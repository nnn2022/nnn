    <strong>Hey Doomers</strong>
    <p><p>All year long I walked around in public without a mask or regard for social distancing, yet my county had very few deaths all year, why is that?</p></p>

        <p>Gonna keep posting this on all your posts...time to troll the troll.</p>
<p>Found the low iq doomer. Let's destroy your world view.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>
<p>https://www.massnurses.org/health-and-safety/articles/infectious-diseases/p/openItem/3201</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a></p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  99.998%</p>
<p>18-49Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  99.95%</p>
<p>50-64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  99.4%</p>
<p>65+Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  91%</p>

<p>This is a political writer at a political event.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>This does not say that social distancing doesn't do anything, but rather than in indoor settings it doesn't do *enough* since COVID can be spread through aerosols as well as droplets, so in an enclosed space with low air flow, given enough time, everybody will be exposed. Because COVID is very communicable.</p>
<p>https://www.massnurses.org/health-and-safety/articles/infectious-diseases/p/openItem/3201</p>
<p>This doesn't say that masks don't work, just that N95s are far, far better than surgical masks. It does say that a single study indicated that surgical masks don't do a lot except block droplets, mentioned in the previous article. Which is not nothing.</p>
<p>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-03-masks-gloves-dont-coronavirus-experts.amp</p>
<p>This doesn't say that masks don't work, but rather quotes professionals who say that they're being misused. Either by encouraging false security and touching the face, or being used unnecessarily.</p>
<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>My browser has a built-in adblocker and won't let me see this one. Let's assume that this one actually does say that masks do nothing to stop the spread. Strike one, ball 4.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-6817</p>
<p>I'll just let this one speak for itself. "The recommendation to wear surgical masks... did not reduce the... infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates"</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</p>
<p>This is about the common cold and was published in 2009. Did you just Google "medical journal mask" and copy-paste all the results?</p>
<p>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-%20review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</p>
<p>Well at least this one is about influenza instead. Again, published in 2010. In fairness, its conclusion states that there is not enough evidence that masks prevent the spread of influenza in natural settings.</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>This one literally starts by saying that there is evidence that non-fit-tested surgical masks reduce influenza spread. It's also published in 2011.</p>
<p>https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567</p>
<p>This one says that surgical masks worked as well as n95s in their analysis, but was cautious to make any further claims.</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</p>
<p>This one says that surgical masks work, but N95s are better</p>
<p>https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/still-no-conclusive-evidence-justifying-mandatory-masks</p>
<p>While this one does stray from pure scientific inference to editorialization and sensationalism, it does offer the most relevant and nuanced argument against mandating masks, similar to the Medical Xpress piece.</p>
<p>https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-</p>
<p>This is a dead link.</p>
<p>Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth.</p>
<p>Read that again, but slowly.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</p>
<p>Some genuine, solid, relevant data. It states what most of us already know which is that as many as 95% of COVID-related deaths involved at least one comorbidity. This makes sense since... 95% of COVID deaths are 80+ years old (see above).</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>This is just a public policy page, not US survival rates. That being said, the rates that you quote are well known. People who aren't grandparent-age have better than a 99% survival rate.</p>
<p>As you might be aware, that means that if everyone in a city gets Coronavirus, as many as 1% of them die. That's a lot of people.</p>
<p>https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/</p>
<p>This is a dead link, but we can assume it reports the same rates we're all aware of already. I guess props for thoroughness, though.</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13554</p>
<p>This reports that the IFR is .15%. Now, I'm not a scientist but I'm pretty sure that IFR includes current unresolved cases as well as all previous, so it's not the same thing as the rate of fatal cases. It's like eating one egg from a carton and saying that all eggs only have a 1/12 IFR of being eaten.</p>
<p>This is a long enough thread so I'm not going to go through the other one as well at this point. But suffice it to say that while there is lots of important and legitimate information here, and some of it does support the idea that just because one country or one government agency recommends doing A, B, and C doesn't mean that it's necessarily the best thing for everyone.</p>
<p>But what this list of articles DOESN'T do is justify you being an ass and acting like "the science" is somehow "on your side" and that "people got played" and so on. In fact, most of this stuff is marginally relevant at best and doesn't compare to the avalanche of data you conveniently *didn't* include.</p>

        <p>Tom Woods is a historian but any idiot that took stats 101 can read the data that mask mandates do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Yes the MTI study literally said...6 ft or 60ft doesn't matter. So thays wrong.</p>
<p>You do realize I said some of those mask studies say they work and some say they don't but what they priced is mask mandates don't. As highlighted in the white paper.</p>
<p>95% of covid deaths were elderly...that means we didn't have to shut down n the economy and lockdown for less than 1% of the population. We literally could have just isolated the elderly and restricted access to nursing homes.</p>
<p>The WHO website said .15 to .23% IFR. I'll have to find it again as the WHO redesigned thier website.</p>
<p>IFR the infected fatality rate...its an inference since not all cases are tested. CFR is confirmed cases only so no very useful because not everyone that has covid get tested. So IFR is an estimate of total infections. We could go raw mortality rate but that just makes the covid cult look even more ridiculous. The global raw mortality rate is 0.00508974358974359%</p>
<p>I'm always an ass. I'm never gonna change that. I don't give a fuck about anyone's feeling. It's all relevant...yiu just got mad because the data doesn't support the covid cult narrative.</p>
