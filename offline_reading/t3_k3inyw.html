    <strong>Inversion</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone else notice that we live in a total clown world where up is down, freedom is slavery, and war is peace? This is exactly what Orwell talked about.</p>
<p>Everything we know to be true, that we see with our own eyes, we're told the opposite. Sometimes they even put the conflicting evidence right there on the screen. Are they taunting us? Is this some gaslighting psyops?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Trump is negotiating peace deals all over the world, is a dictator but Cuomo is being celebrated (and now give an emmy) by the MSM for his role in murdering tens of thousands of seniors. NY is 4th in Covid cases but leads the next state down by double in deaths.</p>
<p>We're told "white supremacy" is a major terror threat, but there hasn't been a high profile white on black hate crime in 5 years that wasn't a hoax. The last one I can think of is Dylan Roof in 2015. Meanwhile, black people are sucker punching elderly white people for sport. They are stalking "Karens" and using this harassment for social media clout. Anti white racism is codified into corporations, media and education, while the phrase "black supremacy" is not even a thing.</p>
<p>You're "selfish" for not wanting to wear a mask or vaccine, even though you're not telling anyone else what to do with their body. It's not selfish of doomers to demand that the freedom of 8 billion people end where their fear begins.</p>
<p>The coverage of the riots were captioned "mostly peaceful" with raging infernos in the background. Meanwhile there has been close to zero violence at anti lockdown protests but we're called "a collection of anti-vaxxers, Nazis, and conspiracy theorists".</p>
<p>We're told Bill Gates and George Soros are "philanthropists" (even their Wikipedia pages say this) instead of agitators obsessed with world domination.</p></p>

<p>I see examples of this all the time. Remember the "Staying apart keeps us together" slogan from Australia. LOL.</p>
<p>And there's a "Freedom Pass" being proposed here in the UK. </p>
<p>Also, great people with integrity who are simply pressing for better science, i.e. RFK Jr, have become <em>dangerous anti-vaxxers, spreading harmful misinformation</em>.</p>
<p>I guess people will see what they want to see.</p>

        <p>I don't get why people see this as a radical conspiracy. All you gotta do is create the New World, kill off dissenters in one big wave, let passive traditionalists dies off, modify + erase inconvenient history, and within a couple of generations you have a semi-permanent authoritarian hellscape.</p>
<p>It's not like it hasn't been at least attempted at every point in human history. Plenty of examples in the present day alone.</p>

<p>Usually, such attempts involve a violent revolution, though. The Russian &amp; French revolution would be the most obvious and most succesful examples.</p>
<p>The approach of using a fake pandemic to crash the economy and then present the solution as a new socio-economic system is one I've never heard before and which AFAIK is unprecedented!</p>

        <p>You're quite right, given the chance governments want to avoid conflict and this kind of talk scares bystanders. But when you have the Canadian military distributing vaccines, suppression polls claiming <em>the majority of Canadians want it to be mandatory</em>, and talk of a digital ID which is obviously a social credit score...  this is obviously state sponsored violence implicit or not. The leaked timelines on covid speak of camps, economic collapse, and civil war scenarios... we have no idea of knowing if this is true but it increasingly looks that way. Considering the united states is heading towards a CW2 scenario, it looks as if Trudeau is trying to secure his staging area</p>

        <p>I’m just so tired of it. I can’t handle it anymore. Silence is violence but violence is peace. I’m not Christian in any way but I do believe we are being led by a dark force maybe lizards or satanist.I’m a conspiracy theorist but like to call myself a truth seeker because everything the government lies about isn’t really a conspiracy but a fact. There are more suicides than Corona deaths. I was depressed during the lockdowns and had thoughts.</p>

        <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation</p>
<p>&rt; HyperNormalisation is a 2016 BBC documentary by British filmmaker Adam Curtis. It argues that governments, financiers, and technological utopians have, since the 1970s, given up on the complex "real world" and built a simpler "fake world" run by corporations and kept stable by politicians.  </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>&rt; The word hypernormalization was coined by Alexei Yurchak, a professor of anthropology who was born in Leningrad and later went to teach in the United States. He introduced the word in his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation (2006), which describes paradoxes of Soviet life during the 1970s and 1980s. He says that everyone in the Soviet Union knew the system was failing, but no one could imagine an alternative to the status quo, and politicians and citizens alike were resigned to maintaining the pretense of a functioning society. Over time, this delusion became a self-fulfilling prophecy and the fakeness was accepted by everyone as real, an effect that Yurchak termed hypernormalisation.</p>

<p>But yes, everything from heterosexual relationships to the definition of art has been inverted to spread chaos and confusion, while being very profitable for the super rich.</p>

        <p>I don’t disagree. White on black hate crime really isn’t a thing and hasn’t been for decades. There have been many elaborate hoaxes because there’s just a scarcity of real crimes and the victim complex would fall apart</p>

        <p>&rt;Does anyone else notice that we live in a total clown world where up is down, freedom is slavery, and war is peace? This is exactly what Orwell talked about.</p>
<p>I noticed that years ago. Since then, it has become progressively worse.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;is all of this being led by a cult of Satanists using inversion as a metaphor for the inverted cross or something?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWw5F3jbOtE">Here's a Microsoft commercial featuring Marina Abramović</a>, which was released back in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbUQF1lliMs">Here's Jared Leto interviewing Abramovic</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/g0s56u/marina_abramovi%C4%87_poses_with_jacob_rothschild_in/">Here's a picture of Marina Abramović &amp; Jacob Rothschild</a> posing in front of the painting "Satan summoning his Legions". AFAIK this is NOT a Photoshop.</p>
<p>Now, consider that Lord Rothschild is considered one of the most powerful - if not the most powerful - people in the world. Consider that Abramovic is connected to the highest echelons in politics and the entertainment industry and a lot of her "art" has very dark themes (like blood &amp; death). As she explains in her interview with Leto, she's kind of obsessed with death.</p>
<p>While I'm not going to argue that the inversion has anything to do with Satanism, I'm ever more drawn to the conclusion that the people "running the world" are at least dabbling in the dark occult, possibly even involving human sacrifice, and that Abramovic is a high priestess in their cult. There's a lot about this woman and the people surrounding her that's deeply, deeply, deeply disturbing!</p>
