        <p>Does it spread the spike proteins? I find myself hoping that one is NOT true and the mainstream is accurate and the Covid vaccinated are NOT shedding spike proteins. This was an issue, I had on the "I don't know" pile. What do you think of this article?</p>

        <p>Unless someone stabs you with a vaccine filled needle you won’t get any spike protein. Stop reading dumb shit.</p>

        <p>Hmm maybe reading dumb shit mainstream articles is a mistake. Why should we believe them? I still have this in the "don't know" category.  Chances are I will be around the vaccinated soon because I have to be around some people but I hope these assholes didn't make these vaccines "spreadable" in any way.</p>

        <p>I don't think spike shedding is very likely but this quote from Pfizer in the "fact check" is just straight up strawmanning.</p>
<p>&rt;"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a synthetic mRNA vaccine and does not contain any virus particles. Because there is no virus produced in the body, no shedding occurs within the human body,” Pfizer spokesperson Jerica Pitts told The Associated Press in an email. “The vaccine cannot be inhaled via shedding and can only enter the human body through an administered dose"</p>
<p>The claim isn't that you shed Sars-Cov-2 or the LNPs, it's that the produced spike protein is shedding. Slimy as fuck.</p>

        <p>Yeah I had the thought, they focused on virus shedding but left any mention of the spike protein shedding. More manipulation and lies. I look at what is not said, they never state the spike protein isn't shedding. :(</p>

        <p>Honestly I was around someone who just got their vaccine like a few hours before, and I started to feel kinda bad? Like sick. I didn't really believe in the spike protein shedding but I do now, I didn't get too sick really but I still felt something. Idk might have been placebo, hard to say.</p>

        <p>I am curious were you maskless around them, did you shake hands or touch them at all. Sorry to hear you got sick. I have delayed meeting with any vaccinated people from this concern. I do see medical personnel but I don't touch them and they are all masked and see the risk as low in stores masked up. I know at a certain point I will have to return in person to some meetings and "having a life" but even intuition seems to be saying, "Stay away now". My husband due to my extreme health is supportive of us waiting. I don't want to treat anyone else like a pariah too, so this one is upsetting to me.</p>

        <p>I don't ever wear a mask so yea I was maskless around them. I didn't touch them, I was just hanging out with them. I borrowed their lighter a few times. I also say in their truck on the way to go find some morels, all maskless. </p>
<p>Idk , I didn't think much of it. I knew that when you give like a dog a parvo shot dogs around it that aren't getting the shot can get a little sick. Yea idk. I didn't really get too sick, I just felt kinda shitty. I also think I had covid at the very very beginning of all of this, like march of 2020. So I probably still have antibodies that help me out or something.</p>
