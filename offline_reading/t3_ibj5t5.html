        <p>That's very true, and neither will travel restrictions or pretty much anything else they're doing. The best that can be hoped for is for it to be slowed down, but since months of preparation time have been squandered anyway the whole exercise was quite pointless.</p>
<p>As for school closures, schools and daycare centers are genuinely very unhygienic and unhealthy environments compared to embedding children in ordinary adult life, but I still find it quite peculiar that schools have been closed to the extent they have. The only truly common precedent is schools closing during the peak of rough flu seasons, but even then the grounds were high levels of absences making it very difficult to keep the whole class on the same page if they stayed open rather than any perceived threat from the disease itself.</p>

        <p>At this point does slowing it down even matter? And really did it ever matter? Sure, there were a handful of places that were pretty bad for a few weeks, but very few hospitals in the world were ever actually overwhelmed. Trying to slow this disease just seems pointless.</p>

        <p>I agree, more and more the longer this goes on. In hindsight steepen the curve would have turned out much better than flatten the curve; even if it caused more deaths and suffering from COVID-19, the faster it worked through the population the faster there would be no more excuse for the fearmongering propaganda, the lockdown policies, and the restrictions, which have caused and will cause much worse death and suffering than COVID-19 ever would have.</p>

        <p>This only applies when the right people are in power. </p>
<p>The new Science^^TM methodology is “ORANGE. MAN. BAD,” and so irrespective of sound medical research or actual facts, we “fact check” by seeing what the Orange Man says about it...and then ~~strongly~~ violently oppose any idea from him.</p>
