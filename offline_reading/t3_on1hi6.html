    <strong>Do you know people who debated on getting the vaccine, but after getting it, now expect the same from everyone else?</strong>
    <p><p>Also they start saying things like ‚Äúanti-vaxxers,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen are you getting yours‚Äù?  </p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen this happen in the people around me, after they get the vaccine they act like they were never against it (or questioning it).</p></p>

        <p>I think I'm one of the few pple thats the opposite. I got vaccinated and am coming to regret it and voicing to other pple to think it through. And suddenly pple look at me like I'm crazy when I raise serious questions. Idk its nice to know here that not everyone in the world has lost their minds and free thought.</p>
<p>Btw I really dont care if someone is vaccinated or not tbh but its all the vaccine virtue signaling or laws being put in place that's just super disturbing to me. And how pple mindlessly go along with it or parrot slogans.</p>

        <p>Yes. I think that once it stops being personal choice and becomes coerced - or worse is being used to segway in outrageous laws and changes to society, we are in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Also, I don't believe in self censoring, but be very careful how out word it when you warn others. You're likely to be labelled anti-v. It's probably obvious, but remind them that you had it done.</p>

        <p>Yeah I specify the argument is the MRNA vaccines that I'm skeptical about. I usually am referring to the fact that it is coercion on use of an "experimental vaccine" is a violation of most vaccine ethical principle, which is very different from being "anti-vax". I remind people I got the vaccine and that it probably would have been a safer bet to go with J&amp;J opposed to the MRNA ones.  When I explain that most sane people do get me. But many just resort to "anti-vax".</p>

        <p>Right. I've had all conventional shots offered to me up to this point. Like polio, MMR, etc., but this one is different. No one respects this.</p>
<p>But yes, it depends on who you're talking to</p>

        <p>Yeah it does depend who your talking to. To many pple it really is cult like üò¨ where I am in Greece its interesting. Most people see through the bs but the gov is covid and lockdown obsessed. In the US it seems opposit, like many pple enjoy the covid paranoia/authoritarianism which to me is kinda bizzare</p>

        <p>Yep. I know people who went from full on anti-vaxxer to pro-vaxxer zealot.</p>
<p>I think it has more to do with guilt. They know they gave in to social pressure - utter pussies - and so now they make themselves feel better by going after people like us.</p>

        <p>Most people I know just got the shot. People that didn‚Äôt want it just didn‚Äôt it get it. </p>
<p>One of my coworkers is one of those gun nut, covid is a hoax guys. He ended up not getting the vax and then got covid. It hit hit him bad and he was in the hospital for over a month. He has asthma but is otherwise fit. Hate to laugh but now that hes better it‚Äôs hard not to.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was pretty worried. My gf has a coworker who‚Äôs friend died and he was only in his early 30s. Seemed healthy as well. Sister worked in the hospital and said some people had a real brutal time with covid. I didn‚Äôt want any part of it being that I had asthma when I was younger.</p>
