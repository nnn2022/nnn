    <strong>Vent about University Mandates With All of This</strong>
    <p><p>Vent time: My grad school has been doing mandatory saliva testing for COVID even for off campus students (which I am) and I was selected a few weeks ago. Was very frustrated because there’s literally no way to say no or they have pretty much said they will kick you out, which isn’t really an option for me when my program has me in over $100,000 in debt already. I complied out of force essentially, was annoyed the whole time and made sure I wasted their time a bit (maybe a little pettily but whatever) by reading all the terms and conditions and what not during it. Tested negative mind you. But now I received an email today telling me that I was selected yet again, which I didn’t even know was a possibility, and apparently for whatever reason may also have to test every single week through the end of semester. I am beyond tired of this and freaked out by the slippery slope that is the government and institutions forcing things like this on us. I’m really genuinely concerned that they may likely end up trying to force us all to get vaccinated when it comes out and even though I’m in the medical field and not an anti-vaxxer by any means, I don’t know that I’m down for that for multiple reasons. Just feeling defeated and trapped at this point in a supposedly “free” country that I love to the very core. Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you. I work for a university and I have no doubt the vaccine will be mandatory even though we all work at home rn. If it truly comes down to it I will work elsewhere. </p>
<p>I wonder how they’re going to make this legal. What happened to bodily autonomy? Where did those particular SJWs go? Haha </p>
<p>Scary times when we’re being coerced in to shit and having it be called consent.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely, it’s so frustrating. I really want to stick to my beliefs and tell them to shove off, but like I said my degree will be actually closer to $200,000 once I’m done and I can’t afford to get booted from the program. First it was a mandatory pledge we had to sign at the beginning of the semester to essentially say we believe COVID is very dangerous and we will behave ourselves in a compliant way, then it was all students in undergrad programs living on campus were to get tested by random selection which I guess whatever they can probably make an argument if the housing is owned by the university, but then it became off-campus dwelling students were added to the random testing, then a few weeks later it was all of us off campus graduate students also, and now it’s testing weekly?? We have to mark a consent box at the bottom of the testing scheduling and it’s such a joke, because we’ve been threatened expulsion if we don’t. One girl in my class got turned in by others in our class for expressing very mildly worded frustrations about the testing on Facebook and had to go to a disciplinary hearing. We got emails afterwards threatening us that if they even see pictures posted of us with other people without masks we will be in trouble. I’m this close to deleting all but a handful of classmates because of it.</p>

        <p>Holy fucking shit that is actually crazyyy!!! Which state are you in?? </p>
<p>I can’t believe the position they’ve put you in. It just doesn’t seem humane. </p>
<p>Can’t say I’m surprised the brainwashing runs deep within universities. The irony is sad</p>

        <p>It really is sad. I’m in Ohio, let’s just say at one of their biggest universities. Was really excited to come out here from rural PA and experience city life for a few years of school before heading home and hopefully to make some friends in my program because everyone touts the college experience of our particular field as so bonding and fun overall. So far I just hate it here and everyone is at each other’s throats, not that we get to see each other in person anyhow at this point with everything being online. And haha, on top of every frickin thing else, we’re trapped paying them that much money with a huge reduction in the actual quality of our education. Some programs involve a lot of training of physical skill on top of the mental education and it is just not possible online.</p>
