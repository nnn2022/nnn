        <p>Indeed. 
In my country at least, when newspapers had to report heart inflammation after the vaccine they dismiss it with "he/she fully recovered" but they omit that an inflamed heart is a weaker heart for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>This is criminal</p>
<p>This guy in the comment.. probably he's in the denial phase: it's too painful for him to admit he ruined himself with his own hands so he finds a justification.
I'm actually sorry for him and for those who developed side effects.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it's still an unknown variable due to inaccurate testing and misdiagnosing, but what we do know, for a "deadly disease" this is the best disease we could have hoped for in terms of survivability. Most people don't, and won't even know they ever had it.</p>

        <p>Some things that can cause heart inflammation include:
Borrelia (the cause of Lyme disease), 
Chlamydia, 
Coxsackie B viruses, 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
Epstein-Barr virus, 
Excess alcohol consumption, 
fungal and parasitic infections, 
Hepatitis C, 
Herpes, 
HIV, 
Influenza, 
Parvovirus, 
Mycoplasma (bacteria that cause a lung infection), 
Streptococcal (strep) bacteria, 
Staphylococcal (staph) bacteria - MRSA, and
Treponema (the cause of syphilis). 
Other causes include certain chemicals or allergic reactions to medications or toxins like:
Drugs (cocaine and amphetamines, and prescription drugs such as blood thinners), 
Lead, 
spider bites, 
wasp stings, and 
snake bites.
An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation throughout your body, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, may also lead to myocarditis. </p>
<p>People were inducing disease in themselves and getting checked out more than normal if they thought they had covid. If it is pericarditis, it goes away within 3 months if it's not going to kill you. A bad cold can cause mild cases of pericarditis as well. It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29728118/">occasionally</a> happens as a result of the flu shot, too. Trans fat consumptions can cause <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16713393/">inflammation</a>
of the pericardium and endocardium (epithelial heart tissue). Ischemic heart disease can be caused by excess processed red meat consumption, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol. Many of which rose during this 15months. 
Medicines can cause side effects that may lead to myocarditis, pericarditis, or both, as well.
Some causes of endocarditis include : Antibiotics, such as penicillin, 
antidepressants (such as tricyclic antidepressants), 
Benzodiazepines, such as Xanax (commonly gotten on the street), 
diuretics, 
heart medicines, 
psychiatric medicines (such as clozapine and lithium), 
vaccines, and
weight-loss medicines, (such as phentermine-fenfluramine or phen-fe). 
Show me evidence of very frequent (more frequent than normal according to the history for 2010-2020 as well) cases of heart inflammation among "unvaccinated" people with no prior heart conditions, new or old bad habits, or previous infections that may have damaged their heart, happening right now as a direct result of a "symptomatic covid19 infection". Further, show, if there are any, that the small number of cases of heart inflammation in "unvaccinated" people that eat well, exercise well, hadn't had pneumonia or a bad flu or cold within the last few years, and consume no recreational drugs (or pharmaceutical ones that cause heart inflammation) is more than the number of cases in "vaccinated" individuals that were previously healthy with good habits and no existing conditions or infections.</p>

<p>lol... "anxiety" is often a catch-all that shitty doctors use to explain anything they can't find out of a basic blood test or x-ray. It wouldn't surprise me if a good portion of people who ever wound up having any disease or condition involving chest pain/cardiac symptoms were diagnosed with anxiety first because they wound up with some lazy dipshit doctor.</p>
<p>Anxiety diagnosis =&rt; SSRI prescription. Gold mine for big pharma and doctors. Kinda ironic that people in this sub are pushing this rhetoric.</p>
<p>Do a lot of people have anxiety and think they have long covid? Absolutely. That doesn't mean long covid doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I love this sub but you guys need to stop with this nonsense. The vaccines are dangerous precisely because covid is potentially dangerous. The vaccine uses a replica of spike protein FFS. Denying one to be harmful long-term while claiming the other is just makes no sense at all. That spike protein is poison, it was engineered to be poison. Luckily most people have an immune system that can handle it, but for some the effect of the spike proteins can linger for months or even longer.</p>
<p>None of what I just said means the vaccine is necessary, or lockdowns and mandates are necessary. You don't need to deny someones experience to be right about all this. We have many allies who have long covid, I can guarantee you that.</p>

        <p>it's not just a respiratory virus, it's cardiovascular. Hence the blood clots and heart inflammation which you can also get from COVID, but you wouldn't know anything about that because you're on the left side of the curve as far as vaccine skeptics go, sorry to tell you.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, that bell curve explains a lot of the stupidity I see on the regular in this sub. Evidently i'm wasting my time.</p>

<p>Also COVID is more than the flu, it's more contagious, can cause blood clots, MIS, and Long COVID symptoms, and even if it has a cure people can still die before they're distributed making it dangerous.</p>

        <p>Firstly, they do recover from mild cases of heart inflammation.</p>
<p>Secondly, very few young people would be immune to the virus but even then they can still carry it and are likely to spread it considering how much less hygienic they are. The chances of long term side effects to young people are very low if anything compared to the chance of death for older people.</p>

        <p>All the sites I've read (mayo clinic, NHLBI) have stated that, unless severe, there is no permanent impacts. I haven't found any sites stating that mild inflammation will weaken a heart enough to be noticed.</p>
<p>It's also worth stating that COVID can also cause long-term damage to the heart and considering you're much more likely to get COVID than be hurt by the vaccine I'd say it's worth it.</p>

        <p>Do you even know WHY they got heart inflammation to begin with?  </p>
<p>Because the reason being is that the vaccine initiates creation of SPIKE PROTEINS which attaches to any and all organs causing an immune response...  </p>
<p>Your own IMMUNE system attacks the cells that the spike protein is attached to..  </p>
<p>So if your heart has spike proteins your heart gets attacked there is NO RECOVERING FROM THAT....</p>

        <p>It's doubtful spike proteins caused this man's issues because injections usually dissipate soon after and aren't likely to reach the heart in pure form as they occur in the arm.</p>
<p>Spike proteins exist on the outside of the Coronavirus cell and are how it attaches to the body, the ones in the vaccine allowing to body to recognize it as with all vaccinations. Your immune system is supposed to attack it.</p>
<p>There is very much recovering because the doses seen in vaccine's are minimal, it'd be a lot harder to recover from COVID's spike protein's though.</p>

        <p>and you can try to explain it away all you want but i have always been very aware and pay close attention to my body (hence why im not putting some experimental drug in it) so i know for a fact covid does some long term shit to ya, my taste being altered was probably the worst because i couldn't stand the taste or smell of meat for almost a year and it really fucked up my diet and that was extremely depressing</p>

<p>Why?  He said because he would rather be raptured with all the people who were considerate and responsible enough to get vaxxed than remain on earth with all the evil selfish “covid deniers”.</p>
<p>Yes, he actually said “raptured.”</p>
<p>My boyfriend and I now refer to the vaxx pushers as “the raptured”</p>

        <p>They’ll say it’s not just about death rates, we also have to consider “long covid”.</p>
<p>When you ask them for actual clinical data on long covid that can’t be explained psychosomatically they’ll say we don’t have the data yet because it’s a “novel virus”, so we still have to take precautions as if it’s a real thing, in order to not risk the potential of long term effects.</p>
<p>Yet when you bring up myocarditis as a side effect of vaccines, they’ll tell you it’s fine the heart inflammation is just temporary and you’ll fully recover with no long term effects.  You should still vaccinate because it’s totally safe, they promise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile over in the coronavirus sub, they’re admitting to having faked their info in order to obtain third shots, and giving each other advice on how to do it.  No safety studies at all for third shots, but they’re confident it’s totally safe.  Just like they will confidently tell you to take vaccine because it’s safe.</p>
<p>We’re dealing with a mind virus here.  Unfortunately it’s endemic.</p>

        <p>That sub has begun to just absolutely sicken me. Any time a player opines that perhaps the jab is not for them, they get called a selfish asshole and much worse. I thought this was football, the most rugged, masculine sport out there—and these uberpansies are all raving about “get your shot, the science is settled, people who don’t are assholes,” etc. I was iffy about watching the NFL this year anyways with all their woke bullshit. The Covid mania has pretty much sealed the deal. My favorite sport is now ruined.</p>

        <p>That's because they're utilitarian. The collective is more important than the individual, to the point where some people have abandoned their own individuality to appease the collective. It never mattered to them what's best for each person, what's morally correct for them is to enforce what is the best for the collective. FOR THE GREATER GOOD.</p>

        <p>This isn’t even true, because long term natural immunity built up from a virus that has a 99.97% survival rate is the far more utilitarian thing to do, rather than being super illogical, creating untested and dangerous ‘vaccines,’ absurd and pointless masks and lockdown measures, forcing small businesses to close, etc.</p>

        <p>That's one of the issues I usually have with utilitarianism. Even if you were a benevolent utilitarian, it doesn't mean you can accurately predict the maximum outcome of happiness in a large scale. What distinguishes utilitarianism from the rest is that you favor the collective over the individual, which in my opinion is immoral. Doesn't matter if the result of the decision results in less happiness due to unintended consequences, if you were trying to maximize happiness over the individual, then your actions are motivated by utilitarianism. The worst is when malevolent utilitarians coerce people into thinking they'll be happy by encouraging people to go into a happy box, like drugs, brainwashing, or promoting ignorance. To them as long as the collective thinks they are happy, they have done their job.</p>

        <p>The 2.wave hit us pretty hard thanks to physicians who didn't cure patients and gave recomendations like "drink water and rest in bed" . Many people help themselves in spring and bought ivm. It helped to many people I know. We still have to wear masks everywhere in interior. The pressure to get a vaccine and vax propaganda is everywhere. People are already divided in two groups, vaccinated(40%)and grandma killers (60%). 
We are not an attractive country for immigrants I think. And I heard that we are racist but I think that we are just conservative and elderly people are affraid of anything new. There are some  common cultural traits with hungarian, czech, polish and ukrainian culture. We are the same european  region.</p>

        <p>Where do you live? I live in rural Missouri, The ozarks. No one out here had it all until like three weeks ago then my family and several others in our little town caught it. But no one has died. None. No one even has had problems. It just feels like a hardcore cold. 
I guess what I’m saying is it’s cool that we went this long without it. I work at the corner store in my town and that’s what I feel like did me in. I see fifty people a day sometimes.</p>

        <p>Without giving too much info, my newly married niece got pregnant shortly after getting vaxxed. The baby had heart issues and died in the womb at 4.5 months. One of the few times I hope Im wrong about this. I told her a week before her appt about the “what ifs” and being sterile was one of them.</p>

        <p>Someone needs to tell her the vaccine likely caused this, especially if she is quite young.</p>
<p>Imagine adults getting heart problems… now imagine a little fetus heart having to deal with that. The full dose makes its wag through the mother’s body, as well as the baby’s body, and BAM, not good for fetus heart.</p>
<p>This is also the issue with giving small kids, and kids in general, the same vaccine dose.</p>

        <p>The danger is that this could repeat itself. Truth can be a bitter pill to swallow but it's better than another disaster like this. Anyway, it probably doesn't need to come from you cause i'm sure they themselves would have come across reports of miscarriages post vaccine somewhere online. And then put 2 and 2 together.</p>

<p>I've been exposed to covid so many times that the vaccine would probably kill me since I'm already immune. </p>
<p>That's one thing I've noticed is the people close to me who got covid last year and got the vaccine this year, got the side effects more hard-core. Maybe not connected, but it's enough people to scare me.</p>

        <p>So sad all these  stories! Scarier when you see it right in front of you . I’m so sorry. We have a lot of genetic heart issues in my family so I’m staying far away from this shot. But  lots of people say that covid  can also cause heart issues tooI’ll take my chances since like you have been exposed too and probably had it. Hoping that they  don’t mandate this for everyone. We know our bodies and we should have to choice what to do with them.</p>

        <p>The problem is how the media has portrayed COVID. The media has made it out to be that if you get covid you’re going to end up in the hospital/dead which is obviously so not the case. Myself and a few friends all had covid at some point, all with very minor symptoms, it’s not a big deal for the majority of people.</p>

        <p>Some of you may be mistaken on the comparison of statistical risk here.  The risk of getting myocarditis is actually greater if you are not vaccinated, because even though not everyone gets covid, enough people do get it that the incidence of myocarditis is larger than the incidence among vaccinated people, because it is such a rare side effect of the vaccine, but a more common side effect of covid.  I got myocarditis from covid and it took months to resolve.  You're more likely to get hit by lighting than get heart inflammation by vaccination.  And the idea that covid is 14 days max is simply not true.</p>

        <p>Myocarditis or Pericarditis (heart inflammation) so far have shown themself to be benign. At worst for every million does there are 25 incidents of heart inflammation. In the same range as my specific mortality rate for covid. I would take the Pfizer vaccine, stupid not to.</p>

<p>I agree, the age of publication matters. I try and search for something more recent, but there is no guarantee any more papers of the same quality has been produced. A month is a very short time in academia.</p>

        <p>From my source;</p>
<p>"Ninety percent of the cases in Israel appear to be men. Although the background rate of myocarditis in this population is high, the rate following vaccination appeared to be 5–25 times higher than the background rate." </p>
<p>The sources I used was published after and included the Isreail finding. The new article does not conclude the Vaccines cause chest pain. It is discussing some initial findings.</p>
<p>From your news article; </p>
<p>"That translates to about one in 50,000 vaccine recipients, a number that isn’t concerning given the background rate of myocarditis in the general population, where it is typically triggered by viral or bacterial infections, including COVID-19."</p>
