    <strong>Hear me out</strong>
    <p><p>The government enforced restrictions suck, and often don't work. Cerfews actually cause crowding during daylight hours, reduced capacity in businesses kills jobs. People still congregate for whatever they can, as you can see from BLM protests and Biden-supporting crowds dancing in the street together. None of that makes sense. </p>
<p>The government shouldn't be in charge of our response to this. They've proven they suck at it.</p>
<p>But COVID is real and it sucks. My brother and mother got it and were fine. My uncle got it and nearly died. He's young, strong, a blackbelt in BJJ. The guy almost died from this. It's new and we still don't fully understand it. </p>
<p>That said, should you cancel your holiday over it? Fuck no. People were allowed to riot and protest, so you should be allowed to peacefully assemble in your home with family. Fuck their 10 person limit.</p>
<p>No one forces people to remove their masks. No one forces people to go outside or into public places if they're scared. Why should our lives all end because of those that are scared?</p></p>

        <p>There have been some conspiracy nuts on here lately, but I think the vast majority of us are on the same page. </p>
<p>COVID is real, and it can cause major problems. Your uncle’s chance of having those problems was super tiny and he got them anyway. Could it be me next? Yes. Is that infinitesimal chance worth losing my sanity, my relationships, my job, and everything that makes my life worth living? No.</p>
<p>But that’s a decision that I, and only I, get to make. This is what serious people believe.</p>

        <p>He was the only one trying to prepare for it in January.  He sent over a thousand vents to New York, sent a medical ship from the Navy, and ordered the construction of an emergency medical shelter with over a thousand medical beds all in New York.  He also sent a Navy medical ship to California.  All of his opponents did was call him paranoid and flat out refuse to use any of the help that came from him. </p>
<p>Then they went on the news and told everyone that the virus was no threat and that everyone should go to the movies, come to China Town, hug, and ride subways.  </p>
<p>And to top it off, many Democratic state governors signed executive orders to state-funded nursing homes ordering them to keep all sick patients.  They were not allowed to send them to the hospitals.  New York, Michigan, New Jersey, and other blue states did this.  This caused thousands of deaths.  President Trump would have never done something like that.</p>
