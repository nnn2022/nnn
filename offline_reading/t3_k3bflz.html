        <p>His/her point is enforcement of unpopular laws can only go so far in the US until police legitimately will have to start to worry if they’re gonna be shot. Even without actually using the guns, the threat alone helps preserve our liberty. We’ve seen this in certain states already where sheriffs/local police have refused to enforce certain rules (like limits on thanksgiving gatherings), partly and overtly because they’d be hard to enforce practically regardless of guns -but at least partly too because they know it could present a safety issue for the officers. </p>
<p>That’s not an issue for them in the UK. Y’all barely have any knives left with pointy ends from my understanding.</p>

        <p>Be that as it may, i had gatherings and i attended gatherings pretty much the whole year. I stood next to police officers in public transport with no mask and they didn’t even looked at me. Now i think that these things gives us the feeling that they can’t do shit about it whilst they go ahead with the real agenda and when that comes to fruition no amount of guns will be able to do anything. I hope i’m wrong though.</p>

        <p>That’s great, I’m not saying the UK needs a revolution yet or will ever need one. Idk what’s going on there, certainly less than you.</p>
<p>I’m just saying we have the ability to do so here in the states and we also may never need to use that ability because the threat alone deters authoritarianism to some degree.</p>

<p>Uh, that's a fantasy if I've ever seen one. US is basically a developing country with insane military budget. People dying left and right from easily preventable causes, propaganda and brainwashing becoming its own industry, education locked behind a paywall unlike which no other country has seen...</p>

        <p>For context, I live in one of the dozens of countries that listened to experts on corona. As a result, we're more or less continuing life as usual, with widespread use of work-from-home type setups being the only notable difference. And, we have a fraction of covid deaths compared to US. I think at the moment it's about 1 in 20 for same population.</p>
<p>One of the key differences being for example, people just started using masks after evidence came out that they are helpful. No protests, no one complaining about how medical problems prevent mask use, just, people use masks in public and people die drastically less</p>

        <p>I mean, do you object to drunk driving being illegal? Why is one way of killing others okay to you but not the other?</p>
<p>Or do you just accept both ways of risking others and possibly killing them? What then is the point where you draw the line, I think straight up murder is okay to be restricted by law. How much harm to others can you cause before it should be illegal?</p>

        <p>&rt; I mean, do you object to drunk driving being illegal? </p>
<p>I’m likely going to give you a different, more radical response than anyone else. But yes, in theory I do object to DUI’s where no accident has occurred though in practicality I’m not against the laws. </p>
<p>Regardless, and more relevantly  it’s about how direct the consequences of your actions are. If you drive drunk and hit someone, your actions directly affected and endangered that person, there’s no wiggle room or argument there. If I get covid and don’t wear a mask then what happens? I <em>maybe</em> infect someone else, then that person <em>maybe</em> infects another person, maybe 20 infections down the road it hits a 75 year old with cancer and they die. That’s supposed to be all tied back to me? Nah, sorry that’s just life and death. </p>
<p>If a covid positive person knowingly walks into nursing home with no mask? Sure, that may be negligent. Otherwise it’s mostly up to each individual to asses their risk and those around them and act accordingly.</p>

        <p>&rt; If a covid positive person knowingly walks into nursing home with no mask? Sure, that may be negligent.</p>
<p>So what's the standard? How directly you have to cause deaths by infectious disease before facing any legal problems? Does the number of deaths matter, like, if you get 1000 people infected by going to a gatherin, and 20 die, is that less bad than just smearing your spit onto someones face who dies?</p>
<p>You say walking in to a nursing home and presumably getting dozens or hundreds of people killed "may" be an issue. What decides that?</p>

        <p>&rt;So what's the standard? </p>
<p>Good point. So let’s compare. The flu is not as deadly as Covid, so don’t paint me as one of those saying it’s just the flu, but it is deadly. The flu kills 60k people a year in the US. All of those 60k contracted it from someone else. After the covid vaccine, do we need lockdowns and mask orders for the flu? How deadly does a virus have to be to lose civil liberties? Who gets to decide that level of deadliness that triggers us losing rights? Odds are eventually there will be a virus less deadly than covid but more deadly than the flu, do we shutdown over that?</p>
<p>&rt;What decides that?</p>
<p>IMO this is solved mostly on the civil side through civil lawsuits. Rarely would this be a criminal manner except for where intentional infection was proven.</p>

<p>Not very. If you can save hundreds of thousands or millions of lives by mandating wearing a mask, a thing you can do with almost zero effort, etc similar low effort tricks, this is a no brainer. I guess it's kinda a balance of loss of liberties and loss of life. Your freedom to not wear a cloth in front of your face seems very non-essential when it has to be paid for by human lives. Some actually important freedoms like right for political participation(which US has just about entirely removed from the people) on the other hand I'd be ready to defend even if it had a significant cost to it.</p>
<p>It's a spectrum, basically.</p>
<p>&rt; IMO this is solved mostly on the civil side through civil lawsuits. Rarely would this be a criminal manner except for where intentional infection was proven.</p>
<p>Which in case you catch a severe disease and die, never gets prosecuted as civil cases need you to be alive to pursue your case.</p>

<p>I’d mostly agree if we were just talking wearing a mask. It’s not the end of the world and the effects are mostly categorized as annoyances.</p>
<p>Lockdowns, forced closures of businesses, limits/ restrictions on businesses, etc are a totally different story though. Stopping protests/free speech is even worse and should be a line in the sand for Americans.</p>

And yes, we do. It's specifically in place to prevent against things like this. However, most firearms owners are too caught up in the cult of trumpersonality to actually exercise the second amendment without bias. I could be wrong and I hope so.</p>

        <p>Yeah. We need to hold our politicians accountable for moving the goalposts. Hospital capacity was never a major concern after May, yet we have security theatre and arbitrary capacity restrictions. The idea of essential businesses basically aligns with secular conveniences.

        <p>Not if you listened to experts.  "Flattening the curve" was just supposed to keep the healthcare industry from getting overloaded.  We were then supposed to continue being safe until we brought down number of infections to the point where it was no longer a pandemic, and the virus could be contained.</p>
<p>However, people misunderstood the message (in some cases, because politicians misunderstood and miscommunicated the message), and they believed that "flattening the curve" was the goal.</p>
