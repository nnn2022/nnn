        <p>She's 82, and sound mind based on what you have said. She is free to make her own choice. I don't believe in coercing people either way, to get it, or to not get it. </p>
<p>That being said, her doctor is full of shit telling her that she won't end up on a ventilator if she gets covid after getting the vaccine. He can say she likely won't, but too many people are saying facts that just don't have enough data to back up. Doctors don't know everything 100%.  Unfortunately people of her age still believe doctors are human versions of god so unless you can find another doctor to tell her otherwise, which you won't because they would be sanctioned in some way, she isn't going to listen.</p>
<p>Just tell her you are worried and make sure she has a will written up just in case she is one of the unlucky ones to have a severe adverse event.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I donâ€™t think any info we send you will be effective in convincing her not to take a second dose</p>

        <p>My dad 85 is exactly as you describe your relative.  He was bullied by his dentist(of all damned things) into getting the J&amp;J, told of the dangers of covid and how selfish it was to when HC providers were in close contact with him. Thank God I'm 1800 miles away. Once those bricks are laid, there's no stopping someone that age from going down that path. HC providers are well trained in pushing buttons that societal pressure installed over the decades.</p>
