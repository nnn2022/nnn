    <p><p>How do you even justify something like that? Anything rational is basically ruled out.</p></p>

        <p>Had this same experience recently. A friend and I went into separate rooms to try stuff on and she yelled over to me that she didn't understand how the flimsy piece of plastic up at grocery stores will supposedly protect everyone, but the solid pieces of wood separating the fitting rooms at Ross aren't enough. I yelled back at her to stop questioning the science. We had a good laugh, and probably offended someone since the fitting rooms were full of people lol.</p>

        <p>In my break room, we’ve had these ugly little fake plants on the 4 tables. During covid they were moved to a cupboard. I asked the admin why and she said for covid. And I asked her to explain. She’s like we don’t want more germs. </p>
<p>??? It’s been a year since and guess what? They are still in the cupboard.</p>

        <p>That is silly. Maybe they think that the change rooms were less than 6 feet apart or something? Maybe next time you could bring a ruler and measure.</p>
