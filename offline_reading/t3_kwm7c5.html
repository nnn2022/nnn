<p>This is what the Pfizer covid19 vaccine has done to my Mom. Everyone please pray for her. She was admitted to the hospital. And be cautious about taking the vaccine. I'm sure it is good for some people but you need to think about is this vaccine worth taking? It's not for me. Please share this post we need help finding answers</p>
<p>Update 1-12-21</p>
<p>Mom Is getting even worse today and still don't have any answers from doctors as to how to fix this. Please pray for her I can't stand to see my mom this way it makes me want to cry knowing I can't do anything to help her. Please don't take the covid19 vaccine. I'm adding a 3rd video that she just sent me.</p>

        <p>My son had full body spasms after his routine a child hood vaccines. It looked different -more like he was being electrocuted every few minutes. But he was an infant.</p>
<p>We could get no help from doctors and we were told repeatedly it wasn’t vaccine related.</p>
<p>We stopped after the 4th month round of vaccines which resulted immediately in an ambulance ride and 2 night stay at the hospital and yet no one ever followed up on it. No one asked for a vaccine batch number or to report the reaction to any monitoring body. Everyone just turned a blind eye. </p>
<p>No one is tracking. No one is taking reactions seriously. They don’t want to.</p>
<p>That made us stop. How can you know the truth if you don’t keep track.</p>
<p>Never again.  And we were vaccine believers.</p>

        <p>Funny how the rise prevalence of vaccines coincides with the prevalence of SIDS and also the prevalence of clean running water availability, but nobody makes any connections.</p>
<p>I guess science is like the courts; if the court refuses to hear your case, you lose. And if the scientists refuse to investigate correlations, they're definitely just a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Plumbers and civil engineers are the real doctors.  Don't question autism and it's parallel trend with vaccines either you tin foil hat nut!  There is no correlation, now stop asking so many questions.  </p>
<p>How come the gates foundation hasn't been able to completely eliminate every disease and virus?  You think they aren't vaccinating huge numbers of people in these 3rd world countries?  They are.  What's the problem then?  Well look at the lack of basic sanitation in the villages that they go in to.</p>

        <p>Google this kid: Immunoexcitotoxicity as the central mechanism of etiopathology and treatment of autism spectrum disorders: A possible role of fluoride and aluminum</p>
<p>This is from India, ever checked the rates of autism between western and eastern societies?</p>
<p>Edit: incase u don't read it: aluminofluoride compounds are WAY more neurodegenerative than either alone. Fluoridated water sources in formula + introduction of aluminum adjuvant vaccine and boom, suddenly you have these compounds being formed leading to extremely toxic effects that are extremely neurodegerative.</p>

        <p>That's an interesting point, but most vaccines aren't for things that are spread by water, are they? The only one I can think of off hand is cholera.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the general rise in sanitation has cut down disease rates. It's intriguing to think that some of the credit given to vaccines could really belong to that. Too bad it's not something anyone will ever seriously study, 'cause that's not politically correct science.</p>

        <p>When they do clinical trials, they dont give the vaccine to everebody, they give it do some portion of the population. This population live among everybody else, they check if they are infected or not by testing, another approach would be to see if the people who get the vaccine are statistically less likely to get the disease. The other variables like sanitations is the same for the placebo as well as the people who got the vaccine. This is how they know how effective the vaccine is, and its why he says is not true.</p>

        <p>My toddler had a severe reaction to the rotavirus vaccine. Fever hit over 104 and he was screaming bloody murder. Got him to the hospital and 4 different doctors checked him out. All 4 said it was the vaccine. Got him to a pediatric immunologist a few weeks later and he told us to knock it off for at least a year on vaccines.</p>
<p>But the doc who administered the shot? He was happy and told us "Imagine how bad it would have been if he had actually gotten rotavirus!" We don't see that pediatrician any longer.</p>

        <p><em>We stopped after the 4th month round of vaccines which resulted immediately in an ambulance ride and 2 night stay at the hospital and yet no one ever followed up on it. No one asked for a vaccine batch number or to report the reaction to any monitoring body. Everyone just turned a blind eye.</em></p>
<p>Same here. I got a severe reaction the the swine flu vaccine and the ER doctor never asked for a lot number or where I got it or anything. Failure to report vaccine reactions is illegal but they NEVER report them. I was unable to report it myself due to not having answers to all the mandatory questions for VAERs. Its just sickening.</p>

        <p>I suspect that's common across all medical products. I used to work for a large pharma company and they had a training module on our obligations to report adverse events. So if I'm at my kid's soccer game and overhear someone complaining about the shampoo made by my company, I technically have to report that. </p>
<p>Just for fun, I looked at the actual paperwork one day and it was 20+ pages of dense legalese. If you asked, they'd likely say "we just want to be thorough!" But it's bullshit. The real intent is to throw paperwork at you until you give up.and decide it's easier to just not report it.</p>

        <p>Throwing paperwork and other difficulties at us is exactly what they do. Even if you make it to that holy grail of vaccine court and win, the payout is around 250,000 which hardly covers your medical bills or legal fees for cases that they drag out for years.</p>

        <p>Every time we get a new child patient with cancer, I wonder if the vaccines had anything to do with it. I also believe over vaccinating is harming our pets. </p>
<p>My cousin had such a bad vax reaction in the 80s that it left her epileptic and brain damaged. She lived a horrible, short life. She's the reason I got vax exemptions every time I moved states. I finally slowly got him vaccinated when we moved to a nanny state that made exemptions very difficult, but he was older and I was more comfortable with it.</p>

        <p>For him to attend school. TX and FL give out easy exemptions for philosophical reasons (my body, my choice). NY doesn't have a philosophical exemption and you have to prove a religious exemption. I didn't have the energy to even try, but by kindergarten he needed far fewer vaccines. </p>
<p>The BeSt part was finding him a pediatrician to administer the vaccines. I called several who refused because they "don't accept unvaccinated children as patients". So they wouldn't give him vaccines because he didn't have any vaccines 🤦🏻‍♀️ I had to google around to find one. Found one through a forum.</p>

        <p>Went to check on my first child one night in his crib and saw him having what I can only describe as a seizure. I panicked ran to get my wife and when we came back into the room he was sleeping peacefully. I thought I was losing my mind. Then a daycare worker saw him have one six months later. Same thing. She saw it called another worker and looked back down and he was fine. We go to the doctor and nothing is wrong. Then my dad sees him have one. We start looking for things each event coincided with. They all happened after a vaccine booster shot. Years later he was getting a check up and the doctor asked us about general health issues and whatnot and we mentioned the seizures and the proximity to vaccines. He just kinda nodded and said that’s normal. WHAT?! Normal? Nobody told us seizures were a normal vaccine side effect. Anyway, so later in life he was diagnosed with high functioning autism. My other three children had been vaccinated before the doctor’s revelations and my son’s diagnosis. None of them had seizures and none of them have autism. I’m not a conspiracy guy but I’ll go to my grave thinking vaccines increase a child’s risk of developing autism.</p>

        <p>Did your wife believe you when you told her what you saw? Cause having my spouse doubt me over that would make me soo sad. Or like you said, I'd wonder I was losing it. </p>

<hr>
<p>The stories that make me the saddest are when one parent believes the baby is being affected by the vaccines, but the other parent just doesn't see it. Maybe they haven't been around the child as much (usually the dad).</p>
<p>Or maybe they do see the negative effects-- but their heart/mind won't let them admit it is a real possibility.</p>

        <p>It was dark and we stood there for a long time just watching him sleep. We were new parents and we both agreed that I saw something but maybe misinterpreted what I saw. As far as the thought that vaccines were causing it and one believing the other. That was never an issue. It wasn’t until after our last child was born that we started putting things together. We are lucky. Our son is very high functioning and attends college and got a full scholarship.</p>

        <p>I’ll add this too. We had issues with the school system early on because no matter how high functioning there are some behavioral issues as well as academic needs. My wife sings my praises on this because when we were not making progress. Let me back up. We went from a private school to a public when we moved to a new city. He was a few grades in and the private school had worked with us. Anyway, in his second year of public school he was struggling in a few classes and his frustration was overwhelming him. The school admins were stonewalling and refuting everything we were saying. So I called our states education department, something my wife had not thought to do. I laid it all out. I was informed that our district had student advocates at given the name of ours. Next call I dropped the persons name and you could hear the change in their tone. At the next meeting I got to sit there grinning ear to ear as the student advocate, from their district, told them word for word what my wife and I had been saying for months. All of a sudden the teacher and principal were on board with our recommendations. Surprise surprise! Anyway, after that year we had two more times in nine years that we had to call the advocate back in to help. My other three children have gone through the same school system with no issues, of course none of them have autism.</p>

        <p>I’m guessing some version of Guillain-Barre which is a known rare neurological autoimmune disease that is triggered by an overdriven immune response— either by a virus or even a vaccine. It’s most commonly triggered by a run of the mill GI virus. Unfortunately, we don’t know how to prevent it or exactly how it’s triggered, but the incidence related to vaccines is lower than incidence from post-viral cases.</p>

        <p>It's called epilepsy. I have it and i think about that option almost every day honestly. To keep the seizures under control I have to take more pills than there are days in the week and thats just my morning dose. And I'd rather not get into all the side effects i have to live with every day.</p>

        <p>Sadly we will be seeing a lot more of this medical assault on people by Pig Pharma and the evil doctors that push these poisons. There will come a time when the "weight of evidence" will be too large for even the sheep to ignore. However, many more people like this poor duped woman will be permanently maimed by evil "medicine". So called "medicine" has thoroughly disgraced itself and I hope that trust in it is never rebuilt. I am calling to defund the doctors! That video is thoroughly sickening to watch, and the fact that nobody will ever go to jail for this is even more disgusting.</p>

        <p>0 people have died to the vaccine, many people has died to covid. For covid, people are having long term effects there as well, far more people. Some people have gotten bells palsy which they have recovered from. I might sound crass, but it sounds like covid is just acceptable risk, but taking the vaccine where we actually got some control and got far better statistics on is russian roulette?, it doesnt sound very logical to me.</p>

        <p>Its not about spoonfeeding me, just have any argument with substance. You posted a link of a far-right conspiratist saying that sars-cov2 does not exist. Even accepting that everything she presented is true and in good faith(that she didnt try to mislead us by leaving out context). There are MANY sources out there who has isolated the virus, maybe the DHSC never actually isolated the virus, so what? We share knowledge all over the world anyways between our countries and medical institutes, we do that so we can build on each others knowledge, and not reinvent the wheel for each country:</p>

<p>Im not sure how many have actually isolated the virus, I bet its not something that can be done in a kitchen therefore I accept that not every single country or lab has done it.</p>
<p>Vaccines is a risk cost benefit, as they do pose a risk, if the risk of the vaccine is less than the actual disease then its recommended to take the vaccine. But then again its pointless to even discuss that with you since you dont even believe that the virus actually exists.</p>

<p>you are just desperate to defend your worldview, you can dismiss the one thing i supplied as "far-right conspiratist" like you have been trained to do then present me with government garbage and a website that does everything possible to protect the mainstream narrative and i can just as easily dismiss them as part of the regime.</p>
<p>look believe what you like, your life is going to be fucked up from this just as much as everyone else, so enjoy the mask, enjoy having your movement restricted in your own country like you are under military occupation, enjoy your vaccine passport, enjoy the destruction of private property rights, enjoy having to check in to every shop and be track and traced by your government the rest of your life over a "virus".</p>

        <p>Listen now Im not gonna look into everything you mentioned cause you arent even responding to what im saying, so im not gonna pay that respect. You believe the government is lying to you to control you, well yes they do lie, but that doesnt mean they lie about everything. Also the fact that we live in a society with rules and laws there are restrictions on us, we cannot do whatever we want to even before the corona. There is a line that we draw where we got our individual liberties and when we get restricted for the collective good. That line is arbritrary drawn based on what power we want the government to have, it has to have some right? otherwise what is the point of a government if we can do whatever we want to anyways. The thing is most people do actually agree with the restrictions set the government, as long as its a temporary thing. Its pointless to argue the "what if it never stops", the slipperyslope argument I think its pretty thin here. Now I actually think that there should be some regulation on vaccine since people seem to want to go back to the stoneage and have half our kids die before they get to 15 years.</p>

        <p>The problem is besides that, its that he cannot communicate like a normal person. I spend a good 10 - 15 min looking up sources to a rebuttal to what he said. And he responds as if that never even happened, like I didn't even say anything, its like a teenager responding: "Whatever dude, vaccines are dumb and if you want to take them THEN DO YOU THAT AND LET THE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER THE WORLD!". Thats why I'm not gonna bother having a normal conversation or waste my time on taking anything he says seriously</p>

        <p>I'm thinking most of these vaccine reactions are overdramatised. But it doesn't change the facts of the vaccine being extremely rushed and coming with highly questionable long term effects. If they try and mandate it that will be the line in the sand for me.</p>

        <p>That's all I know so far. She has a couple friends who have taken the first dose, but her friend wasn't ill until after the second, so we'll see. My grandma doesn't want it, she doesn't consider covid as a big enough risk to justify it (she's in her 70's but cooks good healthy food and has been going on regular walking trips for years). Honestly, we don't know the risks of the vaccine just yet, so we don't know if the risk/reward is worth it for anyone.</p>
<p>My family don't want it, except my grandad but I can understand why he wants to take it and I just don't know how I could talk him out of it, my grandma has tried but I guess he watches a lot of news so that doesn't help. My dad thinks it's something nefarious, me and my mum don't think it's been trialled enough and don't consider covid a serious risk to either of us anyway, so my parents are willing to defend me and my younger sisters and make sure we're not forced to take it. I've been pretty lucky to have a family who agree with me through this, and I hope you can convince your family somehow. There are cases of adverse reactions that you'll be able to find on here, there's the obvious lack of trialling time in comparison to the 10+ years which is normal for vaccines, there's the low death rage for most people, but you've probably tried all of these so I just don't know.</p>

        <p>If you go to the son's FB page he is a huge Trump lover so this could be some Qanon BS made up to discredit the vaccine because they think that it has tracking devices in it that work with 5g or whatever.</p>
<p>The mom might work at a nursing home somewhere and used an empty room to film this story.</p>
<p>The amount of blinking she does while telling her story and her eye movements --looking up and to the side seems to indicate that she might be lying.</p>

        <p>That could've been your mother or relative.  Obviously taking the vaccine was their choice and it was the wrong decision.  But they're suffering and deserve a chance at life.  Have some respect for a fellow human being.  </p>
<p>Yes people are ignorant, but vaccination campaigns are deliberately misleading the public into believing that mRNA gene therapy is a vaccination.  </p>
<p>Calling it a "vaccine," knowing full well that people will think it the same medical technology that had been used in the US over the past 50 years--- is nothing less than fraud.  They're scamming the public by calling mRNA therapy a vaccine despite it containing no virus and not meeting the very definition of vaccine.</p>

        <p>Thankfully it wouldn’t be. They think it’s just as shady as I think it is also. Eh I can try. I’m just done giving respect to people who are willfully ignorant and “trust the science” without batting an eye or doing even a bit of research or critical thinking. I’ve run out of sympathy. This sub among many others tries to educate people and get them to see the other side of the coin, and that usually leads to ridicule, bans, etc from “normies”. It is fraudulent and evil what they are doing yes, you’d just think the majority would see how obvious that is. I’m sure most of us could see the bullshit even without subs that call out the bs.</p>

        <p>Our leaders are psychopaths.  Don't become a monster like them.  Big Reddit isn't representative of the average person on the street.</p>
<p>Trust me, I understand the frustration.  I really do.  But there is a difference between feeling frustrated and being downright callous and cruel.  This is still a victim that is suffering at the hands of the pharmaceutical industry.  Even sympathetic pity is better than contempt.  Hate is draining.</p>
