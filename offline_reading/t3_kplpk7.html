    <strong>Why do people push for mass vaccination with the new covid vaccines when even the companies themselves admit that they don't know if it will slow or stop spreading the virus?</strong>
    <p><p>I  honestly cannot see a reasonable explanation for this. Yes, the vaccine  will (mostly) protect you from the effects of the disease. Yes, the  vaccine was developed quite safely without skipping the regular steps.  Yes, it is far less likely to have long-term damage from the vaccine  than from COVID-19. Yes, mRNA technology is not exactly brand new and  has been tested on thousands of people already.</p>
<p>HOWEVER,  there are absolutely no moral or societal reasons why mass vaccination  with a brand-new product made with a relatively new technology by  for-profit pharmaceutical companies, which are not exactly known for  their beneficence, should be encouraged on a scale of hundreds of  millions of people. While we know that the vaccine is safe in general,  we certainly don't know how it would impact millions upon millions of  various genetic and physiological backgrounds.</p>
<p>It  could do absolutely nothing damaging, but again we don't know if that  will the case for certain. I can certainly understand people who are  under risk of severe COVID-19 complications, like the elderly, people  with chronic sicknesses, healthcare workers etc., should be vaccinated  but someone who isn't shouldn't have any moral obligations to take it.</p>
<p>Am  I missing a key point here? Because I feel like in case something goes  wrong with this vaccine, which is always a risk for new products, it  will just fuel the anti-vax movement for the vaccines we know that work  and are required, which would be catastrophic.</p>

        <p>This just proves that it is not about a virus. Because you made such valid points. </p>
<p>If im not vaccinated, but the person beside me is. The risk of either of us catching it is just the same. The risk of it affecting us is more or less the same (since im not vulnerable). So why on earth do healthy individuals need to have something, which places them at higher risk of adverse reactions than illness from the virus itself?</p>
<p>Its not to protect those around you like they claim the masks do. Because if the vaccine reduces your chances of getting seriously ill, then whoever takes it should be fine around anybody. </p>
<p>Vaccinating health care workers as one of the first makes no sense, unless they themselves are vulnerable. It will result in healthy health care workers displaying no symptoms at all, while working around vulnerable people. With a false sense of security thinking that they can not catch or spread the virus. So many people think the vaccine will stop it, when it has been stated that it probably won't which is why masks and distancing will still be required. </p>
<p>There is no way this is about a virus.</p>

        <p>I think the push comes from the government so that they have the perfect excuse to get out of this mess they have created. It makes the virus seem more serious and their destructive actions justified because a vaccine was "needed" and everyone had to take it.</p>

        <p>i think so too</p>
<p>at some point 20%-30% of major countries inhabitants will be vaccinated,likely by around summer. this is where politicians will give up as they notice there is nobody to be found anymore who wants the vaccine and they will end all measures</p>
<p>and accordingly they will get voted again in the 2021 elections since "they ended the virus"</p>

        <p>I think its not about the problems of the vaccine on pharma, as pharma cant be sued. its more psychology. They destroyed everything over nothing, and will never admit this. So they cant just say lets open up society again and get on with things, they committed to this path of destruction and now use the vaccine as the saving grace. It also helps manipulate the normies who will say damn all this destruction was worthwhile because without this vaccine millions would have died. Its all delusion and psychology and saving face.</p>

<p>Oh, there was definitely something in the USA.  They used this to hang an albatross around the neck of a popular president in an election year.</p>
<p>When Biden is inaugurated, the war machine will be back to full speed ahead.   You'll also (and should have already) notice a stark difference in attitude and interactions between the media and the president.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. The democrats made this as bad as possible in the US and then blamed Trump all to get more botes for Biden and it worked. I think Covid was the 3rd biggest reason people voted for Biden. </p>
<p>We also see the political abuse of Covid in other countries like HK where they uses Covid as an excuse to prevent mass protests and postpone the election as there were big revolt against the chinese influence and the govt wants to prevent this and not lose control. They only have 150 Covid deaths in HK. Its obvious political scam there.</p>

        <p>The timing in the USA has been incredible.</p>
<p>From Dec of 2016 to May/June of 2019 there was nothing but a relentless false attack of Russia collusion.  (Which we now know was engineered by the previous administration)</p>
<p>As soon as that theater was coming to a close, in Sept of 2019, John Lewis takes to the floor of the house to claim that Trump is a threat to the republic and we first hear of a discussion between Trump and the president of Ukraine that leads to impeachment farce.  (I am convinced there was smoke and fire and the 'threat to the republic' would have been to expose that corruption involving the previous administration and The Big Guy, directly.)</p>
<p>Then not a two weeks after the impeachment trial ends, COVID starts and becomes the main focus of the country since March 13th.</p>
<p>How very convenient.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think the hardest hitting question Biden has had to answer is "what type of ice cream are you eating"?</p>

        <p>Heard immunity originally meant when people or animals were exposed to a disease little by little so the body learns how to fight it. They may get sick a little but usually not death. So, they suddenly changed the meaning of that phrase. 
 Back during smallpox epidemics, a third would die now, because no one under the age of 50 has any immunity to it 90% would die if God forbid it got loose from a lab.
  With the whole mask thing, folks aren't being allowed to build any immunity to covid or anything else. If that Virus was to mutate to a stronger version, and we know viruses mutate all the time, we will have a "real" problem. But of course, perhaps, this maybe a hoped for outcome of theirs.</p>

        <p>" Yes, it is far less likely to have long-term damage from the vaccine than from COVID-19."</p>
<p>Actually, there is literally zero evidence for this claim because long-term vaccine damage is unknown because it's impossible to do long-term studies on a vaccine that's less than a year old.</p>

        <p>I would say that's a very bad argument, because in the video he is talking about return of saving from investments. In this case, Gates does not make 20:1 profit, the economy as a whole can save 19 times of the cost for vaccine investment. Ofc when about 90% of the economy is in the hands of 1% you could argue that they profit from that large saving :)</p>

        <p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you get the vaccine, why are you still being asked to practice social distancing and wear a mask?  Didn't you just get the vaccine?</p>
<p>So you mean, the vaccine isn't really a vaccine?  (It isn't.  It's actually a type of prophylaxic treatment).</p>
<p>Do you know what else is an effective prophylaxic treatment for covid?  Sunlight, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc.</p>
<p>With this treatment there is almost zero bad side effects possible.</p>
<p>But will we be able to choose which type of treatment we choose for ourselves?</p>
<p>The real crime being committed here, is we are being told we're not allowed to make our own health choices.  </p>
<p>From the beginning of this whole mess, we've lost sight of our autonomy.  <strong>Every individual should be able to decide for themselves their own health choices.</strong></p>
<p>In other words, we're being sold a lie, but the most unscrupulous, dishonest industry on the planet.</p>
<p>Ask anyone if they trust the pharmaceutical industry.  They will say no.  Then, in the next breath, they'll say they are getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is what we're dealing with here.</p>

        <p>Never underestimate corruption and lobbying. Certain public health officials (like Sir Patrick 'Bank Balance' Vallance) have shares in vaccine distribution companies and don't even look at the safety data before approving it. Politicians work for those who fund their campaigns, not the public.</p>

        <p>Because they have been lied to and made to believe that lie, that the vaxx will lead us back to normal and keep everyone protected from catching the virus... Again both of those are complete lies, the vaxx only maybe minimizes symptoms but does nothing for transmission... Doomers need to take the shades off and see reality for a second</p>

        <p>This seems like the most logical reason to me. They could basically shift the entire load of the problems from pandemic to pharma companies if the vaccine had failures or problems.</p>
