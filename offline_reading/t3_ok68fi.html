        <p>Well if they want to force people to get the jab but it still be "their choice", then that's the way to do it. Of course, if they provided unemployment for these unvaccinated folks then less would take the jab. Let's say they did this with no unemployment, no assistance at all. They probably would go that route too because more people will take it if they can't feed their kids, face losing their homes, can't afford to survive, etc. Basically starve us out.</p>

        <p>So then what are we actually supposed to do? </p>
<p>Also, I’m unemployed trying to find a job that doesn’t require masks or vaccination and it seems like a lot of places, while not yet requiring vaccination, are still requiring masks.</p>

        <p>If I were you, I'd just be happy to find one that wont require vaccination because masks are everywhere. My husband works outside, in the heat and humidity. They just mad eit where they don't have to wear masks outside but only if they were vaccinated. Well they can't ask for proof of vaccination so no one wears masks. Before, old men were on the verge of strokes and couldn't breathe due to the masks. They didn't care. </p>
<p>Choose your battles. If you need a job, accept you'll probably have to wear a mask. </p>
<p>If the government forces everyone unvaccinated out of their jobs, then most will probably take the vaccine. Won't have a choice really. Can't let our kids starve or lose their homes. I suppose we could all rise up and fight back. However, I don't see that working unless we can get A LOT of people to do so. And most won't. They'll just take the jab so they can work and carry on.</p>

<p>This began with The Mask, and will end with The Mask.</p>
<p>It is the battle to fight, because a 30 cent surgical Mask will be the downfall of the world's freedoms liberties and body governance.</p>
<p>This is not a Mask/Vax/Pass battle. This is a human rights battle.</p>
