        <p>23 and Me, MyHeritage, and LivingDNA have serious implications on their own. Your DNA shares markers with people in your family. For example, law enforcement can (and has) used this data to find criminals, by using the DNA of their family members, submitted to these companies voluntarily, in comparison to DNA found at a crime scene. While this example may seem noble on the surface (stopping criminals), it has serious implications if the data falls into the wrong hands, which I think is self evident to most people who stop to think about it for more than 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Now LifeDNA wants to double dip on your DNA data. For the small price of just $19, you can give your extremely valuable DNA data to this company in exchange for a personalized risk assessment. Who knows where this data will end up, or what it will be used for. This is just ridiculous to me. This is abhorrent and evil and it should be stopped, exposed to the light of day as such.</p>

        <p>I'm the child of two oldest children, and consequently got to know quite a few of my older family members; two of my great-grandparents lasted halfway through my teenage years.  This was great, since if I had a question about family history, I could just ask someone who'd (often) been there.  Who'd lived through what happened almost a century earlier.  </p>
<p>Consequently (and with Ireland being essentially in the middle of nowhere, historical-immigrationwise), I knew a LOT about my ancestry- and you can imagine how horrified I was when I found my sister had exposed us all through one of those services.  Paying for the privilege of being spied on.  And I'd had absolutely no say in it.</p>
<p>That was years ago, but I think that one thing this pandemic has showed me is that "George Orwell" was actually a pseudonym of a certain Dagobah resident: the quote as we'd say it is "Big Brother is you, watching".</p>
