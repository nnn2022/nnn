    <strong>Curious if anyone got covid here and their experience?</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve been in Las Vegas for almost a week since July 3rd - constantly around people and presume I contracted covid. </p>
<p>My bf and I got ivermectin along with other supplements and have started the ‚Äúwe are pretty sure we got covid‚Äù protocol even though we haven‚Äôt taken a test to know if we caught it or not.</p>
<p>OVERALL curious if anyone got it and what happened and all that jazz. (Also if they had underlying issues too -cuz I got chronic issues)</p></p>

        <p>I think I had it waaay back in the beginning before it was known to be in the US. December 2019. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know for sure, but my roommate got really sick right after he got back from China and then I got sick, and a bunch of people at work did as well (roommate and I worked together). People were out for weeks.</p>
<p>I had a fever for about a week, then the worst dry cough I‚Äôve ever had in my life - I would literally wake up gasping for air in the middle of the night. My roommate was telling me I should see a doctor because it was so bad. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it before or since. That lasted a few months and I had decreased lung function for a while. </p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm 100% fine and have been for over a year. I think I had covid and it wasn‚Äôt a blast but I still don‚Äôt agree with any of the restrictions over it, and don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine. People get sick, that‚Äôs life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>This is very similar to my story, contracted it late Dec 2019 into Jan 2020 during a NYE trip to Colorado. When I arrived there my friend was sick, I started experiencing symptoms a few days later. First was the worst headache of my life, body aches , chills, coughing and what I noticed the most was how fatigued I was on the mountain. I loss sense of smell and taste but I was still able to get two half days of snowboarding in (killer virus eh?) Worst of it was one night until my fever broke. My friend ended up going to get a test for the flu that came back negative, they said it was a mysterious respiratory infection. I had about two weeks of tiredness after that and came home to pass it onto my partner and sister. Both were fine also. </p>
<p>I was exposed to confirmed cases this past NYE at a party too. 4 out of the 8 of us there got Covid but my partner and I and two others who thought they may have already been infected were never sick. We all passed around the same joint and played drinking games. I‚Äôd say my immunity has lasted an entire year. I haven‚Äôt been sick since. I will take Covid over the vaccine any day.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs interesting because some of my coworkers that got sick also got tested for flu and it came back negative during that time.</p>
<p>Even management there thinks we all had it before it was known to be in the US (and they probably blame me and my roommate - lol. But we had no way to know!)</p>

        <p>I had a very similar situation.  Nobody at the time really even speculated too much that it might be corona.  It was super contagious and lingered maybe twice as long as normal cold or flu.</p>

        <p>dry throat for two days, thought it was just cause I was cycling in the cold. Tired for 2 days with 2 hours of fever. After symptoms went away I lost my taste for like 2 months.</p>
<p>My symptoms sound much better than getting the 2nd dose of gene therapy.</p>

        <p>I got it last November. Woke up with a bad headache and cold like symptoms. Went for a test and it was positive. I had every symptom except for fever. It was like a bad flu for me. I stayed home for two weeks. Fluids, rest and IB for head and body aches. I was not offered any kind of treatment from my doctor. The fatigue lingered for me for awhile. Never got anyone else sick.</p>

        <p>Day One: Chills, lethargy, fever</p>
<p>Day Two: Fever, basically don't leave bed, at least not for very long</p>
<p>Day Three: Feeling about 45% there again, can still do my daily routine at about that level</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I get a lot of colds and my immune system probably overreacted to it.</p>

        <p>I think I had it... It is as at the time of the second wave. Never got tested, so can't be sure.. but how sure can you be using a pcr as a test anyway hey. </p>
<p>Started as feeling run down and tired. Had a bit of a sore throat.
Didn't want anything to eat for 4 days and just slept. The sore throat got bad. Lots of phlegm within a week. Sore throat over 2 weeks and the biggest thing I noticed - I couldnt go woop woop (as in here come the police woop woop) for over a month.</p>

        <p>I am young and fit, with no co-morbidities of any kind. 
This is an excerpt of one of my previous comments</p>
<p>&rt;I had very severe symptoms and ended up in hospital. My wife, who was pregnant at the time, couldn't distinguish between her pregnancy symptoms and her covid symptoms and my children had slightly runny noses.</p>
<p>&rt;My illness lasted an entire month. I had fevers that went up to 104.5 then I would wake up with hypothermia, literal hypothermia, my temperature was 93. The virus spared my lungs but attacked my blood and my kidneys which still gave me difficulty breathing, something about fluid buildup around my lungs. The virus also attacked my ability to produce testosterone. I had no sense of smell or taste and I had no appetite. My muscles and joints ached and my head pounded. </p>
<p>&rt;There were moments that I genuinely believed I was going to die. While I was in hospital the doctors gave me the choice of dying alone in hospital or dying with my family in my bed. They told me because the virus was attacking my blood and causing it to clot in a very peculiar way there was no chance for them to save me if I stroked out. I chose to go home and I guess I got lucky.</p>
<p>&rt;To this day my joints still hurt. I am no longer sick and haven't been for a year but my joints still hurt. I don't believe in long covid, I actually think it's stupid but I do believe this virus can wreck your body in lasting ways, long after it's gone. For some people it's like a wrecking ball that just smashes its way through and does as much damage as it can while your body fights it off.</p>

        <p>Nope, a complete mystery. I'm not really surprised considering many Chinese scientists spent a great amount of time and effort putting this virus together. I'm glad I have the natural antibodies though. I will never take that <em>vaccine</em></p>

        <p>I think I had it when I went to Cuba just before it became widely known. The symptoms I had felt like bronchitis with a mild fever and some lethargy. Sunshine has been shown to be a great help in fighting it off, so it was the perfect time to be in a hot climate. I was able to fight off whatever it was within 2-3 days. I refuse to get the nose jab, but when I next see my doctor, I'll be asking him if there's some other test I can take to prove that I now have natural immunity. I have no faith in their claims that natural immunity only lasts a short time. Thankfully, he hasn't been pushy about the jab and is aware that they aren't fully FDA approved yet.</p>

        <p>Not verified by the 'skull fuck', but 99% sure my wife had it, given 6 others also sick at the same time after the same event were confirmed. She had an average bout of the flu. Maybe I 'got it', but had zero symptoms. (The most common Covid symptom!)</p>

        <p>Pretty sure I had it in Feb of 2020, before they were mass testing for it. I'm not rich nor a celebrity, so I wouldn't have been tested even if I did go to the Dr, but I lost my smell and taste for about 2 weeks. I had a really runny nose, my eyes leaked, constant sneezing, a cough and chest pain, and every nerve in my skin felt like I had a very bad sunburn. It was so much pain, and the only thing that helped it was weed. My husband had to drive to the next state (where it's legal) to get me some and I was so whiney lying in bed all by myself waiting for him to make the 4 hour trip, I was annoying myself! Lol that whole thing lasted about a week from beginning to end, except the smell and taste thing. It was no worse than a mild flu.
Edit for minor details</p>

        <p>My entire household tested positive in November.</p>
<p>For me it was exactly like the flu, and lasted roughly 36 hours.  Maybe 72 hours in total before I was back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but had a little fatigue for a week or so.  And by fatigue I‚Äôm talking about falling asleep a hour or two earlier</p>
<p>My wife did not get anything like that but lost taste and smell and those have not returned at 100% still all these months later.</p>
<p>The kids had the sniffles for a couple of days</p>

        <p>Tested positive last summer. Started with slightly scratchy throat then headache then fever/chills and muscle aches and fatigue. Took about 5 days to feel totally well again. Did not take any drugs whatsoever not even for the headache just laid out in the sun. Probably could have kicked it sooner but my kids wouldn‚Äôt let me rest- their symptoms were a fever for a day and that‚Äôs it.</p>

        <p>Before this stupidity was even a thing. January of last year. My mom, my brother and then I got what felt the onset of a bad cold. All three of us said then that it felt really weird. My mom got extremely sore and tired for like 5 days, stayed home and slept but never got a full blown cold or flu. She just slept. My brother had soreness, a cough and a headache that came and went for about 2 weeks. I had that feeling of when you're about to get sick. You get that body ache, the chills, your feet get really cold even with heavy socks and under a blanket. Where you go to bed and know, this is it, I'm going to feel like shit in the morning with a sore throat and all. But then nothing. It was gone in the morning. But then the following day that feeling returned. Scratchy throat, sore body, chills, cold feet. Then nothing. That happened for 2 weeks straight.  Alternating days like that. Nothing ever became of it. </p>
<p>So by February we were all fine but we all noted amongst ourselves and other family how damn bizarre it was. Different for all three of us but the same in that feeling of about to be getting sick but didn't really. And all of us wrote it off as eh, must have just been our bodies fighting off whatever the flu is this year. And moved on with out lives. Until a month later when the world ended. </p>
<p>Absolutely 100% convinced we got it. Office setting, warehouse and me in multiple school sites among thousands. We picked it up somewhere. It was already around since like November of '19. Our immunity systems did their jobs and we moved on.</p>

        <p>Maybe I had it in Feb 2020.  Whatever it was was super contagious.</p>
<p>A very dry cough that lingered longer than usual but nothing notable as I have had much worse flus in the past.  Perhaps it's also worth noting I haven't gotten sick at all since then but I rarely get sick period.</p>
