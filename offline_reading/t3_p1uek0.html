    <strong>Couple of questions. Trying to understand.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello people. I'm from Argentina. Since day 1 I was sceptical about the whole situation, a global pandemic, in this age, at this moment?? Yeah, no. Anyway, I was always sceptical about everything. So, I had the feeling (and have today) on my gut that there is something wrong here. Very wrong. A lot of "tin hat" conspiracies aside, I always looked for the truth. Always trying to see the cientific side, the empirical side. </p>
<p>I have almost lost friends because this pandemic, not because the virus per se, but because the "social virus" it created. I have friends, brothers in life, saying that, and I quote "I hope they make the pass for vaccine a must for everything so you silly heads get the jab" and I was like, heart broken, you my guy, the one who discussed with me and teached me A LOT of things and opened my eyes more than once, is falling for this? </p>
<p>I reached a place where I'm doubting myself, my ideas and ideals, doubting about if I'm wrong this time and this IS REAL. People saying, "my family members died because of this" etc. </p>
<p>And then, this guy, friend of me, throwing at me a lot of proofs, medical and scientific proofs. Saying that I'm blind, that this is basics, a jab like any other to stop this madness. He really wants to get through this, to enjoy life again. So, im starting to feel guilt. </p>
<p>He even says that it's not only deaths but actual simptoms, worse than any other "flu", and that it left lasting simptoms, like renal and pulmonary deficiency etc. His father went through it and says it was horrible and etc. HE EVEN TESTED HIS FATHER to Oxygen saturation and said to me is an effect of the virus!! Like, here is the proof man.  (By the way, he studied some medicine, and eats book like crazy.)</p>
<p>So, all said, I'm reaching places where there is people that maybe knows a little more, that is fighting against this like I want. So, here I am. Like there is "proof" for the the virus, is there proof AGAINST it?? Like, empirical, scientific proof. </p>
<p>Sorry for the length, and my language, English isn't my first language. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>Its existence is kind of debatable to be honest. Some people say its real and some people say its just a hoax. All that's really known is that the numbers are fake, the PCR test can't tell the difference between the FLU and this alleged virus, and the thing they're injecting people with isn't even a "Vaccine" because "Covid" has never actually been isolated in a lab.</p>

        <p>The problem is that proof against the mainstream is going to be suppressed but it is out there. I don't have anything to link at the moment but one little fact I like to throw out is that more people have died directly from the vaccine than have died from covid in my age group. And that's including the boosted covid numbers and likely suppressed vaccine deaths</p>

        <p>You're not alone my friend. I'm sorry your trusted friend made you doubt. </p>
<p>This subreddit is all about freedom of choice, and never coerce others into doing something that you don't want to do. We're against the "New Normal", as there are evil groups behind the covid agenda to force a more totalitarian control of our way of life, with a Social Credit System, and to force us to behave like feeble weak citizens. </p>
<p>There are those who believe that SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) is like the flu, and some suffer more than others. And there are those who believe that covid-19 is actually another more virulent virus but it's being misdiagnosed as covid-19 due to how poorly the RT-PCR rapid-diagnostic is (the PCR test is complete garbage). </p>
<p>In any case, people who had covid-19 recovered within a few days, while others took a longer time to recover, but continue to have painful symptoms (they are called "long covid sufferers"). </p>
<p>I feel the truth is being hidden from us, and I have no idea of what's actually happening. All I know is that there are dystopian and draconian agendas being pushed by very powerful governments and corporations, and the mainstream media (MSM) are lying a lot about what's really happening. </p>
<p>Continue to trust your instincts, and don't listen to those who are too brainwashed or too drunk on their own hubris. Your heart knows best.</p>

        <p>Mmm, see that's the thing. People believe it because they see (like my friend) people suffer from it. But, what I say, people suffered everyday the same. For example my mother in law died 2 months ago from cancer. She was doing ok, before the pandemic. Then, they gave her less and less chemo and such, cut in half her doctor visits etc and went from 5 to 50 in 2 months. Then, she passed away. My wife is going through the worst. You know what they said? Including my friend. "She was destined to die anyway, covid was and is more urgent". WHERE IS THE URGENCY? Is it real???</p>

        <p>Not sure how anyone can credibly question the existence of covid.  There are just way too many people with eyes on this situation from way to many angles and professions - from scientists, journalists, hospitals, doctors, vaccinologists, and so on.  There are literally scores of papers examining the gene sequence, spike proteins, etc etc.  While there are opinions all over the place on any given issue within the COVID universe, it seems quite settled that covid is real.  I dove deep into the literature at the beginning of this, and I never once saw anything question whether covid is real. And frankly, to say otherwise seems to me like errant nonsense and seems to rely on heavy doses of myopic thinking or fantasy fueled conspiracy thinking.</p>
<p>Lately I saw something about a lawsuit in Alberta where a court allegedly ruled covid doesn't exist because it has never been isolated, and since then I've seen a few allegations along those lines.  Haven't wasted my time figuring out what is going on with that "never been isolated" line but might have to at some point.  My initial assumption is that the lawsuit prevailed more because of some legal technicalities than due to science.</p>

        <p>Oh.  Well that's a different issue entirely.  Sorry, I read your post as pondering whether covid was an actual thing (apparently people question its existence).  As to your question, its my understanding that it is common knowledge that the death counts are inflated to some degree in the US, at least, due to the criteria used for counting deaths.  The criteria made sense to me, in that it seems better to err on the side of overcounting positives and deaths initially than under count.   There are all kinds of questions about the accuracy of the positive case numbers and whether PCR tests are really reliable.  Frustratingly,  it also appears possible that COVID has actually spread and infected way more than the official counts would indicate (as suggested by various antibody tests performed on random groups) which suggests that A LOT of people had it and didn't even know it. There are questions about how lethal covid is, with overwhelming evidence now showing the covid risk profile is parabolic, going from practically zero lethality for children to very lethal for the very old.  Same relationship between the healthy and those with co-morbities.  Bottom line, there are many independent groups looking at this information, and I expect they will be sifting and studying the data for years trying to get more accurate answers to all of these questions.  From what I've seen, there is a lot of room for debate on all these questions at this point - and that we are far from a medical consensus.  And then you have problems like vaccines, improvements in treatment, and variants that keep creating a lot of noise in the data.  But, again, there are so many different and hyper intelligent people looking at this, and enough who are free from government influence or other agendas, that it appears the "scientific" community is making progress dialing in and getting a handle on covid.  Which is another way of saying I'm not going to try to rummage up sources and that I m suggesting you can find sources for and against almost any position at the moment, so good luck drawing any reliable and definitive conclusions.</p>

        <p>So, at the end of the day, we are at square 1. There is SO many points of view, that nothing makes sense. What about the icus, the prevention to use them by vaccination, and more. I know the media play with info, always did. But... It seems too suspicious, like I say, at this time and age, all of the sudden. I don't know. I really want to believe it's just this virus, and we have this solution (vaccine) and then we go free. But, nothing seems to be true today. Not for me, not for my gut. And it's worsening when people point the finger at you, yelling "THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY, GET THE JAB YOU IGNORANT".</p>

        <p>The virus is real. This is a fact. And yes people are dying from it. Another fact (in my opinion) is that the government and pharmaceutical companies are hyping it up and creating more fear and division to push their goals. The “science” is telling us that the vaccine saves lives. Well this is true to an extent in the immediate future but in the long run it is still very much up for debate. Here are the facts we now know about the virus: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Immunity only seems to last about 6 months. This will lead to a situation of vaccine dependence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an unknown risk in the future of vaccine enhanced disease. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass vaccination during a pandemic may cause the emergence of more deadly variants over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other future side effects of the vaccine are unknown at this time but anecdotal reports of period related side effects have been widely reported. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spike protein which is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles CAN pass the blood brain barrier and IS accumulating in the ovaries in animal studies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if 100 percent of the world population took the vaccine today, it would not stop the pandemic because this vaccine is only 39 percent effective against the delta variant. Effectiveness against other variants remains to be proven. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given all of these facts the choice to get the vaccine should be based on a risk analysis of the individual. If you are over the age of 60 or overweight perhaps the risk of dying from covid outweighs the risks to your personal health from the vaccine. If you are young and healthy, this risks and unknown risks from the vaccine MAY be worse. Ultimately we are dealing with a situation with many unknowns from both the virus and the vaccine. Everyone should make their own decision with the limited information we have at the moment. </p>
<p>Will come back to add sources later.</p>
