    <strong>Ultimate red pill. PROOF there is no delta Variant &amp; Covid19 is not novel.</strong>
    <p><p>The Covid-19 virus isn’t even novel, it’s only novel in the sense of classification and ID. Also, there aren’t any variants either. (I bought into the whole novel coronavirus/variant lie, until I saw Dr. Martin give direct evidence disproving it with sources from the US patent office.) </p>
<p>Here is Dr. David Martin’s video breakdown of the rico case he proves in his 200 page dossier. </p>
<p>I would do a tldr for the normie brainlets but no, fuck you, hear it from the source and watch with your own eyes and listen with your own ears. </p>
<p>“Inb4 he has to translate to German!”
He does it ONCE in the beginning, and it's smart, you know why? Because they edited out the remaining times he translated to German and you cannot cry 'fake and gay because muh editing', it's blatantly obvious why that editing took place, and it's because of comments like &rt;aww gee whiz Ozanon, why do I have to skip through muh German translation? This is too much of my valuable time! </p>

<p>Here is the 200 page dossier. The first ~60 pages outline the actual patent data and is what most of you would be interested in. </p>
