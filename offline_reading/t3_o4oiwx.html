    <strong>Psychological effects of living among the Pro New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>Wasn't sure how to flair this.</p>
<p>There has been some talk around how the mixed messaging around how to deal (on an individual level) with covid-19 has forced people who buy into the mainstream narrative into a perpetual state of cognitive dissonance. They're told masks are always necessary, but also that you can eat at a restaurant (where you have to take off your mask); people are encouraged to go to BLM protests buy not places of worship; the "vaccines" work but people who are "vaccinated" still go around wearing masks etc..</p>
<p>However I haven't heard anyone talk about the psychological effects on those who see through the nonsense but are nonetheless forced to live within it.</p>
<p>For example, every time I have been forced to wear a mask for an extended period of time, I have broke down afterwards. In one instance my mask compliance was preceded by being slapped in a public place by an older family member for not wearing it. That is to say, I feel that being among family who all firmly believe the narrative, I am at times forced into things that are fundamentally contrary to what I believe to be true (as someone against the new normal). I am worried that the longer this goes on, the more potential breakdowns I may have and the more respect I may lose for both  myself and those around me.</p>
<p>As a side note: I live in one of the places most pro restrictions, people here are still wearing masks (even the people I know who got the shot) and many businesses are still requiring customers to wear masks. My family has been pressuring me to get the shot (of which I refuse) and all my friends have got it (save one) even though I am young and healthy. I hear everyday from my family complaints about people talking off their masks or how people don't respect the law anymore....</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any similar experiences? This sub is one of the few things that keep me from feeling like I am going crazy.</p></p>

        <p>My experience is similar. I have been trying to get the courage to go back out and face the absurdity. I cannot (and have not) worn masks. I ultimately paid with my job because of conflicts brought upon me by aggressive people (includes my ex-boss)</p>
<p>I learned a bunch of important things through this all though. I like helping others, I enjoy finding the truth, and dedicating myself to pushing forward despite the apparent horde of brainwashed people has actually made me stronger overall. </p>
<p>The thing that helps me come back after losing my grip on who I really am is that through this all, I've done my best to find the information I needed to and made the best choices I could possibly have. I have no regrets. </p>
<p>Stay true to yourself, no matter what. People like us aren't crazy, feeling this way should be considered realistic (and it is for a lot of people), it's just tragic that so many people are lost. I hope they can find the courage to make it through, too.</p>

        <p>Well, guess Im lucky (or actively worked towards it in the past), but Ive got enough peers who also agree that this is all bs.</p>
<p>The rest I mostly quit interacting with, so Im hardly forced to endure any of this bs, safe for the occasional grocery shopping. Ive skipped masks in the train and so far no one has complained.</p>
<p>Cant imagine how it is being forced. Id highly advise working on becoming independt as good as you can and then tell people how you really think/feel. </p>
<p>For example, your mother doesnt want you to invite you to a family meeting unvaccinated, "Okay mom, it kinda sucks that we have to end our relationship like that, but since I wont change, either you do or that was the last time we spoke with each other." - This usually does things with people, because of course they dont want to end the relationship, neither do I. So, she is now forced to either overcome her fears or to tell me that she doesnt want to see me / her grandkids over this. Also, dont be afraid, they started playing the game, so they cant complain if you beat them in it.</p>

        <p>I know exactly how you feel, especially the family members turning against you phenomenon. It‚Äôs pretty grating being called ‚Äòidiot‚Äô every time you talk to them on the phone.</p>
<p>Then again part of me hopes that I am in fact the idiot, many of the predictions I‚Äôve seen of the aftermath of this vax rollout seem too much to bear. I pray every day that we‚Äôre all wrong. </p>
<p>Still doesn‚Äôt justify constant bombardment of insults from one‚Äôs ‚Äòloved ones‚Äô though, this is really a test of patience if anything.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs likely the physical assault that I presume happens to you on a semi-regular basis from your family members that‚Äôs putting the biggest strain on your mental health. Your family is abusive and toxic and they don‚Äôt need to be brainwashed by a scamdemic to mentally damage you. You need to get away from them ASAP.</p>
<p>I find pro-NN stuff extremely frustrating and annoying, and more likely to light a fire in my belly than make me scared. But that may be my personality...I‚Äôm sure depression and hopelessness is also normal, however, your situation definitely isn‚Äôt healthy. Hope you can find some help</p>

        <p>My mental health improved when I started viewing the whole thing as a cult. I used to stay up at night unable to sleep because I was so frustrated with everyone and I'd try to figure out what the hell was going on. Then it just kinda clicked for me. They're in a cult. Obviously I'm still upset about everything going on in the world but this mindset has helped me heaps.</p>
