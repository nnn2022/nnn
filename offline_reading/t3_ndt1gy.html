    <strong>Why "take the vaccine for other people" is a horrible argument.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>If you are sick, you should be staying home for the time being anyway. True, you can have Covid with no symptoms, but if you have no symptoms, you are less likely to spread it. Even then, just take the PCR test, and if you test positive, stay home for a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's say you're in a room with five other people, and they have taken the vaccine, but you haven't. Shouldn't they still be safe from Covid? Why would it matter if you haven't taken it in that case? Anyone seriously afraid Covid is probably going to take the vaccine for themselves anyway. Of course, the Covid vaccine doesn't even really work, but this is assuming it did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of serious side-effects from the Covid vaccine is not worth taking to save some people. Being overly selfless is as bad as being overly selfish. You are not responsible for the health of everyone else. If you were, you be taking other measures to make sure people are safe, but that's just not realistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vaccine does not prevent transmission. Even if you're fully vaccinated, you can still catch Covid and spread it to other people. It might reduce transmission since potential symptoms can be reduced, but that's not nearly good enough when you consider the risk factors of taking the vaccine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, please stop telling us to take the vaccine for other people. It's a ridiculous argument in favor of taking it. That's why it's mind boggling that they have to implement things like vaccine passports. There is no benefit in having such a system in place. People should be completely free in their choice to take any vaccines, let alone the Covid one.</p>
<p>So, next time some tells you to take the vaccine for other people, try bringing up these points.</p></p>

        <p>There is logic behind it: If you don't take the jab, mine will not work...</p>
<p>But seriously, i think down deep in the guts, most people who took it, know or feel that the vaccine is potentially dangerous, and that is why they push others to take it, so they feel better.</p>
<p>As you know, doomers are selfish pricks who demand others to wear masks, get the jab etc so they can feel 'safe'.</p>

<p>That doesn't even check out, it's well known that the vaccine doesn't prevent contraction OR transmission, it just "reduces severity of symptoms." So regardless of whether I have the vaccine, your chances of getting it are the same. I'm fact I would argue that it's higher if I get vaxxed, since now there's a chance that I'm carrying it without symptoms... If I was expressing symptoms then I know to self quarantine.</p>

        <p>Seriously, my dad went from “everybody will probably catch it anyways, what’s the point of all the lockdowns and safety measures?” to “they shouldn’t be enticing people with a carrot on a stick to get the vax, they should be beating anyone who doesn’t get it over the head with the stick.” (Actual quote). </p>

        <p>I'm wondering if this is the case, because at this point two of my friends have gotten it.  </p>
<p>One is not a doomer; she was coerced into getting it because she's a surgical tech.  She was scared to get it, and it made her ill for 2 days after she got the second shot, but after that there was this weird turnaround in her feelings about it where she keeps asking her close friends why we aren't getting it.  It's almost like she thinks that because she was scared to get it and has now gotten it, it's some sort of elite club only the brave get into or something.  </p>
<p>The other is one of those hypocritical doomers who thinks masks are the Final Solution to the virus yet is comfortable socializing with us in close quarters without one--all the while making his two kids isolate from their friends.  He just got his second shot.  Says it made him sick but is trying to push it on us.  Won't shut up about his vaccine.  Keeps inserting it into conversation randomly.  Flat-out asked me last night if I plan to take it.  I could've gone full-on bitch on him because frankly my medical decisions are no one's business but mine.  However, I wanted him to realize that there are perfectly good reasons for vaccine hesitancy so I told him flat-out I have an autoimmune disease and that the vaccines have not been tested on people with those so I am not comfortable getting it for many years to come.</p>
<p>What I <em>didn't</em> tell him is that I probably won't ever bother, because I am of the firm belief that my personal health should matter to me more than strangers'.  I already had COVID and it was a mild cold for me where I lost my sense of taste and smell for a week, had headache, fever and fatigue.  What people are describing from the vaccine sounds much more severe even in "mild" reactive cases than what I experienced with COVID.  I'm sure it will be bad for me because I get quite ill from flu shots as well.  Why the fuck would I take something that I <em>know</em> will make me sicker than the damn virus?  No, thanks.  I will not intentionally make myself sick for anyone.  My health comes first to me.  As it should to everyone else.</p>

<p>During clinical trials, the way they measured efficacy was mere symptom reduction--that's it. It doesn't prevent spread because it wasn't supposed to.</p>

        <p>This argument is not a new one. This has been debated ad nauseam in mommy groups for years. </p>
<p>“If your kid doesn’t get MMR, they can’t hang out with my kids.”</p>
<p>“If your kids are vaccinated, why should you care?”</p>
<p>The theory is that when vaccines are sub-100% in studies, it is usually 100% for some people and severely less effective for other people, and you can never know if you’re that asshole. Some people get MMR but develop little if any protection based on blood test titers. If enough people around them are immune, they’re very unlikely to get it even though they themselves are at higher risk. </p>
<p>So the need for “herd immunity” through vaccines becomes a big deal, which is why antivaxxers have a hard time finding pediatricians and schools. </p>
<p>I believe it’s different with this vaccine, the same way we never aim for “herd immunity” for flu or cold. But Boy is seeing this argument all over agin exhausting.</p>

<li>
<p>Most people will not regularly be tested unless they do have symptoms, so that’s not really an argument. Lower chances doesn’t mean none. Absolutely sick people should stay home, regardless of the illness, but you won’t always know when it’s possible to spread it. That’s why extremely simple safety precautions like masks to diffuse your exhalations and a bit of elbow room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reverse the situation, put one person with the vaccine in a room of 5 unvaccinated. You get a possible major influx of the virus that can overwhelm even the prepared immune system by sheer numbers. You get people infecting each other so there is more chance for the virus to mutate and become something the vaccine doesn’t control, restarting our progress. If we are assuming the vaccine works, even some, it works better when more people have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t imagine many situations where “overly selfless” is a bad thing unless it’s combined with other people being selfish and taking advantage of that. Cooperation and compassion are beneficial to everyone, if everyone has it. They only become a problem when someone rejects them. Sure, it’s not possible to expect everyone to actually be selfless, there needs to be awareness of how you’re being taken advantage of by others and stop it, but that’s not an excuse to be the selfish one. In a very “two wrongs don’t make a right” kind of way, knowing that you may sometimes have to defend yourself from greed doesn’t mean you have to become greedy yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reduces it, and reduces severity and duration. It trains the body to fight the virus, and that in the long term can help us as a society remove it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I do agree the vaccine passports are a terrible idea, and that it’s a totally personal decision whether you take it or not. I also think there’s absolutely a strong reason to take it to protect everyone around you, and it’s not inappropriate to be concerned about too many people refusing it.</p>

        <p>The goal of a cloth mask is not the same as an N95. They were never meant to filter, but to slow down and redirect airflow so your cough or long sigh don’t carry moist air across the room as far.</p>
<p>If you smoke or vape, try faking a cough with a lung full, and then do it again but through the mask. You’ll see how much further unrestricted air travels.</p>
