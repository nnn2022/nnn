        <p>I swear to Christ, I said this over a year ago:</p>
<p>Virus cells aren't strictly alive, in a biological sense. They don't think, they don't act in any way that we would expect from plants or animals. All they are programmed to do is to reproduce.</p>
<p>A deadly virus is not a successful one. If the host dies so does the virus. A successful virus is one that spreads throughout a large population whilst <em>not</em> killing the host.</p>
<p>Wanna know why there is no vaccine against the common cold? Because there are over 200 different viruses that cause it. These viruses have, over milleniae, adapted to be infectious enough to spread, but sufficiently benign that they don't keep their human hosts from spreading them.</p>
<p>When the Delta variant started making the news I was honestly elated, and I had expected something like this to emerge: a less lethal form of the virus that is naturally inoculating people against the deadly form.</p>
<p>It's basic fucking epidemiology. Pick up any book on the matter printed before 2019 and it will tell you the exact same thing.</p>
<p>There's a reason people don't die from the Spanish Flu anymore.</p>

        <p>lethality decreases with mutation.  essentially virus learns not to destroy the host.  </p>
<p>fraudci said this in public statements last year shortly after "outbreak"</p>
