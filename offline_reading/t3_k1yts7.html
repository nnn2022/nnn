        <p>Thank you, Illinois Director or Public Health. This is true: Some states are doing this "If you have CoVid-19 at the time of your death, even if you die from... cancer... it is still counted as a CoVid-19 death!"</p>
<p>Thankfully Maryland, the state I live in, to my knowledge is not doing that.</p>
<p>When my father died on May 5th from CoVid-19, all the doctors they had called and talked with were asked "Is this a CoVid-19 death?"</p>
<p>After almost 45 minutes of talking between them, they decided "Yes, it was a CoVid-19 death even though the direct cause of death was my father's coronary artery bypass detaching because they believed that the coronary artery bypass detaching was due to the CoVid-19 vascular virus attacking it!"</p>
<p>In the case of my mother, who died of multi-organ failure on May 29th due to CoVid-19, they deemed it a CoVid-19 death because her multi-organ failure was a direct consequence of CoVid-19 starting what is called a 'cytokine storm' in her body.</p>
<p>I have seen numerous accounts of other people who were in car crashes and were NOT the driver of the vehicle being deemed a CoVid-19 death because they had it at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>The driver didn't have it... the passengers had it.</p>
<p>Those are not CoVid-19 deaths. Related to CoVid-19, yes. From CoVid-19? No.</p>

        <p>What’s weird is that the brainwashed zombies don’t even bat an eye at this. They say, “that’s why we have to take these strict precautions. the Covid is deadly when there’s a pre existing illness.”</p>

        <p>I post this video all the time. I use it to show how inflated the numbers were in the beginning. But the shills always come out swinging with “that video is 6 months old” no shit dude. I said I was demonstrating how the cases were inflated in the beginning. Or “nice you tube source” </p>
<p>Washington state also has a good print source that outlines these same principals I usually share them together.</p>

        <p>I'm at my step dad's house for Thanksgiving. His ex wife died one week ago on Thursday. She has been battling bone cancer, was on a course of chemo tx, but tested positive post mortem. </p>
<p>Listed as covid death.</p>
<p>When I hear about it from others or read about it online, there's a seed of doubt. But I have met with and talked with this woman a few months ago. I know and have heard from her children how sick she was.</p>

        <p>How can a blanket diagnosis apply when looking for the primary cause of death? That’s not how autopsies of declarations of death work. </p>
<p>People die while testing positive for herpes all the time but the cause of death doesn’t change to “herpes.” </p>
<p>This is political and its existence has removed all sensible science and medical oath honoring. How can you trust physicians or government officials?</p>
