    <strong>Anders Tegnell deserves credit for sticking to his guns on masks</strong>
    <p><p>Anders Tegnell recently said this about masks. "It's fascinating how few studies there are on this," he said. "And if you look at the countries with a strict rules for wearing masks, it's difficult to see that they have fared well."</p>
<p>And he's right. Many European countries with high mask compliance are experiencing higher death rates than Sweden.</p>
<p>Widespread mask usage was never a great idea. Too many people fiddling with them, not washing them, people wearing them improperly, using them all day which cause them to get wet and nasty etc.</p>
<p>I honestly think widespread mask usage leads to more infection because of these reasons.</p>
<p>Tegnell is probably faced with overwhelming pressure to call for a mask mandate. He deserves praise for allowing the people of Sweden to retain their humanity.</p>

        <p>Exactly on the 'using them all day, thereby getting them wet and nasty' thing. Even in a hospital, they do not wear the same mask 24/7/365. They use disposable masks and throw out the mask at absolute longest every hour!</p>
<p>Even n95 were supposed to be thrown out once you were done with them unless they had replaceable cartridges.</p>

        <p>I'm doing it, and I can't be the only one. You could do it too!</p>
<p>You can get a pack of 20 disposable KN95s on eBay for like 10 dollars. I wear them for maybe a combined eight hours each, throw them out, put on a new one. Since I often spend entire days without leaving the house, I've found this to equate to about 10 dollars per month, which I consider to be a very fair price.</p>
<p>Others of my friends who use cloth masks (which I don't trust) tend to rotate through multiple masks per week (like one mask per day) and then wash them with the rest of their weekly laundry.</p>

        <p>I can agree with that. I mostly like the fabric of our society the way it is, though there's certainly room for improvement in some areas.  The lockdowns and business closures are truly fucked, since the government has completely failed to give us any more money to survive in the absence of jobs.</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's easy, cheap, considerate, and overall good to wear a mask in public until we get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Truly one of life's simple pleasures. Just don't put your mask over your eyes!</p>
<p>Just kidding. I know it's a messed up situation. My thinking is that if we wear masks, we'll get back to a place where we see smiles again sooner, and less of those smiling faces will end up dead. Plus, I bet you get a lot of frowns going around without a mask these days. Although, in fairness, most of those frowns will be covered by masks.</p>

        <p>Well, at least in my State and County, they are locking things down again because the percentage of infected people has crossed their threshold. If we wear masks, the percentage will decline, and the restrictions will ease up again like they did a few months ago. It seems very evident to me, in my area, based on what I've seen, that people stopped taking the masks and stuff as seriously over the past couple of months, and then the virus made its way around and things got worse. Leading to more lockdown stuff.</p>
<p>We all want things to go back to normal as soon as possible. From my perspective, the way that will happen is by wearing masks and taking other precautions to get the percentage of cases down again. Then they'll lighten up the restrictions.</p>
<p>I can see that from your perspective, you'd like to just stop taking any precautions and live normally. I can sympathize with that, but to me, it's not normal for people to be dying either. If wearing a mask and such helps that, then fewer people dying is the more important part of normal for me for the time being, and is also the way to end lockdowns sooner.</p>
<p>You also must realize that, like it or not, the powers that be will keep adding restrictions until we get the percentages down again. You can rebel against it, but it's like shouting at a tornado. You can't beat City Hall. Might be sad, but it's realistic.</p>

        <p>People die every single day and they have been since the beginning of time, COVID isn't anywhere near the worse thing we I have faced.</p>
<p>I know more people who have died of overdoses, suicide, and just plain old drinking themselves to death since this pandemic started than I know people who have died of COVID. The number of my friends including me who have hit the bottle, or started using again is insane, that's a lot harder to come back form than the sniffles. I have two friends that got COVID and they were sick for like 2 days which more often than not is what happens when someone gets COVID. We have been lied to by the media and lives have been ruined</p>

        <p>I feel like we're pretty close to agreeing here, but that might be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The suicides and substance abuse are huge serious problems, but they aren't related to masks. They are related to the lockdowns and the government's absolute failure to provide us with enough money to live. It's a horrorshow for sure.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for lockdowns or business closures, although I do think you need to carefully weigh your mental health vs physical health, and take reasonable precautions, when deciding to go out to bars and restaurants in the current moment.</p>
<p>And I think it is clear that mask wearing helps reduce the percentage of active COVID cases, which is how the powers that be decide whether or not things will be locked down or opened up.</p>
<p>I would also urge you, from a place of compassion, to try and get a hold on the substance and alcohol use. I'm guilty of it, too. But that is one area where we are in control of our own lives, and where we have the power to make ourselves mentally and physically healthier. At least until you let it get ahold of you, then the drug has the power.</p>

        <p>I disagree with you, since I think masks are the solution to lockdowns.</p>
<p>But I can at least understand that you think of masks as a symbol of your oppression, like so many little pieces of flair on Jennifer Aniston at TGI Friday's.</p>
<p>To me, the symbol of this whole mess is a near-empty roll of toilet paper. Panic hoarding seems to represent the worst of people to me, and masks represent compassion and a desire to do something to help.</p>

        <p>The debate on face masks is getting increasingly more pro-mask here in Sweden right now. Contrary to the US it’s the right that’s pushing hard for them, but many Swedes in general are now questioning the fact that we’re basically the only country in the world that doesn’t recommend wearing a mask. Especially since the Royal academy of science now claims that it is a mistake not wearing them. </p>
<p>It’s pretty clear to me that the government has decided on harsher measures without consulting dr Tegnell. My guess is that a mask mandate (or a strong recommendation) is just weeks away, maybe days.</p>

        <p>Well, there goes Sweden then. The last bastion of real science left. Honestly, how can anyone look at what we've done in the past 9 months (mask mandates and lockdowns) and conclude that they work? Everywhere that has done them has not fared well at all, it's not even close.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Swedish people should take a step back and put things into perspective. They can walk outside in their beautiful cities without having to wear a mask as soon as they step foot out the door like I am forced to do. They should appreciate that and not call for stricter measures when they clearly aren't working. They should be thankful for what they have: a free society.</p>

        <p>Very well said.</p>
<p>If masks worked the Swedish people should have been ravaged by the virus the entire time. Instead, they enjoyed a significant period with very few deaths.</p>

        <p>I am surprised their are calls for masks now. Even with the surge you guys are having, it doesn't appear to be as severe as the 2nd wave some of your European neighbors are experiencing.</p>
<p>France, Italy, and Spain are very masked up but still dying from Covid at a higher rate than Sweden</p>
