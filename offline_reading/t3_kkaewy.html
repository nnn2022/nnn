    <strong>Would Everyone Here Feel The Same With H1N1??</strong>
    <p><p>So coronavirus, you want your rights, and 99% are fine, face diapers, and all that. But if your stance based on your true beliefs, or just you current situation? There is nothing preventing another H1N1 as severe as the spanish flu was in 1918. That virus was the opposite of covid though, and weaker older people were fine, and it completely destroyed strong and healthy people. If this was H1N1 like that, and old people were saying the same thing you all are saying, except you were likely to die similar to spanish flu, would you be on her defending them? Serious question. If the answer is yes, then I guess this is just a principle thing, but I find that reallllly hard to believe.</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn't care if this was literally the Black Plague all over again, OP.</p>
<p>The shit that TPTB are putting us through, in the name of our "health" and "safety" is a crime against humanity. And, no, I'm not being hyperbolic. Look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the people who've been economically, psychologically, and socially destroyed by the lockdowns and other measures for our own "safety." Not even counting all of the suicides and drug/alcohol abuse resulting from the above</li>
<li>Millions of people in huge portions of the developing world literally starving to death (or soon will be) because their trading partners decided to commit economic suicide because of a cold virus with a \~99.8% fatality rate</li>
<li>The massive expansion in tyrannical measures implemented by governments, in the name of "protecting" us from the 'rona; it's like the post-9/11 periods on steroids</li>
<li>The fact that how these "countermeasures" have been carried could literally be defined as torture by Amnesty International's criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>And fucking tell me that it's NOT a crime against humanity.</p>

        <p>I'm not disputing what you are saying. It seems many people are basing their opinion on their personal risk though. I get the argument the cure can't be worse than the virus itself. I just don't know if everyone saying that would be saying it if 300k 15-30 year olds were dead right now. On the other hand it's crazy to say people can't earn a living, and watching small business being destroyed while huge companies are eating their lunch is disgusting to watch.</p>

        <p>I'm picturing a scenario where an old teacher walks into a high school. Says I'm not wearing a mask, is coughing sneezing, and like 10 teenagers die. I don't see that being viewed the same as car crashes. Or do you think in that H1N1 scenario young people would literally shelter in place? I just can't see people being ok with others endangering others if young people were dying like that.</p>

        <p>I don't really know what people would do and I don't really care. If they're so worried, it should be their own prerogative and duty to do their own risk and cost-benefit analysis and take measures they see fit. Not have Daddy Government impose one-size-fits-all bullshit that may even make things worse than they need to be.</p>

        <p>Face masks do almost nothing, and in some instances they promote the spread of pathogens.</p>
<p>The wearing of Face masks also has too many drawbacks on a psychological level. </p>
<p>Viruses are a nature-type problem, in the same category of weather and earthquakes and people should be aware yes, but ultimately the decision for managing personal health should belong to the individual, not the government.</p>
<p>Anyone who feels particularly as risk (or your children or someone you are the primary caretaker of) can take as many precautions as they wish, especially in this era where we can expect quick home delivery of essential items. Assessment should be made by each individual to determine what activities they are willing to do that may put them at risk. </p>
<p>Anyone who is not concerned about the risks may go about their daily lives as normal. They of course cannot enter the homes of those who are choosing to quarantine themselves. </p>
<p>Bottom line: whether any virus is a risk and what we do about that risk is a choice we should make individually. Our government is not our caretakers, they are our societal rights protectors, that‚Äôs all.</p>
<p>So to answer your question: Yes I would still be here defending anyone who believes the risk of a catching a virus is not worth staying home and hiding from it. Young or old, healthy or not. (In the case of people who need a caretaker, such as children and the mentally handicapped, then the caretaker would make the decision)</p>

        <p>Fair enough. I disagree on masks though. If everyone could magically wear good masks for a few weeks if there was supply(n95), the pandemic would end. I would sacrifice a month of wearing those masks to end the pandemic even though it would feel like an overreach.</p>

        <p>Sick people need to isolate, and shouldn't be mixing with non covid patients at medical facilities. No need to wear on your home, but you obviously can't have people outside your household enter. It's not going to happen, but it could work in theory.</p>

        <p>H1n1 is a bad example. There was a scare 10 years ago, lead by the who and fauci. Superfluous testing, rushed vaccine, etc. The world didn't end then either. It's not clear that the proverbial captain trips of plagues exists with our current behavior and technology. Not that anything necessarily precludes that possibility, but the chances may be so low that it's not remotely likely to ever actually happen.</p>

        <p>The 2009 version didn't do much, but the 1918 was H1N1 as well. It seems like it all depends on the combo of bird/swine on how deadly it gets. No one wants to hear it, but covid actually is somewhat weak in terms of the damage a pandemic could do in terms of deaths.</p>

        <p>I would be interested to read a real assessment of how well our current medicine and treatments would handle that exact strain. Our treatment abilities are better across the board, but would that matter? It's not clear to me how much control we actually have over these outcomes. I like to believe that without the media hype, it would be much worse than another bad flu season, but that's not based on much.</p>

        <p>Good question. You'd think it would be better but who knows. It killed young healthy people because of the cytokine storm and not sure if anything helps with that. Do we think knowing what we know now, would people actually isolate and distance? I think unlikely.</p>

        <p>" There is nothing preventing another H1N1 as severe as the spanish flu was in 1918 "<br>
Except swine flu and spanish flu were both vaccine hoaxes perpetrated by the same people who lie about the coronavirus.</p>
