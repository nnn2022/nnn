    <strong>Weird thing happening on TV shows across the spectrum</strong>
    <p><p>Long time lurker here who felt compelled to post. This could just be an odd coincidence, but I've been noticing an interesting trend that tells me that perhaps all hope is not lost. </p>
<p>I have a semi-permanent schedule change at work so am home during the weekdays a little more. While I sew, I leave the TV on to "keep me company". As long as the show isn't complete garbage (which rules out most daytime basic cable stuff imo), I flip through and half watch shows.</p>
<p>Here's the point though : across various networks, I continue to see shows that are either showing a character resisting an authoritarian system or about how civilizations before us fell under dictators.</p>
<p>PBS, which bizarrely kept glitching, showed an episode of Rick Steven's travel show explaining a brief play-by-play of the Nazi regime. On a different channel, another show called "Mankind : The Story of All of Us" had more talk of fascism and its hold over societies across timelines. Just now, I watched an entire episode of Law and Order about a group that was anti government overreach. The one actor, Denis O'hare, gave quite a moving example of how governments have slowly removed our rights.</p>
<p>Is this all a kind of strange subliminal messaging? I mean, I know these stations are owned by the same corporations, but maybe somewhere in all this, there are people who are trying to help the many who don't see through the dumpster fire that is the two party system? What's really going on?</p></p>

        <p>No, I think it has to do with the election. Subliminal messaging of "orange man fascist" and what will happen to you if you elect him.</p>

        <p>Honestly, maybe it's just that you're noticing this type of media more because you're already thinking in those terms yourself.</p>

        <p>Maybe relevant.</p>
<p>This video which I posted about maybe two weeks ago has a very dystopian glitch.  Watch for the “glitch” at around the 1:50 second mark.  Start watching from maybe 1:00 onward to get the real effect.</p>
