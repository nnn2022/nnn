    <strong>Flipping the "You're Selfish" / "Don't Care About Others." Argument.</strong>
    <p><p>FYI: I am a healthy 18 year old with no comorbidities that got symptomatic COVID , verified though a test, and WILL NOT be getting a vaccine.</p>
<p>I have been noticing an increasing number of vaccine outreach in my area and would like to share my experiences. </p>
<p>Outreach (O): Hi, how is you day going? Have you been vaccinated?
Me: No.
O: Well, we are providing free vaccinations and I am here to answer any concerns you have. 
Me: I already got COVID and as you can see I am young and healthy.
O: We really don't have any information on how effective natural infection is at preventing COVID or the Delta variant. 
Me: Their are numerous studies on this (Cleveland Clinic, the UK study, and the Nature one). They all show reinfection is really low in some cases below some approved vaccines.
O: I understand your concerns but don't you want more protection? Vaccines give you that.
Me: No, I have a job and don't want to feel like I have the flu for two the three days. 
O: I understand that reservation, however getting the vaccine may help this community and even save others. That is a good thing, right? 
Me: Listen, if YOU really care about others go to the bank and take out $5000 to give to me after I take the vaccine. If YOU care so much about others, isn't $2000 worth it? Just give me $2000 for pain and suffering of the vaccine side effects.
O: Thank You, have a good day!</p></p>

<p>Participating in a mass gene therapy experiment for an easily preventable and treatable, low lethality illness is NOT altruistic, it’s reckless and potentially dangerous</p>

        <p>It's not just selfish.  It's immoral and unethical to force injections or any drug on somebody.  I would make an exception to those who are an immediate threat to themselves and those around them.</p>
<p>I think the big deception is trying to make unvaccinated seem like an immediate threat even though there isn't anything supporting that position other than emotion.</p>
