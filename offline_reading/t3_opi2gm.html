    <strong>The Biggest Lie Big Pharma, Corporate Journos, and their lackeys tell</strong>
    <p><p>Is that my decison not to take the shot effects them in any way.  The COVID shots do not prevent OR reduce your changes of catching COVID or spreading COVID!  This is straight from the "vaccine" trials.  All it does is reduce your chance of developing serious COVID symptoms.  Definitionally that makes is NOT a vaccine, but that is a different conversation.</p>
<p>Remember the "95% effective" claim?</p>
<p>&rt; this was based upon relative risk reduction. That is the declared percentage difference between the vaccinated group’s 8/18310 chance (0.044%) of developing COVID 19 against a 162/18319 (0.88%) chance of COVID 19 symptoms without the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;It should be noted this only refers to an alleged reduction of COVID 19 symptoms among those who have the virus. The tested endpoints do not demonstrate that the vaccine will either reduce the spread of infection or save lives. It should also be noted that these figures suggest the threat from COVID 19 is vanishingly small.</p>

<p>&rt;Using Pfizer’s figures, the relative risk reduction is 100(1 – (0.044/0.88)). Which is 95%. Voila!</p>

        <p>If it reduces the risk of symptoms, and therefore it reduces the risk of spread, they would have to admit that asymptomatic spread is extremely unlikely. If they did that, their mask mandates and mandatory social distancing would go out the window.</p>
