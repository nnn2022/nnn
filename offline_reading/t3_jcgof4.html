        <p>I own a bar and some of our staff tested positive (no symptoms, they are just idiots who went and got tested because they were told to). As a result we've now had to close the bar for 2 weeks and it is already on the ropes after being closed for months. I will not be funding it with anymore of my own money (I have another, well paid and secure job) so if it runs out of cash, we will close permanently. I would say it is likely to happen unless things improve before Christmas (December is usually our busiest month, lots of Christmas parties etc.).  To be honest I'm pretty sure it will go under. </p>
<p>The business was profitable last year and we'd been open for 4 years, we put a lot of hard work into refurbishment and making the business profitable and it sucks to see all of that go to waste - I will have lost a very significant six figure sum of money if the bar goes under.  I never took a penny out of the business and reinvested last years profit plus paid staff bonuses.  I know I'm in a better situation than a lot of people, since I do not rely on it for income and personally I will still be OK financially, but it really sucks. I can tell the staff know and are upset as well.</p>

        <p>I didnt have a brick and mortar business, but I can tell you that now is not a good time to be in the student travel industry.</p>
<p>I ran a little agency booking European itineraries for US university groups. As you can imagine, things were a bit slow this year.</p>
