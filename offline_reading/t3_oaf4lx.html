    <strong>Mental health for us and our open eyes</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôm happy to not be a sheep but wow, ignorance is bliss isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs hard to live amongst a community that is so blind to the truth. How are you all keeping sane? I‚Äôve kind of taken a step back from all of this and stopped checking the news and even updates on this sub. Basically just gets me frustrated every time. Have just been reminding myself that it‚Äôs not healthy to worry about what i can‚Äôt control. It‚Äôs also just hard to love and see the best in everyone when everyone is being so incompetent. How are you all feeling and how are you coping? It may just be me feeling all of this in a bit of an inflated way due to my anxiety so i wanted to check in with the rest of you. </p>
<p>I live in Ontario by the way so I‚Äôm surrounded by a dense population of sheep unfortunately (including family and significant other). Will be escaping to a red state soon enough.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, it isn't that bad when you can sort of distance yourself from all the craziness. I mean, it does suck that the atmosphere in bars is real weird nowadays, but on the other hand, grabbing a case of beer and having people over for a BBQ is way more cost effective, so there's always a bright side lol. You should come over to Italy, man. You'll see how that's done üòÇ</p>

        <p>People need community. It's why subs like this are important for those of us who are being treated like crazies just because we don't subscribe to the majority view.</p>
<p>But we need offline community as well as online. I mean that's one of the things that is so insidious about the "new normal" and the "great reset", the way they want to keep us indoors so we are forced to have most of our interactions online.</p>
<p>I'm finding myself spending more time online because my friends in real life have all gone deep into the vaccine narrative, even to the extent that they're distrustful and wary of me and my partner cos we're not vaxxed. It's not even that all of them are scared we could be "infectious" (although one person told me that they're worried about that). Most of them are just suspicious of us now because they think we've become strange and crazy., and this is solely because we don't want to get vaccinated with the experimental covid shots.</p>
<p>So that's forcing me to spend more time online, and I feel like that's ironic, because that whole digitisation/virtualisation/simulation of everything is a big part of the problem, I think. Humans are meant to have fresh air, live life out in the world. We're also meant to interact with each other in physical places.</p>

        <p>I agree. Pretty much lost all friends over the last year with the exception of my girlfriend but probably better to not have those kinds of people around me. Hard to find like-minded individuals where I live.</p>

        <p>Same, I don't really talk about it much to anyone. And so far, no one has forced the vaccine narrative. Technically, my country is leaving it to social shaming, and encouragement through incentives, it may change in the future, but that's a problem for another time. Mostly and the sheep are convinced they'll get their freedoms back or they'll be able to travel. I have stayed away other than telling them to ask me to get when it does open, but mostly trying to not argue with them. </p>
<p>But for the most part, I have a small community centered on what's happening since NNN doesn't really focus that much on it. </p>
<p>And I've limited my visits to no more than twice per day, so that I can get some sleep and not feel dread. </p>
<p>And just focus on work, life and just myself where I try to make strides in the things I care about. </p>
<p>And third, getting to a stage of independence, and having some secret stash of food, other currencies, essentials somewhere. And if things get worse, an idea of where to go.</p>

        <p>i don‚Äôt really have any reason to prove myself to you so i don‚Äôt care if you believe me or not, however i will say i do lean one way - not nearly as far as most. really important to me to think critically and question everything regardless of if it fits your beliefs or not. in fact, i actually try to convince myself of the opposite of my opinion to make sure it really is worthy. a practice i think would be useful to many to have opinions that are better researched and truly have value.</p>
