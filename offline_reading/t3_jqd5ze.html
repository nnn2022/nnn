        <p>It's great to see but the problem I have with protests is it doesn't take much for things to get violent which in turn plays into the governments hands. If things get really bad up and down the country, it will allow the mainstream media to whip up hysteria and give governments an excuse to pass laws and impose marshall law. Once that happens I fear it will be a permanent thing.</p>
<p>I've said it before, the only way stop this, is non compliance by the millions. Small businesses open up. Everyone do their shopping without a mask. Just go about their lives as if there are no lockdowns and rules.</p>
<p>Protests are good, but violence (just like in this video) will play into the governments hands.</p>

<p>I did this for the first time today. I'm terrified of confrontation but no-one said anything. It was so much easier to remember everything I needed and get it all quickly while being able to breathe properly! I know it's a tiny victory but I'm really glad I did it and hopefully will never wear one again. Someone on this sub said something about being in conflict with others being easier than being in conflict with yourself, and I think that's really true. When you go against your firm beliefs to conform to society's norms, it puts you at such unease with yourself. I felt some of that unease lift today :)</p>

        <p>That's great to hear! You will find that once you stop wearing a mask, other people will see you and soon follow. You have planted a seed in peoples mind.</p>
<p>I guarantee you most people now only wear them because they are afraid of confrontation and want to conform. It's these people we need to step up and stop complying to this nonsense. </p>
<p>I was in Tesco the other day and saw some guy in a suit with what looked like a welders visor on his head not even covering his face. I just wanted to say "mate, just take it off, obviously you no longer believe the bullshit, stop complying to this madness". </p>
<p>It's like people just want to be seen complying even though they find the whole thing crazy.</p>

        <p>People are too scared to open their businesses because the police are making an example of anyone who tries to stay open. Been following a gym on Instagram that stayed open- about 8 police showed up at her door, she was held in custody for 30 hours and strip searched plus the police keep harassing her and sheâ€™s being charged + fined. I honestly donâ€™t think most people will stay open after seeing what happens to those who do.</p>
<p>I agree though, violence isnâ€™t the way</p>

        <p>If enough businesses open up it will create a knock on effect. If people supported those businesses and carried on as normal by the millions, not much can be done. You can't fine and jail millions. It would show governments have no real power because we have the numbers. </p>
<p>There is a very good reason governments have moved the goalposts constantly because they know if they said to everyone their plans from the start, instantly you would get mass non compliance. Many business owners would not comply because they know that would destroy their business if they did comply. Instead they have been dripfed bullshit and will now lose their businesses.</p>
<p>Either way, once the riots, looting and violence starts the government can and will pass laws to have the military of the streets , which is what I think they want anyways.</p>
