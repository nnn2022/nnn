    <strong>The bans are rolling in...</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't commented on anything in here in a while. I left a comment this morning on a video of some police <em>harassing</em> an elderly man by slamming him into a police vehicle in Australia (not resisting) for not wearing a mask <strong><em>OUTDOORS</em></strong><em>.</em> In the past hour, I've been banned from over a dozen subs for: </p>
<p><em>"...participating in activity on No New Normal, which is known for being a disease vector to other subreddits and society. Responding to this message with anything other than a promise to avoid that subreddit will be ignored and is consent for us to mute you."</em> </p>
<p>They all say the same thing, pure copypasta.</p>
<p>This is a violation of basic human rights, regardless of what borders you live in. What's to be done about silencing free speech and critical thinking? This definitely sounds like "<strong><em>BrIgAdInG"</em></strong> and I believe goes against Reddit's own policies.</p>
<p>Out of all the violence, the sexual perversions, the lies, and livelihoods lost because of all of what has come to pass in the few years, pushed by the same media tell that tells you to abandon all critical thinking, neighborly love, and self worth, the ^(one thing) that's apparently not acceptable is speaking up against a totalitarian demonic takeover of your basic rights as a human; Arresting you, assaulting you, causing you harm, by the <em>very</em> people, that your OWN tax dollars funded.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</strong></p></p>

        <p>1) Get a VPN
2) Make a new account 
3) Post on the subs you were banned from with a screenshot of what you were given, along with an explanation of why you were banned
4) Convince others to do the same
5) Play a fiddle and watch as Reddit burns</p>
