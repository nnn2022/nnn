        <p>I'll be honest with myself.  If there wasn't such a huge push, marketing campaign, and weirdos screaming at people and acting like it's the end of the world, I would have probably gotten the vaccine by now, or would be willing to if my doctor suggested it.  Right now I'm unnerved by how crazy everyone is acting...</p>
<p>And I'm not antivax, I have every Vax from early childhood/birth, through my military service.  I think vaccines are beneficial.  But this one... it's just weird.</p>

        <p>It's so ironic to me that we have all these people &amp; governments wringing their hands 24/7 about "vaccine hesitancy", when it's so obvious that their own insane marketing campaign/the briberies/all the shaming is exactly what is making people suspicious.</p>

        <p>That’s wrong. Let’s take France for example. In the early pandemic days when the first vaccines were releasing results about 1 in 3 people was willing to take the vaccine. Through lots of government information campaigns this has now increased to about 7 in 10 people. So while the government push surely also scared some people it seemed to have convinced way more people. </p>
<p>Even in US states where they announced lotteries, daily vaccinated the following week doubled after decreasing for weeks. </p>
<p>I get that for you this had the opposite effect but you can’t deny it worked in protecting the majority of people.</p>

        <p>I look at it as - no matter what carrot you dangle in front of people, there will always be some who take it. My main beef - as is the beef of many, many others here &amp; out in the real world too, including some fully vaxed people - is that they are bribing people and using insane pressure tactics to try to link them into taking a medical treatment. A new, only under EUA and therefore classified experimental, medical treatment. </p>
<p>The fact that you don't see these kinds of incentives for, say, healthy eating, exercise, giving blood, etc. is pretty telling when you consider that all of those things have been long-term proven to save lives.</p>

        <p>Didn’t Michelle Obama spend 8 years getting hate fro trying to push a healthier agenda? And then the school meal program that she got through and that was wildly successful for 8 years got altered under the trump admin to allow for much unhealthier food. </p>
<p>So don’t blame the current government for not trying to get people to be healthier. </p>
<p>Also the food industry is way to powerful. The US government is literally in their pocket. They’ll never put out any bill towards healthier eating that’ll actually benefit the public.</p>

        <p>True...and there brings up another issue. Whether it be big food or big pharma, lobbies &amp; corporations control so much of the "narrative" for the world and wield so much power on the public that it's crazy. At the end of the day we are all responsible for our own choices, but it's kind of mind blowing to think about how much money changes hands in order to try to influence those choices.</p>

        <p>Yes it’s completely messed up. I don’t see anything changing without regulations. Like if we say pretty please enough schools are gonna offer better food choices? It’s not a free market because most people can’t just choose to send their kids to another school further away. </p>
<p>Same for tons of other things. Like I love the idea of free market and capitalism but in my mind that’s tons of small businesses competing against each other. Not a handful of mega corporations colluding to fuck over the average American. </p>
<p>For example it’s completely fucked that in many areas there’s only one or two broadband/internet companies. So you’re forced to buy from one of them and they collaborate with each other to jack prices up. That ain’t a free market that’s beneficial. </p>
<p>And they’re too powerful for some new company to come in. Like no one is gonna spend billions to install the infrastructure to compete with at&amp;t and Comcast in rural Wyoming so people are screwed.</p>

        <p>Thanks guys, this thread made my day. I was considered somewhat a conspiracy theorist for a long time on my life. Not because I read blogs or crap on internet but because I dare to question everything, and I look for tangible answers. 
One of the things I kept saying throughout the last year was that the more pressure they put on people, the more aggressive they become with ‘marketing’ the more obvious it will become to even the most resistant parts of still somewhat awake humans. I was the same basically. Knew that a lot, and I mean really a lot of shit is wrong and we’re continuously being deceived. But I still refused to believe my own intuition in the first place. Then I refused to listen to all the sides I could. I resisted my own pull into my own ‘rabbit hole’. I believed way too much what I saw on internet and the media altogether. 2020 helped me realign with myself and my intuition. Since then I know that not just vaccines, also other economic and social agendas are really at play. The most painful one is actually the spiritual one. Myself being more of an atheist than anything else, this was the hardest one to accept and still is. 
TLDR; thank you for starting to question the ‘reality’ around you. Now please, continue to do so and invite as many others as you can. It’s the best for all of us no matter how much we may disagree at any point. We’re in this together wether we like each other or not.</p>

        <p>Indeed, and if I may add to that; keep coming back to the history you already learned at each cycle of declassified documents and then learn again. 
Also learning history which happens to be overwritten, corrupt and false for the most part is not the only way to ‘wake up’. Questioning your own beliefs might be the fast track that leads to discovery of unaltered knowledge or as objective as one can get.</p>

        <p>Well considering the huge anti-vax movement has been rapidly picking up speed lately, it's kind of hard to not get pretty pushy about it, ironically making even <em>more</em> vaccine skeptics in the process.</p>

        <p>Wrong - you’re complaining about the anti vax movement creating more skeptics.</p>
<p>Again, if YOU are vaccinated and “protected” why do you feel the need to pressure others to get it?</p>
<p>Unless you think your vaccine only works if everyone else has it?</p>

        <p>1) Yes, 'plague' was a hyperbole. Still a pandemic nonetheless, and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>2) The fact it's so asymptomatic for the majority is precisely why it managed to spread like it has, and kill whoever was susceptible to the more serious effects.</p>

        <p>If you have preexisting conditions that may cause you to be at high risk of dying from covid, then by all means get the shot. But if the shot makes you far less likely to get sick and or die from covid, there’s no reason to try to force young healthy people (including children and infants) to take a vaccine for a virus that’s less fatal than the flu. </p>
<p>I’m not even anti vaxx at all. I’ve had every shot my doctor recommended since I was a baby. But if you do any kind of research outside of sites like CNN, you’ll see something isn’t quite right about a vaccine that’s been rushed beyond what is even considered close to a proper amount of time for testing, for a virus that’s not nearly as fatal as we were led to believe, not to even mention the fact no one is liable should you experience adverse effects or even death. Think about that before you immediately dismiss anyone who’s skeptical.</p>

        <p>Definitely. </p>
<p>But no promising treatments yet? A vaccine being hailed as the single greatest achievement of the century… but no treatment for those suffering from the virus right now? Like nothing… 17 months in… all the greatest scientists and enlightened minds on the planet and there is no treatment or even an emphasis on it? Or have I glossed over something? Corona viruses have existed for some time right? Sincerely asking… like you don’t find it strange that it’s even pushed for or addressed or discussed as much as vaccines… but shouldn’t it? </p>
<p>So we know old age and genetic abnormalities are a factor in covid death tolls… but western culture has a massive obesity epidemic. Why is that not considered or addressed in main stream media? Too touchy? </p>
<p>I’m aware it’s been funded and many healthcare professionals stress a need for healthier lifestyles but I vaguely remember the obamas trying to revamp the school food system but to no avail… can you remember why? Doesn’t that upset you? </p>
<p>Mal nutrition, lifestyle habits, envionrmental factors, access to healthcare all plays a part too, no? </p>
<p>7 to 8 million die a year to air pollution yearly as well… </p>
<p>The virus is real. The virus is dangerous. That is a fact. </p>
<p>But do you ever think past that one narrative. Does it not make you think of everything else that exasperates the covid pandemic that never gets talked about… </p>
<p>Like poorer demographics. We know they’ll be hit the hardest… they subsist on a diet primarily focused on tasty, high processed, high sugar and fat, easy to make and cheap foods to balance a working lifestyle… usually both parents or partners have to work these days to get by. This cycle continues until… maybe your in 50s and or 60s… so then you develope health conplications and then rely on western medicine, and or surgeries, and therapy’s to get you to that nice age in and around the 80s but with a lower standard of living… now covid comes along and we got a bigger problem. </p>
<p>So we know we have the resources, to make all foods affordable, extremely tasty but most importantly healthy but choose not to… cause profits maybe? </p>
<p>So we’re not raging against the system… instead we blame eachother and take the easy way out…  which are vaccines. Without making any fundamental change that requires lobbyists and big corpa to step up and help humanity. They get away scot free from all of this. </p>
<p>But then I’m a hypocrit. </p>
<p>Everything we have, our cheap household products, clothes, surplus in food, electronics, comes at the expense, misery and exploitation of the entire world around us… that doesn’t make us bad people… it’s just a reality we choose to ignore… a lot of the other half of the world population live in poverty… A rapidly expanding China wants the same lifestyle as those of their western counterparts. Earths resources are finite… this must cause some friction amongst the elites… think of the over fishing in our oceans and agriculture system… the demise of our eco systems and climate in the next 10, 20, 30 years? </p>
<p>Anyway everyone’s a reactionary. No more moderates. Covid is a controversial topic if you think critically about it. And it is a discussion that makes you think of the world more critically. if you listen to other people and not just one single narrative. It’s the beauty of science and one of its pillars is to be questioned. Contrarians are more important then we give em credit for. </p>
<p>A western altruist is almost an oxymoron when you think about it. I can only offer books if your interested in them. Use a library or your local library app and empower yourself… here’s a list of you want to learn more… </p>
<p>The uninhabitable earth - David Wallace wells </p>
<p>How to lie with statistics - Darrell huff </p>
<p>Life span - David Sinclair </p>
<p>Humankind - rutger Bregman </p>
<p>Utopia for realists - Rutger bregman </p>
<p>Homo deus - yuval harari </p>
<p>Guns germs and steel - Jared diamond </p>
<p>How not to die - michael Gregor </p>
<p>Death of expertise - Tom Nichols </p>
<p>The dictators handbook - Bruce bueno. </p>
<p>Breathe - James Nestor</p>
<p>Try and think like a multi billionaire. It’s hard to. 
Here in Ontario Canada lockdowns have caused more deaths due to suicides and drug overdoses amongst the 20 to 50 age demographic than covid has… and that’s straight from the ontariohealth.ca. </p>
<p>I don’t know if this is callous or insenstive… I just think people are overlooking the bigger picture when it comes to covid because it’s most undoubtedly what world leaders and multi billionaires are aware of… </p>
<p>You being totally fine with the idea of multi billionaires being magnanimous altruists is a tough pill to swallow with everything our species is going to have to face in the coming decades… mass automation, climate change, hyperinflation… no layman constantly wants to think about these things cause they’re depressing… but that doesn’t make them any less real… a historians route requires 10 years for hindsight… I can see how this is part of the problem when everyone wants normalcy now… </p>
<p>The topic of covid is not a discussion we can fully flesh out with radom Reddit comments who’s only aim is to prove eachother wrong rather than try to understand each other’s  individual experiences or perspective… its pretty much a full on conversation… </p>
<p>I worked through the pandemic. I live pay check to check… private avaition… you can go through my comment history to see what I’ve experienced but I doubt you’ll do that… and that’s ok… we won’t even get to talk about genetics… which is some really esoteric stuff that science still hasn’t fully figured out… and I think the most enlightened geneticist could tell you that. </p>
<p>Anyway man… I’m just thinking out loud. I know I’m not smart. I’m really really insignificant in this world… but I can ask questions… I question myself all the time… and I really question those that never question themselves.</p>

        <p>You do raise good points, though not really countering the need for mass vaccination. I agree the western world has other long-lasting (?) concerns in need of addressing, but the virus is a global issue, hitting globally, highly contagious. This globalized world that requires constant flow of people and goods throughout the globe, demands immunization so it can return to normal, so funds are focused on the vaccine. As for treatment, I suppose that not as many funds would be directed at treatment development, I assume because of the vaccine works, noone would need treatment in theory, or that by the time it gets developed, everyone would be already immunized; take that as you will.</p>
<p>And yeah, billionaires are a cancer in this world, but right now we have a goal in common: get rid of this pandemic. Reason behind the goal being different for each, survival or profit, but we all still want to get over this.</p>

        <p>Abosoluetly we want to get out of this. But that’s the scariest part… our willful obediance to achieve this without ever so much as havinngba controversial conversation like the one you and I are having right now… and I don’t see it… anywhere… other than the anonymity of online discourse. And unfortunately I have to share this ground with people and lizard beliefs… and words for fools… </p>
<p>Now this is a personal experience… and you can paint me insincere or a liar when I tell it… and that’s ok… but it certainly angered me… and was a turning point in my perspective… I listen to my local news radio station at home quite often… we had the Israel/Arab conflict that happened in the Gaza strip recently (couple weeks back)… so the news declared heavy traffic jams in and out of the city based on the protests of said conflict… but there was also a lockdown protest… close to 2 thousand people walking and clogging the streets over lockdown measures… this undoubtedly had an inpact on traffic reports as well yet there was abosoluetly no mention of it… at that point I didn’t care whether you were a complete covid denialist or a stringent lockdown advocate… news is suppose to be objective… and they choose not to report on it… you can blame it on a notion of public safety… but that’s BS. News is news. whether it’s something you agree with or not. It’s supposed to be objective. </p>
<p>Now I said earlier I believe in the historians route… after reading the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William A Shirer and the Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes I always believed in that notion… of all the history books I’ve ever read I’ve always kept that ideal. </p>
<p>Now I don’t know if you like to read… but I’d rather read a book than some avant guard article or journal on the internet and try to quote that… I have a hard time interpreting things in numbers because I don’t have an analytical mind… history and events are better illustrated to simpletons like myself through story… so what’s the story on covid… we still don’t even know. We don’t Know whether it was lab leaked or zoonotic in nature, gain of function research or benevolent research. There’s no beginning as of yet… and literally no one knows where this is going… but the mere idea that <em>some might</em> know where this is going or even know the full story causes us to vehemently oppose that idea… because it scares us. </p>
<p>but everything I’ve read when it comes to climate change and the impact humans are having on this planet since it’s been introduced to me in grade school decades ago… paints the future in a very bleak and scary way… it could in the next 30 maybe even 20 years that climate change will cause massive suffering on a global scale… and this isn’t even esoteric stuff anymore… it’s quite known and the consensus is pretty steadfast in stating that we are on a collision course of environmental disasters unforeseen and so dire that’s is never before been exoperienced by human beings… yet still we as humans prefer to bury our heads in the sand… whether you think technology will solve our woes… or it’s all a <em>natural</em> influx of global temperatures, etc etc… it doesn’t matter… we’ve been ignoring climatogolists until only the last decade… yet every single one of us still live like kIngs and queens had just over more than 100 years ago… instead of servants we have washing machines, vacuums, cars, electronics, etc… </p>
<p>another billionaire at my work just purchased a new global 7500 private jet… it’s obscene… we’re suppose to be cutting emissions yet I’m watching with my own eyes the rich do the opposite. </p>
<p>the amount of resources and environmental damage it takes just to sustain 10000 dollars of Bitcoin boggles the mind… are you not aware of this? The plight of our planet and how we’re heading there fast… lol and this is common knowledge! </p>
<p>Imagine what the layman knows by just reading books.. now think what government elites know… technocratic elites… think of the projections and trends they are aware of when it comes to our demise regarding climate and the very earth we live on are even more dire and complete in scope. Does this notion escape you? </p>
<p>Rather than drive systematic change… people with the reigns of power would rather choose us infighting amongst ourselves than relinquish any grip on power. Please read that book list I sent you. We literally can’t even change school nutrition choices because of lobbyists and greed. You think any of these things will change after covid. </p>
<p>You think life is priceless? Yes we are taught that but that’s a fallacy in thought. We all have a economic input and output to the state… therefore value <em>is</em> attributed to our life. </p>
<p>Technocratic elites will gladly deminish populations to stave off global climate change and or global conflicts… to not even toy with this possibility is a fallacy in critical thought when your at the bottom looking up. I know I could be wrong… I know I suffer from the dunning Kruger effect… cognitive dissonance… all that shit that makes me realize I’m just a dumb fuck. But I get blasted for just thinking out loud which is crazy… I never told anyone to not get the vaccine… I don’t walk around without a mask… I avoid gatherings… I do my part out of conformity and the plight of others… yet I’m still painted with the same brush as qANoN or magnetic side effects lmao! </p>
<p>But I’m also a realist. In many states and demographics the mere idea of social distancing and mask wearing was met with outright rebellion from leadership positions right down to the people… so what? Forced vaccinations? Medical apartheid? An us vs them mentality already making calls for violence more prominent on media platforms? That’s madness! </p>
<p>Well I can’t speak for everyone. I myself can make risk assessments every day. What am I doing today that will get someone killed? </p>
<p>Remember the Nazis never thought they were wrong… they thought they were doing humanity a favour by genocide and eugenics… can you think like the ultra rich today with the same notion of doing something for the betterment of humanity? </p>
<p>How to lie with statistics by Darrell huff… read it. If they think what they’re doing this for the better good… it makes it that much easier to implement…. hiding a 1 to 2 percent (or even more) death influx under the guise of many statistics… whether it be steriliazation… disease… heart failure… placebo and actual vaccines to stave off climate change and or global conflict in a 10 year period coinciding with what’s already known about climate change and it’s critical impact or resource sustainability in the next 10 to 20 years… you got a fool proof plan going. </p>
<p>Obviously I could be wrong… obviously I could be crazy… I know this… but to not even consider this I think is crazy too. </p>
<p>It’s crazy to think two billionaires of google have made it public knoewledge that theyve invested billions into research to prolong life for individuals to the age of 150 or 200 years of age… that’s not science fiction that’s happening right now… (homo deus) and that’s only one that we know about you can also read (lifespan) where elites are looking at medical technology only affordable to the ultra rich… get your head out of the sand and start reading books… no one in my demographic reads them anymore… and it’s a travesty. </p>
<p>Look at the people who have died from covid so far… I’m not being callous when I say this but it’s dead weight that’s being hit the hardest… the elderly, the obese, the individuals with pre existing conditions… the most resource draining demographics… it’s horrible I know and unfair but that doesn’t make it any less true. </p>
<p>I feel for every medical professional that has to deal with this and doctor who will always have my admiration for what they do… they’re not part of it but could likely be pawns as well. </p>
<p>In the 70s Pfizer had given placebo medication to Africans saying it was medication to cure syphillis when actuality they just wanted to study long term effects of the virus. </p>
<p>Think back in the 70s if you ever said the CIA overthrow South American governments for control and access to the banana republics… you were painted a nut back then… but hey it’s common knowledge now. </p>
<p>So no matter what… in 10 to 15 years some people will die normally due to heart attacks… genetic abonormailites, some will not be able to procreate… all will be buried under varied statistics in order to never create any alarm… people will continue to eat unhealthy nutrition cycles and die from heart disease, diabetes… because ya know who loves a complacent, hive minded populace staying indoors watching Netflix… those in power do. </p>

<p>I’m aware that a ton of stuff in our misinformation age could be the machivillian mechanizations of sleuths, propagandists and shills with only the objective of creating discourse in our efforts to better the world… but that’s strange too… I could give you a list of many doctors… Canadian ones, French ones, American ones that are questioning things… but if they’re all paid off by some shadow entity (be it Russian or Chinese… or right wing whatever the hell you want) then we’re both engaging in conspiracy… maybe their just extremely stupid doctors? Maybe some of them are actually concerned. </p>
<p>1500 certified geneticists in the US. (You can extrapolate further and say virologists, biologists, scientists and researchers have an uncredited understanding of genetics) but How many are non partisan and completely indenpendant… I don’t know? But would the most enlightened geneticist tell you that some aspects of genetics are still not fully understood by science yet? Yet we the layman can be told about and fully understand the rna genetics through a 3 to 10 minute tik tok video about its creation and inplmentation without the mountain of research and nuances regarding this field and how it got to this? </p>
<p>You see I am a conspiracy theorist… but I don’t want anyone to die alone but people do and have and forever will die alone covid or no covid that’s just reality… so if I can live my life like a hermit which I pretty much already did prior to covid… and you want to continue to mask me and social distance from me… so be it… but don’t tell me not to think, explore and learn, question authority, narratives and the overwhelming weight of conformity…  you need contrarians… like I said it’s a pillar to further understand government, sciences, accepted norms, society, economics, philosophy, life, all of it! I’d love a big fat book on genetics… but would I understand it?… and if I don’t… than it’s faith. I’m an atheist btw. </p>
<p>I hate fringe media platforms I got a lot of friends who outright deny covid even exists! I just want transparency and truth… I’m a liberal… and a conservative… where are the moderates?</p>

<p><em>If YOU get vaccinated, then why do you care if people wear masks or not?</em></p>
<p>This is not an original thought, I've seen the question posted and asked everywhere with no logical reply.  I fortunately live in the SE and most people have given up the masks.  I can't imagine traveling to somewhere on the West coast or NYC and having some hypochondriac, government-shill freaking out at the sight of a non-masked person in the age of vaccinations.</p>

        <p>They should be banned unless it’s a pandemic with a legitimate death rate unlike this one which was nearly legitimate, at least for what my opinion of serious pandemics are.  Every individual story is its tragedy when something like this comes along but come on under 1% and 80% of the elderly surviving?  It wasn’t worth all the strain on the world economy to go through with this theater to save a few million.  It was way more humane than any prior world war and people just sucked those up and did it.  We are so feeble in the faces of mortality and control.</p>

        <p>There's no proof that many people died from covid. We weren't testing in the beginning (not that they work). Deaths were diagnosed by symptoms that weren't completely understood at the time. Dr. Birx admitted they were counting the deaths "liberally".</p>

        <p>I'm in NYC and going unmasked every place where it's allowed. I have the vaccine and I believe, still, that it's protective against COVID at a very high rate of efficacy.</p>
<p>So far no one has hassled me. BUT I'm virtually the only one unmasked aside from teenagers and people who look like rabid Trump supporters.</p>
<p>I don't get it. If people believe the science and are left of center then it's over, put the masks away you don't need them. But the sheer wall of people still in masks is a little bit daunting. I do tend to go my own way but I don't want to unnecessarily scare people who are, I guess, really suffering from a lot of fear already.</p>
<p>However, I just don't like masks (they hurt my ears) and I don't want to keep going masked everywhere just because people are irrationally afraid.</p>

        <p>i'm gonna be more harsh and say i'm not vaccinated and idgaf if people are "afraid." i'm afraid of the dark sometimes... does that mean everyone needs to make sure its light out wherever i go with them??? I Mean c'mon how much are we going to compensate for the mentally ill here? Its not even political at this point, people have lost it and i don't feel sorry for them, its their problem and they're projecting their BS onto everyone else.</p>

        <p>There is a logical response if you would listen to the people that probably provided it. It's a common question with an obvious and common answer. Because not everyone that needs the vaccine can get it. While the vaccine will protect you, it will make it harder for you to spread it to our most vulnerable. Maybe the few people you find freaking out, have someone like that in their lives and are concerned for their well being. </p>
<p>Also, unrelated but Desantis has zero chance in a general election. GOP went all in on Trump and killed any chances at a republican president for awhile. Democrats aren't making a big deal about it because the probably are ok with the GOP digging it's own grave. They are making their voters lose trust in our democratic system so less and less will waste time voting. Doesn't bother democratic voters though. Plus he's pushed through multiple laws lately that are very anti conservative that scream of government over reach.</p>

        <p>&rt; not everyone that needs the vaccine can get it</p>
<p>That's some straight up bullshit.  There's a concern that vaccines are going bad because the demand has dropped off.  We are literally trying to find countries that need them since we have no demand.  This is not a supply issue.</p>
<p>Also...if the "vulnerable" are getting vaccinated, and they are by all accounts, then why should I?</p>
<p>You're either misinformed or are spreading blatant falsehoods.  Get fucked.</p>

        <p>There are lots getting it that maybe shouldn't.  I know a few that have epi pens and got it anyways and some with autoimmune disease and a couple of cancer patients.  I have a friend that has 2 toddlers, no one without a vaccine is allowed to see them but if I said I don't want to be around your unvaccinated kids I would definitely be the bad guy.</p>

        <p>The reason they want everyone vaccinated is to protect those vulnerable who cannot get the vaccine. Granted that number is probably close to the number of people who legitimately can't wear a mask. So I don't know.
I would really like if people could just be respectful whether they are for or against the vaccine.</p>

        <p>A big issue for me personally is the whole emergency use authorization. If there are working medical treatments against covid, they can’t have emergency use authorization. It’s only allowed if it’s the only thing available. I know people here would agree, but I don’t think it’s a controversial take to say multi billion dollar pharma companies would suppress information for a huge payout. If it comes out officially that the treatments we’ve heard about are effective, then the vaccines would have to be approved by the fda, and while I do think that will come eventually, who the fuck knows. What if it never comes? What if this was just a massive scam? Suppress working medicine, make a fuck ton of vaccine and get as many people to take it as possible in the shortest amount of time. I just don’t see the reason to rush. The fact that you can get fired from your job because you won’t take a not fda approved vaccine for a not very deadly disease is insanely worrying, and I fear for the future.</p>

        <p>I needed gas for my lawnmower today.  The closest gas station required a mask to come inside to prepay.  I told them to fuck off. </p>
<p>Then I proceeded to drive another couple miles and paid slightly more per gallon for my gas just to give my business to a gas station not run by cultists.</p>

        <p>The biggest Covidiot that I have ran into was a woman who had already had it.  Prior to it, she would just scowl, afterwards she was so crazy that she attempted to stop me from attending to my child’s medical emergency.</p>
<p>The second biggest one was in a Doctor’s office (secretary, not a medical professional) who made the medical decision that we didn’t need to see the doctor, and that natural immunity wasn’t real.  If our problem had been worse, or if it had just been me, she would have required force to remove us.</p>

        <p>I wanted to post this here since Ive never seen anyone else make this comparison. For anyone familiar with trends in gaming in recent years, they'll know what I mean when I say the vaccine is essentially an early access vaccine. With the two safety information systems being used to collect information on side effects, the people who've chosen to get it without FDA approval are essentially part of the vaccine's study. They've even waived away their right to sue for liability. The people who've gotten it and then try to force it on others seem to not realize that they are volunteers.</p>

        <p>My wife and I are both vaccinated, but we are both older, and all vaccines are less effective among older people.  In April, three people died and more got sick in a senior living facility when an unvaccinated worker brought Covid to the facility.</p>
<p>Also, my wife has multiple myeloma and has had two stem cell transplants [auto and allo] which decrease your vaccine response.  So, while she is vaccinated, her oncologist says that she may or may not have anyt immunity.</p>
<p>So, we still mask when we go out.  It doesn't seem like a big deal to me to wear a mask.  We are not intending to be sending a message to anyone.  We just want to be careful.</p>

        <p>You are using the face covering as it should have been used all along: as an indication to others to stay away. Masked people should be avoided as much as possible by strangers, because they either have something they don't wish to spread to others, or they are more likely to suffer severe symptoms to mild illness that others may be carrying.</p>

        <p>The vaccine currently helps against getting symptoms of the disease (aka, getting sick) but it isn't confirmed how good it is at preventing carrying or transmitting the virus. So a vaccinated person may still carry the virus without getting sick for all we know.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes you are. The idea that how people decide to act moving forward after getting the vaccine somehow makes the vaccine less effective is the stupidest thing you could possibly suggest. But considering this subs track record I’m not surprised.</p>

        <p>I think most people who mask up after getting the vaccine just don’t want to be confused with being thought of as a Republican. </p>

<p>4- I’ve been going places since April including Disney World and Puerto Rico so I have no idea what you’re talking about</p>

        <p>You don't need to trust that we've gotten the vaccine. You have a 95% chance of immunity and a .1% chance of death even if the 5% were to happen. And on top of that it's YOUR choice. Sounds like a win/win. Get the vaccine and shut up.</p>

        <p>Post-vaccine you can still get and carry the virus and spread it to others, which is reason enough for normal reasonable people who care about others to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>No, the point is that once everyone gets the vaccine, the immunity of the population as a whole will increase, thus massively reducing the chances of Covid occuring and spreading, and thus eventually eradicating the virus altogether.</p>
<p>Right now, the time is for caution, because all we need is that extra 2-3 months after which everything should get back to mask less and normal</p>

<p>If you can still get/spread covid after being vaccinated then the vaccine doesn't work. And masks absolutely do nothing g to stop airborne viruses.

        <p>If you really want to wade into these waters we can. There are obviously diminishing returns as to what an individual can do. It takes basically no effort for me to wear a mask. It takes considerably more effort to wear three at once for obvious reasons. I could be safer and wear a hermetically-sealed suit, but I don't. Is this acceptable to you? Or does it have to be all or nothing in your simple black-and-white absolutist mind?</p>

        <p>You seem to be under the mistaken impression that I think that preserving life must be done at all cost.</p>
<p>I'm sure you can think of a few reasons without my help. But here's a simple one. Three masks requires thrice the production. 300 people with 70% reduced chance of spreading Covid is better than 100 people with 90% reduced chance and 200 people with 0% reduced chance.</p>
<p>Wearing a single mask is absolutely a reasonable thing to do if you aren't an alarmist fruitcake who sees government agents under your bed at night.</p>

        <p>&rt; I'll wear a mask for as long as it's proven to be helpful</p>
<p>So far every study and from Fauci to CDC says its NOT helpful. Unless you consider <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/mit-researchers-say-youre-no-safer-from-covid-indoors-at-6-feet-or-60-feet-in-new-study.html">MIT to be anti-mask?</a></p>
<p>&rt;i.e. if and when Covid is gone (no thanks to anti-mask/anti-vax/anti-lockdown morons) I'll stop wearing it.</p>
<p>If these anti-covids arent getting jabs, they're probably aren't getting tested either. </p>
<p>So why are you loyal covidians fucking up so bad? 🤔</p>
<p>But I mean, I get it, you're from the UK and obedience to authority is in your blood.</p>
<p>I heard UK restriction lifts are delayed because of a "delta" variant now. 😂</p>
<p>Enjoy your perpetual slavery.</p>

<p>It's just (not so) common sense. Bad enough that it's more deadly than seasonal flu. It's also capable of causing debilitating, life-altering effects i.e. long Covid. I know people who are still feeling significant after effects of having Covid 8 months later, even although they "survived" i.e. it didn't kill them. You'd have to be stupid to be so cavalier about the risk of contracting such a virus.</p>
<p>&rt; I haven’t wore a mask. Not have I gotten the vaccine. And I won’t. I have literally been doing the same exact thing I’ve always done. If not more during the entire “pandemic” lockdowns? Nah. I just went to work.</p>
<p>Which makes you an irresponsible and selfish person. Nobody is perfect, everyone is selfish. But my selfishness doesn't extend so far as to put others' lives and health at risk because I want to be a rebel. Apparently yours does.</p>
<p>&rt; Just go out and enjoy life. Turn off the tv. And relax.</p>
<p>Just go out and spread Covid. Turn off the ventilators. And ignore the death and disease you cause.</p>

<p>He's going to have to show some data that suggests that any of these measures (including masks) saved lives.</p>
<p>The last time the CDC ran the numbers, before California caught up with Florida, masks were responsible for at most a 2% reduction in deaths. Since that study California and Florida are equal in terms of deaths per 100,000, meaning masks are responsible for no reduction.</p>

        <p>&rt;Bad enough that it's more deadly than seasonal flu. It's also capable of causing debilitating, life-altering effects i.e. long Covid. I know people who are still feeling significant after effects of having Covid 8 months later, even although they "survived" i.e. it didn't kill them. </p>
<p>Ivermectin can not only prevent/treat severe covid, it also cures "long covid". HCQ and zinc is also excellent. </p>
<p>Stop fearmongering when we have effective treatments/cures.</p>

        <p>The flu has been doing that shit for a hundred years.  Masks can actually INCREASE your chance of getting bacterial pneumonia which can cause long term and permanent lung damage.</p>
<p>Funny how the flu, pneumonia, and masks don't scare you but the 'rona does.</p>

        <p>I do respect you for replying respectfully. Thanks for that. But I go as far to not even believe the numbers about Covid. I am convinced that the numbers are manipulated. People dying with Covid are counted as Covid deaths. Even if Covid isn’t what killed them. </p>

        <p>Agreed it's difficult to have a meaningful conversation on public forums, particularly echo-chambers such as this sub-reddit.</p>
<p>For me the numbers aren't the point. Whether it's 3million+ dead, or 6 million, or 2 million, it doesn't make a difference as far as my actions are concerned. People are unnecessarily dying, or suffering chronic health issues, and taking precautions such as wearing a mask, avoiding crowds particularly indoors, getting vaccinated, is helping to mitigate that. </p>
<p>I know people who have had, and continue to suffer, from Covid. I also have friends who've had family die from it. That's more than enough for me to take it seriously.</p>
<p>It takes basically no effort for me to wear a mask, so why wouldn't I? It's a mask, not mind control.</p>
<p>The real irony of this anti-mask slavery/mind-control position is that the same people who hold this position no doubt have phones, or tablets, or PCs etc. which know far more about them and have much more control over their behaviour than a simple mask does, yet they aren't kicking up a fuss about that. Out of sight out of mind. I think half of them just lead very boring lives and love to have an excuse to act out.</p>

        <p>Vaccine shedding has always been a thing.  It wasn’t new with covid.  Look it up.  They don’t let recently vaccinated people even for regular things like polio (if vaccinated within 8 weeks) into ICU wards in a lot of hospitals for risk of shedding.  The risk is small but it is there. </p>

<p>Vaccine shedding is not a belief that "the vaccine itself can make other people sick because they're breathing on them." It is the belief that the viruses transmitted through the vaccination process can reproduce or be spread to others. It is a rare occurrence. Prior to 2020, it was considered a myth or conspiracy theory by the AAV community.</p>

        <p>You mean calling people brainlets is not insulting?  And shedding is a known issue way before covid but most here are not worried about that, more like all the other potential issues for a very low risk virus (unless you obese or diabetic, which is also why it affected seniors since most are).<br>

        <p>Before 2020 is was a weakened virus that would be shed. Now it's a spike protine that has ten times the serious side effects. A jab has billions of mRNA strands that build billions of spike protines. Shedding shouldn't have anywhere near that. It's probably fine, but the reproductive/  hormonal/ pharemone reports from women spending time around the vaccinated are still somewhat troubling, to me anyways.</p>

        <p>Like authority figures have never lied to anyone before. Or they did but somehow they’ve all turned into saints in the last year or so. It’s your job to question people in authority when you live in a democracy so if that’s not your thing then maybe move to China, you’ll love it.</p>

        <p>Ahh I guess a few bad apples really do ruin the bunch. </p>
<p>Instead of using the authorities past lies as a way to discern in the future when the authorities are lying and telling the truth, you want to see it as “the authorities have lied before and thus every future action or demand must be based on lies as well”.</p>

        <p>As a Jew, do not fucking compare this slight inconvenience of wearing a mask or getting a vaccine to the mass murder and gassing of my ancestors. It's deplorable. </p>
<p>And before the vax people were still comparing a piece of cloth on your face as being the same as the literal holocaust. </p>
<p>My ancestors literally got genocided, Jews carry immense generational trauma from this. Don't compare this shit to an actual genocide, it's so pathetic and sheltered. </p>
<p>Sorry you're never experienced a slight inconvenience in your life, I guess anything that's slightly bad is the fucking Holocaust. </p>
<p>Absolutely deplorable, where is your humanity?</p>

        <p>About 245 years ago a group of political geniuses got together and formed a new theory on government. That theory is that government is inherently abusive and needs to be held in check by the people and the law, and people in general are competent enough to govern themselves. Distrust of expanding government power is a vital aspect of that theory.</p>
<p>The idea that you or AOC are better fit to reform government than that group of literally historic minds is example 1(a) of illusory superiority and delusions of grandeur.</p>
