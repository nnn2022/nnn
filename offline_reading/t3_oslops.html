    <strong>Possible covid? Please read</strong>
    <p><p>So I just came back from one week vacation, spent in a country house, inhabited by me and my family only.
We only left the house for groceries and my family is totally obsessed with desinfecting everything (groceries included). Everyone jabbed (mom &amp; dad double jabbed, sister and her husband have 1 jab for now) but me and my boyfriend (which have not been jabbed at all).
I have rhinosinusitis and went on vacation with 3 negative tests, done on different days. We were all tested before leaving for holiday, all negative.</p>
<p>At the second day there (19th July) I was having a fever, dog like coughing, clogged nose and all that. Went to the hospital, tested there again (with a negative result) and after 4 hours in an isolated room, I was diagnosed with bronchitis, very close to pneumonia. I started on antibiotics and this sort of asthma pump. At this point, everyone was ok and no symptoms. </p>
<p>Fast forward to the last day of vacation: 23rd July. My sister starts having same symptoms as I. My mom as well. </p>
<p>Today (27th) my mum is diagnosed with one otitis in each ear. Doctor tells her the situation is currently a huge mess, lots of weird Covid symptoms being reported in the urgency rooms, and they are not sure if she has anything else theyâ€™re not detecting - it might be Covid. All of us are to be contacted by our family medical practitioner in order to get a prescription for a PCR test (god knows when, as this is Portugal). All tests we have done so far were antigen tests.</p>
<p>I have finished the medication and still donâ€™t feel 100%. Still runny nose and ALWAYS tired. Like there is an elephant on my chest.
What the fuck is going on? Anyone with similar stories?</p></p>

        <p>My point exactly. I went inside the hospital for an x ray - everything empty. 
I waited for 4 hours in a box dumpster though, as it was another busy day at the urgency room ðŸ™„ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>Don't let them put you on a vent.... that's the killer.  My whole family had Covid, everyone survived, even my 94 year old grandma.  </p>
<p>My wife said her inhaler was the game changer.  For me it was similar to a flu (except the headache, smell and taste loss.)</p>
<p>I'm so happy I had it. I understand the fear, because I was also afraid.   If you are not very obese or have other serious illnesses  you'll be fine.</p>
<p>I know a handful of people that have had it and didn't get a positive test result.... notnsure why.</p>
<p>I'm not vaxed.... and NEVER WILL BE.  Having survived it only 3 people WORLD WIDE have died of reinfection.  Not encouraging anyone to get it.... but if you have and survived, you're good</p>

        <p>So many tests all saying negative and yet they are hell bent on trying to prove it is covid. </p>
<p>Remember, we have had our immune systems squashed lately. Especially if you family is obsessed with disinfecting everything. So anything we do pick up is going to hit us harder than it usually would. </p>
<p>As with any other viral infection. Ride it out. Think nothing more of it, unless it gets to the point you feel you need medical intervention, then go for that. </p>
<p>Whether it is covid or not, it makes absolutely no difference. All it would do is prove the tests are forking useless.</p>

        <p>Not being a dick but you probably gave yourself an infection by re-using the same mask over and over, like most of us do.</p>
<p>It's a really unhealthy thing to do. On the other hand, a brand new mask probably has loose fibers that aren't healthy either.</p>
