    <strong>An Antidote for the Great Reset has been revealed.</strong>
    <p><p>Last week a family member sent me a link to this website:</p>
<p><a href="https://awarriorcalls.com/home">A Warrior Calls</a></p>
<p>The guy behind it, Christopher James, is a Canadian who has discovered the power of <a href="https://awarriorcalls.com/common-law/">Common Law</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it's this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Law is the law God created that applies to every man and woman. This is not a religious statement and certainly is not restricted to a specific creed or group of people. It's a matter of fact of all human and natural life.</li>
<li>The most simple statement of Common Law is this: <strong>“DO NO WRONG OR HARM” [TRESPASS]</strong></li>
<li>Governments (aka. service corporations) and the people who make up the agencies/forces that answer to them cannot create <strong>Laws</strong>. They can only create policies, codes, rules, statutes, mandates, decrees, orders, restrictions, threats... you get the idea. They may call their legal fictions "laws" but they aren't truly laws. Only God makes laws. "Legality" is inferior to (and therefore irrelevant) to Laws. "Legal" and "illegal" do not apply to you: a living, breathing human being. They have no power over you (unless you willingly submit and surrender to them, which you should never do). Only what is Lawful and Unlawful apply to you.</li>
<li>There is a short yet <a href="https://awarriorcalls.com/core-words/">powerful set of Core Words</a> to learn and know. Read them, they are invaluable.</li>
<li>Service Corporations (governments and their agencies) have been very successful in deceiving almost every human being to believe that their legal fictions are Law and that they have power over people. They hope that you never learn and apply this new knowledge, <em>especially en masse</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a theory or a wacky idea. It has already been proven and is currently in use. Christopher has real, relevant, and recent (very recent) examples of this working (winning). He has assisted people who are being damaged by these mandates (which are all based on the complete lie about a pandemic). He has published videos and documents showing the Lawful responses he has assisted to create. You can see them on his website.</p>
<p>Christopher lives in Canada. He is mainly helping people in Canada and America. However, there are people all over the world discovering and waking up to the information Christopher is bringing forward. This is not country specific. It applies to everyone, everywhere. <strong>It applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>But, it's not necessarily easy to benefit from this. The other side (bad guys) have been creating, perfecting, and protecting their enslavement systems for thousands of years. The roots of this go way, way back. Babylon. Rome. England. It's ultimately all about enslavement vs freedom. In order for this to work you must be courageous, resilient, and persistent. You must apply the Common Law continuously against the intimidation and threats of violence you will receive from the bad guys until they fold. This will be easier if you don't do it alone. You need help. You need friends. You need allies.</p>
<p>What is happening this year is them "pulling the pin" and going on full scale attack. To put it simply, their objective is to enslave you or kill you. Whichever comes first. If you think deeply and long enough about this and see all the common sense evidence around you, you will realize that my statement is true.</p>
<p>Some people have described what is coming as "neo-serfdom". The masses are serfs (indentured servants with little to no ownership of anything, including their own body autonomy), dominated by a super tiny elite that are 1% of 1% of 1% (maybe even less than that) using technology to track all movement, conversations, sentiment, commerce... everything... and dissenters controlled by violence (directly: police, military, gangs, assassins; indirectly: restricted from participating in normal life activities such as travel, socializing, entering businesses unless complying with masking, vaccines, and shutting down access to bank accounts [when all cash is abolished and everyone <em>only</em> has digital money]).</p>
<p><strong>God made us free. Men made us slaves.</strong></p>
<p>This is exactly what the Bible prophesies about in Revelations. "No man shall buy or sell unless he has the mark of the beast". The thing that makes a lot of people doubt all this, though, is the fact that the slavery, serfdom, and violence is not blatantly obvious everywhere you look. Meaning: you are not currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>living in a prison or internment camp,</li>
<li>getting beaten daily,</li>
<li>living in squalor,</li>
<li>starving to death,</li>
<li>threatened with death, getting "disappeared", or corporal punishment for dissenting or breaking rules,</li>
<li>and all the other hallmarks of blatant despotic tyranny and dictatorship.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tyrants got smart. They used to make you live in mud and shit, beat you, murder you, force you to go to war, give them most of what you produced, have sex with your wife, etc... all out in the open. Eventually the peasants would burn down the castle and cut off the kings head.</p>
<p>They realized they needed to enslave you with more cunning and use technology as a force multiplier. They have made a gilded cage for you that is just comfortable enough that you don't revolt. You still have bread and circuses to keep you fat, distracted, and indifferent. You still have the illusion of choice in media, and in electing who will perform the will and the agenda of the head tyrants (all government officials at the top of each government are 100% controlled, <em>do not be deceived</em>). You still get to buy iPhones and drive cars. In order to get to <em>their</em> 'utopia' of neo-serfdom the changes have to be gradual, slow, and always justified by the propaganda (ie. "New Normal") so that the changes are accepted. They are building a house, one brick at a time. They make it taboo to resist or question or even wonder about it by getting others to shame you.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> while we still live in a 'relatively' polite society (which we still do, all things considered), then we have a chance of using Common Law to defeat the lies and 'legal violence' being perpetrated upon us, We The People. When life shifts from polite society to barbarism (The Law of the Jungle), then everything changes. Common Law doesn't cease to exist, of course, but if the other person is swinging an axe at you or shooting at you (etc), then you're not going to be worried about paperwork (Lawful, legal, or otherwise). Remember: just because there are violent protests and riots happening more and more does <em>not</em> mean that barbarism is in control yet. For the most part, most of us reading this can still walk outside our homes and sleep in our beds without the constant fear of imminent attack, kidnapping, or death. I am personally grateful for this blessing and shall do all I can to protect this freedom and fight to recover <em>all</em> the freedoms that have been stolen.</p>
<p>For now, while you still can, educate yourself on this Common Law <strong>with haste.</strong> Share this message with everyone who will listen, especially those who find themselves being hit with fines, lockdowns, quarantine, and restrictions that are killing their businesses and ability to work and make money to live.</p>
<p>Pray for strength and protection for yourself, your family, your neighbours, your community, your city, your country, and all people in this world. Pray for the blindness and fear that is enslaving the minds of men and women to be defeated and replaced with seeing the truth and the courage to stand up and fight. Pray for your heart to be filled with patience, love, and compassion.</p>
<p>God Bless you.</p></p>

        <p>I didn't read it through - but just a heads-up that in law and political science "common law" refers to something quite different - law derived from custom and judicial precedent (as contrasted with statutory law). What you are calling "common law" seems to be what is normally called "natural law" in political science, philosophy, and religion.</p>
<p>I thought you might want to know to avoid confusion. Shalom.</p>

<p>You're right, the site isn't super easy to follow. I'm learning what I can from it. So far I've gained the most value from watching his videos on Bitchute.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being polite and asking for information.  So rare on Reddit. </p>
<p>On the subject of Natural Rights I would go to the sources.  John Locke, Thomas Paine.   For more current writings (but not really current) There are classic liberals like Frederick Hayek and Milton Friedman.  More economic thinkers, but the main concern is freedom.  Hayek's <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> is a classic as is Friedman's <em>Capitalism and Freedom.</em></p>

        <p>I second chasonreddit's suggestions. Locke's "Second Treatise On Civil Government" (or something like that), Thomas Paine's "Common Sense". I also recommend Judge Andrew Napolitano's first two books (but not his later books). You could also check out the utilitarians (John Stuart Mill is one) - I'm not sure which (if any) of them believe in natural law though.</p>

        <p>Yeah so this is just another take on the 'Sovereign Citizen' movement. Sorry, it's been done before, and it's not real or effective. It's more of a wannabe religion than anything else - people think using language and legal terms in some special way can magically prevent the authorities from coming down on them. Again, it doesn't work.</p>

        <p>Lawyers and judges have a certain established way of going about things. There is no magical cosmic force which COMPELS them to treat an outsider, an amateur representing themselves, invoking a bunch of ancient common law gobbledegook, fairly.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe for something like a traffic ticket, they'll just roll their eyes and humor you, but for anything more serious than that - say, a national lockdown? - they are going to treat somebody trying to apply this stuff the same way they would a mad hobo off the street. They will dismiss whatever shit you're trying to pull in a courtroom with extreme prejudice. It will not go anywhere, and they will not humor you. My ex-wife made a minor clerical error trying to DIY our divorce years ago, and they rejected the whole document without even looking at it. They don't have time for this shit.</p>
<p>For example, have you heard anything about these shutdowns being successfully challenged in such a way? Have you heard of any 'sovereign citizens' getting a free pass to conduct their business or walk around without a mask while everyone else wears theirs? Surely they could just reference the correct set of case precedents in a court of law and they'd be on their way, and we could all follow in their footsteps ... right?</p>
<p>All law is a set of conventions created by human beings. It's applied and enforced by human beings, in a way customary to whatever era and culture they live in. Deciding that you've come across some "God-given" laws (as OP was claiming) and being able to apply them everywhere, willy-nilly, no matter what the present-day judges and lawyers think, is batshit insane. They spent huge amounts of time and money on their education and careers and consider themselves utterly superior to people who self-educate on the Internet, or from old books. They will not suffer fools - neither gladly, nor at all.</p>

        <p>Personally? I believe simple mass civil disobedience MIGHT work, but it's a problem of coordination. How do you get the message out when all the main centralized websites will shut down any groups urging people to violate local/state/national ordinances? Particularly trying to organize in-person protests on a given day, far enough out to make sure enough people know about it and show up?</p>
<p>Even if some people show up, the news media will either ignore it or go hard attempting to discredit everybody present as lunatics or evil (claim it's violent / racist 'supremacists' etc).</p>
<p>It's a tricky problem and I don't have any answers. And even this particular subreddit won't be around much longer, either, if reddit's past behavior is any indication.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be wrong about all that, but they're just the trends I've seen. We can't be naive and pretend they're not going to play dirty, because they hold most of the cards.</p>

        <p>You bring up good points. The lack of coordination is a big weakness. It's what makes the ants vulnerable to the grasshoppers. It doesn't matter that there are billions of us vs thousands of them when they keep the mindset weak and the conversations misdirected by media.</p>
<p>And that's why I mentioned the 'Law of Jungle', which is what they could turn to as a last resort. If people did actually coordinate and millions marched to topple a capital, they would bring out the big guns (DEWs for example) and start melting people on the spot.</p>

        <p>This is just sovereign citizen/Freeman on the Land and it's going to <em>kill</em> opposition to everything going on. It has no bearing on anything. If you've declared yourself outside of the court system, you're outside of society, and so guess what? It doesn't matter. The country that you reside within has power over you regardless. You do not get to invoke some magic words based on a technicality in the Magna Carta and then suddenly not pay taxes. </p>
<p>Let's bring this idea to its logical conclusion: someone rapes you. Now, what is the "Common Law" recourse here? Who enforces... what exactly? Do we 'do no harm' to this rapist? </p>
<p>The worst part about this is that the term "Common Law" refers to the Western legal system that is both as anathema to the "Sovereign Citizen" as well as the best protection. It means <em>precedent</em>, and it's why none of this applies. We do not live in a society, in the west, of legal technicalities, it is in fact the opposite where precedent in fact defines and refines existing core law. </p>
<p>Your birth certificate is not somehow money. You are not a 'corporation' registered to the government. None of this is real. Canada is a Dominion that has laid claim to the land, not a service corporation, and if you are spouting this type of thing, at best you're now considered to be a nationless vagrant.</p>
<p>This is a fantasy--more specifically, it's a LARP of the end result of a revolution without violence, as if we already overthrew the bad guys, and we won. It doesn't work like this. The cops do not give a shit if you 'enter into a contract' with them, they have every right to haul your ass away, and the courts back them up.</p>
<p>This is not the way. The way ought to be through the courts, but well, they've been furloughed. It may need to go another way none of us want to, but if the courts fail, that's the only option.</p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for taking the time to respond.</p>
<p>I am still learning this, very new at it all, so again, I appreciate what you are saying. I do not live in a fantasy of believing this automatically and easily fixes everything. Of course not.</p>
<p>However there are powers in words, as our adversaries know. Everything starts with words and then moves into actions.</p>
<p>The "way it ought to be" isn't particularly useful, as you've mentioned. The courts are a battlefield designed for you and I to lose.</p>

        <p>Look man, I get it. I'm pretty active in the anti lockdown community and my wife is the town witch. I know MANY people like you who have these same <em>hopes</em>, but that's all they are. I really don't want to be mean here, but so many are taken in by this. It has its origins in more or less pyramid scheme 'classes' that ostensibly teach you how to invoke certain magic words that people studying law somehow didn't know about. </p>
<p>&rt;However there are powers in words, as our adversaries know. Everything starts with words and then moves into actions.</p>
<p>What actions? We're just back to where we started. These concepts hold no validity in court, they are philisophical at best, but also unworkable. </p>
<p>Let's say I open up a town and that town legitimately needs taxes to survive. 90% of people living in the town pay taxes, but 10% refuse, yet enjoy the amenities OF those taxes.... and why should they? </p>
<p>&rt;What way do you think is the way it will go?</p>
<p>I think that if constitutional challenges do not utterly destroy everything going on, we're on the path to tyranny and that'll need to be met with force.</p>

        <p>Sovereign Citizen movement is not new and was "discovered" by this con man OP credits it too lol! This nonsense is not just false and ignorant information it is downright dangerous if any gullible individuals actually try to use this nonsense in any disputes with police or in court...the law is very real and whether or not you agree with that or "recognize" the "corporate business that is government" they recognize you and you can be forcibly subjected to the laws of the State. Please do not allow ridiculous bullshit to cloud the fight we have ahead of us...like ive been saying we really need to do something about all these conspiracy nutters and right wing "patriots" who making our logical distrust of the elites in power and skepticism of draconian lockdown and mask measures look more and more like an excuse for spreading long disproven and highly nonsensical conspiracies and incite useful idiots to break the law without a clear plan or path forward. Time to grow up and leave the childish "good vs evil" view in thr religious arena...it has no place in the political one. Fight with facts, counter studies and empirical proof of our position and disobey the authorities where it makes sense do so.</p>

        <p>Haha! "It's my first day!" ;)</p>
<p>Seriously though, I don't know what the gold fringe means. I've heard it mentioned that it's significant but haven't researched it yet.</p>
<p>Can you bring me up to speed?</p>

<p>I cannot, but I do know it figures extensively in the FotL mythology.  Something to do with admiralty law.  It's one of the trappings that make the magic words work when you're in court. </p>
<p>It's all bullshit.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing this!! You are spot on and this very important information. For those interested in diving deeper into common law, I highly recommend the podcast of Crrow777. He has been doing amazing work on this topic.</p>

<p>No, this is the first time I've heard of it. I am Canadian, but don't live in Canada anymore.</p>
<p>I just went to their website and read the Proclamation. I have been aware for a long time about the slavery and murder perpetrated for centuries by the British Crown and the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the only real salve for all this is God's Word. The Truth. They (the bad guys) can kill us, break natural laws, and oppress people... but they can never defeat God's Word. They absolutely have nothing to do with God because they are a death cult that worships Satan, and pretends to worship God.</p>
