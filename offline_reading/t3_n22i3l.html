    <strong>"I'm not anti vax just anti covid vax"</strong>
    <p><p>If you believe the vaccine companies would knowingly harm you with their covid vax, why would you trust them on anything at all?</p></p>

        <p>That’s the only thing, not everything is one and the same. I truly don’t know how to feel in regards to other vaccines. I, like many other people, was injected with multiple vaccines in infancy. To my knowledge I’m quite fine. Those shots however had already been in use decades before I was born in the 90’s. Inoculation has been around for a very long time. Our body does have natural defenses built in to fight off nature’s afflictions. To my understanding however, these particular vaccines work in a different manner than previously known vaccines. I truly don’t know where I am in the middle of this all, but I do know that I don’t trust these new generation of vaccines for myself or anyone else I love. I know a lot of people who had COVID, and they were all fine. I smoked after every single one of them and I turned out to be fine. Funny thing is though, several people I know got sicker with the vaccine than they did with COVID.  Companies like Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have shown to not care about people in the past, as well as the government. I truly believe what going on now is different.</p>

        <p>Yeah I personally do trust vaccines because they have been around for a very long time but just like you I think that this new vaccine just hasn't been tested enough and we don't even know about long-term complications yet. Had covid as well didn't even knew cause it was just like a regular flu infection where you're just tired. Didn't even knew it was covid until afterwards. Vaccines from companies we have here where I live already caused multiple issues but the media just doesn't show it but continues with their propaganda and how the vaccine is completely safe even tho many people already died to it.</p>

        <p>I don’t trust them since trump, but i took/take vaccines/meds as a calculated risk. with “covid “, just like every other seasonal flu, there is no benefit, there is only risk.</p>
