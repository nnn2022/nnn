    <strong>Has NYC Reached Herd Immunity?</strong>
    <p><p>According to the New York Times on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html">August 19, 2020:</a></p>
<p>&rt;New York City on Tuesday released more than <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-testing.page">1.46 million coronavirus antibody test results</a>. Across the city, more than 27 percent of those tested had positive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibody-testing.html">antibody results</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown">research</a> out of Sweden released August 18, 2020:</p>
<p>&rt;Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.”</p>
<p>If this holds true, then 54% of people in NYC have developed T-cell immunity. Combined with the unknown rate of innate immunity, this places it deep into herd immunity territory, as is shown by the flatlined new case rate.</p></p>

        <p>Take a look at <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page">their graphs</a> and decide for yourself.  (Scroll down a bit and you can see NYC's cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over time.)</p>
<p>Do you think deaths dropped from almost 600 / day to almost zero in a city of 8+ million people living on top of one another, because (a) they've reached herd immunity; or (b) they all suddenly got serious about wearing shitty cloth face masks and "social distancing"?</p>

<p>July 20, 2020:</p>
<p>&rt;"But scientists have also recently discovered that some people can test negative for antibodies against Covid-19 and positive for T cells that can identify the virus. This has led to suspicions that some level of immunity against the disease might be <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1.abstract"><strong>twice as common as was previously thought</strong></a>."</p>

<p>12 August, 2020</p>
<p>&rt;"Health experts predicted that 40% of the population in the capital, Stockholm, would have developed antibodies to the disease by May.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"The actual figure was 17%, according to a review of evidence.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, found that 17% of people tested in April in Stockholm had developed antibodies.</p>
<p>So, they had already reported that covid specific T-cell immunity was present in twice the amount of people showing antibody presence and they just forgot it in a few weeks.</p>
