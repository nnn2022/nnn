        <p>P.S to anyone that doesn't realise how fart huffing and micro-managing the mods of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lockdownskepticism/">r/lockdownskepticism</a> have become, remember that beyond nuking comments that point out the most basic political elements of the lockdowns or even just openly talk about which party is zealously pushing for them, they also removed this post:</p>
<p>citing: "Thanks for posting. This piece isn't really relevant to the task of expressing a skeptical position toward lockdowns. If there is a component that you think makes sense for this sub, can you try to isolate it and re-submit? Feel free to reach out by modmail if you think this message is in error."</p>
<p>Apparently this news has nothing to do with lockdowns.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I knew that sub was going to shit when you'd see the mods nuke comments in an article about a democrat politician enacting harsh measures and the top comment they'd leave un touched would be "GUYZ don't make it political! This isn't a left right thing!". They seem to micromanage posts so much, I'd get my post removed and see them accept 2 other posts on the same thing but written in a masturbatory tryhard academic tone as if they were writing  a paper, then the mods put their special "HIGH QUALITY ESSAY DOOT DOOT" flair on it.  </p>
<p>Someone even mentioned the LDS have their own private whatsapp group or something, it's honestly sad, the sub was a great haven in Spring and Summer but since it's the biggest anti-lockdown hub and becoming more mainstream it seems the mods have become pretentious.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even more lol worthy, in another post they didn't nuke comments of people talking about being socialist and saying "comrade".. The commenters proceeded to say the "anti-lockdown movement is filled with nazis and racists and they need to bu work together to increase their numbers"... I go over to /r/lockdowncriticalleft and find that  one of the top posts is basic purity/ tone policing talking about "too many transphobe lockdown skeptics" and just dumb fracturing because they haven't learned anything. But they still act shocked there is no serious left-wing anti-lockdown community in the USA, that's why.</p>

        <p>whenever leftists get their filthy hands on something nice, it ALWAYS turns to shit. especially online. once they begin meeting the demand of the mob crowd and start condemning people they deem "transphobic", (and of course their definition of transphobic being someone who questions mental illness at someone wanting to split their dick in half) it's like piranhas smelling blood in the water. </p>
<p>by that action, they know they have a useful idiot in the mod staff who is weak and will capitulate to their demands, and in doing so, you've basically announced to the mafia that everything in your house is free for the taking, and they will take it all and they won't even say thank you. NEVER capitulate to leftists. always, always stand firm no matter how wrong you are, always be the first to accuse them for everything no matter how ridiculous, always keep them on the defensive. just look at chick fil a when they stopped giving to the electric Jesus charities. did they say thank you? or did they bring them back into the fold? fuck no! people still condemn them to this day.</p>

        <p>I kind of have to agree with this not really being related to lockdown skepticism. Why? Because the man could of died of ANY cause and those people would of still rioted because it was a  black man that died in police custody.</p>
<p>I bet you if it was a white man that died in police custody, we wouldn't even be hearing about this.</p>

        <p>I'm very happy with the moderation and overall effort to maintain a high standard on r/lockdownscepticism, but isn't this at least as relevant as the articles on English enforcement, some focused on specific policing incidents, that have been allowed? One focused on the death itself would be better, though.</p>
<p>Both subs somewhat inevitably skew right, there isn't much of a left to counterbalance it, after all.</p>

        <p>Looks like the Big Tech social media censorship platforms are going to be awfully busy banning all of these "insurrectionists and terrorists" denouncing their governments all over the world and "inciting violence" and protests. It's time to start fact checking these platforms and making sure their ambiguous ToS are being equally enforced worldwide.</p>

        <p>If Belgium is like most European monarchies these days, the king has very little political power and has a mostly ceremonial role. I don’t see why they’re organizing aggression against him. Although what makes matters worse here is that the person who died in police custody was black.</p>

        <p>My point is that the anger is misdirected. The person with the most political power in a constitutional monarchy is the prime minister. If people are unhappy with what the government is doing, they need to blame the prime minister over the king</p>

        <p>It's not "misdirected". The things they are angry about are police brutality and, more recently, police going power crazy with their new found power enforcing lockdown measures.</p>

        <p>That’s just not true since the prime asshole minister reports to the king. And not a informal report kind of deal but the king literally stands above the government in any kind of monarchy around the world.</p>
