    <strong>"in order to get through this, we have to be we, instead of me" is wrong on so many different levels.</strong>
    <p><p>firstly the phrase insinuates that individuals on their own are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. that they, when left without state or collective control, will always violate and mess with others. as if everyone is a idiotic karen unless they are a "team player".</p>
<p>secondly, this says that the will of others, the collective will, is a moral good. that your purpose is to serve the decision of others. if a random group of people think you should wear a mask, you have to because other people decide what's right. ironically, the people telling you to close your business or wear a mask are the selfish ones, they are making you conform to their wants and they tell you that your a good person for doing so. </p>
<p>when you put these things together you get the ideology of the corona obsessed masses; that you are a selfish person if you do anything that the state or collective deems to be wrong. even if you open a business and allow people who are willing to take the risk to enter, and nobody who does not consent is put at risk, if its illegal, your doing something wrong. and they use the leverage of the extremely small risk of death to pin you down. as if by letting people into your store who are willing to take the risk somehow kills someone's grandparents. </p>
<p>next the phrase clearly tries to state that the coronavirus is something actively occurring and nowhere near its end. as if were in a tight situation and we still have to look for the light at the end of the tunnel. if you look at the real risk of death, hospitalization, etc. as well as the cases (not including false positives) you will find that the corona virus is an issue, but it poses a risk to very few people and should be kept in mind, but not in the forefront of society.</p></p>

        <p>Honest question not trying to start an argument just ignorant to this. Why is mask wearing mandatory if this infection has a 99.96% survival rate among confirmed cases? I mean if that's the case then shouldn't we have been wearing masks every single flu season, shouldn't we have been shutting down the whole country then? Why was Covid-19 so different?</p>
