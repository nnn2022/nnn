    <strong>Can anyone explain stats to me like I’m dumb?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s so hard to find information that makes any sense. But perhaps someone here who is smarter than me can help me out. These questions might sound so basic, but please bear with me. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the actual difference between “cases” and positive test results? Are they not the same thing? Or is there more to “cases” than that? In my understanding, if you have a “case” of something, that means it’s progressed into a sickness, right? But some people will test positive and never be sick. Or they will test positive one day and negative the next. And I can’t imagine testers are really following up with people who test positive to see if they develop sickness? Or are they? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they say cases are rising by however many thousands per day, does that mean that they are getting that many thousands of new positive test results PER DAY? I live in a big city, and of course I don’t see everything happening all the time. But the testing centers I have driven by don’t ever look like anyone is there. So I don’t see how every day there are like 8,000 people getting tested? Every day? That’s a lot of people. How is this information calculated? It just seems really out there and one of the many reasons I’m having a very hard time thinking any part of this whole thing is legitimate. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m seriously trying to understand why some of my family and friends are still so scared. And why everything that makes life worth living is illegal. </p>
<p>I’ve been relying on my own observations, which are showing that no one is sick. I know a total of two people (kind of like, peripheral friends?) who have gotten it and were sick at home but are now fine. Also, I’ve been traveling all over the country for work all summer and fall and I have not gotten sick nor have any of the people I work with. I’ve also hugged and shared food and drinks with every friend that I can and no one is sick. Just nothing makes sense.</p></p>
