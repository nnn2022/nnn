    <strong>A news article from the year 2023</strong>
    <p><p><em>Sacramento, Calif</em>. – Governor Gavin Newsom announced a lifting of certain restrictions for vaccinated persons.  Beginning June 15, 2023, individuals that have received their fifth vaccination will only be required to wear three masks in public.  Currently, all individuals must be triple masked, wear goggles and must wear an anal plug.  Those who have yet to receive the fifth vaccination will still be required to wear goggles and an anal plug, in addition to triple masks while both outside and inside all times.   The California Department of Public Health announced it will continue to verify compliance with the mandate by setting up screening areas at entrances to essential businesses, parks, and other public places.  Fifth-vaccinated individuals will be required to present their vaccine passport or will need to submit to a physical and/or visual inspection of their anal cavity.  Governor Newson reiterated the importance of preventing the spread of COVID-19 through fluctuance.   “Chinese researchers have found that over 95% of spread is via the release of air through the anal cavity or what’s commonly known as farting,” Newsom said.  The Los Angeles County Health Department announced it will still require goggles and anal plugs for all individuals irrespective of vaccine status.  “Despite not having any cases within the last 6 months in Los Angeles County, we cannot let up now,” the Department said.  California has reported 12 cases within the last 14 days, all of which occurred in San Francisco County.   In other news, Dr. Anthony Fauci is arriving to San Francisco after attending multiple closed-door meetings in Beijing on Thursday to begin his coronation ceremony.  The ceremony has been advertised as the “event of the century” and will attended by various celebrities and politicians including his majesty King Cuomo I and General Secretary Gretchen Whitmer.  The event will be mask and social distancing free, and Governor Newsom has defended the event saying that all attendees and staff will have received a new sixth vaccine which Fauci has described as a “game changer”.   Governor Newsom stresses that despite celebrations all Californians should stay home during the ceremony and reminds that in San Francisco it is illegal to leave your home without permission from the health department. Newsom and Fauci will share almost unlimited legislative power as the California Legislature dissolved itself last year and transferred powers to Newsom due to the virus.  Newsom has promised to return the emergency powers and hold elections “as soon as the virus is contained” which Fauci has estimated as soon as a 10th or 11th vaccine is developed.</p></p>

        <p>IDK if Cuomo, Newsom and Whitmer are vaccinated.</p>
<p>But, given that Fauci has access to the real information about the vaccines, I can't imagine that he's vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Reminds me of when I saw Jello Biafra speak at a college. Smoke machines filled the front of the auditorium as Jello walked on stage in steam punk goggles and big trench coat.. “The year is 2023 and Governer Newsom…”</p>
<p>I don’t remember if that exactly what he said, but this post reminded me of that. Wonder how he’s doing now.</p>
