    <strong>Where are all the doomers buying up all the vitamin D?</strong>
    <p><p>Vitamin D was well known for providing protection against viral infections even before covid hit the scene, and if you look you can easily find scientific research showing that vitamin D reduces the chances of contracting covid and the severity of it if you do. Basically, almost everyone who suffered serious effects from covid was deficient in vitamin D.</p>
<p>The people who have spent the last 14-15 months living in terror of contracting covid have eagerly gone to all kinds of lengths to adjust their lives accordingly: staying home, minimizing contact with other people, wearing multiple masks, and getting experimental vaccines at the first opportunity. Many of them are even insisting that they'll continue wearing masks after it is no longer required (and they're vaccinated) just because they are that damn petrified of this virus. </p>
<p>So here's my question: Are they popping vitamin D supplements like candy? Surely they are, since it'll further help improve their odds of not catching or dying from covid.</p></p>

        <p>My kids are grown now.  But when they were in school they dragged home every possible virus, and it seemed like my wife and I got sicker than they did.  I was eating a reasonably healthy diet (but with exceptions like <em>way</em> too much sugar/soda), and not doing anything really punishing to my body.  Nevertheless I'd get seriously sick a few times every winter - laying miserable on the couch for 2-3 days sick - and several colds of varying severity.</p>
<p>About 9 years ago I stumbled onto an article on Dr. Mercola's website (currently being actively suppressed) about Vitamin D.  I was a little bit skeptical, but he laid it all out in readable form, and cited a long list of studies.  So I went and read several of those studies, and the abstracts of several more.  It checked out.  I figured I'd try it.  As long as I didn't overuse it, and got a blood level check occasionally, there would be no harm in it.  So, as per his recommendations, I started taking 5000IU daily in the sunny months, 10000IU in the winter months.  Also, a reasonable amount of Vitamin C.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the next winter, I hardly got sick at all.  Yeah, I'd get the sniffles for a couple of days, or I'd feel something coming on a bit harder so I'd take extra C, drink a big mug of chamomile tea so I could sleep, and flop into bed... 90% recovered the next day.</p>
<p>This has been true for all the winters since then.  Some years, an especially virulent flu would cause me to miss a day of work.  I wouldn't evangelize, but if anyone asked, I'd share my experience.  A number of people started doing the same after I told them about it. Others repeated the pharma quote back to me, "vitamins are useless, all they do is give you expensive urine."  Fine, suit yourself.</p>
<p>When people got freaked by the cooovids I tried to convince them to take D, that they'd be much less at risk, but it mostly fell on deaf ears.  I got mocked once, when there was an uptick of deaths in another country, "huh I guess they didn't get their vitamin D, haha".  Some started taking it after I shared links to studies showing that most dead covid patients had extremely low D levels. But they still thought it wouldn't save them, and were waiting for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Those that thought I was grasping at straws to save myself from covid, got quiet when I said I've been using D for almost a decade.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience. I used to get bad colds several times a year, even in the summer. And they'd last for like two weeks, sometimes even worse. Eventually, sometime in the last ten years, I started taking a selection of vitamins, supplements, and foods, such as vitamins D and C, elderberry, garlic, and ginger, every time I'd feel a cold coming on. I rarely get colds now (long before the masking and social distancing), and when I do, they're mild and short-lived. I'm in generally worse health than I was when I was younger, but much much better at fighting of respiratory infections, that's for sure. So when people dismiss vitamins, it just sounds so ignorant to me. I know for a fact that vitamins help.</p>

        <p>I went to a small boarding school as a kid. Lots of international kids. Everyone was sick all the time. I remember being sick for an entire winter once.</p>
<p>I told my parents and they gave me vitamin D to take everyday. I never got sick. Even my senior year when 90% the school had swine flu.</p>

        <p>These findings have been confirmed over and over and over again.  You should ask yourself why the media and governments are not regularly reporting this and encouraging people to supplement with vitamin D.  It's such an easy way to prevent infections and deaths.  And it doesn't harm society like mask mandates, lockdowns, and segregation do.  So why hasn't it been publicized?  Why have you never heard about it before now?</p>

        <p>Its just like telling people to eat their veggies. It'll help their immune system. They already do that and while i admit not enough, its not just only specifically vitamin d. I am currently taking vitamin d tablets but for unrelayed reasons. why u say it is not publicized?</p>

        <p>No, I'm not.  You seem to have a lot of trouble finitely the conversation so I'll recap it for you.</p>
<p>Somebody posted info about how people who suffer severe covid have a vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>You kept asking for a link to a source.  I provided you with one.</p>
<p>I then asked you to think about why the media and governments aren't publicizing and promoting the use of vitamin D to help fight covid.</p>
<p>You asked what makes me think they aren't publicizing it.</p>
<p>I said because people like yourself, who think they know everything about covid, have never heard of it.</p>
<p>You said "when did I say I know everything about covid?".</p>
<p>I said, ok then what areas do you feel your knowledge is lacking in and I'll try to help educate you.</p>
<p>You said, no it should be there other way around.</p>
<p>I said, oh, so do you think you know everything about covid?</p>
<p>And now here we are with you trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>I hope that will help you to follow the conversation.</p>
