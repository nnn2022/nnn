    <strong>Question about masks</strong>
    <p><p>Do you guys honestly believe that every medical professional in the world is covering up some big conspiracy about masks? The vast majority of doctors recommend wearing a mask when indoors and in close proximity with other people. If it were actually just some sort of compliance tool, then why would every educated member of the medical community be advocating for it? They can't all be "in" on some conspiracy because that would be tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>Would like to understand why this sub is so convinced that masks are some sort of evil conspiracy.</p></p>

        <p>Before Covid, the CDC, Fauci, and everyone else all said masks did not work against respiratory viruses. You can see archives of the CDC website saying this, Fauci said it in his 60 minutes interview, etc. Suddenly around April 2020 masks were forced everywhere with CDC and others all suddenly promoting it. Now they are suddenly saying to double or triple mask, essentially admitting 1 mask did nothing, or very little all along. There's also plenty of studies from before and during Covid showing masks have little or no effect, the Danish study for example. Overall, the mask thing is extremely sketchy. I think most doctors go along with it in fear of backlash.</p>

        <p>This. I went to my doctor to get a mask exemption to show my local gym who said they required a doctor’s note. I have severe PTSD from an assault and wearing a mask is often impossible for me. My doctor has seen me through my treatment for this and even wrote me out of work on disability for 6 months so I’d have time to heal and focus on treatment. He would not write a mask exemption because the licensing boards had threatened to pull licenses for providers doing so. There was also an issue of liability-if I had gone to the gym with my exemption note and somehow had and spread covid and it was traced to me and he was the one who had written the exemption it was bad bad news. </p>
<p>Plenty of doctors hate this shit and don’t believe it does anything at all but aren’t going to risk their years of expensive schooling and high paying jobs to come out and say so when they’ve been threatened by their superiors. This is what they’re “supposed to do” so most of them shut up and fall in line, the rest are immediately discredited by the larger body and thrown under the bus.</p>

        <p>Ahh a troll, how cute. You won’t-I had covid in March with mild symptoms no worse than a cold. </p>
<p>The panic attacks I experience from mask wearing are far worse than covid ever was and will be for me. Sure hope you aren’t assaulted with your mouth and nose forcibly covered anytime soon and end up unable to wear a mask-I’m sure that’d make your life working in the covid ward real pleasant.</p>

        <p>I dont think moat people here think its some conspiracy. Honestly, its a feel good measure more than anything; a way for people to show that they are making an effort, and good for them.</p>
<p>I think there even may be some circumstances (like people with symptoms including coughing) where it can be very helpful. People have worn masks in public when sick in Japan for a long time now.</p>
<p>However, it is crazy how so many professionals talk about how wearing a mask does not effect the ability to breath when physically exerting oneself, even now saying that breathing recycled air is GOOD for you. Lets tie a sweatshirt around your head and put you on a treadmill and tell me everything is fine.</p>
<p>I dont really care about the masks. They are annoying and gross, but whatever. But the lockdowns? They are terrible, to the point where it is killing people, and not people older than life expectancy.</p>

        <p>I have noticed that before covid, masks weren't recommended during influenza seasons. Also when covid started, there were lots of studies that masks don't work and health officials here in Finland said that "Masks are not recommended for general public". Not sure what changed afterwards when suddenly every country is recommending then. There are still lots of recent studies saying that masks don't work, also there are some studies stating that masks work.  </p>
<p>I personally think that masks might reduce the transmission by very little, i.e. 1% slower transmission if wearing masks. So in theory they might work by slowing this spread but there are also lots of negative effects if you wear mask 24/7. In my opinion they are not the miracle cure for the covid. And definitely they don't justify you to shout to maskless people "Where is your damn mask?!?!?".</p>
