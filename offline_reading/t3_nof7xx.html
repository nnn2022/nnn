    <strong>Compassion for those who have been vaxxed</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, I want to congratulate all the deep-thinkers, you are amazing to have made it this far in doing what you believe is right for you and society at large. </p>
<p>I also want to encourage us all to be compassionate to those who have taken the vaxx. It must be really terrifying for some to see how the situation evolves regarding vaccine effects and ever lasting restrictions. I recall when I had a treatment that I was reacting to, I would constantly seek out information to confirm that I was ok and that it was Infact normal or beneficial. Despite the cruelty that has been carried out between groups, the one thing we cannot deny is that we are all in a momentous period of our lives and we are living it out all together. </p>
<p>Stand up for what you believe in, forgive your neighbors when they become fearful, be true and strong. You got this. </p>

        <p>I have no compassion for those who want me dead. If/when they die from the vax, I won't bring myself to their level and rub it in, but I will have no sympathy for those who willingly took it and bragged about it. I'll reserve my sympathy for those who took it not because they wanted to but because they were pressured significantly enough to feel they had no other choice so kids forced by their parents or people in nursing homes forced to take it by the staff, etc.</p>

        <p>I understand. Death or harm should not be wished upon anybody. It is the lowest level that a human can reach. Manipulation is strongest when an individual is isolated, literally, isolation will make a human go to horrific lengths. The level of hatred and fear in those who wish death to those who choose their bodily autonomy will do them harm inevitably. </p>
<p>Whoever you are, I hope that you have a community that supports you. Smalls discussions such as this give me hope to know that there are people out there who disagrees wholeheartedly with the situation. </p>
<p>Forgive me if I sound naiive, I just cling to the bits of humanity that I see left in people during this time.</p>

        <p>They are the ones that are afraid. Don't let yourself be put down or belittled. You are the stronger one. It's so hard, I know, I had a lot of anger and I still do, but it caused me more pain and held me back from actually standing up for what's right. </p>

        <p>I have compassion for the ones who are okay with others making a different choice or at least recognize our right to do so. The ones who are pushing for various authorities to try to coerce us into submission with mandates and segregation can go sit on a cactus.</p>
<p>A few of my friends and distant family members have gotten it, but they're not trying to force it on others. I respect their decision and they respect mine, even if we disagree on who's making the right one.</p>

        <p>That's great I'm happy to hear that you have people around you that respect your personal decisions and vice versa. That's the level we need to be on and it takes a strong person to do that. </p>

        <p>My job entails going into 15 different households on average every day. It truly breaks my heart to see those who are truly good people, who wouldn’t hurt a fly, terrified for their lives because of what the news tells them. People who are perhaps in their 60s or 70s, so shaken with fear that some of them will live the remainders of their lives in fear. I refuse customers service who immediately use masks as a power trip.(I always don’t have a mask on as I approach customers) however those who I can see are truly kind people yet are terrified, I oblige. We have all felt overwhelming fear of something. We are no better than those who want to force us to wear masks and take shots if we cannot differentiate.</p>

        <p>Fuck that. Avoid these people. They will make you sick. Why do you think they have dropped the restrictions everywhere in America? They want this thing, whatever it is, to run like a wildfire by vaxxed people shedding all over the place. They also want the unvaxxed to swap pathogens with the vaxxed to get a little ADE going on. </p>
<p>These fucking people that took this shot have ruined society for the rest of us and FOR NO GOOD REASON. They deserve nothing except what Moderna or Phizer has so carefully planned for them.</p>

        <p>What is with the comments about those who have taken the vax killing you or taking away your freedoms.  There might be some overlap but some ppl are just taking it for themselves be it out of fear or feeling it's what they should do, whatever.  I've got one person in my family who's really pushing it on others and is on the no vax no getting together with you train but not everyone is like that.</p>
