        <p>The story referenced in your first Twitter link indicated the confounding factor of population density.  We need data that shows vaccination rates in similarly populated areas with an uptick. As it stands that article doesnâ€™t really meant anything.</p>
<p>As for the other two links, the official story never said the vaccine would be effective against variants, only that it would provide protection against particular variants, variants that have now been supplanted by the delta variant. This subreddit simultaneously pushes the idea that the virus isnâ€™t real, that it is real but isnâ€™t deadly, that it isnâ€™t real and the vaccine is causing it, that it is real and the vaccine is causing it, and that it is/isnâ€™t real and the vaccine does nothing but hurt people. From where Iâ€™m sitting, all I see is a lot of people here who donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about while the official story tends to follow the pattern that I would expect based on my own critical thinking.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve asked this before and Iâ€™ll ask it again, given two worlds, one where the official story is true and one where some variant of this subredditâ€™s truth is true, how can a person tell the difference? Since people arenâ€™t getting it, let me phrase it this way: There is a reasonable explanation for the data you are providing (population density issues/the vaccine doesnâ€™t work against the variant). How do you know that the official explanation is incorrect?</p>
<p>Edit #1- Moderna did say that their vaccine would likely protect people from variants. Maybe no one is lying, maybe they were just wrong?</p>

        <p>&rt; population density issues</p>
<p>do you remember the czech republic in the media narrative around spring 2020? they "controlled the virus through masks". got hit later on, though. https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/europe/czech-republic-coronavirus-intl/index.html</p>
<p>there's always a post-hoc explanation. now it's "population density" what's next?</p>
<p>and lol, im sure the "variants" are the post hoc explanation for the utter disaster that is vax efficacy right now. so you'd agree the vax is ineffective now?</p>
<p>&rt; How do you know that the official explanation is incorrect?</p>
<p>why don't the vaxs work against the variant? ADE is simply the underlying mechanism.</p>

        <p>The population density of the Czech Republic is about 350 people per square mile. Los Anglersâ€™ is almost 8500 people per square mile. It isnâ€™t comparable. </p>
<p>The official story says the r-naught value of the virus â€˜s delta variant is thought to be around 5 to 8, meaning we should expect the virus numbers to go up if the vaccine doesnâ€™t work. Thatâ€™s one of the things people here are suggesting, that the virus does nothing. How is this evidence of a lie, itâ€™s exactly what people here are saying would happen if the vaccine didnâ€™t work.</p>
<p>As for post hoc rationalizations, thatâ€™s how science works. You make a hypothesis and test it. If your hypothesis is wrong then you have to come up with a new theory as to the original phenomenon (I.e. a post hoc rationalization).  My whole point is, how do you know thereâ€™s a lie when the simplest explanation is that people were wrong.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d agree the vaccine appears to be ineffective against the current biological make up of the disease. Coronavirus a mutate rapidly, thatâ€™s why there is a flu shot every year. If the current variant has different spike proteins, then the current vaccine wonâ€™t work. However, that doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t work entirely and it doesnâ€™t mean people are lying about the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, I donâ€™t know what ADE is.</p>
