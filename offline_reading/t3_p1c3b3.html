    <strong>Servicemen &amp; Women: Do not take the shot. My life changed forever because of a bad decision like this.</strong>
    <p><p>11 years ago before I went overseas, it was discovered that I was behind on some extra immunizations. Instead of taking them over the course of a few weeks/months before leaving, my command said I had to take them all at once. I ended up having a severe reaction and developed an anaphylaxis allergy. Red dog tags for me.</p>
<p>I was told it wasn’t that bad, and I would be fine until one day I went to Disneyland and took a picture holding those massive balloon clusters. Within minutes I had a latex reaction and was almost rushed to the hospital. My entire body was covered in hives and I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>Now I have epipens.</p>
<p>While waiting to see ENT at the VA (over the course of several years), I have met countless other vets who have suffered from gulf war syndrome, agent orange, and other crazy reactions to bad decisions such as burn pits in Iraq, and also those new malaria pills they came out with. I even met someone else with my condition.</p>
<p>I really can’t go to kids birthday parties anymore because I can’t even be near a balloon FFS. Do you know the dealing of not painting a kids room? So much more… let alone eat Bananas, Kiwis, and a plethora of other foods I used to enjoy because I have a severe anaphylactic allergy now.</p>
<p>Because command wouldn’t wait.</p>
<p>I blew my knee out at SFAS, Day 19. I’ll never forget. I was planning on continuing, and the 18D said to me. </p>
<p>“Look man, I’ll med drop you, and you can heal up and come back from this and be allowed to return, but if you push yourself and break your leg, you might not be able to.”</p>
<p>I paused, thought he was fucking with me and then he said…</p>
<p>“Just remember, the Army doesn’t really give a shit about you. Only you do.”</p>
<p>That right there.. That moment. That was when I realized I was taking my DD214.</p>
<p>If I was still in, with what I know now. I’d take the field grade.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear they did this shit to you. Christ, the military really doesn't give a shit about servicemen. Thank fuck your 18D had a functioning heart and brain.</p>
<p>I always wondered if the MMR vaccine I got as a kid is the reason I have a number of allergies (pollen, cat dander, dust mites...). It's the same principle - too many shots at once fucks your immune system up.</p>
<p>This whole situation has made me rethink vaccination in general. I'm starting to think Andrew Wakefield was onto something before he was cancelled.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I really credit that guy for a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve spoke to a pediatrician about the MMR, and he unfortunately said they don’t split that shot up.</p>
<p>However, he’s been great about spreading things out extensively because of my experience and allowing us to pick our own timelines. I think the MMR will be saved for the absolute last if need be.</p>
<p>There are good docs out there, just hard to find.</p>

        <p>If I had a kid, I wouldn't let them get vaccinated. If a vaccine has the potential to cause immune problems, I'd want them to take that risk themselves as an adult, rather than having the choice made for them.</p>
<p>No criticism of you, use your own judgment - I just feel this way because immune problems fucking <em>suck</em>, as you know. You can't really 'cure' them, only manage them.</p>
<p>It's fucked up how the whole business model of pharma is to make you sick so they can sell the cure...</p>

        <p>Yes.
It’s a balancing act between what YOU want, what your wife wants, and what you BOTH think is the best course of action.</p>
<p>There are some shots that I’m fine with, others I’m not (like MMR). </p>
<p>But something…. That we have been putting in our bodies…. Is effecting immunities and reproductive problems. That much is sure.</p>

<p>At least my kids doc is super cool, and I might hold off on basically all of them until he’s bigger.</p>
<p>I personally think the age of some of these are batshit.</p>

<p>All these shots are just money makers. Pretty sure I’m a decade behind in shots and I could care less. </p>

        <p>I'd advise you to actually read his crackpot study before musing if he had a point. You really claim to be a free thinker against the medical machine yet are willing to give a man the benefit of the doubt who claimed autism was caused by your stomach because of MMR vaccines being 3 vaccines which causes a reaction but they're all fine individually? Oh no, I mean the ones I made with my private company and am going to sell for billions, those, those ones are fine. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also as an aside, allergies are believed to be caused by a lack of dangerous sickness as a child. People used to get allergies less because kids would be busy with cholera, polio, measles, smallpox, etc. The ones who survived had their immune system essentially only focusing on overtly dangerous particles whereas in our modern era of hand washing and not living in our own waste, children are not commonly exposed to deadly illnesses and as such the immune system has a tendency to focus on more benign particles. Studies have further noted that certain proteins emanating from peanuts are nearly identical to those of dangerous parasites and such the body in acts in such as manner as if it needs to immediately make the body inhospitable to attempt to remove any such danger. Essentially allergies are your body believing that there is a substance inside of it that needs to be expelled and that's why coughing, itching, sneezing, etc are the common reaction. The only relation between vaccines and allergies would be that since vaccines prevent many such deadly illnesses you're more likely for your immune system to become overzealous due to it not worrying about plague, smallpox, tetanus, etc</p>

        <p>In 2018 I tried to become a naval officer - went to OCS  and graduated in fact. As you know, all the vaccines are required. What was interesting to me was that at one point, an admin/nurse type (maybe she was a doctor but I seriously doubt it) came in to collect medical information and describe the administration schedule - she asked if anyone had any hesitancies about about any of the vaccines (I had been healthily skeptical of vaccines because my mom had always advocated informed consent). I was the only one that raised my hand. I told her I had had religious waivers in the past (that my mom got for me) and I didn't feel comfortable getting anything I had already had. I gave her my mom's phone number so she could get my immunization record (because I guess I didn't have it with me at the time). Well I didn't hear anything further about it and my thought process consisted of two things: 1) what are the odds something bad would happen and 2) the navy basically owned me so what could I REALLY do. </p>
<p>Well, first round of vaccinations came along and I didn't notice anything unordinary. The first round happens around week 4/12 if I remember right. The second round happens around week 8/12. I could look at the records to see which vaccines I got in each round if anyone is that curious. Anyway, several days after round two, I had sort of a bruising sensation in one of my eyes - I thought it was a little weird but the sensation went away. A week or two later, the vision in the same eye started to fade into sort of a foggy haze. It was very gradual so I couldn't decide if I was just imagining things at first but a vision test clearly confirmed I was losing my sight (unfortunately this happened the day before "battlestations" - the final evolution before candio phase). Then, oddly, my class LT said "there's someone I want you to talk to". Turns out this "someone" had the EXACT same symptoms except they completely lost their vision in the one eye. Anyway further testing led to a diagnosis of optic neuritis. We were hoping this was merely an isolated case such that I could argue for my commission. </p>
<p>I wouldnt normally have gone to such drastic measures for treatment but it was on the Navy's dime and I did NOT want to spend any longer than I needed in H-class (especially after the horror stories of the medical liaison doing a piss-poor job and candidates being stuck in H-class or student pool for months). The "recommended" treatment was high-dose corticosteroids (methylpredisolone) and if that didn't work, plasma exchange. I only ever needed the former but apparently it's common sense that you get an oral taper for steroid doses that high - no one told me this and by the time I reached out to the doctor they told me "well at this point it's too late" (a major blow to my faith in the healthcare system). Anyway, you could blame the following (grand mal) seizure on the fact I didn't have the oral taper or as a follow-on symptom of whatever caused the optic neutritis. They determined the seizure was caused by a "meningeal enhancement" in my brain. Because I didn't have any spinal lesions characteristic of MS, I had the seizure, and tested positive for the MOG antibody - they diagnosed me with NMOSD which stands for Neuromyelitis Optical Spectrum Disorder (for which I've had no recurring symptoms).</p>
<p>Later in student pool (since I didn't commission and opted for IDES), I found out yet ANOTHER candidate that had similar symptoms and was held back as well (he had some other inflammation in his eye and the same tremors I had right before the seizure). </p>
<p>Anyway, the whole thing was worse for my wife than me - she said when she flew up to see me after the seizure, it was like I didn't even recognize her because I was so out of it (and for some time over 24 hours). In fact, she was concerned I actually had a stroke as well because I had partial paralysis in the entire left side of my body - and obviously I remember very very little. The point of all this being, I don't even want to take the risk of something like that happening again, putting my wife and kids through that or something worse. When I tell people the story they seem to sympathize with my declination of the COVID vaccine even though I tell them I wouldn't get it anyway. The scary part is, I think we are moving to a point where people won't even be able to sympathize - so blinded by the hatred the MSM is pumping into society.</p>
