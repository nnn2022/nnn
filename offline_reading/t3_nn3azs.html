<p>On that page it has a link to download the full petition <br>
 "Citizen Petition from Scientific Advisory Board on behalf of Children's Health Defense"  for reading.    </p>
<p>Under "write a comment", I chose "drug industry" as the category.  I simply stated the following from the petition:    </p>
<p>FDA should revoke all EUAs for any COVID vaccine because the current risks of serious adverse events or deaths outweigh the benefits, and because existing drugs provide highly effective prophylaxis and treatment.    </p>
<p>FDA should immediately stop allowing minors to participate in COVID vaccine trials.    </p>
<p>FDA should immediately revoke approval that pregnant women may receive any EUA or licensed COVID vaccines and issue public guidance to that effect.    </p>
<p>FDA should amend its guidance for the use of the chloroquine drugs, ivermectin and any other drugs demonstrated to be safe and effective against COVID, to comport with current scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, and issue notifications to all stakeholders.   </p>
<p>FDA should issue guidance to the Secretary of Defense and the President to NOT grant an unprecedented presidential waiver of prior consent regarding COVID vaccines for our service members.   </p>
<p>FDA should issue guidance affirming that all citizens have the option to accept or refuse administration of investigational COVID vaccines without adverse work, educational, or other non-health related consequences.    </p>
<p>Pending revocation of COVID vaccine EUAs, FDA should issue guidance that all marketing and promotion of COVID vaccines must refrain from labeling them “safe and effective.”  For more background,    </p>
