        <p>Don’t even go on the other subs that are pro anything. They’re lost and don’t want help. </p>
<p>I know we mean good to our lost friends and family, sometimes we think we could have worded things better and maybe they would have kept listening. And that’s okay. </p>
<p>Our responsibility as the truth holders, are to plant truth seeds. But if the garden is fenced off, leave the seeds by the door. It’s all you can do and that’s better than nothing at all. You have not been defeated if the opponent walks away, they will only have a rematch with the next truther down the road.</p>

<p>The pro-ivermectin, pro-guns and pro-gold subs are kind of cool.</p>

        <p>I often take a step back and consider how much I have been sucked into some delusions because a lot of this is pretty far out there. Some conclusions drawn I have take with a grain of salt because I have a hard time picturing how some things could be coordinated on such a scale.</p>
<p>However, whenever I have a conversation with a normie, it's clear that they never look at anything outside of what they have been told through "official" channels. They don't know about any of the nuances, they simply take things at face value and show little interest in the details. For example, most people I speak to haven't even heard of Ivermectin.</p>
<p>If one took any interest in their own health and wellbeing at all, they would go out and LOOK for these things themselves. When this all started, all of my usual suspect friends were getting in touch and asking about sourcing HCQ, and whatever else they could get their hands on. Most people I speak to have no idea that there are effective preventative and immune system boosters, and many have good evidence supporting efficacy against covid. If they're so worried, why are they not finding their own solutions?</p>
<p>And I think the same goes for most things discussed here. People don't go looking, it's not "mainstream" so you are called "mentally ill".</p>
