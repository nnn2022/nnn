    <strong>we all just want our lives back.</strong>
    <p><p>my last post was quickly made and I am sleep deprived too but all I was trying to say by making it was “The isolation of the lockdowns effected me mentally to the point that I couldn’t even accept my own sexuality, and that is just one example of how lockdowns and quarantines are awful for everyone’s mental health” I thought I would get responses agreeing with that and maybe even some sympathy because why not, i’m allowed to let myself feel validated by the only subreddit who actually wants to listen to my ideas. I just got responses saying that being lgbtq is unnatural and one guy thinking I was trolling but idek what he was thinking. I just wanted to share my experience as an example of how damaging the lockdowns are and that it’s not just “oh stay home for a while” people NEED social interaction face to face and a virus with a 99.99% survival rate should be the least of our concerns in the grand scheme of it all. I want what you all want. I want my life back.</p></p>

        <p>Hey OP, I just got done reading your other post, and as a mother to a 16 year old daughter who also came to terms with being bisexual during quarantine, I want to apologize for those crude and disgusting comments you recieved by some, I know how hard this has been for you kids, most adults my age have know idea what you kids have been through this past year, Not only is being a teenager hard in normal circumstances, adding a global "pandemic" to it really tops the cake, I can only tell you that from my experience as a mother I was really proud of my daughter, I watched her slowly blossom into who she envisions herself to be, I think it's beautiful, so many people go through life not letting themselves be who they are, and the sooner you can see yourself the longer you have to live to your fullest, and also, some people take longer to understand, even my mother, who has 0 problems with the LGBTQ community has a real hard time with the use of pronouns etc...they are just from a different time, give it time, you guys are the new generation, each generation always strives to change the perceptions of the ones before them, and it's going to be okay, stay strong, this madness will come to an end, you are young and have still a lifetime left, don't let em knock you down or make your heart sour, I don't even know you but I'm proud of you, and you handled that creepy opposition with much class, be well and stay your course.</p>
