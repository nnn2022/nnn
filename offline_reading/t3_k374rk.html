    <strong>If you want to ban the sub then fine. But this is why I'm here and I'm sure there's plenty that agree with me.</strong>
    <p><p>It is not just about rights or freedoms. </p>
<p>A lot of people on this sub are concerned about how many people will die from the poverty the lockdowns are causing. Theyre annoyed at the hypocrisy of protests being allowed through this. They're concerned that children are becoming suicidal and left behind with education because of these lockdowns. They are also worried about our elderly in care homes who don't understand what's going on at all. </p>
<p>Theyre worried about the thousands of people missing cancer treatments who could die due to lack of care. They're worried about the people not getting surgeries they desperately need while many hospitals do indeed remain empty. They're worried about small businesses who have the most to lose. </p>
<p>Like it's not even just about rights and freedoms. It's about everything else as well. How long will this go on for? How many more people will die? In the uk 1 in 5 people are experiencing mental health issues now than before the lockdown when it was 1 in 10. We didnt have the support capacity before and we certainly don't now. </p>
<p>1% of the worlds population is 70 million dead. The average age of covid death in the uk is 84 while the average lifespan is 80 years. Nearly all those who've died have had underlying medical conditions. They're in their 80s so of course they're going to. </p>
<p>Ask the old people if they wanna stay locked up. They're the ones it's really affecting in deaths. Most of them are surprised they wake up every day. I know because all the people in my family over the age of 80 feel that way and would rather just get on with their lives. I love them dearly and would miss them terribly but at that age they're old enough to know what they want. And right now so many of them are sitting isolated and alone. Some with altzhiemers and dementia are getting worse because we can't see them. My step grandmother has deteriorated this year with senile dementia because she hasnt seen anyone. </p>
<p>It's shit enough being 80 where nearly everyone you know is already dead never mind the lockdowns now. 
It's killing people either way.</p>
<p>There's been an increase in suicides in university students in the uk because there's no support for them here either. Domestic violence has increased too. A friend of mine is a social worker and her job is literally convincing kids who are too scared of covid to go back to school. What impact is it having mentally? </p>
<p>It's also skeptism of the vaccines too. I am not an antivaxxer. I've had all my previous ones and I'm confident in them because they've had rigorous testing. The covid ones though... Made in a year? Nah I'm not convinced it's safe. I'm not convinced by the testing. I've been surprised by how many people are also wary in the UK. It's the silent majority I think and it's really concerning because some of them will become complete antivaxxers and there's obviously been a disconnect and lack of trust. </p>
<p>There are other forces at play too. The IMF won't bail countries out if they don't lockdown. So I do think there is a monetary incentive and they have been promising a debt jubilee. Again I don't believe in conspiracy theories but it's been on their website for the past year. I have outside interests in the global economy so follow them on linked in and they've been pushing the great reset for over a year now. It's not a conspiracy. It's literally all there despite what the media tell you. </p>
<p>This brings me to my final point. We want transparency from the media too. We don't trust them. We don't trust our governments. We don't trust WHO and we don't trust the UN. The trust between the power and the people is breaking. Censoring us proves our point and doesn't make it better. So by all means ban the sub. But you'll just make the divide worse. Censoring one side of an argument doesn't make it better. You push people to the extremes which is how we're getting into the mess we're in right now.</p></p>

        <p>You can say all the same things in a positive way, and then you won't be labeled a conspiracy theorist. Say 'I think to combat this awful pandemic, we need to live in pods and eat bugs forever!' and doomers will suddenly agree with you. It's only a conspiracy if you mention this in a negative way.</p>

        <p>Disagree. The doomers will say that’s ridiculous and we’ll be back to normal after the vaccine. When you then point out that their God Dr. Fauci admits we’ll still need to wear masks after the vaccine, they’ll stare at you blankly like you’re an alien because their brains simply can’t comprehend what this all really means.</p>

        <p>Depends on a doomer. Smarter doomers know just as much about great reset as you, the difference is that they support it / believe this will be good for them. Dumber doomers just believe any lies they read, however there are really not many dumb people out there. Really. If you owned a predatory business (MLM, loan shark, lottery, scams etc) you'd know that idiots are in very short supply, most people are smart.</p>

<p>This is why the stigma of "conspiracy theory" works so well. Most people favor their social status over intellectual honesty, especially intellectuals. Now that there is no society, we don't have to worry about being ridiculed.</p>

        <p>There’s fuckery afoot. That’s all there is to it. Blind compliance with government edicts directly contradicts the recognition of the FACT that history repeats itself. Like you said, go ahead and ban it. It will serve as incontrovertible proof that the technocracy views anyone with a modicum of dissent as unworthy of a voice or to be reasoned with.</p>

        <p>This sub is the only reason I've been active on Reddit lately.</p>
<p>What's the point of Reddit in the first place, when even the last few remaining echo chambers on Reddit that question the status quo (most have already been banned) end up getting banned?</p>
<p>Didn't Reddit used to be a place once where critical thinking and counterculture were the norm rather than the exception? Or is that a very naive and idealistic perception of the early days of Reddit?</p>

        <p>Exactly. Forums are for open discussion about a particular topic. Whether you agree or disagree with that topic is another matter but everyones so scared of not meeting the status quo and being different that its easier not to express these opinions and just bend to the will of the minority.</p>

<p>That's the part that scares me the most.</p>
<p>It's not so much government or corporate censorship, but the general public either submitting to it or even outright supporting it.</p>
<p>Before the whole concentration camp thing became public knowledge in the 1940s, Nazis were despised by freedom-loving citizens for far less extreme forms of totalitarianism than what we have come to consider normal today...</p>
<p>And if we keep submitting to this tyranny, concentration camps may return before we realize it...</p>

        <p>I'm definitely doing this. I recently went from being a lifelong radical feminist active on social media, blogs, and Tumblr (shut up, it's great) to very much not that and I no longer talk to anyone about my thoughts. I barely even have thoughts and ideas anymore because no one IRL could handle hearing them and online I'd be putting myself at risk for doxing. It makes me sad, but then I figure it ultimately just doesn't matter. Tyranny will always win and there's no reason for me to express wrong-think just so people know I #resist.</p>

<p>It looks like you could use some new female role models.</p>
<p>You may want to check out following 4 Youtube channels :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Shoe0nHead/videos">June Lapine</a> (aka Shoe 0n Head)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Barbara4u2c/videos">Barbara Horvat</a> (aka Barbara4u2c)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DaisyCousensOfficial/videos">Daisy Cousens</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BlondeintheBellyoftheBeast/videos">Rebecca Hargraves</a> (aka Blonde in the Belly of the Beast)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them are stong, intelligent &amp; freethinking women. I arranged them from the most left-leaning to the most right-leaning, Regardless of where you are on the political spectrum now, I'm sure you can relate with at least one of these women.</p>
<p>If you don't have anyone around in life whom you can share your thoughts with, my experience is that it sometimes can help to watch a video or read an article from someone you CAN relate with. It helps you feel sane again. I helps you feel grounded. It confirms to you that you're not alone out there, and that's there's others out there who think and/or feel just like you about issues that matter to you....</p>
<p>Either way, the qualities exhibited by any of these women are the qualities I'd personally look for in a girlfriend, once I put myself on the dating market again. And these are also the role models I'd present to my daughter if I'd ever have one...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It makes me sad, but then I figure it ultimately just doesn't matter. Tyranny will always win and there's no reason for me to express wrong-think just so people know I #resist.</p>
<p>Tyranny will always win if the majority of us refuse to speak out and/or stand up.</p>
<p>If we stand up collectively as a united front, that's still no guarantee to win. But if we fail to stand up at all, we're guaranteed to lose.</p>

        <p>I can see your point. but if you start going on about rights and freedoms usually people take that as the right to just do what you want. Imo detaching it from rights and freedoms (even if it is a right to healthcare and a right to open your business etc) drives home the point further. Right now people are not getting healthcare because of lockdowns. Their health, that we're trying so hard to protect, is deteriorating BECAUSE of lockdowns. Its a case of weighing up which causes too much damage and imo, if 90% of the population end up needing therapy and 5% of the total end up not getting a diagnosis and dying, those numbers are still greater than the 1% of people dying. If the percentage of people who's health has deteriorated due to the lockdowns is higher than those health thats deteriorating due to the virus alone then lockdowns aren't worth it.</p>

        <p>I think we agree.  You are saying that rights and freedoms is not a defensible rhetorical point.  But from a philosophic one, people not getting healthcare is because of a lack of freedom. People suffering mental problems are mostly doing so because their rights have been taken away.  If they trust government, they have a moral dilemma, why are these bad things happening, if I'm doing the right things?</p>

        <p><strong><em>The Usually People</em></strong>, fuck em I say and all the Lawful Evil they entail. Rules were built to punish that specific demographic.</p>
<p>The real reason for the lockdown is China's counterfeit money operations. Wuhan was destroyed by bombing those dams. Why because besides a virus lab, a money printing lab also requires expensive dyes and printing. Not only is George Floyd's crime sheet connected, but its the NSA that is about to lay down the law to those involved.</p>
<p>Its no wonder in recent years the most hard working and honest businesses have required government bailouts when the rest are cheating. And how NASA got fucked in the process will most likely be a documentary to look forward to in the future.</p>

        <p>I think this is the thing. Everything is being split into two camps. There is no 'middle ground' anymore. Idm wearing a mask out and about and will wear one if it makes people feel safer. Do I think they work? Do I think theyre necessary? Well these are two questions with the same answer. <br>
But society is being polarised by the media so you are either for or against something you cant be in the middle.</p>

        <p>Lockdown skepticism is castrated, you can't say anything political, you can't be sceptical about the quality of vaccine, etc etc. Posting there is like voting for Jeb Bush instead of Donald Trump, or voting for Joe Biden instead of Bernie Sanders. What is called 'constructive criticism' in totalitarian states.</p>

        <p>&rt; Ask the old people if they wanna stay locked up. They're the ones it's really affecting in deaths. Most of them are surprised they wake up every day. I know because all the people in my family over the age of 80 feel that way and would rather just get on with their lives. </p>
<p>I feel like it really is this simple, but I know the weirdos on the other side will claim to know better than the elderly, as if the elderly are 100% helpless class. Trust me, as an American I see this a lot with a certain group of people that will remain unnamed. It’s insulting to say the least.</p>

        <p>Also as if banning the sub will magically make the people on the sub change their mind. </p>
<p>This is the thing people don't seem to get. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you really think our ideas are so awful then you should want them to stay in the light so that they can be shot down. You ban discussion of that viewpoint on a more public forum, that same discussion is going to go more underground. Do you want radicalism? Because that's how you get radicalism.</p>

        <p>Yes, but unfortunately, censorship has the effect that people who haven't been critical yet are less likely to listen to skeptics because the censorship makes it look like there is no "credible" criticism.</p>
<p>Edit: I agree with the radicalisation thing and that censorship doesn't change a skeptic's opinion.</p>

        <p>I've kinda come to the conclusion: When there's blood on the streets, it's time to buy real estate.</p>
<p>Fuck 'em.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, it's going to be a buyer's market out there and given we're those poor, ignorant rural people that would be hit soooo hard and drop like flies (wrong), I aim to capitalize when the city and suburbanites start liquidating their shit to keep their heads above water.</p>
<p>I deal in horses, horse tack, and horse trailers.  Those are status symbols for suburbanites.  Sooner or later, that horse they got so their daughter could look like a rich bitch is going to start hurting to keep.</p>

        <p>Incorrect.  Horses are now the status symbol of the middle class, barely paying their mcmansion mortgage, suburbanites.</p>
<p>The rich will always profit off a crises - that's why they're rich.</p>
<p>It's the middle class suburbanites, wanting to APPEAR to be the truly wealthy, that are going to be cutting loose the horses and shit that goes with them because they're already stretched thin as it is due to trying to appear wealthy and living beyond their means.</p>
<p>ETA: Downvote me all you want folks, I buy and sell horses, tack, and trailers for a side hustle, and do well at it.  The middle class goobs wanting their precious girl to hang with the actually wealthy kids, are the ones that get in over their heads the quickest and sell off everything at a huge loss and not just horse related stuff.  It's not the ultra wealthy doing this.</p>

        <p>What’s your solution though? You make a couple valid points about hospitals needing to prioritize covid patients at the expense of others and lockdowns causing financial problems and that but, you offer no insight, ideas or solutions. You’re just complaining. There are solutions to these problems but people, much like many on this sub, have prevented them from coming to fruition.

        <p>It’s just frustrating to hear you go on and on about all the problems and then totally deny the only solution. Which is another lockdown during which we’re paid to stay home. It sucks, suicides will continue to rise and small business will suffer. But that’s where we are. I run a small business and haven’t been eligible for aid since august. I’m taking in about a quarter of what I did pretty pandemic and I still know lockdown is the answer. It’s like you’re so close but then at the end, you botch it and don’t make any sense. There is only one answer</p>

<p>Half my comments are ironic, I'm not necessarily pro or anti lockdown depending on the situation. I just feel bad for people losing money. But I should focus more on myself.</p>

        <p>I don’t have much of a choice. I run a daycare out of my house for kids under two. You’d think with them being that little parents would be ok with my having three or four of them at a time. Nope. They get skittish if I have more than one anymore. I recently added a little girl full time and almost had one of my families pull out. But I’m self employed so I don’t pay into unemployment insurance. Congress said they wanted to included self employed folks in the second executive order but it was so slapdash that they forgot. That was a joke anyway so it didn’t much matter. I’m sorry to hear about your mom. If you’re older you’re totally dependent on the government operating correctly, people bringing you the things you need and society following the rules. That sucks.</p>

        <p>I never said staying home was bad or wrong in any way. Limiting your contact with people is the easiest way to not spread a virus like Covid-19. I myself havnt been to work in a month and have my groceries delivered to my house as I live with multiple at risk people. What I'm saying is people who need to leave the house, those who work in areas like the USA that has 0 infrastructure to support workers in these situations need to be wearing masks, people who go to stores for shopping need to be in masks. People should not be going out and about but its very clear that people are going out and bout, so atleast wearing a mask can make it safer for everybody involved. Everybody needs to limit their person to person interactions that is absolutely true and a necessity to handling this pandemic.</p>

        <p>Then maybe people should spend their time taking pictures of people out at stores with or without masks and shame them on social media but we don't see any of that. If anyone really wanted to focus on stopping the spread why hassle the small percentage not wearing a mask and not the huge masses casually out and about. </p>
<p>In my city cases are rising yet I never see anyone maskless yet they feel like legitimate heros. </p>
<p>Is my ironic rant making sense? Maybe. I'm tired of everyone being a broken record repeating reddit front page talking points and have no thoughts of their own. At least it would be entertaining to read.</p>

        <p>For me it's several reasons.</p>
<p>It's dehumanizing and removes people's humanity. People stop looking like people with masks on and look like zombies and as a woman I get scared during night time when I see a man with a mask on walking towards me.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of politicians and "experts" claiming back in march that masks are useless and then changing their tune. And the argument that they were lying to stop people from buying up masks doesn't stand considering they claim a homemade cloth mask works.</p>
<p>Speaking of homemade cloth masks, I have not seen a single piece of evidence or study that suggests a piece of cloth protects you or anyone else from a virus. </p>
<p>As for medical masks, let's put aside for now the fact that experts cannot agree whether they work or not, the ones who are in support of masks say that they only work if you change them often, do not re-use them and do not touch them while wearing them and do not touch your face. I don't know that if you have noticed, but the vast majority of people are constantly fiddling with their mask, pulling it up and down, touching their face, putting a mask in their pocket and re-using it tomorrow, thus rendering the whole thing pointless. </p>
<p>Final point is that I have noticed that people who wear masks forget about distancing because a mask makes them feel safe so they start standing too close to you in shops and public transport breathing down your neck.</p>
<p>It's a charade.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is not physically hard, although being on the spectrum it does make it a lot harder for me to know if people are joking or angry. What's outrageous is that someone else's fear of getting sick forces me to wear a mask too. If you don't want to get sick, stay home and let the rest of us live our lives as we see fit. </p>
<p>It's hard to see people not supporting the right of free movement and enterprise, hard to see country after country shut down their economies and doom a very large part of their population to poverty and dependence on the state. The mask alone isn't the issue, it's that the mask is the first step to a future that no one should want for their children.</p>

        <p>So instead of someone's fear forcing you to wear a mask, your reluctance to wear a mask is forcing someone else to stay home?  There are also people who has to work you know, cashiers, delivery drivers, teachers, so on. You're saying all those people quit their jobs and stay home just so you don't have to wear a mask? </p>
<p>Seriously, what does the government get out of getting people to wear masks? Do you seriously think that if people listen to the government to wear masks, they will blindly listen to everything else? Come on, people aren't that stupid.</p>

        <p>Well no, if you want to wear a mask or observe any other preventative measures, you're free to do so. On the other hand, I shouldn't be forced to wear one or businesses forced to close because you want to feel safe. Every one is capable of deciding what level of risk they want in their lives. </p>
<p>As to what governments gain by implementing these measures? The introduction of new laws that prevent: peaceful protests, freedom of enterprise, bodily autonomy. Basically they gain more power and more control. Once in place, these laws will never be overturned.</p>
<p>No, I don't think all people will blindly follow every rule just because they wear a mask, but I do believe a large amount of the population has been scared into wearing the mask and not doing it out of logic and reason, which means that i think they can be scared into accepting more drastic measures without thinking about them too much or at all.</p>

        <p>The problem is your decision affects other people. That's like saying drunk driving should be legal because people can decide if they are fine with the level of risk. </p>
<p>You speak like the government is a complete separate entity from the people, you realize it's still composed of people right? Do you seriously think if the government impose a mask mandate, it will just stay even after the pandemic is over? It's pretty ironic you call people doomers cause that sound pretty paranoid to me. </p>
<p>Why does the reason people wear masks affect whether the mask mandate should exist? Shouldn't the sole deciding factor be the effectiveness (which is proven by uncountable studies, not to mention you can just look at how well all the Asian countries are doing)?</p>

The difference is that you can chose to protect yourself if you wish, i dont have a choice how i live. Driving is operating heavy machinery and is regulated as such, I'm allowed to walk around drunk even though i can hurt myself and maybe others, should that be illegal?</p>
<p>Yes i think the mask mandate will stay in place, certainly long after vaccines are distributed. I don't think it's paranoid, I base that opinion from what I've already seen and hearing world leaders saying that we might have to wear masks for at least 2 more years, and perhaps get vaccinated every year. I sincerley hope I'm wrong! Who will decide when the pandemic is over by the way? Many doctors have said they think its already over. The point is that the decision about the level of risk will never be in your hands again.</p>
<p>Encouraging people to wear a mask and forcing them to do so is completely different. You say their effectiveness has been proven in countless studies, well so has their innefectiveness... so who's right? When there is contradictatory information, the public should never be forced to do anything they don't want to. Irrespective of their effectiveness, i disagree with the reason for wearing a mask in the first place.</p>

        <p>What's so hard about just staying home during a deadly pandemic. Masks aren't 100% effective so why don't you preach for something that actually works. </p>
<p>A good portion of all deaths were because people were out and about spreading it while wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Stay home!</p>

        <p>1% is with treatment; which requires hospital capacity.  Look at New York early on in the pandemic to see what happens without effective treatment.  This fucking sucks, but if  we go beyond our capacity to treat we're more likely to fall somewhere around 5+% dead.  Most of the current lockdown and death could have been avoided if everyone had people worn a mask as soon as it became obvious it made a drastic difference in infection rates.  </p>
<p>Now we have to pay for the antimasker stupidity.   This is 100% their, Trump, and Mitch mcconnell's fault.  Trump made masks a political issue and moscow Mitch has been blocking everything that hits his desk including aid to struggling families.  Add millions anti-mask dipshits spreading it far and wide  and you get what we have right now.</p>
<p>If you anti-maskers want someone to blame for how bad things have gotten, look in a mirror.</p>
