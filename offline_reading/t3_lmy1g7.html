    <strong>Apparently I’m clinically extremely vulnerable and STILL haven’t caught covid.</strong>
    <p><p>So, I’m in the uk. 3rd lockdown. My general belief is that covid is real, but that it has been massively overhyped to I still fear in people. I believe lockdowns are barbaric and that making it illegal to see family and friends is abhorant and ridiculous. The first lockdown I stayed in, I followed every rule. Didn’t see anyone for 13 weeks. Just me and my son in a flat, no garden, and at the time, illegal to sit on a field. After then my mental health took a huge swing downward and I decided that I was able to make my
Own decisions on safety (as I always have been able to) and that I was at more risk of killing myself than of catching covid and that my sons mental
Well-being mattered more than some old
Person I didn’t even know. </p>
<p>I havent been massively breaking “the rules” everyone I have seen agrees with me that they would choose 1 year of living over 10 years of existing. I’ve been much happier and haven’t worn masks around my friends. I do not and have not gone to a shop this whole year because in my head, seeing my family and friends is safer than going primark. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Well anyway, I’ve not been careful at with my own covid risk. I didn’t think I was high risk so I don’t worry about sanitising my hands every two minutes, or not hugging people. But yesterday o got a text offering me the vaccine. Confused I called my doctors questioning why. Apparently because I take steroids for my asthma and immunosuppressants for allergies I am clinically extremely vulnerable and should have been shielding!!! </p>
<p>A whole year and I’m apparently so vulnerable to this highly contagious illness I’ve either still not caught it or had it and had zero symptoms? I’ve questioned all along how these Elderky people who do not live in care homes are even catching it and dying! They can very easily stay in. I feel even more validated about my decision to not ruin mine and my sons life now I know that I am vulnerable to it.</p>
<p>When I’ve spoken to Doomers, they say I just got “lucky”......makes no sense right?</p></p>
