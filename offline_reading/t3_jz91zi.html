    <p><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g48z9z/functional_fear_predicts_public_health_compliance/">Functional fear predicts public health compliance in the COVID-19 pandemic : COVID19 (reddit.com)</a></p>
<p><strong>Highlights(you'd think this was from our sub, but I'm pretty sure 3-4 months was before this sub existed. I guess we were the sheep)</strong> These people were the first.</p>
<p>Warning Long:</p>
<p>&rt; “If you look at my local sub, this is going to be damn near impossible here in Canada. Health and gvt officials have literally terrorized the population into thinking their neighbours shopping for groceries is going to kill them somehow. It’s absurd and illogical and they quite clearly don’t have a game plan for the next 4 months"</p>
<p>&rt; “Fellow Canadian here. I totally agree with you. There's still discourse in USA amongst politicians but here we're just obeying out of fear and uncertainty. We don't have a gameplan"</p>
<p>&rt; Are you in Ontario? The level of terror is totally unreal. People have completely forgotten that “flattening the curve” means we still almost all catch it ffs. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ottawa/">r/Ottawa</a> sub is full of people who act as though the fatality rate is 100%.</p>
<p>&rt; Yeah I'm in Ontario. I'm actually quite shocked at how terrified everybody is. And there's no end in sight. Trudeau just keeps on extending things. Hard to understand what their gameplan is. Plus, it doesn't seem like our hospitals are overwhelmed either.</p>
<p>&rt; We have capacity for 2,000 icu beds and currently have, what, 230 in use right now? This is completely absurd. All we hear is “it will be many many many weeks...” meanwhile we are handing out $2k fines to teenagers for bouncing a ball alone in a park. And people are cheering this! what exactly are we trying to accomplish?! It’s so disappointing to see such stupidity.</p>
<p>&rt; Exactly. Unfortunately since media today work based on ad revenue, which is based on the number of clicks, this system encourages fearmongering and better news gets buried under the noise. For example there have been many blood studies lately that seem to confirm that the number of real cases is many times the number of detected cases, making the actual chance of dying of the disease 10 times lower than the scary numbers 1-3% derived from the number of detected cases that still get repeated in the media (in some cases they even say 10% which is ridiculous) .</p>
<p>&rt; Furthermore, the message that it's actually less deadly than the previously propagated estimates is spun in a way so that they still spread more fear - by the headline saying that many more people have the disease, most people parse that information as being in even larger danger, not realizing this also means it's not as dangerous as it looked in the beginning.</p>
<p>&rt; This selfish system causing unnecessary fear is what helps regimes turn more authoritarian (e.g. Hungary).. for money from clicks</p>
<p>&rt; Quebecker here, exactly what happened in our province. Our prime minister mentioned opening schools. A petition, now signed by over 238000 persons (about 2.8% of the population of the province), emerged on the internet. Now kids wont get any food, classes, or any other services from our education system for at least a few more weeks so they don't get a disease that doesn't seem to affect them seriously in the vast majority of cases. Oh and everybody here is praising the prime minister and his national health director for their outstanding management of the crisis.</p>
<p>&rt; Yes and we got there <em>because</em> instead of actively mitigating risk by focusing on vulnerable populations, the local government instead kept hammering fear mongering nonsense like how young people are really in danger of dying too, kept scapegoating everyone who dared go outside, was about to forbid travel to the main city (Montreal) and close the bridges. Not only that but all the fear led to huge amounts of health workers simply not showing up to work anymore. Or if they did, doing anything they can to avoid COVID cases. So instead of harsher lockdowns for at risk groups, we got a broad quarantine that almost exclusively impacted people who were not at risk.</p>
<p>&rt; All of that while older people had functionally the same restrictions as anyone else and nursing homes were not isolated <em>at all</em> until maybe last week so their residents were allowed to freely go outside if they wanted to. We even allowed people with <em>confirmed</em> COVID cases to go back to their nursing homes. And while the prime minister was boasting daily about how harsh he will be against anyone who transgress the lockdown rules, nurses were told to not put on masks because that could scare patients or that they only need masks if the patient has been confirmed to be infected</p>
<p>&rt; That all led to literal wipe outs in nursing homes and residents not only dying but doing so in horrible conditions because <em>the health workers were terrified and were suggested to quarantine themselves no matter their age</em> so there was no staff to take care of the patients for weeks.</p>
<p>&rt; At the end of the day, we functionally managed to do nothing to stop the disease from actually spreading while completely shutting down almost everything and handing out 2000-6000$ fines to kids playing soccer. It was really incredible to see the hysteria going around.</p>
<p>&rt; Reopening schools at this point wouldn't really endanger anyone simply because the disease already spread to pretty much all of the potential hotspots. Something like 95% of deaths are from nursing homes with the vast majority being state controlled</p>
<p>&rt; Oh but whatever you do, don't undermine the confidence of the population in its leaders, it's so important that they trust them during a crisis! That's bullshit, just do your job and keep them accountable, maybe you're gonna save some lives. And what genius idea have they found to fix the mess they made? Just take 2000 doctors from the hospitals and make them work in nursing homes. But where the fuck do you find 2000 extra doctors with nothing better to do during a pandemic? Easy peasy, scare everybody into their home so nobody needs to go to the hospital. Then, delay every "non essential" procedure in the province. Sure people are gonna die from that, but who's gonna notice/care the surge in cancer death or suicides in the next few years?</p>
<p>&rt; Well you might be right, but that's not my point. I personaly don't know what is the best moment to re-open our schools. The point is that a considerable part of the population reacted against it and that their reaction was based mainly on fear, not facts. And this is only my opinion, but I think that a large proportion of that fear was government induced.</p>
<p>&rt; It what pisses me off about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/">r/Coronavirus</a>. They get off keeping people’s anxiety up thinking their saving lives</p>
<p>&rt; They definitely have some righteous complex. Like they’re saving lives by staying at home and the people who go out are just selfish asshole. So when bad news comes, they can blame it on the people who go outside</p>
<p>&rt; I think it’s also because they’re in an echo chamber where they feel validated and intelligent for making statements based off sensational headlines. They’re addicted to that validation, even if the information is wrong. But if you try to make them think differently, you’re a murderous bastard</p>
<p>&rt; That’s a reoccurring one, ain’t it?</p>
<p>&rt; “Oh, you think we should go outside, if you want to kill your grandma that’s your own fault blah blah”</p>
<p>&rt; It’s almost to the point where that’s become a strawman argument. You comment on anything and suggest that we’ve got a bit of hope, or that things could change and they think you want to be a granny killer</p>
<p>&rt; my theory is that there’s probably a large portion of that sub that’s either still able to work from home and getting paid the same as they always have and then another large portion that’s college students making more on unemployment and stimulus money than they ever would be if they were actually working, while also living at home with no expenses since schools are closed. Those people are fine with staying home for 18 months cause they are benefiting from the lockdown and they don’t have any empathy for all of the people who are losing everything. I also don’t understand when the goal went from flattening the curve to “we are going to everything we can make sure that no one ever does from this.”</p>
<p>&rt; I've had massive struggles with depression since I was in middle school and this pandemic+global economic collapse has had me thinking VERY dark thoughts. If I ever meet someone in real life (assuming we ever meet other humans in real life again) who tells me that deliberately spreading abject terror in a population full of barely-functional depressives was a good idea, do you think any jury in the land would convict me for breaking his nose?</p>
<p>&rt; this is why I think we see so little media coverage about what we’re learning about the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; If they start telling the public en masse that:</p>
<p>&rt; A) That if you get infected, there’s probably a 30-50% chance that you won’t even get sick from it.</p>
<p>&rt; B) If you do get sick, there’s only a 20% or less chance that you’ll get very ill from an infection.</p>
<p>&rt; C) If you get seriously ill, your odds of dying if you’re under age 70 are still very, very low</p>
<p>&rt; then people are going to start thinking “well, if that’s the case then I’m not giving up a year or more of my life to live a <strong>new normal</strong> I want to take my chances and move on with life.”</p>
<p>&rt; The only way to get people to comply with stay-at-home orders at this point is to instill a sense of fear and existential dread in the public. That’s why we’re still seeing the faulty, incomplete IFRs from Spain and Italy plastered everywhere, and it’s why there’s such a focus on outlier deaths from the young and healthy.</p>
<p>&rt; 2/3rds of the deaths in my state county have been in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Can we please stop pretending this is a super killer like the Spanish Flu? It’s not.</p></p>

        <p>Came across a book called "News and the Culture of Lying" and this paragraph jumped out at me, sums up the pandemic fear narrative perfectly I think that we have been relentlessly deluged with for 10 months now:<br>
" The news media and the government are entwined in a vicious circle of mutual manipulation, mythmaking, and self-interest. Journalists need crises to dramatize news, and government officials need to appear to be responding to crises. Too often, the crises are not really crises but joint fabrications. The two institutions have become so ensnared in a symbiotic web of lies that the news media are unable to tell the public what is true and the government is unable to govern effectively "</p>
