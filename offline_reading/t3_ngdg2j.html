        <p>That's because you saw through all the hypocrisy and how it's impractical to shutdown society over something that is already widespread and contagious. Just doesn't make sense at that point. The mitigation efforts never really worked.</p>
<p>We had a shot to contain it and society blew it.</p>

        <p>Yup. Was right there with you. Back then we were conspiracy theorists for thinking it was something to be concerned about... We were evil people for wearing N95's because fRoNtlInE rEsPoNdErs nEeDeD tHeM.</p>
<p>I'm convinced they wanted to spread the virus as a pretext to take away people's rights. It's the only logical conclusion based on series of events.</p>
<p>You don't even need to go far down any rabbit holes to come to this conclusion.</p>

        <p>100% agree. That's why they told everyone not to worry about it and not to ban travel they banned subs that were popular but not controlled by the right people like wuhan_flu. Banned zerohedge from twitter when they said it was a lab leak and lots of other stuff. while they were telling us not to worry and make sure you go to china town. Then and only after it was in every corner of the planet. WE NEED TO STOP TRAVEL AND SHUT ALL THE BUSINESSES! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!</p>

        <p>Fuck these people - they only say what is socially acceptable. Not an ounce of curiosity in the world around them, only blind reaction. It makes complete sense that those of us who were watching this back in january (on r/conspiracy and 4chan of all places lol) came to the conclusion that the virus wasn't that bad because of the simple fact that <em>we ask questions</em>.</p>

        <p>&rt;We had a shot to contain it and society blew it.</p>
<p>Did we really, though? I mean, technically, sure, but best case scenario that means shutting off the entirety of China from the rest of the world, and even that extremely unlikely scenario comes with a slew of negative consequences and questionable ethics.</p>
<p>Much more likely, we'd all end up as another Australia, still completely locked down over a year later, with no exit plan.</p>
<p>There's certainly a tipping point somewhere between covid and ebola where containment becomes a viable option, but with a virus so contagious and so benign, letting it run its course was always the better option.</p>

        <p>Same here. When it was suppose to be the next Black Death and it would only take a 2 week break to get things under control, I was willing to work from home for a couple weeks. At that point, we didn’t know if my wife and one of my best friends would be super high risk, so we took a lot of extra precautions. As soon as the numbers came out as not even remotely matching what they had claimed, we went back to work and stopped wearing masks.</p>

        <p>I had a feeling it was corrupted but I kept telling myself "hey maybe its for the better, since animals are going out and nature is healing" but nope, now we live in hell. Because we still go get fat at MacDonalds, and puff and chug up our hatred, and the world carries on as it is with some "very draconian" restrictions. -- That's Boris Johnson's words, not mine.</p>

        <p>I think you were ahead of the curve. In Jan/feb I thought it was nonsense. March I was at a work conference (3 days 300+ people flying in from all over Canada) which was cut short the day the nba ended the season. </p>
<p>Got home from the conference and got an email from HR saying I ate dinner with someone who had Covid. My wife and I were genuinely concerned. </p>
<p>By June I realized it was all nonsense.</p>

There's so <em>many</em> of them and they do not think about what they say or do AT ALL, they only live in the present and never recognize or observe patterns or trends in behavior or events.

        <p>Same here, no visits with the neices and nephews. I think the mom heard of one kid who got shingles or something awful coinciding with covid and she's been paranoid ever since.

        <p>I feel that so much. I’m watch otherwise smart people around me become deranged, because they never clued in that their favorite media outlets were advocating to them, and they were in echo chambers. I really worry they won’t be able to find their way out of this pit, because man some of them are filled with hate for the people they’ve been told are their enemies (I.e., anyone who isn’t repeating the same lines is an “antivax”, COVID-denying, science-denying racist)</p>

        <p>I completely stopped watching cable, although some of the free services with commercials started getting bad too. I really started to like Pluto's MST3K channel - just some robots making fun of bad movies. Then they started cutting into commercial breaks here, cutting jokes off mid-sentence to play these California state funded ads:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1zDX9PXkotA">https://youtu.be/1zDX9PXkotA</a> </p>
<p>Needless to say I just went ahead and purchased most of the series for my leisure. They have to make the optics of this so pervasive, yet I still don't know a single person who had anything more than a cold from covid.</p>

        <p>I can't help but repeat to myself "Robot roll call!!" every time pundit sheep comes on the news.
I've been a mistie since 1996 (even my alias was influenced by the show), and yet somehow I have not seen the reboot series yet.. no time anymore, being an adult who actually works for a living and all.</p>

        <p>Me too. I was so worried that it was going to be the end of the world as we knew it, and I guess it was, but not in the way that I thought! It took me a couple of months until I started to question things, becoming highly skeptical and critical of lockdowns and other crazy restrictions, before finally beginning to realise the bigger picture of what's going on around August/September last year.</p>

        <p>Neither ignorant or an idiot. I’m a free thinker and can see how the definitions of thing have changed over the last year to fit the narrative of how dangerous covid is. The CDC quietly changing PCR thresholds for the testing numerous times, especially when the “vaccines” came out, the changing of what herd immunity means, and asymptomatic people spreading viruses like wild fire are a few of these things that have changed. And none of them are logical, especially the asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>Fauci didn't recommend mask early on because <br>
1) there're shortages of mask if everyone hogs them, medical worker needs it more, that's why national guards needed to be deployed to prevent "other people" from stealing them<br>
2) science is always changing, presymptomatic and asymptomatic wasn't a thing earlier on, it was unclear that people who aren't showing symptoms can spread. hence there wasn't a need to mask up, he change up once studies show it's a thing.<br>
3) yea, source and citation on mask not effective ? you really want to do this again ? you're not at all embarrassed by the other beatdown ? lol <br>
btw i PMed you, mods had to save you. you can continue there, i hope you're not the all brawn and no brain type, 5ft9 and 200lbs eh ?</p>

<p>it's not a claim, i don't see you responding to the rest of the post, just the "asymptomatic and presymptomatic" portion where you comprehended wrongly too, LOL. your original comment was NOT to mask up because masking was meant for asymptomatic cases. YOUR link show that presymptomatic cases is a thing as well. now if you'd just employ basic logic, if you contract covid on day 1, didn't mask up for the rest of the week, symptoms showed up on day 4 only, wouldn't you have spent day 2 and 3 spreading the virus ? that's what a mask is for, now if you have anything between your ears you'd know that. </p>

        <p>I’m going to break this down for you because I know you have a hard time comprehending anything. Unfortunately I can’t write this with an oversized crayon for you, but you’ll just have to try your little heart out. </p>
<p>The entire argument and everything I linked was specifically about the prevalence, or lack thereof, asymptomatic spread. That was literally the only point I ever made and the only argument I ever presented. Yes the research article also happened to mention presymptomatic spread, but that was just additional information in the paper. I don’t know why you’re hung up on that as if I claimed presymptomatic spread wasn’t a thing. Again, asymptomatic and presymptomatic are two entirely different things. Asymptomatic NEVER produce symptoms. Presymptomatic people haven’t produced symptoms yet. My comment and point of the argument was that specifically asymptomatic people did not need to be masked as they don’t produce symptoms and don’t spread virus. Again, the study I linked was massive. 10 million people studied. Out of those 10 million, they found 300 that were asymptomatic. Of those 300 people, they found that they spread 0 (ZERO) traceable secondary infections. </p>
<p>You, being the mental midget that you are, continued to present articles that showed that asymptomatic people existed. I never argued that they didn’t. I said that they don’t spread viruses. Which I had to repeat to you over and over because you are too slow to follow the actual argument. Your links on viral shedding incorrectly label presymptomatic people as asymptomatic. Remember someone who is truly asymptomatic produces no symptoms. </p>
<p>Listen kid, you’re out of your element here, save yourself from further embarrassment, go learn how to read and more importantly, comprehend the things you’re reading. Until then, you’ll continue to be the biggest dumbass on the internet and remain an easy target.</p>

<p>"if you contract covid on day 1, didn't mask up for the rest of the week, symptoms showed up on day 4 only, wouldn't you have spent day 2 and 3 spreading the virus ? that's what a mask is for" - THAT is what masks are for. presymptomatic cases TOO.  because they can spread too, and the <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Viral-Shedding.aspx">link</a> shows how spreading is possible for asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases.   </p>

<p>no, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322154/">LINK</a> i presented shows HOW asymptomatic people spread covid. </p>
<p>look at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322154/figure/fig01/">figure 1</a>in the link it showed show she spread aymptomatically. next ,the study followed up on the close contacts of 59 imported infectious patients (51 symptomatic cases and eight asymptomatic carriers). A total of 2147 close contacts of these individuals were investigated, and among them of 132 local residents were infected (110 symptomatic cases and 22 asymptomatic cases). It was found that the total infection rate was 6.15% (132/2147), and the infection rates of close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were 6.30% (126/2001) and 4.11% (6/146), respectively, with no statistically significant difference (P &rt; 0.05).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>cool, that's 300 people. there are a recorded 165 million cases so far, what'd you think that 300 is worth in comparison ? can you imagine "hey boss, i found out that 0.000018% of cases isn't bad, we can safely ignore the findings in the rest of the 99.999982% that may contain asymptomatic cases as well"</p>

I have more muscle in my leg than you have in that totality that is your amorphous mass.

<p>The masks aren’t just “not perfect” they’re not terribly effective at all. At least not in the way that they’re being used. If the mandates required n95 masks, sure. Most people are wearing homemade cloth masks that provide something like a 3% filtration rate.</p>

        <p>I'm not really interested in quotes from Fauci. He is just one person and his statements don't speak for the scientific community. Non-surgical masks appear to be decently effective, just not anywhere close to 100%. I am not a big supporter of the mask requirements or something, I just believe the science shows they do help.</p>

        <p>Here’s the hang up. Some science shows that they “may” help. Other science shows that they don’t help at all. In fact, there isn’t a single randomized controlled trial that proves efficacy of face masks. Not one. I don’t care if people wear masks, I just think that these mandates were based on politicized and heavily biased “scientific” suggestion. There’s no conclusive benefit to them in medical settings and the covid data here in the US sends very mixed signals about their efficacy as well.</p>

        <p>There are several studies showing the effectiveness of surgical face masks. I agree there isn't a lot of solid information regarding clothe face masks, but the more studies I read the more it seems like the general consensus is that they are somewhat effective. I do think masks were overemphasized and the real effective tools for handling a virus like this are social distancing and vaccination.</p>

        <p>Somewhat effective is not good enough. It’s a viral illness that is aerosolized. Reduce the number of droplets means nothing when most, if not all aerosols are being spewed nearly unimpeded. I’m sure that some level of efficacy helps, but it’s essentially trying to catch a swarm of gnats with a tennis racket. You may hit some, but the bulk of them are going right through</p>

        <p>That's a decent analogy, but the amount getting through is definitely up for debate. I think the amount of evidence showing they help somewhat justifies their use, but I don't think it justifies federal or state enforcement. I think it should be decided by individual businesses. </p>

        <p>That’s the point that I think most people are trying to make. The science isn’t settled and therefore mandates cannot be justified on the basis of unsettled science. It amounts to enforcing restrictions backed by conjecture. Wear a mask if you think it helps. Don’t wear one if you don’t. The risk acceptance should be at the personally level. </p>
<p>I’m up in the air on it. On one hand, I love that people arent standing on me while I’m waiting in line at the grocery store, but as far as it’s efficacy in preventing spread I’m not entirely sure. MIT recently released a study that came to the conclusion that it doesn’t really matter how far apart you are if you’re in an enclosed space, what matters is the filtration system of the room you’re in. I think 6 feet is arbitrary as aerosols remain suspended for very long periods of time until acted upon by another source. For example, we may be 6 feet apart in a line, but everything you’re breathing out is staying the air around you for me to walk into when it’s my turn to move up.</p>

<p>I completely agree with your point on social distancing, but I was thinking more about distancing that involved not being in the same building. I think that should have been the focus early on instead of masks, but I can understand why people see that as a violation of their rights.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if most people here are insane. Some people subscribe to a lot of far out conspiracy theories, but for the most part people here just want to be left alone to make their own choices. There are a lot of logical points made, both about masks and vaccines, but they get drowned out by people who come here with sole intent of arguing. The same could be said of any sub, really. </p>
<p>It’s not a far fetched idea that staying away from people and not congregating in large groups would potentially prevent the spread of illness. We do that naturally when we are sick. We tend to stay home when we don’t feel well. It’s sort of an innate response. That was the point of lockdowns though. Nearly every, if not every single state, locked down for an extended period of time, but the problem was that a complete lockdown was not possible. People can’t stay locked in doors for an extended time as most of the population cannot afford a disruption in income. It seems logical that people completely isolating from each other would eliminate the virus, but I just don’t believe it’s possible</p>

        <p>To add to the aerosols, if you can smell any scent such as perfume or smoke from a cigarette passing through your mask, you are inhaling aerosols that may or may not be carrying the virus. The masks stop large droplets. Cool yeah, whatever. Have you thought about the effects on the human body from rebreathing your exhaled air? How much bacterial build up happens in the mask in a short amount of time? How that hypoxia can develop after long-time mask wearing? Actually, they’re starting a study in December 2021 about hypoxia from wearing masks. That can be found at clinicaltrials.gov, along with the vaccines and when their human trials end, which is 2023.</p>

<p>No they aren't but people have been treating them like they are. How many more people were infected because they went out or got too close with this false sense of security? Do you think that might be why areas with masks mandates actually have somewhat higher rates of infection?</p>

        <p>hey, idiot here. The reason he changed his policy is not as you said. You are factually incorrect, which is fine, we don't have high expectations for you. They didn't realize how transmittable the disease was and that it had such a high asymptomatic rate. As well, there were supply chain issues with masks and there were discussions that they may run out for healthcare workers.   </p>

        <p>So for the whole of modern medical history, there has been no study that definitively proves the efficacy of any type of mask at preventing the spread of viral respiratory illness, then all of the sudden masks are the only way to save society. Not only actual medical masks, but any old t shirt you can find and throw over your face. Your lack of ability to think critically makes you a strain on society.</p>

        <p>I feel like if I showed the studies that showed how masks do help or the fact that the vast majority of scientists agree they do, the dogma you're aligned with is going to override. In your reality, science is a cabal of liberals looking to infringe on western civilization. you're in fantasy land. </p>
<p>because you're committed to seeing the government as a perpetual monster looking to take away rights at every corner, you couldn't participate in a collective act to help one another. its easy decency but your butchered mind sees it as being a victim in a quixotic conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Show them. I’ve probably read and ripped apart every single study you think shows “proof” of efficacy. I challenge you to find one single randomized controlled trial that proves efficacy of masks.</p>

        <p>No my angle is not that it’s a conspiracy. I don’t subscribe to that line of thinking, I think our government is woefully inept, was unforgivably unprepared, and they needed to make it seem as if they were doing something. There’s not a single study that conclusively proves efficacy of masks. Not one. There are a plethora that suggest they don’t work, but the science isn’t exactly settled on that either. The reality is they threw sweeping and damaging mandates in place without scientific backing and then rushed to justify them with observational studies and predictive computer models with inbuilt biases toward mask efficacy.</p>

        <p>That’s the problem isn’t it? It’s not that scientific community is unaware that these studies exist, it’s that most don’t want to speak out in fear of losing grant money for research. We live in a time where saying the wrong thing, as innocuous as it might be, is grounds for complete dismissal. It’s not prudent to go against the status quo. There are however, multiple scientists and doctors who are speaking out about it, or are still publishing research on the topics, but are not getting mainstream attention. You also have to understand that this is a pandemic and the probably the best possible response to give if you’re in the community, but don’t necessarily believe the research backs mask wearing by the public, is to say that more research is needed on the subject, but we don’t advise against protective measures. Which is what most of them are doing. </p>
<p>The reality is that the science is not settled, but it’s been treated as so in order to validate restrictive measures that may or may not have been more harmful than the virus itself. The best thing that they could have done is admit that they don’t have all of the answers and advise people to do the simple things that we know for a fact have worked with other illnesses. Instead of being transparent, they pretended like they had all of the answers and ended up seeing a seed of division that could have been avoided.</p>

        <p>Thank you for admitting you’re stupid. That’s the first step toward doing something about it. </p>
<p>So you’re assuming that the people who agree with you are intelligent? Could it possibly be you’re agreeing with them because you don’t know any better? You’re blindly following the pack and assuming you’re following smart people, when in reality they’re equally as ill informed as the rest of us. The difference between us is that you blindly accepted what you were told and only look at things that confirm your bias. I on the other hand, looked at the information I was given, thought it was interesting, then looked at competing information and drew my conclusions from a completely informed position. I chose to look at all the data and found the evidence that masks don’t work to be more compelling. Is this to say that masks absolutely serve no benefit and that lockdowns absolutely cannot work in any capacity? No. I would say that the scientific studies that show lack of benefit or marginal efficacy are more compelling and less prone to bias as most of them were performed years prior to covid.</p>

Consensus ain't on your side.</p>

        <p>Those are not really outliers, in fact that's how cults like scientology and JW's get you, making you believe a bunch of crap while also making you think everyone else who is critical of the cult is trying to deceive you and feeding you false information. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The first step to recognize if you're being manipulated is accepting the fact that you CAN be manipulated and probably have been at many points of life but out of pride or whatever won't admit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So my point is, most people who have been brainwashed (be it by cults or or movements or whatever) will be paranoid about misinformation and actually act pretty critical of everything they don't believe already in. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If this applies to you or not is always a good excercise to make, since being absolutely certain that you (and those who you agree with) are the only ones being rational is a pretty good sign that you're not being as rational as you're thinking.</p>

        <p>While the statement is true, but given a big enough data space and a limited enough data visibility, one can easily wrongly conclude a median from a subset of data points.</p>
<p>Need to look at the big picture... But it begs the question, is our picture already the "big picture"? Thats the million dollar question.</p>

        <p>It's from the Matrix where Neo gets to choose between taking the red pill to learn the truth of the world or the blue pill to remain in ignorance. The directors originally meant it to be a subtle transgender reference as estrogen is a red pill but the idea has ironically been adapted by conservatives</p>

        <p>I can safely say that I avoided the brainwashing, once I got out past the 2 month mark.  By end of May 2020, I was seeing what was happening.  It wasn't clear to me in March/April of 2020.  By summer 2020, I was absolutely off the train, and that's presented it's own problems.  I'm not the outgoing person I was prior to 2020, anymore.  I don't look forward to things I used to look forward to, anymore.  I don't know if I'll ever want to hang out with others, just to be hanging out.  I basically just sit in my backyard, smoke, and drink coffee.  I aged a lot from 2020.  My trust of everyone from media to family and friends, is less than ever before.  My paranoia regarding anything and everything I hear, is off the charts.</p>
<p>And my blood pressure isn't getting a break from all of this, either.</p>

        <p>I’m ashamed to admit that I supported the lockdowns and masking at first and then the longer it went on the more I realized this was all complete authoritarian bull. </p>
<p>Masks do work when used properly which literally no one does. They all use the same filthy masks they don’t wash after every use/change after every use which cannot be healthy and defeats the purpose. </p>
<p>I remember one of my former coworkers (a veteran) told me back in March 2020 that he’d heard from his military friends that the government was already planning on a lockdown for a year or more. I thought he was crazy then but I realize now he just knew the truth before so many of us.</p>

        <p>Well you are very niave and have no idea what has taken place these last 16 months. We have proven the govt and media can tell us almost anything and radically change society at a moments notice with no backlash as long as they make us fearful. Do you think these vaccine passports for example will dissapear in the next year? They are creating a 2 tier society, vaccinated v non vaccinated, that is already different to what was normal 16 months ago. They will then build on it, first our vaccine records, then why not other medical records? Then why not our tax records, why not our driving liscence, why not our criminal records, why not our credit history etc. If we ban people from certain events for not being vaccinated then why not ban them if they have a criminal history etc. This is what they start to do in China, search online for the Chinese social credit system. Did you have any idea such a thing existed? The society will never be the same again.</p>

        <p>You are a useful idiot them. You got played by the media and govt because fear is the strongest emotion in the world and prevents people from questionning and thinking critically. Take the death count for example, do you take the figure at face value or do you realise the number is highly innacurate and the way they classify a covid death is as generous as possible? Like in the UK it is any cause of death up to 28 days after testing positive for Covid. This means even a car crash can be a covid death. Were you even aware of this?</p>

This is a health issue where millions worldwide have died.  This entire sub is a shrine to the Dunning-Kruger effect.  Just impressively sad and depressing that people like you exist.</p>

        <p>How are those two things actually connected?  You aren’t some rebel without a cause who knows the real truth.  You’re a selfish person that refuses to help his neighbors because “you see the real truth”.  When in fact you’re just a sad, ignorant person with their head in the sand.

        <p>Wow. How mind-boggling. You remind me of individuals I debated with way back when who insisted that Iraq had WMDs because the government and media said so. Similarly, nothing I said could convince them otherwise since all of the “reports” and “data” were obviously true and I was just a tinfoil hat-wearing kook. 🙄 </p>
<p>One day you’ll (hopefully) realize how incorrect you were. Also, I’m not doing your research for you. You can discover the truth yourself. Good day.</p>

        <p>What a nonanswer.  Also, no one is asking you to “do the research for me”, I asked for a source to back up anything you said.  You aren’t debating either, you’re just throwing up nonsense rebuttals with sources that contradict your own claims.</p>
<p>This is the problem with talking to people like you.  You have your feelings, but no actual data to back it up.  So instead of taking the smart, safe bet, you act like you’re some lone wolf.  Meanwhile you’re actively hurting society and you’re only able to because of the privilege coming from the very science you rail against.</p>
<p>Pathetic.  Absolutely detrimental to society.</p>

        <p>Not my argument.  Really it’s just trust scientists about a pandemic that’s killed a whole bunch of people.  Honestly I don’t care if nonmaskers don’t, I consider that Darwinism... I just think it’s sad for the people that have to suffer for “your freedoms”.  Because viruses are infectious and your actions effect others.  I would not mind if nonmaskers stopped using all safety devices that evil scientists have created.  Me and my friends/family will be okay since we aren’t morons.</p>

        <p>I’m not necessarily even opposed to masks — if people want to wear them then so be it, but if people don’t then who cares? Masks mandates were about as foolish as shutting the economy down.</p>

<p>And, yeah, I’ve been to a university — I went for like nine years, actually. But it’s clear this is an ego-driven thing for you. Like most other pro-mask and pro-vAxX extremists, constantly adhering to the rules of the pandemic gives your mundane life some excitement. I see. That’s cool, though. </p>
<p>I don’t know anyone who’s died from Covid-19 and I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who’s died from it. But lest we forget how scary it is!! Better wear your mask!!!</p>

        <p>My neighbor has two family members that have died from it.  They’re older so it makes sense.  I had two friends who didn’t really have any symptoms.  And one friend that was laid out for two weeks and said it was the worst pain in their life.</p>
<p>So it’s really great that you haven’t personally suffered and you can laugh in survivor rate percentage.  However, not everyone can say the same.  Your actions are selfish and shitty.</p>
<p>Anyways, you aren’t brave for not wearing a mask nor do you have the science figured out, you’re just a huge piece of shit that thinks being a contrarian is a personality trait.</p>

        <p>3.5 million? Only 5% of 566,000 deaths in America were directly related to covid. The other 95% had 3-4 other medical conditions/diseases. Don’t you read the cdc? It’s a fact the numbers have been manipulated. But you’re brainwashed so you won’t even go find out for yourself and somehow feel more comfortable promoting 3.5 million covid deaths.</p>

        <p>How many of those 3.5 million would NOT have died if it hadn't been for CoVid? </p>
<p>5%. 20%. 50%. You get that the virus compromised their bodies more than just having whatever ailments they already suffered from? It wasn't ONLY just CoVid. Having the virus made it worse. A lot worse. Fuck, why is this so hard to understand?</p>

        <p>You’re giving too much credit to covid. You’re looking at these medical conditions/diseases as if covid compromised their bodies and if it wasn’t for covid they would of survived. That’s not the case, Imagine all the people dying in the hospital before covid okay? Well the same people are dying for the same reason the only difference is the PCR test said that they tested positive for covid. You phrase it like these people came into the hospital because of covid and since they already have medical conditions, covid simply turned those conditions fatal. Covid is not the tipping point, they were already going to die. Another important thing to account for with statistics, is if you tested positive for covid within 28 days of death it is listed as a Covid death.</p>

        <p>No, I see you making wild leaps with unsupported claims to TRY and back your brainless narrative. Somehow, in that paranoid mush bowl on your neck, you translate “these people died from COVID, but had supporting diseases/complications besides ONLY COVID symptoms alone” to “oh mer gawd numbers r manipulated so George Soros and Bill Gates can turn us into human batteries”. I’ve yet to hear a SINGLE valid excuse for why the CDC is trying to brainwash us, it’s baseless fear mongering so you can feel like victims of an imaginary threat. Restrictions are being lifted, shit is normal again in most states and in countries that didn’t have dumbasses like you grinding progress to a halt, but every precaution taken from the get go has been some horseshit conspiracy to you loons.</p>
<p>I lost 3 people to COVID this last year. Two were elderly with no complications besides being old, the third was 32, and more fit than you would ever be in your wildest dreams. He died of heart failure in December, caused by nothing other than clots and lung damage from COVID. Doubtless you’d sperg out and claim he died only of heart failure, while ignoring it was caused by COVID, which is why I thank Christ you’re no one of importance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you chose to twist it into something it doesn’t say. Nothing on there says “COVID isn’t lethal, very few people died from it, actually”. It claims that there were contributing factors, like age, weight, and other health issues. You inflated it to “ITS A HOAX!”</p>

        <p>Stop! Rational, logic based thinking thinking, backed by science, is not allowed here. These are the same people who think Global Warming is a hoax because it snowed this year, or that world hunger doesn’t exist because they just ate. They’d sooner get their world views from a Facebook meme than anywhere with a degree of fact checking. Then they try to pretend like they’re the rational ones? I swear, I almost believe this is a satire sub. Plagiarizing the N64 logo is also a crime against humanity.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I wish you mooks actually said this shit out loud before you typed it, because that’s dumb as hell. What was it based on there, sport? The desire to keep you from drinking margaritas at Applebee’s? Because every other country that had a clean, 2 week to one month lockdown, got over it quick, and back to work. Australia did it flawlessly, so did New Zealand, and places with denser populations, like Japan, ran circles around our mortality rate. Again, because they didn’t have to deal with contingents of dumbshits like you, who think Googling conspiracy blogs equals an epidemiology degree. It’s why I’m at least happy you’re unimportant in the grand scheme of things.</p>

        <p>Impressive how the nation with the fewest lockdown rules had the most infections, most deaths, and just got lucky they are bailed out by the vaccine. Are all these statistic fabricated? Are the bodies in the ground too? Its worrying how little anybody here demonstrates knowledge about the science, but if you do I would love to hear somebodies interpretation here. I’m willing to change my mind since doubt is the basis of the scientific method.</p>

        <p>So 10 times more deadly than the flue, the number is 98,2% for the US, that would be out of 328.2 million a total of 5.904.000 people, so multiple millions. Then this is calculated based on current cases it doesn’t account for people who did get proper protection, like elderly people in homes. Furthermore, this also doesn’t account for overloading the IC units in hospitals which would result in the number growing exponentially from people who cannot get other diseases treated, or are denied healthcare. This is despite the fact that large numbers of people dying hurt the economy the most of anything possible. I provided sources below, I would love to see your sources. Again I’m open to have my mind changed. </p>

        <p>Right? 3.4 million people died from a worldwide pandemic. There was a massive push for people to get vaccines. Now that most people who are getting the vaccine, either got it or are scheduled to get it, it is reasonable to allow vaccinated people to start taking part in physical and social activities again.  </p>
<p>Imagine after all that happening, your reaction is "Wow, so this was all jut a hoax, huh?" YIKES!</p>

        <p>Why? You assume im someone with no compassion? Very simple minded. Our countries and lives are being destroyed, causing harm to everyone, secondary deaths like missed cancer treatments and suicides, mental health issues, poor education, lonely boring lives, lost jobs, poverty, unnecessary stress and fear. I am trying to make you aware of the exaggerated deaths with good intentions as covid deaths are not the be all and end all, there are lots of other negative things taking place as a result of our attitudes towards covid that we need to put into perspective.</p>
