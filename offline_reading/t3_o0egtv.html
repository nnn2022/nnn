    <strong>Why do people trust the system so much?</strong>
    <p><p>I have friends who have died in rural America, who didn't have medical insurance, or the right health care, because they didn't have enough money and good care. I survived myself but had to fight to do it. I believe the quacks out there would have killed me by my 20s if I was the trusting type. [there are good doctors but there's many bad ones]</p>
<p>The problems with money and lack of medical care, means a bunch of friends died in their 40s and 50s. Gen X is not living as long as Boomers unless they are wealthier.  I have seen my husband pushed into gig employment after job lay offs. We will chip away at stimulus savings for him to see his specialist. Fortunately nothing was wrong costing thousands. I have moved twice to places I knew no one to escape homelessness in my past.</p>
<p>I have seen lying bosses, the greedy and the corrupt and seen a small rural town economically destroyed as factories closed one by one. I have seen lives destroyed and other people disabled. I think the system sucks.</p>
<p>For all you ultra conservatives here, realize many of us are too poor to believe in the American dream. We haven't been able to build lives in the same way. My household even is on the entreprenaur side of things, where we have sold things to survive like ebay etc in the past. He works for himself in gig employment after job lay offs, no more benefits, holidays etc. A lot of his work got cut with Covid. I worry about the future poverty coming because many gig and freelance jobs are not coming back.</p>
<p>You have an argument against "socialism" screwing people's lives up too with the control freaks and authoritarianism, but post capitalism has pushed many into poverty or lives working low level jobs. If people are going "communist" it's because they are tired of dead end jobs and living hand to mouth with no future. </p>
<p>Before I was disabled even with a college degree, I had to work 4 part time jobs once to pay for a crappy apt and old car and none offered health insurance. If one has health problems or is autistic, or looks a little different expect to be sent out into the woods. You may have a good family but for many of us [especially white] people, since the 1980s it all became competition and if you didn't reach a certain level you got ostracized from the family dinners. </p>
<p>The book Bowling Alone talked about the destruction of community. I saw some real community for a brief time in the small rural town but it got decimated, otherwise my life has been one being moved from one small white walled box to the other, and a litany of strangers. </p>
<p>I don't trust the system. Why should I? I've been lied to so much of my life. </p>
<p>Why do these idiots expect me to trust them? Like they want to keep me safe. They never kept me safe before.</p></p>

        <p>What's most baffling is the same people that spent most of their life railing against the system, now defend it and trust it implicitly. Even those fully aware of the very long, totally uninterrupted history of it being corrupt as fuck. </p>
<p>I think the real difference between then and now is the fact that journalism used to have <em>some</em> integrity, and now has <em>none at all.</em></p>

        <p>I am noticing I am disenchanted with a lot. I support anti-racism causes but among fellow liberals/leftists, I think the world is on fire, and you ignore the growing totalitarianism that is going to destroy POC lives as well as our own? I don't even know where to start. I belong to a few groups where I have said a few things but everyone's so indoctrinated.  I was deemed a "radical" a few joked about that when I said I didn't want to vote for Biden--sadly gave in, wish I had not. I know a lot got mad because I quoted Chris Hedges. [See Death of the Liberal Class] The days of WTO protests and Occupy railing against the corporations and Wall Street are over, liberals and leftists [aka neoliberals] have become bootlickers to the elite. I can't go the dominionist authoritarian right either, guess I belong no where now. Journalism is dead. The local newspapers have been dying, for a long time, we got mostly corporate newspeak and are there even investigative journalists anymore. They bitched about Trump destroying the press but the liberal side did too. We don't have a free press anymore, everything is corporate owned. Why should I trust a bunch of corporate corrupt assholes with their experiment? I don't want to be the sucker sitting there as they say WHOOPS MY BAD.</p>

        <p>We're in the same boat. I didn't vote for Biden, but I'm in California, so I knew my vote didn't matter. I wrote in my dad. Not a wasted vote at all, in my eyes. He gets a kick out of it still. </p>
<p>I can't, with any kind of conscience, continue to vote for Democrats. I don't want to vote republican, but I've become a single issue voter because of this "pandemic." </p>
<p>If the special interest groups want my support back, they can stick with the one thing they're advocating for and not accepting wholesale Marxism across the board. </p>
<p>I'm not gonna feel bad if their rights get rolled back in the meantime because we elect Republicans. I'm just not.</p>

        <p>I am in a blue state so my vote didn't really matter either. I actually did not want to vote for Biden but gave in to peer pressure, something I badly regret. I was caught up in the Trump stuff too much. I will not vote Democrat anymore and I can't vote Republican. I may vote for Greens, I have in the past, but with the cries of "throw away vote" in my ears. </p>
<p>I can't be Republican either, I don't want the Dominionist flavor of authoritarianism too, and I am too poor and disabled, be told to go die in the gutter as they cut everything and give employers the right to pay as little as possible just isn't going to cut it. I see some of what Republicans mean when they shout about "socialism" but some don't seem to get that Gen X and below are far poorer, and the same jobs for lives are not there.</p>
<p>If the young are going full Communist, they are tired of living in Mom's basement. College isn't paying off either. Most jobs are a joke and not ones you can build a life for family on. I guess I am a single issue voter too. Democrats have disappointed me with the march to totalitarianism I'm done. It's all BS. They ignored economics for years as all our lives were destroyed. The Democrats betrayed the working class in 2016, I refused to vote for Hillary and didn't vote for Trump, voted third party but I made a giant mistake here, with that creep Biden whose far more dangerous to us then Trump ever was. Well all of them belong to the same club anyway.</p>
<p>My state is probably going to go full red, so many businesses have been destroyed, we got an uber Covid disciple as a governor, but that may be the only thing holding off vaccine passports and other BS I don't want.</p>

        <p>They <em>haven't</em> always been this way. CRT and Marxism infected the party only recently. Sure, if you're a teenager, then it feels like they've "always been this way," but it's simply not the case.</p>

        <p>Yeah I remember that too, they just let people die and didn't do anything. Even now I am sure people with AIDs or HIV struggle in getting meds they need. I am in disabled circles, want to know how many had medical bankruptcies? My husband hasn't had medical insurance except for a brief time in 10 years. Even one of his jobs cut his medical insurance down so low, when I was on his supplemental, I had to order my prescription meds from overseas to get them cheap enough. Medicare D came later but if that ever gets removed by Republicans, I'll be dead. Mental health care, is barely existent now for the poor. Even counselors want 170-200 an hour, I have to pay around 65-70 an hour, but can't afford it. There's no more sliding scale fees or mental health programs, not like there was for the poor in the 1990s. Yeah this entire place is a lie. We are supposed to believe they care and want to "rescue us". No these assholes destroyed our lives to make profit and to get control. So many veterans are homeless now.</p>

        <p>&rt;For all you ultra conservatives here, realize many of us are too poor to believe in the American dream. </p>
<p>The American dream is not about money, it's about taking ownership of your own situation and working to make a better life.  What  you are actually saying in this is not that you are too poor, but that you are too lazy.</p>
<p>What (if anything) have you and your husband done to avoid "the gig economy"?  You have a college degree, but obviously not in anything that will actually provide you with a good job, and stable income.</p>
