    <strong>Let's have an honest dialogue about the spike protein (and the vaccine)</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys, like many of you, I believe there is something sketchy going on with these mRNA vaccines and that their long-term safety is questionable. Based on what I've read, I think the most convincing argument about this is that the spike protein being manufactured by these mRNA vaccines appears to concentrate in organs, e.g. the heart and ovaries, and is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, versus their original claim that it would stay isolated in the shoulder muscle (I don't have a source for this claim, so if anyone can supply it, I would be grateful). If we assume that regular "booster" shots will be required, as it appears to the be case now, then we are essentially consenting to regular injections of poison into our bodies (as we know the spike protein is harmful).</p>
<p>However, it is my understanding that the spike protein on the virus itself has the ability to do all of the aforementioned stuff (i.e. concentrate in organs, cross blood-brain barrier) as well. Hence (please correct me if I'm wrong), the same reasons that we believe the vaccine is dangerous applies to the virus itself. I don't know all the numbers, but it seems like the vaccine is fairly effective at preventing hospitalization/serious reactions. In this case, wouldn't it make sense, from the perspective of probability, to get the vaccine? In other words, if everyone is eventually going to be exposed to this virus (debatable, but let's say this is true), wouldn't it be better to get the vaccine and drop your chances of serious reactions with the understanding that any reaction you get from the vaccine is probably one that you would get from the virus as well (but maybe less severe, as they tout)? I mean, presumably, one can just get it once to get better odds on the virus and then reject the booster shots.</p>
<p>Please point out any flaws in my reasoning or if I'm missing some facts (sources, of-course, are most welcome). I ask this question here as I believe this is the only place where I can get answers that would go against the mainstream narrative (i.e. go get your vaccine...it's 100% safe!).</p>
<p>Looking forward to an interesting, enlightening discussion.</p>
<p>EDIT: To summarize some very interesting points made so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intravenous versus intranasal spike protein concentrations in the organs are about 10x (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8). If I'm not mistaken, this means that we stand to get less of the stuff from the actual virus. Although, a caveat is that this is not comparing the vaccine versus the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative treatments like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine appear to be quite effective and do not carry the risk associated with the spike protein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination." (http://q17.ca/reading/vx/bio/the-safety-of-covidvaccines-09-00693-v2.pdf) One caveat however is that it seems like the number of adverse side effects is 700 per 100,000 vaccinations and the number of serious ones is 16 in 100,000. It's unclear if these numbers are better versus unvaccinated (if the vaccine studies are to be believed, I would think they are).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural infection allows one to fare better against variants/mutations.</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>Real-world experience suggests otherwise. Women weren't complaining about weird periods before the injections started. Now both injected and injection-free women (who are around injected people) are reporting weird periods. It happened to me for 3 months after people around me got injected.</p>
<p>Before people started getting injected, if the coronavirus was actually in wide circulation, I would have been heavily exposed. During lockdown, I regularly met up with a large group of friends without distancing or masks, and I traveled by plane several times. I never got sick or had any weird health problems. I still haven't gotten sick, but the 3 months of weird periods starting in March is certainly concerning.</p>

        <p>That is really weird. I also wonder about how wide-spread the virus actually is versus how much of it is false-positives due to inaccurate tests. I've heard that women sync up their periods, so maybe that is part of the reason?</p>

        <p>Woman here, and I don’t think it has anything to do with the syncing of periods, that wouldn’t cause some of the issues I’m having. This is what I know from personal experience:
My cycle has been seriously jacked up since my coworkers started getting the vaccine. I was getting my period every other week, until it just stopped. I’m not pregnant, but I’ve missed two now. </p>
<p>Also what I know from people close to me:
My sister is pre menopausal, and had stopped cycling until people around her started getting the jab. Her period has come back with a vengeance, and starts whenever she is in close contact with someone vaccinated. </p>
<p>My friend got the jab, and started severely cramping and bleeding. The weird thing in her case is she had to have her uterine lining removed years ago… so she has no idea how she is bleeding (the procedure ended her cycle).</p>

        <p>90% of positive PCR tests were false positives because every lab used cycle thresholds that were too high. <a href="https://archive.is/VIFhL">https://archive.is/VIFhL</a> Also, people were being diagnosed with Covid even without testing.</p>
<p>I was around the injected people only 8 hours per week while they all got their first and second doses and for several months afterward. 8 hours per week is not enough exposure to sync up periods. Also, this has happened to women regardless of the sex of the injected people they were exposed to. By the way, my exposure was in a work situation in California, and everyone wore masks-- N95 or double masks. (I wore a single-layer chiffon mask because I know they are useless and I like to be comfortable).</p>

        <p>Wow! Thanks for the article. Given this, I'm almost tempted to call it a systemic fraud and brainwashing.</p>
<p>The period thing is very bizarre, definitely something keep an eye on. Have you been tested for covid since March? (In this case, the overly high cycle thresholds might actually be meaningful.) I'm not a doctor (humble-brag: I technically am), but I think you being (mostly) asymptomatic but infected might explain the situation.</p>

        <p>I've never been tested and I have no plans to be. It would be interesting to have avoided Covid infection all that time, only to get it (as opposed to the shedded spike proteins) as soon as everyone started getting injected. It's also interesting that both injected women and non-injected women started getting period problems as soon as the injections started.</p>
<p>Overly-high PCR cycle thresholds are never meaningful. If you want a positive test to have any chance of meaning anything, the CT should not be above 28. And if you were shocked by The New York Times article from August 2020, you might also be shocked to learn that the reason injection-free people are diagnosed with Covid at a higher rate than injected people is because the CDC quietly announced on their website that they will not count positive tests in their case numbers for injected people unless 2 criteria are met: The CT cycle is 28 or lower, and the person is hospitalized with severe Covid symptoms. Injection-free people are still counted as positive cases with CT cycles of 45 and no symptoms.</p>

        <p>Humans are a complicated system, so let's talk about strawberries.</p>
<p>Anyhow, did you know they once isolated the component of a strawberry that makes it taste like strawberries so they could use it as a food additive?  Makes sense, right?  You could grow it in vats and concentrate it and not have to deal with all the bulk of the fruit.  Unfortunately, this strawberry flavor compound on its own was poisonous.  Somehow it was some other unflavored compound in real strawberries that neutralized the toxin and made them safe to eat, you couldn't separate them out and get them to work the same.  Funny that.</p>
<p>Anyhow, so back to humans and covid.  Now, this is speculating, which is the first step to working out what experiments might be worth running to actually understand how complex systems work, but it's entirely possible that the spikes being part of the covid virus make them less harmful than when they run rampant on their own.</p>
<p>Maybe the virus takes longer to replicate, giving the body more time to begin sweeping up the bits when there is more to it than just spike protein.  I mean, the virus goes through a whole long hijacking process that contains other parts, and also has the goal of reproduction at is core.  The spike proteins are one and done, but they were supposed to just stay on our cells... although it appears science modeling was wrong on that, since the reality is they get around instead of staying in the arm.  Also, maybe it's just that the whole virus is covered in spike, but is only going to bind with one cell... your immune system can still potentially interact with the other spikes hanging on your cell surface after it hijacks, but a billion loose spike proteins can destroy a billion cells, since they aren't linked with each other either.</p>
<p>We already were wrong on so many agents of action on these vaccines... which is cause for investigating them further and study.... although if we did that, then we wouldn't have our panacea, and that's what the people and the politics want.  The actual pursuit of knowledge is tertiary at best, also behind the pursuit of money.  Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is not profitable.</p>
<p>They possibly could have had their cake and eaten it too if they allowed ivermectin to be given along with the vaxx to potentially soak up some of the rogue spike proteins, but that would be too much compromise on their end.</p>

        <p>I personally havent heard of the heart/blood and nervous system issues from getting the virus. I have heard of flu symptoms and loss of taste/smell, breathing issues, as well as being fatigued.</p>
<p>Seems to me the vaccine effects that are reported are not inline with the common effects from the virus at all.</p>
<p>That is what I am of the opinion of based off what I've been reading off and on since this started. Take that with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>I think I've seen a study saying that the virus also causes heart inflammation and can cross blood-brain barrier. In fact, during the summer last year, I think there was a study showing that it showed up in male testicles. (Yikes.)</p>
<p>Actually, I just spent some time looking it up and it seems we have another point against the vaccine. It sounds like intravenously administered spike protein concentrates at 10x more than intranasal:</p>

        <p>Yeah it is so unknown but the simple reason I have is i had covid and have gotten alittle sick once since. I don't want my body to rely on a vaccine as I feel healthy and my body has treated me well so far and does have antibodies.  The vaccine kills a certain antibodies (forgot the name).all of them and you cant give plasma with the vaccine. I used to give plasma twice a week. And no when your not sick you dont spread covid that is a lie.i wash my hands and dont want anybody to get sick I really do care about people and want everybody to be happy and get what they want in life. Right or wrong that is my reason personally.</p>

        <p>Makes sense. I think for the majority of healthy people, we'll be fine without the vaccine. I'm also pretty sure I caught it, but I had very few symptoms. I just wish I knew more about how the spike protein works in our bodies when we get it from a vaccine versus the virus.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is not proven to produce antibodies in everyone, hence the CDC change on antibody testing and those it does produce are only for a small specific part of the virus, that's why a mutation in the virus will render the vaccine more ineffective than it already is</p>
<p>Your body will produce antibodies for the whole virus and will be more effective at dealing with mutations</p>

        <p>This study talks about how a mutation evades antibodies produced both from vaccine and infection, but the second to last paragraph mentions the antibodies that will offset this, those a antibodies are not produced by the vaccine, only through infection</p>
<p>It is why vaccines such as the measles vaccine is so effective, it uses the whole virus albeit a weakened version to produce a natural immune response</p>

<p>It also brings up points that were mentioned early in the pandemic a number of times by the UK CMO who said that the vast majority of people will not catch this virus and that we already have a natural immunity due to exposure to other coronavirus such as the common cold</p>
<p>There have been studies that estimated approx 60% of the population would have an acquired immunity due to this fact</p>

        <p>Thanks for the article. What I understand from the article is that a few small changes in the amino acid makeup of the virus could cause interference with antibody binding, which sounds like technical jargon for variants can easily foil the vaccine. Your point about old-school vaccines makes a lot of sense. I think the narrative about mRNA vaccines is that it's hard/takes too long to isolate the whole virus. (Probably true.) I don't know how to take news from government/officials. Initially I thought they were trying to calm us and not make us panic (at least Trump's initial remarks gave me this feeling) -- we've caught them backtracking on their claims a few times -- but then the media switched over to full on fear-mongering. Hard to say what's real or not these days.</p>

        <p>This is a speculative oversimplification but: It matters how and where things are introduced into your body.  </p>
<p>A toxin being eaten, for example, can pass through the relatively controlled and closed system of your digestive tract (unless you have a leaky gut) without much harm but if you take the same toxin and inject it into your bloodstream, bad things can happen.</p>
<p>Regular infective processes are somewhere in the middle of that spectrum but a pretty big part of your immune system involves keeping certain things OUT of your bloodstream so it isn’t that big of a leap to envision scenarios where pumping an unknown quantity of spike protein into unknown places can get dodgy.</p>

        <p>It seems like there is a study demonstrating what you said: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8. Unfortunately, it's not in the context of a vaccine. But one can infer a similar reaction, I believe.</p>

        <p>I wish I still had the link but there is an interesting (though small) study in which around 3 or 4 in each of several groups of 12ish exhibited their vaccine-induced spike proteins in locations other than the muscles around the injection site.</p>
<p>This alone is interesting because one of the first bullets in the initial ‘why the vaccine is safe’ pr kit was something reassuring about that NOT happening.  Wonder if that was retconned out by now but I feel like if that was one of the drug companies’ pillars of safety, they should be a little alarmed.</p>
<p>Overall, to your point about infection also resulting in circulating spike proteins, I think it all goes back to the nuances of infection being handled differently by different bodies.  I would postulate that the populations in which things go wrong, this 3/12 risk of rogue proteins may still put them in a better position than natural infection.  But in people whose bodies handle the infection ‘well’, the relative risk is higher.  </p>
<p>But that is what the studies are for - and resulting debates like this one - and it would just be cool if everyone looked at them with more clear heads and fewer agendas.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I've already been infected with covid so I won't be getting the vaccine but my folks haven't and are debating it. I'm leaning towards it not being in their best interest to get it but I want to be able to thoroughly convince myself. Thanks for your comment.

        <p>I have. It proves that the spike protein is dangerous, but that means so is the virus. How do we know these people would not have had the same reaction if they were exposed to the virus? It is a bit disgruntling, but what if this is a case of saving 10 lives at the cost of one life?</p>

        <p>Prions?  Little to none from my understanding.  From what I've read the gene therapy does not produce an abundance is sterilizing ABs, unlike those from exposure to the wild virus.</p>

<p>Which is why it’s better to get the highly survivable CoViD and let your immune system handle it than consent to an experimental mRNA prion “vaccine” who’s companies can’t be held liable for adverse side effects.</p>

        <p>The first paper...yikes. The second paper sounds like it's saying the spike protein is dangerous, which I'm aware of. I don't quite see the connection with the third paper however?</p>
