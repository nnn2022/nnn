    <strong>The Vax is SAFE? Don't mind the 653 Deaths + 12,044 Other Injuries Reported to VAERS</strong>
    <p><p><em>The numbers reflect the latest data available as of Feb. 4 from the CDC‚Äôs Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website.</em> <strong><em>Of the 653 reported deaths, 602 were from the U.S. The average age of those who died was 77, the youngest was 23.</em></strong></p>
<p>So, who's next for the vax? Step right up for the vax! You sir, you look like a fine chap, how about a nice little jab for you? Don't worry, you won't feel a thing. </p>

        <p>And remember these deaths are the ones ‚Äúofficially attributed‚Äù to be caused by a vaccine. </p>
<p>We keep seeing headlines of old people and doctors dying after having this mRNA product and their deaths being labelled due to something else.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Potentially dodgy maths, didn't double-check!</strong></p>
<p>While I'm not trying to downplay the side effects, which, so far, seem to be more dangerous than the virus itself, I'm kind of curious if there are further sources out there. VAERS say they only account for 1% of vaccine injuries and specifically for Covid they only have 12,697 Reports Through February 5, 2021. Considering how many people have been vaccinated already (I think VAERS only accounts for the US, but don't quote me on that).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/</a>, 50.1 million people in the US have had the vaccine.</p>
<p>If we assume that VAERS reports account for 1% of vaccine injuries (This ranges from the mildest effects to death), multiplying the 12,697 reports that are on record to assess how many total "accidents" there have been leads us to a grand total of 1,269,700 (12697 / 0.01).</p>
<p>Dividing this number by the amount of vaccinated people results in 2.53% of vaccinations have had side effects. If 653 deaths are 1%, then 65,300 are 100%, meaning that 0.13% of vaccinations result in death. Looking at the death reports on VAERS you will notice that this affects mostly people aged 80 and over.</p>
<p>This is not to say that this bears any significance in regards to vaccine safety. I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of vaccine deaths would also have occurred if the respective people would have come into contact with the actual virus.</p>
<p>Which spikes the question, if the vaccine mortality rate is THAT close to the mortality rate of the actual virus, why vaccinate in the first place?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we understand that this entire charade has a lot of money and economic interests behind it and there is a chance (not saying it's the case, not saying it isn't) that the virus is being used as a smokescreen for <em>something</em>. Quo bono? Who profits?</p>
<p>Again, take this with a grain of salt. I have no backup on these numbers, they came from quick DuckDuckGo searches and not from multiple searches, so make of it what you will. Yes, vaccine deaths are tragic and likely preventable, but we shouldn't fall for sensationalism.</p>

        <p>I think a sane and non-politicised view would be that if there are vaccine side effects, given it's a new type, it's still safer than the virus itself for the vulnerable. However, it should not be mandated to those whose risk level is considerably lower.</p>
<p>However, since it is massively politicised and backed up by propaganda, we are being coerced into accepting there's not even a single incidence of a side effect and everyone must have it.</p>
