    <strong>Growing Up In (And Leaving) A Fundamentalist Religion Taught Me The Importance Of Questioning Things. Anyone Else Here In The Same Boat?</strong>
    <p><p>I grew up in a fundamentalist religion that believes they have the absolute truth.  We were told that our leaders were always right, and that we should do whatever they said without question.  We were told that to question any of the doctrines was to deny God and to put our souls in jeopardy.  Instead of "trust the science" it was "trust God's chosen messengers".  Any deviation from the narrative was met with consternation and discipline.  If you dared question "the truth" you were shunned and isolated.</p>
<p>It took me years of dealing with cognitive dissonance and soul searching before I was finally able to see through the lies (and admit to myself that they were lies), and to dissociate myself from it.  And it was a very painful process.  As I left the religion I endured threats and mental abuse, gaslighting and manipulation.  Instead of "you're killing grandma", I was told that I was "breaking my family's hearts", and it was implied that if they had a heart attack or a stroke or died from sorrow it was all my fault.  I was told that not only I, but my family and my friends would suffer terribly for my heresy and disobedience.  (Incidentally my family treated me with nothing but kindness and understanding through it all, which is amazing.  It was leadership and other people in the religion that gave me a terrible time).  It was a costly process.  But the dividend is what I learned from it and how that affects my life now.</p>
<p>I no longer can be fooled by dogma and calls for blind obedience.  I am inherently suspicious of anyone who says that their way is the "right way", especially people in positions of power.  I will never again be duped into following any absolutist religious ideology, including secular religions such as the Church of "The Science" (TM).  Anyone who tells you they know all of the answers is a fool at best, and a liar and charlatan more often than not.</p>
<p>Anyone else able to see through all of the bullcrap because of their history with fundamentalist religion?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT:  Was also just thinking...  "I hope you and your family get Covid and die" is the new "I hope you burn in hell".  So many fundamentalist religious parallels.  </p></p>

        <p>Nope but you hit it on the head.  The Science is a new religion now.  I'm impressed that you didnt.go to the other extreme and.embrace The Science and the true word.  My friend grew up like you did and he defends The Science 100%</p>

        <p>It's interesting, I've seen that too.  It's like some people need an "absolute truth" in their life, and just exchange one for another.  My undergraduate and graduate education are both in science fields incidentally, and I can't understand why anyone is so religious about it.  Science (real science) is a wonderful endeavor, but it's about constantly looking for and questioning truth - not about having it all already.</p>
