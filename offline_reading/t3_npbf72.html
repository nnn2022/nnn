    <strong>Obesity and COVID</strong>
    <p><p>This may be an unpopular opinion and definitely not a politically correct one but I don’t care, it’s true. </p>
<p>We know people who are obese are more likely to die from covid. The CDC found 78% of people hospitalized from COVID were obese (link attached at bottom). Obesity is a lifestyle choice. Just like how being healthy and staying in shape is. </p>
<p>It is not my responsibility to get vaccinated/mask up to protect obese people from COVID. They brought that on themselves. Everyone in the world knows if you’re fat you’re going to face more health problems than healthy people. It’s common sense. If you spend everyday filling you body with garbage fast food, chips, soda, and sugar YOU WILL FACE MORE ISSUES THAN A HEALTHY PERSON. That is your choice, and you know the risks. Don’t come bitching to me to protect you after you spent years doing this to yourself. I have no problem with people choosing to be fat, I have a problem with them choosing to be fat and then forcing/getting mad at me for not “protecting them”. Lose some damn weight, that’s your best bet against the virus. The problem stems from within YOU, I didn’t force feed you McDonald’s for 30 years everyday and then get you sick. YOU DID THAT. THAT IS NOT MY FAULT. </p>
<p>It is definitely possible to lose weight too... I wasn’t really obese but I was definitely overweight at one point (18 years old, 5 11, almost 240 pounds at my heaviest). I was lazy and fat. Realized I would live a short unhappy life, so turned that around. About 2 years later I’m now 170 pounds at 13% body fat. Anyone can do that. So stop blaming your problems on me and other people. Either give up the unhealthy lifestyle and you will be much less likely to die from COVID, or stop complaining and accept you are more likely to die, BECAUSE YOU ARE UNHEALTHY AND OBESE. </p>

        <p>More people should be talking about it, fuck being politically correct. The four most common comorbidities seen in COVID hospitalizations in adults are high blood pressure, obesity, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle choices play a <em>crucial</em> role in the development of these conditions. </p>
<p>We are far from hopeless against this virus, our only hope is far from a novel vaccine. We should start by demonstrating we give a shit about health in the first place and stop cheering for companies bribing people with boxes of fucking donuts or free booze for getting the vaccine, and stop trying to make a social justice movement out of being very overweight. Like, have we all gone fucking crazy?</p>

<p>Yeah but seriously it seems we ignore the actual issues because they could be “offensive” to people. The reality is if you’re fat you’re more likely to die in general than healthy people. Lifestyle choices for sure play a role in this kind of stuff, but no one wants to talk about it. Anywhere else and my post would’ve got downvoted all the way to hell because it’s too offensive. Fuck your safe spaces, truth matters.</p>

        <p>Because you can't slap a label on "lifestyle choices" and administer millions of doses of it. Even if they could, why would they want to? The chronic diseases that are borne from making shitty lifestyle choices are the very things that are lining the pockets of these pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>So that already makes me weary when they try to force me to take their medicine, but when we're not acknowledging the clear pattern arising from seeing exactly who is getting gravely ill from this virus, and we're out here giving them a years supply of McDouble Quarter Pounder Patty Melts for getting this vaccine, it makes you wonder what the fuck must be in the water these people are drinking to not see any issues with that.</p>
<p>If I'm a big pharmaceutical corporation trying to maximize my profit on the medicine I manufacture, I heavily rely on the presence of chronic disease in my target market. The things that prevent chronic disease are downplayed so profit can be maximized. That is exactly why lifestyle choices are downplayed, because they are a threat to revenue.</p>

        <p>Yeah well that makes sense. Too many powerful people would lose too much if everyone started making good lifestyle choices. So there is no incentive for them to market us a healthy lifestyle. Trillions are made every year off them filling peoples bodies with crap and then they sell them the “solution”... weight loss pills and other medication to make them “healthy”.... there are no shortcuts to a healthy lifestyle. People are too stupid to realize that though.</p>

        <p>Bingo, and we're being punished because we can see the value of taking care of your body, and think that a dicey vaccination is no substitute for that. People are free to vaccinate if they feel they need it, but trying to sell to me that I'm prolonging the pandemic because I would rather reduce spread in other meaningful, practical ways and promote widespread improvements in general health mediated by diet and exercise. It's fucking bullshit and I can't believe I'm seriously considering changing careers because my line of work is likely to require COVID-vaccination. Go against your principles or upend your entire life, that's the mentality of these people.</p>
<p>Sorry for the angry ranting, I just have been really stricken by anxiety by the idea that we're encouraging employers to require it, when these vaccines are far from the perfect solution or completely "safe and effective". It's not fair that people's futures could potentially be ruined for exercising medical autonomy.</p>

        <p>Yup I feel you. They’re selling us the problem then selling us the solution and people don’t see through this bullshit. Instead of promoting mass vaccination we should be promoting mass diet changes and healthy lifestyles because that’s the real solution to these types of things like COVID.  But obviously that solution doesn’t really make anyone any money, and not many people want to work that hard over such a long period. They want the easy way out. Crazy what we’ve came to. </p>
<p>No worries man, I feel you. Been a crazy last year with all our rights and freedoms being stripped from us. I sure as hell hope my employer doesn’t mandate it, and if they do, I’m hoping I can get away with the “religious card”, even though I’m not religious... or maybe I could just identify as vaccinated. Crazy times await though...</p>

        <p>The problem with this, and I'm not saying you are wrong, is that half the kids in ICU for covid were in ICU and got covid, they weren't in ICU for covid.</p>
<p>This is an ascertainment bias. If everyone in the hospital is checked for covid, there's going to be a high percent of people showing: hospitalized and covid. The same ascertainment bias that you will find with lots of covid deaths. Essentially, any serious medical condition can severely worsen your chances of survival with covid and if you hospitalized or die from it, they blame it on covid.</p>
<p>Now, the CDC says 42.4% of the population is obese. But the regular hospital population may just be 78% obese, on any given day.</p>

        <p>Yeah you’re right, but nevertheless in general if you are obese and unhealthy you are more likely to have hospital visits. Not even specific to COVID but you are at risk for far more illnesses/sicknesses than healthy people.</p>

        <p>The problem I'm having with this is where I live they're still forcing masks in the damn gyms and I can't work out like that. We can't all just become runners either, I like heavy lifting and my sciatica flares up when I run. I was in better shape than probably 80 or 90 percent of people before all this bullshit.</p>
<p>Ever since they closed the gyms I've felt more and more hopeless since that was my place to let off steam and now I've just gained so much weight. It's also a class thing because us in apartments can't just make a garage gym...I can't be lifting and jumping around on the upper floor of my complex. Closing the gyms the way they did was absolutely criminal.</p>

        <p>Completely agree. Gyms are probably the best way to counter viruses... healthy people have better immune systems. It is complete bullshit that they have been closed this whole time while (I’m in Ontario, Canada) our government owned/operated liquor stores, dispensaries, and fast food chains have all remained opened. Completely counterintuitive. I’m lucky enough to have a friend with a good home gym setup, so have for the most part kept my gains... but I know most others are losing all their hard earned progress. I really feel for you... if I lost everything I worked for over the past 2 years I would probably have given up.</p>

        <p>I'm lucky I don't have a desk job and my work has a weight setup, but working out at my place of employment is obviously not ideal. I can't really do full heavy workouts in work clothes but I'll take what I can get, at least it's something. I think if I had a sitting job though I'd probably be huge by now. I've also been walking my dog for longer but it's been a little hot out for her. </p>
<p>I can't imagine being in Ontario though, Silicon Valley is pretty bad but Canada has lost its mind. Soon they're gonna have to build a northern wall and our southern wall here will be to keep us down here from running to Mexico 😖 I hope it turns around soon because it's getting a little scary</p>

        <p>Yeah Canada is really scary right now... we have been on full lockdown since this all started. They keep dangling our freedom in front of us by saying as soon as X amount of people are vaccinated we’ll open up... well our Supreme Dictator, Doug Ford’s net worth has went from 3m (dec 2019) to over 50m now... I think he quite enjoys keeping the province locked down... I think a lot of our politicians do. They don’t give a fuck about us suffering and not being able to work... they love the easy money that they’re getting from shutting down their competition their (private) businesses face... seems like a little conflict of interest to me but that doesn’t really exist in Canada... they may get a $500 fine though!!!</p>

        <p>Baaah this is more fear covid19 bs. Remember how when you were a baby, doctors were saying that plump cheeks are a sign or health, and then, as a kid relatives were gathering around to pet your chubby belly as a sign of good luck, seeing you as a small Buddha which brings fortune into their life. Ok .. if you need a helicopter to get out of bed then it might be a problem, but i`ve seen plenty of obese peoples, not chubby, obese .. that are doing just fine.  Fat has an influence upon your health problems, if you have them, but saying that it`s a critical factor in Covid19`s pathology is just bs, as you could die just as easy from any other health problem amplified by fat. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand what you`re saying OP, im not sure why you are upset on them tho ? Might be 1 or 2 that said something to upset you, but im sure that most have no idea that they are beeing used by crazy murderous scientists as a tool to convince others of something. Maybe you should redirect your anger towards scientists, media and government ? In this case, the CDC  ? Just looks like alot of misplaced anger.</p>

        <p>No it’s more I’m sick of us as a society never addressing the real problems. I don’t care if you’re fat and choose to be unhealthy, but that isn’t an excuse to blame it on me. Obesity is a huge issue and no one seems to want to talk about it because it may offend someone. Not even just relating to COVID but in general. If you are fat and unhealthy you are undeniably more prone to sickness and other health complications compared to healthy people. And to take it a step further it pisses me off to see companies offering doughnuts and fast food to vaccinated people... get off your ass and lose some weight it’s not that hard.</p>

        <p>Obesity is not a "lifestyle choice" although it is frequently caused by bad lifestyle choices. It can also be caused by having bad childhood nutrition (growing up obese makes the weight almost impossible to lose in adulthood) or a number of hormonal/autoimmune disorders which are increasingly common which can cause uncontrollable weight gain.  </p>
<p>What is important is that obesity is highly correlated to other illnesses and health risk factors, and while not every person with those is obese, and not every obese person has them, it's very likely the high number of COVID deaths in obese people is not a result of just high fat percentage in the body but also probably a number of health complications related to obesity, especially in older people. Keep in mind nearly half the adult US population is obese, so 78% of COVID patients being obese isn't a crazy statistic.   </p>
<p>I personally think the risk to the obese is overblown. I know plenty of obese people who had COVID and recovered totally normally without any severe symptoms but they are not all super old or sick, and tend to be obese but moderately active and relatively healthy eaters. Even if you are obese you shouldn't be worried to death of COVID.  </p>
<p>Also, 5'11 and 240 lbs is most definitely obese.</p>

        <p>Well I will take children out of the equation, since a lot of the time it’s out of their control (like it was for me). But you’re wrong, the only reason the weight is almost impossible to lose is because people don’t want to lose it. It is EXTREMELY easy to lose weight, if you have the willpower to lose it. Actually losing weight for obese people usually means just eating A LOT less and A LOT healthier. Though obviously weight loss can be done through different methods that adhere to caloric deficit, as that is the only way to lose weight. Most people just don’t lose it because they don’t want to lose it. If they commit to losing it, it is relatively easy. </p>
<p>Obesity is not a healthy lifestyle choice. And while COVID deaths from obesity may not directly be tied together, the other health complications that you mentioned from obesity definitely play a role. It is very basic knowledge that fat people who eat shit the whole day and don’t stay active will have far more health problems than healthy people. Don’t make excuses for that.</p>

        <p>That's not true if you actually read the science. This is one of those things that seems like "common sense" but is actually more complicated. I used to have the same kinds of biases until both myself and another person I know developed the same hormonal disorder which caused us to rapidly and uncontrollably gain weight - we were both super health obsessed and active people, doing sports at a competitive level. Nothing either of us did allowed us to lose any weight until we got our hormones under control and even then it's an uphill battle. When I was at my heaviest I was eating the least by far I ever had in my life, and ended up in hospital multiple times due partly to malnutrition. It's really NOT just that simple.  </p>
<p>As for children who grew up with poor nutrition it can screw with your system long-term. The body is not like a car where you just put something in and burn it. I am a biological scientist and it even took me a long time to wrap my head around how some of these things work because they're not intuitive, but no one on this sub or other similar subs is doing themselves any favors by blaming everything on fat people either rather than focusing on controllable lifestyle choices. There are things even fat people can do to be healthier and prevent themselves from getting ill from something like COVID-19 though, and the vast majority of obese people do not get sick from COVID. It is people who are extremely unhealthy with many comorbidities who tend to get sickest from COVID-19, and while some of these illnesses are not preventable, some are. People with autoimmune conditions or undergoing chemotherapy always knew to be careful with circulating viruses anyway, this one isn't new.</p>

        <p>Ok you’re talking about an extremely small percentage of the population. You can’t make arguments based on that... eating is super easy to understand. Everyone has a caloric maintenance level which is the amount of calories you eat per day to maintain your current weight. Most people are around 2500 cals. If you go above/below that by ~500 cals then you can expect to gain/lose 1 pound a week. People who are obese consume far more than they burn. THE VAST MANOIRTY DO NOT HAVE AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES. And there are many people that are naturally able to beat their autoimmune disorders just by changing their diet (good example is Jordan Peterson and his daughter who nearly died). Most of the time it is addiction developed over time, and like most addictions, the only way around them is controlling it yourself. It is literally as simple as eating less, more fruits and vegetables, less crap, more protein, and <strong>CALORIC DEFICIT</strong>... I had a ton of issues stacked against me and I overcame them by literally telling myself I was going to be healthy. Took me months to actually commit to it but once I did, it was easy. That’s the thing that most people can’t get over, actually committing to a healthy lifestyle. </p>
<p>If you are obese as a child then most of the time it is out of your control until at least your teen years. You are completely wrong if you think that if an obese child adopts a healthy lifestyle then they won’t be healthy... take for example David Goggins, probably the toughest man on earth... was 300 pounds at his heaviest with all the odds stacked against him... it’s possible if you commit to it. You seem to make a lot of excuses and complicate it more than it needs to be... it’s very simple. If you want to lose weight caloric deficit. If you want to maintain weight eat the same. If you want to gain weight caloric surplus.</p>

        <p>Nah it's not nearly as rare as you might think, especially in genz and millennials. But if you want to learn about science it is going to take more than just buying into government propaganda about nutrition etc.</p>
<p>I had typed a longer comment but as a scientist this is like arguing with prolockdown promask doomers at a certain point. It unfortunately takes research and a willingness to be curious and look past what the government has been saying for decades about 'healthy eating' and metabolism and look at what is actually happening - the skyrocketing rates of autoimmune and endocrine disease in the young, the messed up nutritional advice people have been fed by government/industry for years, etc.  </p>
<p>ETA: p.s. I started losing weight when I started eating a lot more and fixing my hormonal issues. Eating at a bigger and bigger "caloric deficit" (you realize that the calories out part of the equation matters too, yes?) just landed me in the hospital multiple times, near death twice, while I kept getting fatter. I had to look into the actual science to figure out how to lose weight and get healthier.</p>
