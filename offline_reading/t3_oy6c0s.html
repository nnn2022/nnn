    <strong>Canadian news is pushing the fake Alberta protests hard</strong>
    <p><p>I have noticed several stories every day for the past week talking about the "protests on lifting of covid restrictions and mandatory masking" in Alberta,</p>
<p>They recycle the image from the same "protest" where there are maybe 50 masked overweight purple haired NPCS. </p>
<p>It's insane to believe this is getting front page coverage, it's actually kind of funny. They are really desperate.</p>

        <p>This makes a lot more sense if they’re recycling the same shot over and over to make the crowd look more sizeable. I’m only an American visitor here in Calgary but even in this city which like all cities, has a lot more left leaning people than the country, there are way too many mask-free happy people out and about all over the parts and trails… old ladies, kids, dogs all without masks and all smiles. Just couldn’t imagine enough people wanting to bring that shit back. It’s been so nice not using masks and just being normal again. Will definitely be a downgrade going back to Cali but am very happy for you guys, just hope it sticks and this propaganda doesn’t work. It’s sick what they’re trying to do.</p>
