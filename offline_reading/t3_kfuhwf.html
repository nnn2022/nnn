        <p>Profit for the most part. Keep the false narrative (that you can contain a highly transmitable but relatively mild respiratory virus) for as long as possible.</p>
<p>- The big retailers have made bank because small businesses (AKA the competition) have been destroyed.</p>
<p>- Online delivery and Amazon are making bank because people are too afraid to shop in meat world due to all of the fearmongering.</p>
<p>- As the economy dies, all of the seized and repossessed assets (like homes) will come up on the market for pennies on the dollar - to be held and flipped for profit later.</p>
<p>- Tech companies are making a killing building our new social credit/surveillance dystopia.</p>
<p>- They have bought our governments, lock, stock, and barrel. In return for the unlimited powers now being seized, governments are going to kick bailouts to their crony-capitalist masters, paid for by you (see airlines for an example).</p>
<p>Everyone wins. Except Joe Average.</p>

        <p>My friend had covid. ICU for 3 weeks, we could not visit or anything of the likes. I assure you , this virus is not a hoax. And while I am all for the wacky conspiracy theories, one point is that, why would the vaccine be free? If everyone is trying to profit from it, why would they dish it out to everyone for no cost at all. And that microchip nonsense, I simply believe it is not true. Another counter point is, think about the oil market. Surely if someone were to try to profit from this, it would be them, with their billions of miles of lands, but their market has plummeted. I’m not trying to start a fight, I hope we can resolve this like gentlemen.</p>

        <p>I now covid is not a hoax. It's real, but it also isn't what media is trying to portray it is.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't free. It's fully payed by taxpayers. These vaccine companies also have immunity from liability if something unintentionally goes wrong / all the side effects.
From their point of view, this is yet another thing that grants them more profit (they can't be sued).</p>
<p>&rt;And that microchip nonsense, I simply believe it is not true. </p>
<p>I don't as well.</p>
<p>The harsh truth is, almost everyone with prior power is gaining something from this pandemic.</p>
<p>Politicians are getting bigger political power and a bigger salary.</p>
<p>Billionaires (like Jeff Bezoos, Elon Musk) are doubling/tripling their net worth during this crisis. Basically profiting from a crisis people are dying from.</p>
<p>Corporations are getting even bigger, as their competion is getting destroyed (local businesses).</p>
<p>In my opinion when you realize this is a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus with a low IFR, you realize none of this was needed. The whole narrative starts falling apart. We know for a fact it's impossible to contain viruses like this, for  the simple reason that they spread too fast (when you realize it exists, it's already too late as it's been spreading for way too long to be able to stop it). For the same reason we will never eradicate Influenza or other low IFR viruses.</p>
<p>This is the reason why lockdowns, masks, social distaning continuously failed to stop the virus for the past 10 months.
Masks also contributed to increase in pollution, while lockdowns contributed to destroying the economy which consequently contributed to the increase in suicides, overdoses, starvation, domestic violence (just like the post shows). </p>
<p>This is the reason I am against lockdowns. They "kill" more than they're saving. For instance, to give you a better perspective: starvation has took around 2 million more lives than it did last year. Economy crisis is no joke.</p>

        <p>&rt; why would the vaccine be free?</p>
<p>Uhhh ... it's not free. Not even a little. Pfizer is going to make an estimated $15 billion on their vaccine in the US alone during next year. The government is paying for it. And who pays the government, fellow redditor?</p>
<p>&rt; My friend had covid. ICU for 3 weeks</p>
<p>How do we know this isn't medical malpractice?</p>
<p>Remember, all the medical establishment was convinced, <strong>overnight</strong>, that a deadly new virus was going around (given their marching orders from the CDC/WHO). That meant when any respiratory case came through the doors, they treated it as such ("because we're in a viral pandemic, obviously"). We know the PCR tests are mostly bogus / wildly inflated. What if many of these deaths were people tagged with high-cycle-count PCR tests and treated incorrectly due to a false positive?</p>
<p>So a simple question: for the all the young people who die(d) of this thing, who would not be expected to die from a flu under the age of 70 ... what if it's mostly malpractice? About 10 years ago, I knew a guy who had pneumonia in his 20s and nearly died from it - he even required surgery to get through it. At least in that instance I could see a misdiagnosis as causing a needless delay or initially incorrect treatment, that might have easily cost valuable time, leading to death. They could be fighting a 'virus' that doesn't even exist in one person's case. How will that affect treatment?</p>
<p>There were a lot of ventilator deaths happening at the start of this thing, though from what I gather they aren't being used as much anymore. If so, why the change? Were people being needlessly killed, then?</p>
<p>Also we know the attacks on things like HCQ were baseless and there was some shady shit going on behind the scenes -- parroted breathlessly by the media -- that closed people's minds to the possibility of widespread, cheap, non-vaccine treatment. (Look into the Surgisphere scandal for an example of that)</p>
<p>It feels very much like everybody is being herded down a narrow corridor, the ONLY exit from which is "mass worldwide vaccination". If this whole thing were legit, weren't being dictated from above, it would stand to reason that much more experimentation / regional variation would be allowed and encouraged, to find workable treatments - which would then spread like wildfire to areas that weren't having as much success. Instead, the ONLY course of action being sanctioned by experts and the media worldwide is VACCINE, VACCINE, VACCINE. (Nevermind that it's a newish type of vaccine that's never been widely approved for human use, fasttracked through testing for emergency use)</p>
<p>Long before all this, there was an estimate out of Johns Hopkins claiming that there might be as many as 250,000 to 400,000 medical malpractice deaths in the US every year. Assuming that's even remotely correct, would you expect MORE or LESS of those in the middle of a 'deadly pandemic' where people are still trying to figure out which end is up? Wherein we don't have the benefit of hindsight to know to what degree any of what humans are doing right now is either effective or even causing more harm than good?</p>
<p>Look, I don't have any answers because it's not clear what is actually going on - 'fog of war' and all that. But what is clear, in many cases, is that the confidence The Deciders have in the handling of something that supposedly was 100% unplanned, unanticipated, is unwarranted. They are very gung-ho about this mass rollout of a frankly experimental vaccine, about mass lockdowns and masking continuing indefinitely even with the vaccine's expected widespread availability next year. They don't harbor any severe doubts about all that - whereas they are endlessly hand-wringing about allowing any normalcy to return to society. "We'll just have to wait and see, it's too early to say ..."</p>
<p>But no skepticism, no reservation, no "wait and see" about this whole push to inject some novel substance into every man, woman and child across the planet.</p>
<p>Oh, and just to add, re: profitability - you're also not thinking far enough ahead. Vaccine profits are just one little piece of the puzzle. By shaping society in a certain way, by pushing for widespread human dependence on governments, by herding everybody into Walmart and Amazon and Big Tech for every last human need, by pushing for global ID interlocked with vaccine status ... they have a long-term game plan. This shit goes wayyyy beyond mere capitalism, to a level of societal control unthinkable (except by conspiracy theorists) even 5 years ago. And the worst part? People are BEGGING for it.</p>

        <p>You're the one killing people. You see the list of things that people are dying from because of lockdowns.  IGNORE all of it and continue to bitch about covid.  Complete insanity.  Acknowledge these deaths! Can you not see them? They are happening becaue of lockdowns. Gun violence keeps rising because of lockdowns.  Sooo many deaths incoming from lockdown related things not covid.</p>

        <p>Yup I wear a mask in public and don't think it's a hoax, but it's definitely overblown by the media, the arbitrary restrictions don't do shit, and we're heading down a slippery slope that I already witnessed after 9/11.  But people are too set into their mindsets and not willing to change their minds so we're all gonna bicker amongst ourselves and blame each other while the government runs us into the fucking ground so who cares.</p>
