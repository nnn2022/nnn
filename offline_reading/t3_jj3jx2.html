        <p>Before this year, most of the peer-reviewed science about the holy masks found little, if any relation between mask use and reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. </p>
<p>Why do you hate science so much, OP?</p>

        <p>That's entirely untrue. Sorry. China has been using masks effectively for respiratory illnesses for a while now if you need a long-term example. Plus.. it's obvious. </p>
<p>It's not like an "Earth is flat" issue where you can't exactly see for yourself to know. Just use your head or, if you really must, a slo-mo camera. No contest. I mean wtf.</p>
<p>No relation between "Mask use and reducing the spread of respiratory illness"</p>
<p>I feel like I can use your words to argue against you. That makes no fucking sense. How do you think respiratory illnesses might spread (hint: it's in the name)? Where do you think we breathe from? Now.. why don't you think it works?</p>

        <p>&rt; That's entirely untrue. Sorry. China has been using masks effectively for respiratory illnesses for a while now if you need a long-term example.</p>
<p>If it's entirely untrue then please point to studies.  Here's a <a href="https://rationalground.com/mask-studies/">link</a> for you to peruse.  Furthermore, if this were untrue, then why was the initial recommendation to NOT wear masks?  You can still believe that they're helpful, but to act as though the science unequivocally supports them is simply incorrect.</p>
<p>&rt;  Plus.. it's obvious.</p>
<p>It's obvious  if you fail to appreciate the fact that viruses exist in a world completely different to our own.  Your average person is not going to comprehend the microscopic world.  For example, you have approximately 32.7 <em>trillion</em> cells in your body.  This is an unfathomably large number.  And viruses are about a hundredth the size of a cell.  You might think it's obvious that a mask is going to filter a virus as you exhale but you can't truly appreciate just how small a virus is.  Once again, this doesn't prove that masks are useless, but to say it's "obvious" is pretty ignorant.</p>
<p>&rt; I feel like I can use your words to argue against you. That makes no fucking sense. How do you think respiratory illnesses might spread (hint: it's in the name)? Where do you think we breathe from? Now.. why don't you think it works?</p>
<p>So if it's so plainly obvious then why were initial recommendations to not wear masks?  Why is it that we haven't been wearing masks every flu season for the past 100 years?  How many lives could have been saved if we all masked up?  Why is it that Tokyo apparently has <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200924/Tokyo-citizens-may-have-developed-COVID-19-herd-immunity-say-researchers.aspx">50% seroprevalence of coronavirus</a> yet <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/10/national/japan-masks-close-range-conversations-poll/">80% of Japanese wear facemasks in conversations</a>?</p>

<p>So there wasn't a run on vital healthcare equipment. That much is also obvious. </p>
<p>Also, you're arguing directly against yourself. This appears to be a trend on this sub. I could point it out, but this is clearly not a discussion worth having</p>

        <p>Why would you want to debate it?  Because if it's of such vital importance that we all wear masks then you should be seeking to illuminate our ignorance and show us why we're wrong.  Because maybe you'd get through to one or two of us and that'd be one or two more people wearing a mask and you would be contributing positively to the world.  The fact that you have chosen not to do that and instead choose to insult people tells me you don't really care about others at all.</p>

        <p>If you're so sure that masks don't work well then I should only assume you've looked at every possible scientific source in order to validate not wearing one and endangering people. You're clearly the most informed person.. well.. maybe on the planet to be that confident. Anything I would link you would already know back and forth. What's the point?</p>

        <p>Increased regulations other than masks that people followed called a temporary downward trend. Then people like yourself got bored and fucked it up and it went back up. Exponential growth would happen regardless of mask use without proper social distancing. It would just be either more or less severe. Also, it's not like everybody actually uses masks, so the point is null regardless.</p>
