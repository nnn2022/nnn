        <p>They <em>are</em> wanted. Why do you think they're so frantically trying to mark people out as 'sick' with their ill-conceived mass pcr testing programme? They'll fight this to the last man. If the people knew that asymptomatic transmission was rare, the bottom would fall out the bucket and all the shit would spill out. The jig would be up.</p>

        <p>We knew this months ago. Asymptomatic spread isn't real. You need SYMPTOMS to expel virus particles.</p>

        <p>With an airborne virus? Data shows that with a truly airborne virus, even talking is enough to expel virus particles.</p>
<p>So that is simply not true.</p>
<p>The issue here is that CoVid-19 hit that 'sweet spot' where it was airborne but the CV-19 particles were suspended in droplets when they first came out of your mouth.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if with airborne viruses that is true, that they are suspended droplets at first but then quickly dry out and the CV-19 particles keep on going around and stay alive for awhile.</p>
<p>Masks are not going to stop that... once the CV-19 particles have 'dried out', they are too small for masks to filter and you will just suck them in through the mask pores.</p>

        <p>While I think you are basically right.  What I experienced getting sick earlier in the year with what I think was corona, I got my gf sick after I felt like I recovered but maybe could still feel ~5% sick.</p>
<p>She ended up getting sick too but normally at that point, that would have been past the contagious period with a normal cold and flu.</p>

        <p>We need more research and articles about asymptomatic spread. That’s really what drove the crazy here. Once that’s debunked, it’s tough to rationalize other things. I’m anti mask but even I will support if you’re sick in the winter, sure wear a mask when you go to the grocery store.</p>

        <p>It's bigger than him now. If he did that, they'd rip him apart and ostracise him. Take the masks - we were assured they were ineffective and nobody went along with that, do they switched to saying they might work and from there that you're a science-denying conspiracy loon if you express any scepticism at all.</p>

        <p>Not that I know of. I come from Liverpool, the first place to get mass tested. There are no bracelets or passports and many people are ignoring the lockdown now. There's a tent set up at gym an leisure centre close to where I live, with people garbed in ppe. I went for a walk the other day with a family member, and we passed a nearby social club where a soldier was stood outside. I always told myself I would not worry until the army started turning up on the streets. It's a very strange situation. My family member tried to encourage me to get a test and I explained about the false positives and the (lack of) asymptomatic spread, and how it won't do any good - you know, all our main talking points. I don't know if I'm getting through though.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your experience and I'm glad you haven't given into the testing! I know the army was going to go door to door and have people test but last I've heard (from Alex Belfield on YouTube) that it was a mess and that the majority of people didn't even get tested and refused! False positives are a real thing and if you need any resources in regards to the testing, there are a few links that have been posted on here that you can show them!</p>

        <p>he WHO already came out and said it was very rare and then immediately tried to backtrack it for damage control. Fauci said this in January "assymptomatic carriers do not drive an epidemic". Apparently this guy who's supposed to be the world expert on this didn't know what he was talking about in January? Not only that but he openly admitted that he lied about masks just so people wouldn't buy them. Am I supposed to trust him?</p>
<p>I think we're at a point where if some important expert came out and told everyone that this was a complete hoax (which I don't think it is), but that they did it to stop climate change and help the planet, people would eat it up and regard these con artists as heroes.</p>
<p>People are blind and they refuse to believe anything that isn't the mainstream narrative.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't make any difference if people got all the facts and figures disproving it as long as a "Pandemic" was the narrative. It has nothing to do with intelligence or lack of information.</p>
<p>I showed a friend the tweet from the south australian police department about not being allowed to walk your dog and she spent 30 minutes trying to debunk it, an official statement, and learned nothing from it... I really didn't do anything other than show the tweet they themselves sent out.</p>
<p>The truth will not set you free.</p>
