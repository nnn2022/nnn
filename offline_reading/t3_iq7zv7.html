    <strong>Trying to find strength, but facing significant resistance. Vancouver, Canada</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a 35 year old male living in Surrey, BC. I'm getting sick of the lockdowns and the endless policies. We have more limitations than we did back when the lockdowns first started in March, and with the peak in April!</p>
<p>No, I haven't been making the right choices most of my life. And I paid for it. After an attempt I ended up being at the hospital back in February. Damn me and my timing! Right before the lockdown I said screw this I'll actually work to strengthening myself, going to the gym and maybe take up indoor rock climbing, and eventually go back to work. I'm underweight, and one thing I can describe of myself is "Tired".</p>
<p>I had a counselor to talk to for a few weeks after hospitalization, but I started feeling that nothing will change until I change my mindset and its ultimately all about self-help. And I did. </p>
<p>Know what's the "revelation" I had during the talks with the counselor? It was after reading the title of a Youtube video about how you'll be stronger after being alone for a while. And I did feel better. Maybe I don't need to socialize other than with close friends and family. And I can tell you right now its pretty close to zero.</p>
<p>I've seen Vancouver's Hugs no Mask group and their protests. All I want is to live in peace and quiet. I identify myself as a law-abiding citizen. I hope, I sincerely hope these few protests that are going around the world, along with covid quickly subsiding that it'll be enough. My days, and even hours are increasingly flip flopping between feeling strong and feeling despair.</p>
<p>I had to post this because this subreddit feels like one place I have something important in common with people.</p></p>

        <p>Try bulking. Eating a big evening meal (high carb) before sleep helped me when i was underweight. Also easier than the gym is rucking for strength conditioning carrying a backpack with weight in for an hour walk.</p>
<p>I know how burnout and tiredness feel. I'm a carer for my mum with dementia through this time, somehow you just keep going. I guess doing the right thing gives me more strength than giving in.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I'm not sure of that strategy. I want to do it with balance if possible without risking other parts of my health. I don't want it going one way without considering the negatives.</p>
<p>Regardless the whole lockdown/masking is complete nonsense. Wishing to avoid all this while having social contact seems increasingly like wishing for a unicorn to exist.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I still want to thank you for the suggestions. I might try the backpack thing.</p>
