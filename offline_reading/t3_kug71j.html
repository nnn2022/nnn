    <strong>Sharing a small experience...</strong>
    <p><p>So I was at the local grocery store with my husband and we don't wear masks. I saw maybe 5 others in the store also not wearing masks so it was all good. As I was turning a corner to head to the next aisle this woman (Karen) maybe mid 50s gave me the nastiest look I've ever received from a human and it was a mix of disgust and awe that I wasn't wearing a mask. So I turned around and said excuse me but what the fuck are you looking at? I already speak loudly so everyone within ear shot heard. She kept walking and I said hey maybe stay home if you're shocked by someone trying to breathe fresh air. </p>
<p>What I've learned is most people ASSUME no one will speak up so they get away with this atrocious behavior. I will always speak up this is a hill I'm willing to die on. I turned to another maskless guy and asked if anyone bothered him and he said no. So because I'm a woman I'm guessing I'm an easy target. Stand your ground. Have no fear. Break the chains.</p></p>

        <p>Totally anecdotal but I have noticed this too. I’m a pretty average height weight and build for a man. No one has ever bothered me about not wearing a mask. When I’m with my wife who is like 5’ 110 pounds, no one bothers her about it either. Yet about a half dozen times she’s told me people have come up while she’s alone and started scolding her, even being somewhat aggressive towards her, a grown woman, about not wearing the correct item.</p>
<p>Makes me think these people aren’t actually concerned about their own health, or the public health either. They realize they have an opportunity to be rude and aggressive bullies to people in a way that would normally be unacceptable, and still feel heroic about it. It’s just regular ol’ bullies looking for someone weak to pick apart.</p>

        <p>They're not concerned. If they were they would be too afraid to leave their homes. I'm 5'4 and a little overweight and my face always tells a story. When I'm in public now resting bitch face is an understatement. So no one typically approaches me. This was a first. Before this shit I was always smiling at people chatting with others. My friends say I never meet a stranger because I'm the kinda gal that will invite you out for coffee in line at the grocery. My whole demeanor has changed for the worse. 😢</p>

        <p>Yes! It depresses me because this isn't who I am. I'm a super approachable person. Like the one you can stop and get directions from and end up becoming friends. This is completely unnatural for me. Its consuming me.</p>

        <p>I agree. I'm quite introverted but I love small little interactions with strangers, I'm tall so I always offer to get things from high shelves, take peoples trolleys back for them if I'm headed that way... now I feel like people are so agitated in public, just waiting for someone to do something wrong so they can admonish them, I don't want to deal with it. I'm realising right now, I've lost A LOT of my personality during this.</p>

        <p>It's psychological warfare. Most of us have. It made good people go mental. It made awful people take advantage and become more horrid. I feel like it was done by design and now that you can't see a face people don't have to acknowledge each other almost like the anonymous effect the internet has only in public.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. We were in a major grocery chain down South that I just saw pro-maskers condemning because they kick anti-maskers out. I will always shop there. Vote with your money.

        <p>I’m a smaller young woman and I’m terrified of being massless alone. I get nasty looks like this when I’m alone. When my bf is with me (beard, 6ft tall) people smile and say hey to us. So weird. Early on, I felt like being a girl made people leave me alone more, but now I think I get worse treatment than he does.</p>

        <p>Yes speak up ! Here we cannot even get inside the grocery store without a mask and using their stinky diluted solution of water and alcohol or we'll get a fine of 1000 to 6000$. After that control point i put it under my nose so i can breathe !</p>
<p>I am a very short and skinny woman and i bring my taller and bigger than me son who's 11 year old with me and he's not obliged to wear one at his age,i cringe so much when i see people putting mask with kids cartoons on their toddlers...</p>
<p>Well people seem to think i am an easy target because i look "frail" and this old hag decided to block the space with her cart to stop us from getting diapers for my baby !! She called us selfish for putting people like her at risk.</p>
<p>She then pushed her cart on my son's heels pretending it was an accident and i lost it ! I screamed at her that if she's so much at risk it is because she's severely obese and old and that it is selfish of HER to demand that the whole world stop living to protect people who made bad decisions and that if she touches my son again that she'll realize that i'm worst than covid !</p>
<p>Just to be clear,people's weight isn't my business and i don't care nor have any judgement,my own husband is considered obese but that's a comorbidity for the virus and if you that scared of covid then it's your responsability to protect yourself not mine to stay home forever.</p>
