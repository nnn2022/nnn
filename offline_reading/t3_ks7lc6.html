    <strong>I’m tired.</strong>
    <p><p>This is more of a vent than a rant. </p>
<p>I’m 17. I have epilepsy. I can’t drive because I don’t have my license, and I’m not able to due to COVID. I can’t even make my own money because I can’t land a job. I haven’t seen my family outside of my mom and stepdad which I live with in months. My brother moved out shortly before COVID and I haven’t seen him since the pandemic started. I miss him so much, the only way we communicate is through text messages. </p>
<p>I’m tired. I’m so tired of this. Because of lockdowns, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months. I’m starved for actual human interaction. Events I’ve wanted to go to (Otakon 2020 and Katsucon 2021) have been cancelled because of this. I’ve tried picking up hobbies, but things have become unenjoyable. I know this isn’t going to end any time soon. Most of my days is staring at the ceiling and listening to music, reflecting on the freedoms I took for granted. I’ve even attempted suicide at my lowest points during lockdown, but reminded myself it would cause more harm to my family than anything, and that it wasn’t worth it putting them through that. </p>
<p>At the beginning of quarantine, I was happy. To be honest, it saved my 10th grade year as I was able to take my classes at a slower pace and get good results. Even though I hate school, I miss the days where I would talk to people. I miss being social. It’s gotten to a point where I get excited to go to a Dollar General because I get to leave my house. </p>
<p>I’m not the only one affected either. My mom worked at a housing authority (basically a place that negotiates housing for the less fortunate). Due to COVID, she lost her job and subsequently any money she got off of unemployment and stimulus. She’s gone through most of her savings trying to keep a roof over our heads. The landlord is threatening to kick us out in March, so I’ll probably have to move soon. </p>
<p>I know this looks like I’m desperate for attention, but I need to get this off my chest. </p>
<p>TL;DR: I’m tired of lockdowns and I want to be free.</p></p>

        <p>Hang tough OP. From the way you write I can tell your very intelligent. You think for yourself and havent internalized the covid propaganda. You are literally the future of this world. We need people like you to carry us forward and there are not enough of us. </p>
<p>This sucks bad for everyone. But you and all of us have the strength to overcome it. They lock us down? Well theyre in for a suprise when we come out stronger, tougher, smarter, and angrier than theyve every seen. </p>
<p>This time in history can either make you or break you. Your greatest victories will always come from the bottom of the dungeon. Dont run from the dungeon. Go deep into it and murder all the demons and dragons thatre there and bring their heads back on your belt as a trophy.</p>

        <p>People like you keep saying this, "It's going away soon! Shut the fuck up with your negativity and nonsense!" It's been months. After yesterday's news, things look more dire than ever, and not just in the US but all over the world. I don't see the pandemic or the repercussions of it to society going away anytime soon. Even if we somehow "won", and got things re-opened, life is not going to be the same. The damage done to the economy, and to society is extensive, and I don't see us recovering from this for years or even decades. But sure, keep spouting blind optimism, and chastizing people for not seeing the "silver lining" of this shitfest.</p>

        <p>I saw something about people not reaching herd immunity for 3000 years. They won’t let up if we just go along with it. I’m not saying we need to get violent, either. I’ve taken my mask off in stores plenty of times for a few minutes at a time and no one says anything or stops me. Every time I do it I keep it off a little longer. Enough people start doing that and things will have to reverse</p>
