    <strong>The standards of medical care are up in the air right now</strong>
    <p><p>The standards of medical care are up in the air right now. Word for word that is what a lawyer told me. Backstory: my grandfather passed away the end of 2020. We brought him home on hospice and took care of him his final days, he was diagnosed with Covid and in an unresponsive state. There was a lot of evidence of neglect. EXTREMELY underweight and multiple bedsores. In the spring I started calling lawyers, no one is willing to take my case because Covid is listed on his death certificate. The second cause of death I'd like to add, not the main cause. But the guy that told me the standards are up in the air WTF?!?! What does that even mean? You can just let people die because there's a pandemic? You can neglect your patients because of Covid? I'm sorry I just had to share this complete and utter bullshit and vent.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry.  There are a lot of these stories of neglect.  Politicians and health care failed the aged.</p>

        <p>Same thing for my father who was in a rehab center that I believe KNOWINGLY sent him home with CoVid after neglecting him and not properly doing his rehab, killing both him and my mother.</p>
<p>This whole scamdemic has been a carte blanche for various people to get away with medical negligence and malpractice.</p>

        <p>Want another example. I wont bore you with my personal one, but look at what is considered "normal" healthcare in nova scotia right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/oxh9w4/iwk_not_doing_full_gestational_diabetes_test/">https://np.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/oxh9w4/iwk_not_doing_full_gestational_diabetes_test/</a></p>
<p>Gestational Diabetes is no joke. Back home a coworker I was friends with had a wife and two children. The first pregnancy went ok, but something went awry in the second one. And because they were appalachian and didnt have healthcare they avoided going to the Doctor.</p>
<p>She ended up permanently blind and its just sad when shit like that can be avoided. One thing to do it to yourself though. It's like the hand of the universe or god or whatever you want to call it doing what it has to do.</p>
<p>When it's by the hand of some greedy, pompous ahole, that is a entirely different thing.</p>
<p>Could you imagine having a "unforeseen" accident to this vaccine, and being one of the rare few to suffer a permanent decrease in your quality of life, no one to help you because you gave up all your rights when you got the shot.</p>
<p>Only to find out that they knew from the very beginning that a certain percentage of the population was going to end up messed up, and then shredded the evidence.</p>
<p>Thats exactly what they mean by "Unforeseen" consequences, you fools.</p>

        <p>In Canada there was a a lot of nursing home deaths at one particular home in Ontario, they sent out the army to take care of the situation. Long story short the army released a report saying most of the people who died in that home died of neglect, dehydration, malnutrition etc.</p>
