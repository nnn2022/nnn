        <p>Good for that dr for speaking out but I bet he’s full of shit. He most likely HAS treated children with vaccine-related complications he either didn’t pick it up at the time or refused to acknowledge it. My oldest got intussusception right after she got the first round of the rotovirus vaccine. Reading all the stories about patients suffering adverse reactions from the vaccine and then having drs either insist it’s not from the vaccine and not know how to treat them….has brought back bad memories from when my own child was injured by a vaccine and the hospital staff refused to listen to us! We spent hours in the ER only to be told she probably had the flu and that if we were still concerned in the morning, we should contact our pediatrician. Not long after we got home, she had a bowel movement that looked like red jelly! So damn straight we were at the pediatricians office as soon as they opened and the dr that saw her immediately admitted her to the hospital for dehydration because she hadn’t eaten in over 24 hrs! From then on it was all downhill, the staff I think thought I was a teen mom or something because they wouldn’t take me seriously! My daughters stomach started to get hard and distended, the red jelly bowel movements continued (and again nurses weren’t concerned!) and for 24 fucking hours no one would listen to us when we told them about it! It wasn’t until day 2 when she got a new nurse that things changed. That nurse examiner her belly and got the dr to order an X-ray. The x-ray showed something very abnormal in her intestines and we told “oh shit! Something is very wrong here but we don’t know what because we don’t have staffed trained to look at pediatric X-rays! You’ll need to go to Stanford but we don’t know if they have a bed for you”…….fast forward 6 hours, we get transferred to Stanford and within an hour they knew she had intussusception and we had a treatment plan! My kid came through it fine thank God. As soon as we got home we started researching how this could have happened and found the link to the rotavirus vaccine! And yet our pediatrician completely dismissed us, said there was no way it was the vaccine! My 8 week old got intussusception 3-4 days after she got the vaccine. But no dr would admit to us that the vaccine could have possibly been the culprit! So yeah I am sure this dr HAS treated patients suffering reactions from the vaccine but he dismissed it!</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. They won’t see what they are told doesn’t exist. This is the problem with the doctors of today. They’ve been trained by pharma to not see what’s right in front of their faces. Even if you show them what is happening they refuse to see it because whatever it is it certainly can’t be that. In some cases, seeing things for what they are can even result in a doctor losing their license. This problem is deeply rooted.</p>
