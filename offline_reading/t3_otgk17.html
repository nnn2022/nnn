    <strong>Spiritual Leaders</strong>
    <p><p>We need to reach out to spiritual figures to get an oomph behind what we are saying. People in these realms have a higher consciousness and can begin to decipher what is true and what is not true along with what is said and what is not said unbiased and clear for the masses to understand. They have a beauty of speaking what most people can't express. They have a beauty of having people listen while not getting attached to selective hearing because of the smoothness and clarity of their words. Please reach out to a spiritual figure if you know one that touches you with their words or that makes it clear to you that they are genuine and want the best for the world.</p>
<p>Gandhi had such an impact on the world because of his words. If people with clarity are made to speak on this issue after seeing the ideas that we have presented it could do great good and could save so many people in the future.</p>
<p>If you are scared, realize there are people that have been working their whole lives to become genuine enlightened people that could help us in this grave time of danger. Please reach out to them over social media if they are on social media leaving multiple comments telling them to do research on the anti-vax side or calling their locations or areas where they provide expertise.</p>
<p>These are some of the most unbiased people in the world that can spread wisdom. We can't live in fear and fear is deciphered by clarity and understanding. If someone with clarity and understanding speaks out, they can speak to the soul</p>
<p>If you are to tell them about this anti-vax side in detail or to possibly make them aware of what the U.S is going through that would be better than them not knowing about the inner workings of media manipulation through corruption until they research. This could be just enough for the saving of the lives of so many people. If what we are going through right now is a time crunch we need to control our fate and recognize our time. Spread the news</p>
<p>SHARE THIS POST EVERYWHERE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND PRESERVATION OF THE SOUL</p>
<p>IT IS BETTER THAN US LIVING IN FEAR IN A CORNER OF THE INTERNET ON REDDIT. THIS SHOULD BE KNOWN BY ENLIGHTENED FRIENDS OF THE WORLD</p></p>

<p>No they don't.</p>
<p>I'm an occultist, mystic, and paranormal investigator (whom others might consider spiritual), and can count on one hand the amount of people who self-describe as 'spiritual' who <em>actually</em> know their stuff. If they say they're a guru, they're not. It's not a paradox: it's just that people who loudly say what they are tend to be afraid of the work it takes to make it true.</p>

        <p>Maybe that's because you're not as connected to spirit as you think - there is a massive difference between practicing occultism to commune with unknown entities and having a true relationship of knowing with the godhead. Imo occultism is a psychic trap that fools man into thinking they possess power over others. Luciferianism is real, don't ignore it</p>

        <p>Stop relying on "spiritual leaders", it was spiritual leaders that killed most of the prophetic people you speak of. Raise your own consciousness, it is a lie that you need someone for that relationship. Meditate, listen twice as much as you pray. Spirituality is universal, don't sell yourself or God short, if that is what you choose to call them. Enlightenment is only a few quiet moments away!</p>

        <p>Please define "spirit" or "spirtual" cause I have no clue what it means.  I've never heard a good explanation of what a spirit it.</p>
<p>Hint:  do not use the "spirit" in your definition of the above words.</p>
