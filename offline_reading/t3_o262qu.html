    <strong>The whole plan</strong>
    <p><p>Okay I'm going to start by listing some facts that we know to be true:</p>
<p>-Covid only affects 0.0001% of the current population<br>
-Media and censorship has made covid seem like a much larger threat than it really is<br>
-The vaccine is a tool the government is using on those who have not yet woken up and are fearful<br>
-Masks are ineffective</p>
<p>Now I realize what I'm about to say is the truth which I know is about to happen in a few months here in the United States and has already started to happen in a few countries. Now if we look at the points that I've listed above the think critically about what has happened so far and how the government and CDC have acted, we will figure out their next move.</p>
<p>The the main tool the government used at first was covid and the media. They have scared the whole population with countless articles and 'data' (with BIG air quotes) about how many more people have died from this virus than actually have. THEN, they offered those who were scared with a vaccine, claiming it was safe, this time underreporting the number who faced negative side effects. Those who had realized the theatre show that the government is putting on have not yet taken the vaccine - those are the people still reading this article now.</p>
<p>That is where we are now - please lmk if I have missed anything in the comments.</p>
<p>Now, there is a question I would like you to ask yourself? Who would the government like to protect more - the mindless sheep the believe everything they say or the wolves who are actually self aware and threaten their power? By now you probably have some idea where I am going with this and how the government plans the secretly eliminate those who are self aware.</p>
<p>I believe that the government has one more stage to their plan. They are going to release a new disease, one far more deadly that the vaccine MAGICALLY  protects you against. See, the vaccine contains markers, that has labelled people as "government safe" and those who have not received it are "threats". Similar to when Moses had to paint the doors with lambs blood. Now the people who have gotten the vaccine are the sheep that pose no threat to the government, the people who have believed their lies so far and gotten the vaccine. People they can control. Now this disease will kill those who are free thinkers, those who were smart and haven't gotten the vaccine.</p>
<p>I know the government is not our friend but that does not mean they are stupid. They anticipated this, they realized those they can't control won't get the vaccine and that is how they will get us. This second much more deadly virus will complete their plan. Look at what is happening in India, them, like us had a large population that saw through the lies, then the government released their second attack, 'the variant' and now those who are unvaccinated are dying and 'deserve' it because they didn't fall the lies.</p>
<p>Now what I'm about to suggest may sound a little crazy but hear me out. The only way to survive this second virus is to pretend to be the sheep, blend in. You have to subject yourself to the vaccine, even if does carry a slight risk. I had mine taken as signs of the second wave are starting to show up. Please protect yourself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am willing to discuss this with you in the comments below. Let me know if I misspoke anywhere or there are things you will like to talk about more, I will not be as close minded as the sheep.</p></p>

        <p>1) There was no covid.  Only false PCR tests and fearmongering by the media.  No unvaccinated person has ever been found with covid.  The virus has literally never been isolated in an unvaccinated berson.  The death rate is virtually the same as it is every year, they just attributed all other causes of death to the magic covid that only they can seem to detect.</p>
<p>2) Covid is in the vaccine.  The vaccine kills people and can make them sterile.</p>
<p>3) They have stated repeatedly they want to reduce the worlds population.  Bill Gates is on record stating he can do this with <em>vaccinations</em> and <em>reproductive health</em>.  You can replace those two buzzwords with what he really meant, death and sterilization.</p>
<p>4) Mask, lockdowns, etc.. all done with the intent to crash the economy in order to usher in the great reset/new world order.  Take a look at the inflation rate now.  Something like more than 25% of all the $$ in the US have been printed since last July.  Yet they claim it's only "transitory" and only "4.1%"....  The livestock control tests were an added bonus and they must be pleased with the level of voluntary compliance and self-enforcement.</p>
<p>5) Fauci will be thrown under the bus.  They will use this as an excuse for war with China.  What does China have a lot of?  People.  What do wars do?  Kill a lot of people.</p>
<p>The world is ran by a bunch of psychopaths.</p>

        <p>Since that is just wild speculation. I will engage in my own. </p>
<p>Why would the government want a dumb population? Why would they want a large population. A smaller population would be easier to control. A smarter population would function more efficiently. </p>
<p>If anything the pcr testing was dna sampling and the eugenics program is happening irregardless of who took the jab. The jab was engineered to have deleterious effects on the undesirable dna groups. The spike shedding will take care of those who didn't directly get the jab. </p>
<p>Trust your leaders they already accounted for the "They dont know that I know that they know that I know"</p>
<p>Come on man hundreds of billions of dollars went in to this eugenics program. You thing the answer is as easy as fit in?</p>
