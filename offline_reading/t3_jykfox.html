    <strong>Why is Hospital Capacity Still Even an Issue?</strong>
    <p><p>I still see overflowing hospitals given as a reason for locking down again. It's been over eight months since the COVID pandemic began, shouldn't that have been plenty of time to prepare? COVID isn't new anymore, and it should have been entirely predictable that we'd get a spike in cases as the weather got colder in climates with cold winters. They built all the emergency field hospitals in the spring which mostly never got used. Why wouldn't they have kept some of them ready for a winter surge? If hospitals overflow this winter, it's a self-inflicted crisis.</p>
<p>This is more evidence to me that they want to maintain a crisis, to keep people afraid. It's crazy to me how they've managed to convince so many left-leaning people that used to support civil liberties and be skeptical of policies that benefited big corporations to go along with such a massive transfer of wealth and power to the technocrats.</p></p>

        <p>Correct. And many of them have not called back all of their furloughed workers so they are working a bit short handed but it’s their own fault. They aren’t sharing this info, of course.</p>

        <p>In the UK lockdown was based on the premise that we needed to stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has currently spent £250bn on furlough and other subsidies at tax payer expense. Imagine how many new hospitals that could have built or how many of the unemployed could have been retrained as Covid nurses. Instead we have people sat at home being paid by the government, no new hospitals, an increase in national debt and because of the broken economy we have less ability to pay off the debt and build more hospitals.</p>
<p>This is a stone-cold con-trick. Daylight fucking robbery.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if it's good or bad that other humans across the planet are being treated this way by their political and media elites but at least it gives some of us hope that good people all around the world are also questioning it. A glimmer of hope, perhaps and a possible way to help bring us together in the future.</p>

        <p>What province? AB here and all my friends are posting the daily update articles of case count and people can't separate the differences between case numbers, hospitalizations, and ICU admittances and deaths when comparing us to Ontario and Quebec. Highest per capita testing, some of the lowest hospitalization and ICU admittance but nobody sees that, something like 80% of people read the headlines only, and I admit I'm getting better at it but I still do sometimes.</p>

        <p>The hospitals aren't overwhelmed more than it would be (hell it's even decreased in capacity in comparison to previous years), the issue is that it was so slow during the beginning of this they let go of staff and are understaffed and of course part of it is the fearmongering agenda</p>

        <p>To demand more money. This entire thing is a looting of the treasury. Why do you think they are taking so long with the next stimulus. They want to build overwhelming complaints and demand so they can raid the treasury (which really means borrow from the Fed the private bankers)</p>
<p>Its one engineered collapse to the next.</p>
<p>Wait till inflation hits. the dollar will be collapsed to give way to the new fed crypto coin they already announced. people will flock to save their dollar savings and paper wealth</p>

        <p>Right now they are hyping El Paso, yet another "border hotspot" that I suspect is having to deal with people coming across the border. Expats, dual-passport holders, and border crossers.</p>
<p>Last time they had the refrigerator trucks down there it was Hidalgo county. Another border zone.</p>
<p>They say they are setting up a second emergency morgue in El Paso to handle the crush. But this one is run by the military and in a "secret location" for "privacy reasons". </p>
<p>I do believe that there might be some busy hospitals out there, but if they are not turning people away the hospitals are coping.</p>
<p>It's crazy that this whole nightmare of "overrun hospitals" has really not played out <em>anywhere</em> has it? .. yet people are under the impression it has.</p>

        <p>The only time a hospital has gone ovverun is early in pandemic in Italy.</p>
<p>I did some digging into my local numbers too, it's even harder to decide how bad the hospitalization rate is because backw hen covid was starting in march we had lots of hospitalizations but it appears most were hospitalized to be monitored despite barely having symptoms, some literally didn't even need a hospital bed/room and just took a makeshift normal bedroom. It was kinda like "well, we have the facilities available so we'd like you to stay to keep an eye on you" whereas today with more understanding of virus progression and need for beds those people would likely be sent home to ride it out.</p>
<p>There's more nuance in this than just "lotsa cases today guys"</p>

        <p>And where I live, Alberta, we still have these morons who think we are doing terribly because we have as many cases as Ontario, 10 M more people than us (4m for us) and our hospitals and ICU wards are still barely seeing patients.</p>
<p>We're testing some of the most number of tests per 100k of all sub national units in North America. We have rigorous testing that can always be expanded like by adding pharmacies into the mix.</p>
<p>But people just see the headline "1300 new cases" and ignore the bylines that say "7 new deaths" or "net ICU/hospitalization rate decreased"</p>
<p>Of course when you test more you will get more cases.</p>

        <p>Not sure what generation you are, I was born in 1985. Both left and right have always been a mixed bag, but it did used to be as recently as the Bush years that the left tended to be more accepting of dissident viewpoints while the right tended to be more into patriotic virtue signaling, fearmongering, and shaming of anyone who didn't follow the government's narrative about terrorism. The whole "woke" scene is really mostly a phenomenon of the past decade.</p>
<p>I still know non-authoritarian left-leaning people my age and older who think the left stands for freedom and liberation. Many of them were raised in the 90s in very conservative Christian Republican families that severely restricted what they could do and who they could hang out with while growing up, and they still associate the right with their oppressive upbringings, and haven't really paid enough attention to what's been going on the last ten years to realize how those who they are voting for don't represent them at all anymore.</p>

<p>The Covid Cult doesn't hesitate to create its own facts, or to fabricate its own credentials.</p>
<p>Go find a physician you know, personally, and ask him if his hospital has been in danger of overflowing, recently. You are probably not going to get an answer out of him, that would make a doomer very happy.</p>
