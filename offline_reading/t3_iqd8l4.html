    <strong>Are we now in a casedemic?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from the UK, and the actual number of Covid-19 cases here is reportedly going up, and was apparently something close to 3,000 a few days ago. However, the number of deaths remains no higher than a couple of dozen or so per day, and often in single digits. The stated death rate was vastly higher a few months ago, when the number of cases was essentially no higher than it is now.</p>
<p>This begs the question: is the virus now less deadly, or has the rate of testing increased? Funnily enough, the media doesn't seem to be asking this question. It assumes that merely having the virus is akin to having a fairly deadly form of cancer. You might survive, but if you do, you will need a prolonged period of treatment. In fact, many of those who have this virus do not even know that they have it, as the World Health Organisation itself has admitted.</p></p>

        <p>This also confuses me...why are more cases necessarily a bad thing if people are surviving it?</p>

        <p>It's so deadly you need a test in order to know if you have it... The " cases " are false positives majority of the times, it got exposed too. Even if you have the covid flu, it has a 99.97 % survival rate under 70, Influenza flu has a 99.90 % survival rate. It's an agenda, authoritarian measures globally to pave way for the " new normal " and the great reset.</p>
<p>If someone passes away, they don't perform autopsies majority of the times anymore... They look at the health history from private doctor, if they don't have a private doctor, they perform a covid test. If the covid test says you have covid, regardless if that's actually the cause of death or not, it says covid on death certificate, case closed.</p>
<p>Why is it that pneumonia and the Influenza flu can kill people of any age, while covid only seems to kill people in their 80s ? Median covid death age in BC is 84, at some point it was 86 years old, life expectancy here is 80...</p>
<p>Project Veritas called a few funeral homes in New York and asked them about death certificates, all said the same thing... It's a massive hoax, I'll link Project Veritas video of them calling funeral homes in NY, which is the " epicenter " of the outbreak in the states.</p>
<p>Manufactured crisis and hysteria all with the help of the propaganda networks.</p>

        <p>Have been for months. They still like to say the total number of deaths, but the headline since the riots started and it looked like the virus was fizzling has been cases. They only report deaths when there is good news (aka a lot of people happen to die on one day or in one place), which is not usually the case. Even the several hundred deaths per day we have are weeks or months old and of dubious classification.</p>
