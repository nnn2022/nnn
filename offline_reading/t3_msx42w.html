        <p>Controls are used in a laboratory environment to assess whether processing has been done correctly or not. The presence of both positive and negative controls will allow the individuals reading test results the ability to distinguish whether the non-control specimens exhibit characteristics similar to the control specimens.</p>
<p>What ya got in the picture there isn't anything bad. They're just tools required for proper diagnosis.</p>

        <p>To elaborate: Imagine a machine that lights up when you stick a piece of corn in it. The Positive Control is a piece of corn. The Negative Control is a rock.</p>
<p>Before you run any samples, you need to test to make sure the machine works. You stick in the Positive Control (piece of corn) and if it lights up, you know it can detect corn. You stick in the Negative Control (rock) and if it doesn't light up, you know it does not detect non-corn. If EITHER the positive or negative controls don't behave in the way they should, you know something is wrong with your machine.</p>

<p>What if it has a defekt where it always only keeps alternating back-and-forth between a positive result and a negative result? :)</p>

        <p>Thank you. I just wanted to find out, people I know are sending me all kinds of things. I still don't trust those PCR tests, they are garbage and a brainwashing technique used by mindcontrol.</p>

        <p>You're very welcome. I'm happy to share a bit of knowledge on the matter.</p>
<p>The PCR tests aren't inherently a bad thing either, though they are very susceptible to getting massaged via cycle threshold to help a particular narrative or not.</p>
<p>I haven't bothered to be tested since I would hate it if I became a statistic for an 'expert' to twist around.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I just had a minor medical procedure in the hospital a couple weeks ago but the whole week before they kept calling me to schedule my testing for this stupid mindcontrol flu. I said no every time. So when I got there they put me in a negative pressure room. I was so insulted but anyway, this has gotten out of control, My brother had the same experience and he said you know what? Yall are full of it and I'm outta here. So then his Dr came in and said yeah, it is BS, lets go. So my bro took his IV's out and left. They were just using him as a lab rat to poke on him so he said no effing way man, not me!</p>

        <p>Thankfully in my state they recently relaxed the use of these tests. They are no longer required of people in order to get their other routine or emergency care taken care of.</p>
<p>Legit, I would walk into work saddened by the fact that patients would be lined up to get those tests in order to get anything else done. I feel particularly bad for individuals suffering chronic conditions that would necessitate being frequently tested such as individuals requiring dialysis treatment as an example.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what it has been like for the elderly population presently in nursing homes, though I shouldn't speak on that with no first hand experience.</p>
