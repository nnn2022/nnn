    <strong>History will judge us as the reasonable ones; we will be the mainstream in the future</strong>
    <p><p>2020 will be regarded as that time the entire world went mad.</p>
<p>That time we let countless millions die of cancer, heart disease, suicide, overdoses, abuse, and starvation because we became obsessed with and irrationally terrified of a new species of coronavirus.</p>
<p>That time we treated an infectious disease like a hurricane -- something we have to hide from rather than treat.</p>
<p>That time we threw out hundreds of years of social progress, and drew asterisks next to every single liberal value: freedom of expression, freedom of association, the right to protest.</p>
<p>That time when the word of some scientists and bureaucrats became the word of god, when complex moral and economic choices were falsely presented as purely scientific ones.</p>
<p>That time when we told women what they had to wear on their heads when they went outside, after years of mocking the middle east for doing the same.</p>
<p>That time when we said every life matters, but threatened to murder those who dare not comply.</p>
<p>That time when authorities created a new class of people -- the non-essentials -- and told them it didn't matter if they could feed their families.</p>
<p>That time we prevented children from seeing their mothers and fathers one last time before they passed away.</p></p>

        <p>I am optimistic about this as well.  Historically it always takes a unifying crisis to bring about real change.  This is the whole thesis of the "great reset".    But I think that this "9 month socialism starter kit" will have the opposite of it's intended effect.  While many people are being, well, socialized to the concept it is also distilling dissent from a lot of people who didn't realize anything was going on.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid the last dissident voices will be suppressed in the near future and the world will usher into some sort of neo-feudalist high-tech Dark Ages. The current ruling class was never as powerful as before, the last few dissident voices get censored, and those that profit from the lockdown and the Corona dictatorship will be EVEN more powerful in the near future. And as they set the agenda, they decide what the media say, what schools teach, etc. ... there will be hardly any places left for critical voices. I'm very pessimistic.</p>

        <p>I agree with you.  I always thought when something like this happened people would stand up to it.  I've tried, but I have no one to stand alongside me, no one is willing to leave their comfortable life to fight for the natural rights our ancestors fought for.  Ever since the 50s the government has been working to make us weak by making our life more and more comfortable, we're now to a point no one is willing to leave that comfort even when faced with tyranny.  Everyone likes to say they would've fought the Nazis, fought alongside our founders against the British, but as history has always shown and continues to show, few actually do.</p>

        <p>Censorship-resistant encrypted decentralized communication networks and even financial systems, e.g. cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the Dark Web, are more sophisticated, robust, and user-friendly than ever before. It's the ruling class that should be (and are!) worried about the march of information technology, not us.</p>

        <p>What's essential or not is entirely arbitrary. Sure we can go without software updates for a few months, maybe even a few years. But at some point things need repair or updating. People rely on their machines to keep working, sometimes to stay alive even. </p>
<p>Who decides what is and isn't non essential, and by what measures? The other day I saw a guy call for a ban on the sale of anything "you don't need to survive", mentioning biscuits, chocolate, coffee, cigarettes, sweets, magazines, and cleaning supplies as non essential. But are they non essential? Often when I'm sick the only thing my stomach will tolerate are dry biscuits. Do we really want to lock people down and then force them to kick their addictions at the same time? That's bound to go well...</p>
<p>You could survive on dry bread and water for months. That doesn't mean it would do you any good. Do you want to be able to buy <em>only</em> bread and drink tap water? What else would you need to live?</p>

        <p>The sad thing is we won't be the mainstream the people who now are acting crazy will just mirror us out of shame, that's what I think anyway. Take solis in the fact that our words have meaning. They talk but say nothing. I think we should be careful not to make an example of ourselves, not  to get crucified, so to speak</p>

        <p>I don't understand why!? How will anyone benefit from this lockdown? Everything is terrible this year, and it's just become worse with covid and isolation. </p>
<p>Why do these people in power want to control the masses? Sorry-- this is just so frustrating, and I'm often just so confused.</p>
