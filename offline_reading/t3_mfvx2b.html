    <strong>has anyone else though about how they're going to interact with the people who supported lockdowns after we go back to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I have recently been gritting my teeth and fuming at my mouth thinking about interacting with the people I know who are avid lockdowners. they still haven't seen though the massive propaganda yet, and the worse thing is, they're actually benefitting from the effects the lockdowns had. recently, my a level exams got cancelled and alot of my doomer classmates are rejoicing over the fact that they can just get a grade based on online assessments and tests they cheated on, instead of actually giving the stupid exam. one of them is so retarded that she thinks that "its a big risk to give exams" as if were going to go give them in a war zone or some shit. I feel like this might be against what some people here might think, but the one thing I'll miss about lockdowns is the fact that I haven't had to interact with these people irl. if they get annoying, I just mute or block them, but once I'll actually have to interact with them in real life, I would prefer to poke an eyeball out.
I seriously don't even know what its going to be like interacting with these people who were "so concerned about the greater good" that they helped contribute to the biggest scam in human history.</p></p>

        <p>Remind them to put on a mask constantly. 
Berate them whenever they are closer to anyone than 1.5 meters.
Berate them every time they visit people.
Berate them every time they show intimacy to anyone, including their SO or kids.
Berate them for going out to restaurants or bars.
Every time something happens either blame it on something that happened in the last 28 days or say it's just a coincidence nd natural event.
When they leave the building when I enter I'll do newspaper cuttings and send them by mail.
I'll rent a billboard when they burn their mail unopened.</p>

        <p>I resist the temptation to give lockdown fanatics a hard time when they finally decide to go on a vacation, or visit their grandma, or go to a bar, etc*. I care more about actually getting back to normal than pointing out their hypocrisy. I encourage them to change their minds. I don't need them to admit they were wrong. Whatever mental gymnastics they want to do is fine. I want to minimize the psychological barriers to returning to normal as much as possible. </p>
<p>*I would call someone a hypocrite if they were giving someone a hard time about going on vacation AFTER they themselves went on vacation. However, I'm willing to forget people's past transgressions.</p>
<p>Once we have some distance from the covid restrictions, then I think we can turn our attention to putting in the legal framework necessary to prevent this from ever happening again. But I think people will need some time to accept that the lockdowns did more harm than good.</p>

        <p>they won't, because they won't be in their little echo chamber on the Internet. oh, and I'm not in a minority as you'd might think, despite being surrounded by psycho doomers, alot of people I know have woken up to this bullshit, including my whole family.</p>
