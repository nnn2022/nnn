        <p>Thats because canada is heavy heavy liberal. They believe whatever trudeau and company tell them. Probably one of the faults of canadians always saying we should have peace but thats just not the reality we live in. You have to accept that and roll with the punches</p>

        <p>Canadians are some of the biggest pussies ever.</p>
<p>The overwhelming sentiment amongst the liberal intelligentsia is they are "doing their part".  They actually think they are "helping".  They are "making the world a better place".  In Canada, we've all "got each other's backs".</p>
<p>I want to puke.</p>
<p>I would wager roughly 25% of the population is based.  I've had plenty of whispered conversations: "this is fucked up, what are we going to do?".  But then, we always come back to the realization there really isn't anything else to do.  </p>
<p>Leave Canada?  Okay, maybe at some point.  But where?  How?  Is that not a bit cowardly abandoning my country, friends and family?     </p>
<p>Being "nice" is one of the Great Canadian Virtues.  People would rather be wrong and nice than right and be called an "American".  Or worse, gasp (!), a "Trump Supporter".  The fear of being "not Canadian" is very real.</p>
<p>There's such a swarmy, smug arrogance oozing out of the liberal intelligentsia class, the ones who work in government, the Media, official services.  They have <em>loved</em> working from home.  Watching Netflix in the background in their pyjamas, <em>never missing a paycheck.</em> It was a fun winter for many people in Canada.  They could order DoorDash with impunity without feeling guilty.  Many Canadians coming out of this look like they were the packing on the pounds like it was a sport.  Like some sort of pious sacrifice made to the alter of covid of "doing your part".  Always staying inside and ordering food.</p>
<p>It's just all so sad.</p>

        <p>I'm Canadian, I don't understand why people are just blindly following.  There is alot of pressure to get vaxxed and yes some where it as a badge if honor, posting selfies with their vaccine card.  I know people that are refusing to see unvaxxed friends and family and it's depressing to watch.  Now there is talk of a fall election and if the Liberals get a majority we are all screwed.  Our news doesn't cover anything that would make people question what's happening and if you try to tell people they scoff that it wasn't on the news so it didn't happen or it isn't true.  BC is currently burning and the coverage is nothing compared to the 2017 fires, too much talk about Covid.  I stopped watching because it isn't really news anymore.  I don't think investigative journalists exist anymore or they've been silenced.  Doctors in Ontario are losing their right to practice because they don't follow the narrative.</p>
