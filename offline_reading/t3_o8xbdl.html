    <strong>The US government has agreed to fight the American people.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's consider <a href="http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GeneralMilleyTestifiesToCongressThatWhiteRageCausedAnAttackOnCapitolToOverturnConstitution.mp4">the statement by America's top military officer</a> in context.</p>
<p>After decades of <a href="https://leagueofrealpeople.com/why-false-left-right-paradigm-exists-and-establishment-is-left/">establishment assaults on the American people from the so-called left</a> ....</p>
<p>After America had just experienced several months of BLM burning buildings, breaking windows, looting stores, carrying guns, shooting people, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, expressing racism, and attacking white bystanders .... because cops shoot black people at the same rate per encounter as white people .... and which was whitewashed as "mostly peaceful" protests by the establishment ....</p>
<p>And after unarmed Trump voters protesting the <a href="https://leagueofrealpeople.com/2020-trump-biden-election-fraud-voter-cheating-self-evident/">stolen election</a> at the Capitol caused no fires or deaths, shot no one, bullied no bystanders, expressed no racism, broke no windows, planted no bombs, threw no rocks or Molotov cocktails, destroyed no property, and rejected the agents provocateur trying to incite them .... and are being blackwashed by the entire establishment ....</p>
<p><em>Then</em> .... <em>in that context</em> .... General Mark Milley, Chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying before Congress, June 23, 2021, <a href="http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GeneralMilleyTestifiesToCongressThatWhiteRageCausedAnAttackOnCapitolToOverturnConstitution.mp4">said</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;I want to understand white rage, and <em>I'm white</em>.^(--General Mark Milley, Chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying before Congress, June 23, 2021)</p>
<p>Given his statement before that, one might think he merely wanted to know what other people meant by "white rage", but his next words made his meaning clear:</p>
<p>&rt;What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building [the Capitol] and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that?</p>
<p>His boss, the Commander in Chief, had <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/biden-says-u-s-experienced-worst-attack-on-democracy-since-civil-war/2590458/">just said</a> he inherited:</p>
<p>&rt;The worst attack on our Democracy Since the Civil War.^(--Joe Biden, address to Congress, April 28, 2021)</p>
<p>Joe Biden would have been correct if he had meant that the <em>stolen election</em> was the worst threat on our Democracy since the Civil War, but he was referring to the <em>peaceful protest</em> of the stolen election. He would also have been correct if he had meant that the actions of the US government during the Civil War (e.g. imprisoning legislators to stop them from voting) were a threat to democracy, because it is a logical error to call secession a threat to democracy, but he meant that <em>secession</em> was the threat to democracy.</p>
<p>Then Joe Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/01/joe-biden-tulsa-oklahoma-race-massacre-us-politics-live">said</a> just days before Milley's statement to Congress: that white supremacy is the "most lethal threat" to America.</p>
<p>The words of General Milley were the next step in the end game of the Apex Players. The US military is the final part of the establishment that has declared the American people to be the enemy. Even the US military itself probably didn't know why it was ordered to engage in asymmetric warfare--<em>hard</em>--for 50 years, but many of us have known since the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>However, the US military has its own intelligence branch, so it knows the election was stolen, and it knows who is being whitewashed and who is being blackwashed. It knows that "white rage" is bullshit. It knows that all almost all terrorism is perpetrated directly or indirectly by the US establishment or its global masters. It knows that secession is a right (that's how America was formed) and that secession is not a threat to democracy. It knows that the American establishment has done everything it can to strengthen China (limited only by having to maintain <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/">the illusion of legitimacy</a>). It knows that <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/opium-afghanistan-war-asymmetric-nwo-cabal-illusion-legitimacy/">the American government doesn't work for the American people</a>, and at this late stage, it has to be fully aware that it is being set up to fight the American people .... and it has agreed ....</p>
<p>As bad as that sounds, the reality is worse. <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/winep-admits-us-false-flag-iran/">The American establishment admits that it uses false flags and secret provocations to start any war that it wants to happen.</a></p></p>

        <p>I am sure that is true, but those generals loyal to the American people have been losing by attrition for decades, and they will continue to do so if the onoing trends continue. Perhaps this slap in the face will help to wake them up.</p>

        <p>You can run for office. County by county we can win. There are something like 400k local elected officials and 5k nationaly elected. Go run for one of those 400k local offices. It’s what the left has done for 30 years. Hence we have DAs and school boards funded by outsiders ( $oro$ and friends ). Our local DAs let out criminals who shoot at cops and burn down buildings. School boards are all politics and they force their political views on children. Take the power back one step at a time.</p>

        <p>Don’t learn to be helpless. This plan will take 30 years. If you are 25, your tree won’t bear fruit until you are 55. I’m 45, my plans won’t see fruit until im 75. We must play the long game. It’s the same reason you don’t throw all Hail Marys when you are down by 4 TDs, you still have a plan and need to stick to it. There is still a lifetime of game left to be played. Be the hope you want to see. Feel free to DM if you need to talk to someone. I can help in a very limited capacity on running a campaign. I can also just give a pep talk. Hope is not lost :)</p>

        <p>Just a few points you may want to consider if you haven't already:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those positions shouldn't exist in the first place.</li>
<li>Good people don't want to do those jobs. Those jobs are designed to attract people who are soul sick, and they are designed to make one soul sick if one was not already. The pro-establishment side has a lot more of those people.</li>
<li>They will see you coming.</li>
<li>If this strategy worked, then why has the Libertarian Party been trying it since 1970 with petty much zero progress?</li>
<li>If this strategy were starting to work, the trend where central/federal government is taking an increasing amount of power from the state and local governments would accelerate, so they would just eliminate your local elected position and federalize it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could probably think of more, but those are the ones I could think of as fast as I could write them.</p>

        <p>The Generals have been selling out the country for some time.</p>
<p>None of them stood up against the obvious falsehoods surrounding 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. They all get incredible perks and many get defense contractor jobs right after retiring with hundred thousand or million dollar a year salaries. </p>
<p>The US military is completely incompetent and FUBAR. Don't look for them to save your ass....they are more likely to start killing people.</p>

        <p>Capitalist indoctrination is so strong that you have internalized a devil, Communism, that will always be responsible for tempting you to sin, that will always be an excuse onto which you can project the internal failure of sacred ideas like free markets and capitalist democracy.</p>
