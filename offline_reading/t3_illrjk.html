    <strong>The lockdowns have made my mental and physical health worse</strong>
    <p><p>I've always had allergies and have had social anxiety for a long time, but things have gotten worse under COVID-19. Before, my allergies were tolerable, with just some flareups from post-nasal drip and the occasional bad day due to sinuses throbbing. Now, I have a persistent cough I need take additional medicine for to calm down, and breathing is heavier at night. If I wear a mask, I have to breath heavily for most of the day afterwards due to not getting enough air because of the mask. This made a recent haircut hell for me since I had to wait for a while with a mask in the lobby.</p>
<p>People might say that I should just stay home and only go out for groceries (I work from home), but my allergies were made worse directly because I was stuck at home, breathing the same shit in and out for months and sanitizing like crazy when I went out, all because I was lead to believe a supervirus was going to kill me if I dared step out for anything besides groceries (which I started to get via pickup eventually due to my because of how afraid I was of the virus). I have to start exposing my immune system to the shit outside of my neighborhood without a mask or else I'll only get worse and worse. I can't stand living a life where I'm locked in my home forever because of allergies that are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. I need to fight it, even if it comes with a risk.</p>
<p>Social anxiety? I was becoming more paranoid and distrusting before the lockdowns, but the lockdowns and fearmongering about the virus solidified them. I have no idea how long it will take me to reverse this. Being around people again is an excellent start, though.</p>
<p>I got fatter under the lockdowns and my blood pressure flared up because I was unable to do anything but sit on my ass, work, play video games, and eat salty as hell preserved foods due to lockdowns and the fear caused by the media. I've since started rectifying it (already seeing a lot of weight loss), but seeing so much weight gain and blood pressure increase during a routine doctor's visit scared the hell out of me and just made my mental health worse.</p>
<p>I'm mad because the damn experts and politicians are the reason why I've gotten so bad. I genuinely believe this nonsense has made me more vulnerable to COVID-19 than without it and has done damage to my mental health. I'm pissed and think nobody would care if I told them about this. I have the feeling they'd say things like, "Oh, but we're all in this together!", "Do you want to be on a ventilator?", or "You're a jerk that doesn't care about others!". I have to fight and reverse the damage caused by the lockdowns and fearporn from the virus instead of melting into a permanent shut-in, but it seems like the world would prefer that I put fear of the virus over my well-being, adding to my anxiety.</p>
<p>When people tell me to "trust the experts", I find it very hard to do so because of how much worse my physical and mental health are because of their recommendations and initial overhyping of the virus as this world ending event. They've thrown me to the wolves to stop a virus that isn't anywhere close to being apocalyptic despite media hype; how can I trust them? It might seem selfish, but I am not going to turn into an allergy-riddled hermit with a weak immune system that fears his own shadow for the sake of guidelines and policy recommendations given by faceless "experts" and bureaucrats that have already made life worse for me than if I got the virus, no matter how educated they are on diseases and viruses.</p>
<p>My blessing is that I live in a state that's lifted lockdowns and requirements. Masks are still required in most stores.</p></p>
