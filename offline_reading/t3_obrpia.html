    <strong>Is anyone else getting bad vibes about Future Lockdowns after 4th of July?</strong>
    <p><p>They are practically announcing it by the media causally saying “America won’t meet Biden’s 4th of July goal of all adults 70% Vaccinated.” And it’s freaking me the fuck out. I’ve seen multiple propaganda organizations casually announce this. It’s freaking me out because the media for the last year hyped up Fauci-Chinese Virus to 200%. So to just causally say it’s no big deal Biden didn’t meet his goal is fucking creepy. I have a bad feeling that after 4th of July they will lockdown HARD. And they will blame it on the “Delta Variant.” They will blame the 4th of July for the sudden increase and then Lock us down. Just remember Lockdowns were a Campaign Promise for Dementia Biden. </p>
<p>And I have a feeling they will follow through with that promise. They allowed us a little Freedom and then they will take it away. Because they will blame it on a combination of the Unvaccinated and Delta. Causing hatred among your peers for not getting the Gene Therapy. Increasing the Peer Pressure. Is the ultimate goal I believe. Once we hit 70% they will announce the Vaccine Passports like the UAE and Israel is doing for all Schools, Businesses and anything else you can think of. And people who are resisting the peer pressure will be made Public Enemy #1 by the media and State Government or else your just banned from these stores because your the minority. </p>
<p>I hope I’m wrong. I want to be wrong. But I don’t think I am.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty sure this is what will kick off the revolution.</p>
<p>The (bullshit lie) Carbon Neutral movement is a giant trap that will have us literally living in the pods and eating the bugs.</p>
<p>Won't be able to farm or have an industry that isn't probably carbon neutral. Bye bye independent businesses.</p>
<p>Won't be able to fly anymore. Bad for the same earth that has massive volcanic activity all the time since it's inception. Of course, the VIPs will be able to.</p>
<p>Enjoy travelling by centralized train! It will be the only way you will be able to travel for long distances in the US because..</p>
<p>Can't drive cars anymore! At least not those AWFUL gas cars that can drive for hundreds of miles and take only moments to fill back up! Nope, just cheap electric cars that can't go more than 160 miles without needing a recharge. Don't get caught out in the middle of nowhere though, because...</p>
<p>There are no more small towns and rural areas anymore, just "smart cities" hubbed around megalopolises. Inefficient and not carbon neutral to demand food and electricity is provided to people outside of major cities, so best group us all together. Don't worry about that though, because...</p>
<p>You'll be living in terribly diminished conditions in a ruined society! Thanks to UBI many people not only do nothing but younger generations aren't interested in learning or growing in any significant way. Why do that when drugs are legal and sex is like a handshake? Surely we have entered a utopia...</p>
<p>Until about 2 generations later when the past has been eradicated, any living memory of a world before is dead, and you just have a mass of useless eaters jerking off and smoking weed 24/7.</p>
<p>That's when the culling begins.</p>

        <p>Biden never had a national lockdown or mask order in the first place. He just got really pissed off at Texas when they lifted their mask order.</p>
<p>I can't imagine him recommending that states re-adopt lockdowns or even mask mandates at this point. I think Biden's viewpoint is basically that if you haven't gotten vaccinated at this point then that's your own doing, and other people shouldn't have to wear masks to protect you.</p>

        <p>Hopefully he stays that way. Sticking to lockdowns is proven disastrous to democratic leadership, which has already led to the recall of Gavin Newsom. Him not being involved in this is the best course of action based on his resume</p>

        <p>No one with a brain in the US is going to go along with another lockdown, mass mask requirement.  The southeast remained mostly mask free and lockdown free in the first place.  I think it would take the military to enforce any kind of mass lockdowns or mask mandates here now.</p>

        <p>Trump didnt lock down America. Biden didnt lock down America. The states along with corporations did under the guidance of CDC and Fauci who are rapidly being discredited every week. </p>
<p>That being said, it is possible some states (blue ones) will do another lockdown. California is pretty much fully open except for masks here and there. Unless there is some dramatic and large scale loss of life from a new virus (not a variant), I dont see the states doing another full scale lockdown. </p>
<p>In the US, covid is wrapping up, at least on the state level. Corps and businesses will probably keep doing security theatre until the CDC gives the all clear, which will take some more time. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I can see other countries like UK and Canada keeping this up for the forseeable future.</p>

        <p>It’s going to need to be quite dramatic to get those that have awoken to the BS to play along with their game again. It’ll work in the usual places as they seem to love worshiping at the Mask alter, but another round of this garbage will require heavy handed “enforcement”.</p>

        <p>He probably realizes he can't reach that 70% with the current ages that are authorized. Doesn't want to risk pissing the vaccinated off, especially when they're about to start offering people a 3rd shot🤡  They'll rush thru the 5 to 12 year old approval and get some more that way😥</p>

        <p>I don’t think it will happen. People are so done with it here. I’m thinking maybe California, Michigan, New York, and Illinois might lockdown halfway again in the fall/winter because of the flu which they will claim is covid, but otherwise I don’t see the majority of states enforcing this or people going along with it. That’s IF the fed tries to suggest it. I don’t think they will because at this point it’s very unpopular.</p>
