    <strong>Boyfriend is getting vax and I don’t know what to do</strong>
    <p><p>So now his office is trying to require it for work which last time I checked is highly illegal in the US on a federal level. He is not for or against the ”vaccine” and doesn’t believe that there’s anything bad about it, he does disagree with how this whole thing has been played out though. They asked him if he’s had it and when he said he didn’t they treated him like he was crazy. The new CEO is requiring it for people going back to the office and they want him back to train people.  He told he he is getting it cause he can’t afford to risk his job. I doubt they can ask for proof though but he says he’s not going to lie. I am sickened that no one will stand up for their rights. I have been having bad periods recently when I never had them before and I suspect it is from being around the vaccinated as many women are saying. My mother even got her period again after going through menopause 5+ years ago. This stuff is disturbing. I already told him if he takes it I might just want to use condoms forever cause who knows how that could affect me. I mean if people are feeling the affects from merely being around someone then what about being sexually involved with someone? I mean this stuff is evil on many levels. I am also a spiritual person and I can just sense this shit is evil. I don’t know what to do. I told him what happens if I get seriously ill? There’s no taking this vaccine back. He doesn’t care. He probably just thinks I’m wrong. Idk what to do. It really sucks because I love him dearly and I thought we would get married and maybe have children someday. Now this evil may or may not destroy our relationship... I’m beyond upset and my faith in humanity gets lower and lower everyday.</p></p>

        <p>Hey! I can relate to a lot of what you said in your post as my husband got the vaccine as well and I was wondering for the longest time WHY. Basically he chalks it up
to being peer pressured into it. At the end of the day, I realize we’re just not going to agree on everything and I respect everyone’s choice to get the vaccine if they choose. I totally understand your feelings towards it might being unsafe for you. Personally 1 week after my husband got the shot I was extremely sick for 2 weeks. Your thoughts are totally valid. I’m really sorry you’re even having to think about these things :( I wish I could
offer better advice! I’m just taking it day by day honestly</p>

        <p>I hate to say it, but your boyfriend is an NPC. You have a fundamental difference in values. I got a nice job and would quit on the spot if they tried to force me out over not getting a vaccine and I wouldn’t even hesitate.</p>

        <p>The workplace was an email and a phone call.</p>

<p>But then</p>
<p>https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/faqs#vaccine</p>
<p>&rt;DOL and OSHA, as well as other federal agencies, are working diligently to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. OSHA does not wish to have any appearance of discouraging workers from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and also does not wish to disincentivize employers’ vaccination efforts. As a result, OSHA will not enforce 29 CFR 1904’s recording requirements to require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination through May 2022. We will reevaluate the agency’s position at that time to determine the best course of action moving forward.</p>

        <p>Seems this is merely an alleviation of a reporting requirement. I don't see anything here disclaiming liability from workplace injury.  They are using the word 'record' in a way I don't understand if they mean to say that they're no longer liable for not 'recording' an incident of workplace injury. I dont know how that stuff really works though. However, I'd just sue them on the grounds of disability law first and foremost.</p>

        <p>If it's not recorded as a vaccine side effect, it's not covered under worker's compensation or protections. It's shoving it under the rug and then ripping the rug out from under all of the people expecting the government to have their back.</p>

        <p>That is definitely a lie because literally zero evidence, that hasn’t already been debunked, exists to support these claims. I’m not even being hyperbolic in the slightest, there’s a reason the scientific consensus is that the vaccine is fine. The arrogance of people to think they know more about a subject than those that dedicate their entire lives to studying that one subject is fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>No all y’all just lost. How are these medical experiment gene therapies not considered a crime against humanity? I don’t know. All I know is these fucks want to genetically modify humans so badly they put it in our food and just about everything we come into contact with. We can absorb fucking radiation from phones. We can literally be mind controlled through computer waves (this has been known for decades). And you’re gonna tell me something injected into the human body and alters cell function ISNT going to pass on to others? I mean people swap DNA when they kiss. Just cause we can’t see it don’t mean it can’t affect us.... if you aren’t on this path you won’t see any of this shit but empaths sense this shit. It don’t take much to figure out there’s some fishy shit going on. Also how can you discredit tens of thousands of women on multiple websites and social media’s talking about their experience either being vaccinated or merely being in contact with them? What are they all fake people conspiracy bullshit spreaders? Come on now. I get some of this conspiracy shit can be propaganda but personal testimonies can’t really be disputed.</p>

<p>If the vaccine is spreadable... like if your period is off because people around you are vaxxed and they're spreading it... we're all already screwed. </p>
<p>Odds are, he'll probably be fine. Some side effects, but fine. I doubt he'll spread anything to you (it's possible, I just doubt it).</p>
<p><strong>My advice to you:</strong></p>
<p>Frame things as small and temporary. Don't think in terms of forever. Say, "we'll only have sex with a condom until I find out more and get more comfortable. I'm too worried right now."</p>
<p>That leaves the door open for things to get better. </p>
<p><strong>My advice to everyone:</strong></p>
<p>Get outside more! Feel the rain, the wind, the sun. Touch a plant, a rock, a stream. Break a sweat and laugh! </p>
<p>It's good for the soul and really helps me keep things in perspective.</p>

        <p>I totally agree and don't want to fall into the same trap as the doomers.  Although having taken the prick gives me more reasons than just shedding to not want to be around you anyway so why not play it safe.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure they can do that at this time because there isn’t a legal standard, though many states have submitted bills protecting workers who won’t get jabbed. Once that happens though you can bet on it that they will just make life hell for those that won’t submit proof; masks forever, daily testing, shit like that.</p>

        <p>Hey OP.  Thanks for sharing your story. Really you put it out all there. I can certainly empathize with you. This whole vaccine is literally creating such a divide in our relationships. I am for one not getting the vaccine and agree with all the things you said. This shit is pure evil. Plain and simple. The fact that people are being pressured and coerced into it is terrible. But at the end of the day we all live by the choices we make. </p>
<p>I am also quite spiritual as well. What I feel might be happening is you are no longer resonating with one another. Something so fundamental as health, truth, and purpose is coming up right now. If people choose to be blind or ignorant it says a lot. Might be time to move on.</p>

        <p>A coworker told me her periods been abnormally heavy... (she didn’t get vaxxed) 
Mine was late for three days.... thought I was pregnant, but nope. (Test came out negative) I work in healthcare. Most of my coworkers are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Being late. HIGHLY unusual.
And yes, I sense there’s something very off with the vaccine...</p>

        <p>That's a tough one... I'm sorry you're in this situation right now. I don't know if this makes things better, but all of my roommates are vaccinated because they work in the hospital. I was scared that it might influence me as well, but I have not experienced any negative side effects after they got vaccinated. So I do not believe that vaccinations effect people other than the vaccinated itself. I also have beem very intimate with someone who was vaccinated and still was not effected. Hope things work out well for you, but I don't think you should be scared that his vaccination will impact you. Good luck!</p>

        <p>I can attest to this. Work in a central London hospital and one of the only probably not vaccinated. Haven’t personally been affected whatsoever since other people have been vaxxed.</p>

        <p>Really good news!  I'd imagine it depends on a couple of factors, one being a thousand variables - the other being birth control - I'd imagine girls not on hormonal birth control are a much better indicator of what's really going on in relation to environmental exposure.  Although I'd imagine that if it were an acute enough problem that we would see problems in those on hormones as well.</p>

        <p>There is no good answer to this. Stay and something bad might happen or you could just live your whole life in uncertainty , seeing your future plans blown away. Leave, and suffer for couple of months, years, until you find someone else. I would just leave and never look back in this certain scenario, because he is a "danger" not only to himself but to those around him also with this kind of thinking (virus or not). But then again, it`s just me thinking like this, as we all have different views.</p>

        <p>Here is an excellent resource that shows it’s illegal to require an experimental vaccine.  https://lcaction.org/vaccine</p>
<p>So you have told him that you are afraid for your health because of him getting the vaccine.  If he cannot assuage you with data that says otherwise, then it sounds to me like he is choosing his job over you.  Which a lot of people have done for decades for many reasons.  I think you should spell that out for him, his reaction will tell you everything you need to know</p>

<p>I'm really worried about the shedding at this point like you said - terrified about all these stories of girls having horrible periods and such.  Girls are far more in touch with our ancestors than guys because of reproduction and they have a visible monthly blueprint about what's going on.  This spike proteins vaccine shedding thing is likely affecting us all but girls just have a more visible indicator.  I'm terrified for my wife.</p>

You said you’re spiritual, this could very well be a test (I’m right there with you) I think we as the divine feminine need to be supportive during this time but for the love of god have a plan and an oh shit bag ready to go. If he’s thinking about taking it and unwilling to lie about it, you have sheep on your hands and that could weigh you down later if you ever need to run.

        <p>That’s a thing too the thought of what could be passed to children later down the line. We have been through a lot together and it would be a shame if this is the thing that makes the relationship take a dive. I understand cause he just wants to make sure he is secure in his finances, as he is trying to get his life together still finishing his degree and what not and does not want anything jeopardized. Also most of his family has gotten it so he doesn’t think anything bad will happen to him. I understand where he is coming from but I’m just like this can inadvertently affect me in many ways and if he could just please don’t do this one thing and just trust me. But he thinks all this is conspiracy hogwash. The brainwashing runs strong because he didn’t even want to take it before. Now cause his family has gotten it and a lot of people he feels socially pressured. He don’t even like masks and also we had covid and he didn’t even get sick. It just baffles me. But it’s understandable with his current financial situation why he can’t risk losing his job but I honestly don’t think it’s that big a deal, like his job didn’t flat out say if you don’t get it you’re fired. But he doesn’t want shit to get complicated if they keep pushing it ya know. For now he is getting tested every couple days for the office and holding off for now just cause he knows I won’t change my mind on this. It’s sad that it’s come down to this but it’s the only thing keeping him from taking it.</p>

        <p>People were forced to make a decision about this so quickly, they were trapped, and people, especially men, tie their life and their worth to their job, and they don't believe they could make it if they quit. They see the vaccine as an acceptable risk because to them to not take would mean they would certainly lose their life.</p>
<p>Badgering him relentlessly when he is already being pressured by everyone else isnt likely to have a positive effect &amp; could just make it worse. Most people already have made up their mind strongly one way or the other. They are likely going to keep mandating boosters every so many months, if he ever is going change his mind and have the confidence to quit and change jobs he will have an easier time doing that if he feels supported by you instead of seeing you as another adversary. </p>
<p>Supporting someone is not the same thing as agreeing with everything they do or changing your own mind, it means helping them after they have made whatever choice they've made.</p>
<p>Love means putting your relationship above your own well-being sometimes; If he had a natural Covid infection, would you treat him differently because of that? If yes, you probably dont have a real relationship. If no, then dont treat him differently because of this. </p>
<p>If it turns out you dont love him that much: unlike a natural infection where we know the average time a person will take to clear the virus, I have not been able to find how long it takes for all of the particles to either attach to a cell or degrade and then clear the spikes. I would make a guess that a month after the 2nd shot there would be nothing left.</p>

        <p>Are- are you ACTUALLY this stupid?? How entitled do you have to be to believe you have a RIGHT to put other people's health and well-being at risk? You sound like the type of person to get blackout drunk and choose to drive, it's LITERALLY the same kind of decision.
Like you're seriously listening to people with zero expertise in science ABOUT SCIENCE. Like what the actual fuck
Btw, it is 1000% IMPOSSIBLE for this vaccine to affect your reproductive organs or for any kind of side effect to spread to anyone else.</p>
<p>You're screaming “santa is real” and have the audacity to be upset that people treat you like a fucking moron.</p>
