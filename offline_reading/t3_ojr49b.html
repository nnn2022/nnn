    <strong>Blueprint of the digital Global Vax Pass Roll-out !</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li><strong>The blueprint -</strong> <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process?preview=/76241/76276/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf">https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process?preview=/76241/76276/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">GoodHealthPass</a> is the digital global vax pass, owned by Bill Gates &amp; Rockeffelers</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More info:</p>
<p><strong><em>They want to link the vax pass to a digital global id system named</em></strong> <a href="https://id2020.org">id2020</a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Guess who owns both <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">GoodHealthPass</a> and <a href="https://id2020.org">id2020</a>? Bill G and Rockefellers. UN and WEF are in also.</p>
<p>&rt;ID2020 is a ‘digital identity’ project spearheaded by Bill Gates and Microsoft, and overseen by the United Nations. As part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Initiative, ID2020’s purported goal is using digital identity as a solution to the problem of over 1 billion people who live without any officially recognized identity.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To achieve this ambitious goal, Microsoft has incorporated four other companies into ID2020, forming the so called ‘ID2020 Alliance’ made up of Microsoft, Gavi Vaccine Alliance, Accenture, IDEO, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Other companies like Mastercard recently joined the alliance as its profile continues to rise in light of the Coronavirus Pandemic and the increasing likelihood of digital identity being used as a means to verify who has been vaccinated against COVID-19.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Since its inception in 2016, the ID2020 Alliance had mostly been under the radar and only recently came into the limelight when in March this year, Bill Gates inadvertently made it known that he intended to push for the use of digital certificates as way of verifying who has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.<br>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More about id2020 development and funding:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The following year, at the annual summit 2017 in the United Nations</strong> ECOSOC Chamber, ID2020 adopted “the platform of change” and started the ID2020 Alliance, <strong><em>with funding from major donor Rockefeller Foundation</em></strong> and the digital technology consultant firm Accenture***.*** <strong><em>Other founding partners were GAVI – The Vaccine Alliance, Microsoft</em></strong> <strong><em>and IDEO.org (a design and consultant firm with partners like The Rockefeller Foundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and The Bezos Family Foundation).</em></strong> Participants included <strong>Intel, IBM, Verizon, Samsung, NEC, and SAP.</strong> The Alliance featured a very tight connection between big tech companies, foundations, and vaccine and health interests.<br>

        <p>Ah. Kind of a weird reason without reason. Either Reddit doesn't want that information circulating or its just a coincidental auto removal.</p>
