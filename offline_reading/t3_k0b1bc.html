    <strong>I was in the Class of 2020. Let me tell you what it was really like.</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like this is the only subreddit that would truly appreciate hearing the horrible, honest truth about the class of 2020.</p>
<p>As a graduating senior this year, my university made the decision to cancel my graduation ceremony, replacing it with a virtual stand-in event and a promise of a physical event at some indeterminate point in the future. Prior to my university announcing this, many universities across the country made similar announcements. I remember watching in horror as one by one these institutions axed their ceremonies until it was finally time for mine to do the same. And suddenly, after four years of work and studying, the acknowledgement of my efforts was destroyed by a single announcement.</p>
<p>I was horrified. I began a downward spiral that sent me into a depression that lasted two entire months. The magnitude of my loss played through my head on repeat day in and day out. I tried to forget, but the pain wouldn't go away. It left a deep mental scar that has not healed and will probably never heal. It has soured my memories of my college years and given me a negative view of schools and universities in general as I realized that, rather than acknowledging my feelings, they tried to coerce me to feel happy about this instead. I can no longer see them as forces of good in this world.</p>
<p>The virtual ceremony was absolute shit. It was pre-recorded and incredibly demeaning. They spent the ceremony reminding us of what we missed out on and focusing more on praising essential workers than praising our efforts as students. It came and went like nothing happened.</p>
<p>What happened to me was torture. There is no other word for it. It was the most traumatic experience of my life and I'm fucked up now because of it. And we cannot ever let it happen again. We need to make a promise as a society that the class of 2020 is the last senior class that will ever experience this.</p></p>

        <p>I was in the high school class of 2020. Planned on going to college, but decided to take a year off and wait until fall 2021.</p>
<p>The college I planned to go to was almost full lockdown, all the way down to shower schedules. I’m working full time this year instead and have found some other colleges that have more relaxed restrictions and more reasonable Presidents. Fingers crossed college can be somewhat normal in Fall 2021, because I’m not taking another year off of school.</p>

        <p>Sorry about your graduation. My daughter was in the class of 2020 also. I feel your pain. You bring up a great point: if universities don’t pull their collective heads out of the COVID hysteria, many of them will render themselves obsolete. </p>
<p>I have two kids in two different out of state universities and shovel tens of thousands of dollars to each. Both are on near total zoom schedules. This IS NOT WHAT UNIVERSITY IS ABOUT. </p>
<p>I’m tempted to recommend they take a semester or year off. Let’s be real: the experience has been reduced to an online education. One can get that for a lot cheaper. I can see a scenario where a few elite schools offer online education that drives many other universities out on the streets. </p>

        <p>College has turned into a propaganda machine with identity politics, so maybe its for the best and don't forget the student loan trap that many fell into. Maybe it's time to reconsider what you should learn. The internet is free "for now" use it.</p>

        <p>I understand how upsetting this would be, but if that is honestly the most traumatic experience of your entire life you have led an incredibly sheltered and cushy life. In the grand scheme of 2020 canceling the graduation ceremonies was not the worst thing that has happened regarding lockdowns and restrictions etc. (think families literally going hungry because they have no source of income and are one step away from being homeless for just one example), although I do think it is ridiculous that they cancelled and I’m sorry that you got the short end of the stick with being class of 2020. Just the fact that you attended and graduated with a degree from a university means that you are incredibly privileged and lucky compared to the vast majority of the world’s population. Try focusing on the good and don’t let this ruin it all for you. I graduated several years back and I can honestly tell you that while it seems like a bigger deal at the time, in comparison to all of the other things that will happen in your adult life, college graduation is not even close to the most memorable or important days of my life. If you ask most adults who graduated from college how high the graduation ceremony etc. ranks in their most meaningful and important days of their lives, I think you will find it’s not going to be that high (especially if you choose to make your life full and meaningful to you).</p>

        <p>I actually agree that objectively it wasn't the worst thing that ever happened to me. Subjectively, though, it was absolutely awful. I've always been particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and it set off some kind of trigger inside me. I know that I can't be the only one to have felt this.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say it wasn’t bad or that you shouldn’t feel bad about it. I just don’t want it to ruin all the good memories about college you have, or never heal from it Iike you stated in your post. There is a difference between being really sad and disappointed about something and being so affected by something that you go into a deep depression and have a mental scar you don’t think can ever heal, and pain that won’t go away. It’s not even that you shouldn’t feel that upset about it, I just hope that you can heal, and the point I was trying to make in my comment was that as time goes on and there is more distance, I think you will not feel as sad about it (even though I’m sure you will always feel like you missed out), and that by focusing on the good memories and the good things in your life you can hopefully start to let the good take up more real estate in your head than the bad. Not that this is on the same level, but if you have ever experienced the loss of a close family member you can relate to how although it is always painful, as the years go on time and distance provide some healing and help you to process it in a way that isn’t possible when it is still so fresh and raw. I hope that you are able to process this and eventually heal, but it is ultimately your choice and you are a stranger on the internet so if you don’t like my perspective or advice just ignore it and do your own thing. I have two family members who are very close to me that also graduated this year and they were disappointed but they weren’t affected to the same extent that you were. I think you just took it really hard, and I just wanted to try and offer some perspective and advice since you seem like you are still in a dark place and I felt for you in that.</p>

        <p>I think this is a good, positive view on things but man let people feel the way they feel. If this person is crushed about missing graduation, let them be crushed. Pain/grief/anger is not comparative, we each feel how we feel and that’s okay. It’s like saying “oh you shouldn’t be happy because other people are happier”. </p>
<p>Again I think the perspective is an important view but OP, you’re right to feel the way you do and I am mad/sad/crushed for you. My graduation was indeed one of the most important days of my life so far and I remember it very fondly. You are likely to have far more important events down the road but that doesn’t make the loss of this one any less.</p>

        <p>I was in the class of 2020 as well. I wasn't even looking forward to prom or graduation. Just enjoying my last quarter of high school. Most little girls fantasize about their wedding day. As a little girl, I always fantasized about enjoying the last few months of school before college. I waited all my life (yes, I'm 18, I know I haven't had a very long life) for this. I looked forward to this more than anything. I always thought "When the end of high school comes, I am going to enjoy it so much, I can't wait for that." At first, I was glad. Two weeks of being out of school, it would give me a nice break. Then it was after Easter break. Then, May. Then "Oh, by the way, we're not going back at all." Like I said, I wasn't even looking forward to prom or graduation. I just wanted a last day and to enjoy my last quarter. That's all. I remember crying every day, because it looked worse and worse for going back to school. The worst part was I didn't get to say goodbye to my teachers. The best teacher I've ever had, was last year. He got stage 4 cancer earlier in the year. I'm scared I might not ever see him again. I still haven't gotten over it. Whenever I think of it, it just takes me back to the hell that was last spring. </p>
<p>Not looking for pity or anything here, just thought I'd share my story too. I know what it's like to have everything you've worked for, those moments, just stripped away. Not by the virus, but by politicians. Of course everyone in the class of 2020 is upset, but most just say "But it's a sacrifice we needed to make." But it's not like that for everyone, definitely not for me. We should have had a goddamn last quarter, last day, real prom, real graduation, all of it, with no face diapers, and no socialist distancing. Everything normal. And I bet it probably wouldn't have made a difference in the cases or deaths. I know what it's like to take all you have just to get through the day. Keep on going, I know how hard it is.</p>
