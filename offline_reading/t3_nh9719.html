        <p>Okay , truth be told vaccination is not a full proof thing right, it's just a preventive measure of things go south, you can still catch covid. 
But I understand you already know this.</p>
<p>So I was watching this Dr. Wife (who is also a Dr) talk about vaccination, she said that vaccinations takes time to build immunity, he would have survived had he caught covid few months later, and also since he suffered (from something I don't remember) few years back his body was fragile to handle covid.</p>

        <p>&rt;she said that vaccinations takes time to build immunity,</p>
<p>The official statement from the pharmas is 14 days to build anti bodies. Dr. died after 3 months. Covid becomes deadlier only to people with weak immunity . That's why the average age of deaths in US 78 and in UK us 83. 95% of reported deaths in US has average of 4 underlying comorbidities. If you are young and healthy vaccines are useless. You certainly will sail through COVID.</p>

        <p>That is actually logical and Valid point. It takes around 3 weeks after second dose to have immune response, and he had is second dose on February 22nd, so he should have been safe after march 15th.
 I don't remember the full wordings of Dr.Nirmala Aggarwal, but she did state he had some health issue which made him more susceptible to covid and it would take some more time to form immunity.</p>
<p>But unlike other people who were keeping their distance from outside world, he was surrounded by covid patients.
Though your point is right.</p>
