        <p>Where is a link to the data that supports this?  </p>
<p>Screenshots of random speadsheets/numbers implying death by C19 vaccine without a source will get this sub banned for misinformation on Reddit, irrespective if it’s accurate. We have enough attention on this subreddit as it is from pro lockdown/mask/new normal subs - let’s not give them a reason to point to posts that ~~Reddit admins~~ Chinese overlords can use to ban our content.</p>

        <p>The data is from the CDC VAERS which stands for "Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System".  I assumed by now most people on this sub would know about VAERS and recognize the screenshot - sorry.</p>
<p>What is VAERS: "Every Friday, the CDC <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-david-kessler-covid-vaccine-vaers/">VAERS</a> makes public all vaccine injury reports received by the system as of Friday of the previous week.

        <p>It is BS. If you look at the CDC website it says that there have been 1637 deaths from 92million does. That’s a death rate of 0.0018% and it doesn’t even factor in that people who might have died anyways from Covid we’re probably given the vaccine. Data is useless without context.</p>

        <p>5% is in reference to the percentage of deaths conpared to the total nunber of adverse events reported so its the 1600 deaths divided by the 32000  events reported. The number is skewed heavily because most people dont report the mild events like fever or sore arm and most people dont even report to them at all, hence why its only 32,000 reports out of the millions that got the shots.</p>

        <p>Which is still not significant and a useless data point. The post was made in bad faith trying to distort one data point that makes it seem like the vaccine has a higher death rate than Covid. Even with what you said below it’s like 5% of .034% of people who got vaccinated. Like I said before data is useless without context.</p>

        <p>Most posts here are disingenuous and deliberately leave out context to scare people. The sad part is half the posts are about how the government is trying to control people when in reality people are letting the fear mongering of the government control them more. It’s the governments job to protect people from each other. While everyone may not agree fully on how that should be implemented it is the job of the government. People on this sub also haven’t even done the most basic cost benefit analysis. Even if the government is trying to control people with masks it still isn’t a big deal since the cost to wear one is almost zero while if they are wrong the costs could be as high as a loved ones life.</p>

        <p>I think people here do cost benefit analysis but they place more value on the detriments to children and education. There are 2 and 3 year olds that havent seen a strangers face besides on t.v. The power of a smile on mental health is very strong, theyve done straight face studies with babies and they respond negatively to a lack of emotion in the face. There are kids in school with parents who either dont care or cant help them with school, these kids arent just stalled, they are regressing in learning. A whole generation behind in learning and social skills. In certain states the unemployment rate doubled from 5%-10%, millions out of work. There are studies that say one month of unemployment changes not only your attitude but your brain. Too lazy to search for the actual study but heres a blurb https://brainworldmagazine.com/getting-by-how-unemployment-changes-your-life-and-your-brain/#:~:text=Getting%20By%3A%20How%20Unemployment%20Changes%20Your%20Life%20%E2%80%94%20And%20Your%20Brain,-March%2016%2C%202020&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20research%2C%20long,them%20to%20find%20work%20again.</p>
<p>I was for the two week lockdown, i dont think they make much sense for long periods. Masks im indifferent to, n95s and greater work fine but the rest basically do nothing. Vaccines, me personally, there is not enough long term data on the safety and destination of the nanolipids used to encaspulate the mrna for me to feel comfortable choosing to be injected with an expirimental vaccine, and considering the recent cancellations of use of the astrazeneca shot, other places are starting to take the unknown risks more seriously.</p>

        <p>Yeah I disagree. What you said about mental health is true. A friendly face can go a long way. That has nothing to do with the lockdowns. Out of curiosity why do you think we locked down the country? The overall reason was to save lives and if they had not done it our healthcare system would have been over run with sick people with no where to turn too. All of the ICU beds would have been full and hospitals would have been turning people away. This happened in a few states. My friend in California was turned away due to this reason and he had to care for his parents by himself at home which puts them at a much higher risk of death. So while the lockdowns sucked and still do suck opening everything early and blaming people in power for a no win situation isn’t good reasoning. It has also been proven that lockdowns can work see New Zealand for example. </p>
<p>Also, the chances that something bad will happen to you are slim to none and you are probably more likely to be injured for driving your car than getting vaccinated. This sub seems to be anti-mask as well which is extremely silly because the cost benefit analysis of “OMG government control” vs killing people by unknowingly spreading a deadly virus is absurd. Just wear the mask it’s not a big deal and has the potential to save others.</p>

        <p>The thing is COVID is never going away, just like the other coronaviruses. New Zealand might be able to pull it off with a vaccine passport and testing all incoming passangers, but how long will they have to keep that up? Do you think a business man wants to get jabbed in the nose or swabbed in the ass like china is doing? They shut off their whole country to the world for a year, which was a much easier feat than most countries because they could control their borders. Part of the USAs problem is that by the time we found out and shut our borders covid had already spread into new york and washington state to the point it made it into care homes. Thats a pretty small subset of the population so the fact that it reached into these generally isolated places means it was out pretty broadly in the population. From there it spread to cities all over the country each with their own infevtion curve. They overlap, they spread and the fact that interstate travel is protected in the constitution containment became insanely difficult. I was for lockdowns to bide time, but the fact that more nurses have been laid off or furloughed than were hired during the pandemic leads me to believe they wasted that time. It just kicks the can down the road.</p>

        <p>You’re right it’s not going away just like the flu. The flu kills thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people in the US every year. We have a nation wide flu vaccine that is distributed every year and we will most likely have the same thing with Covid. The difference is that we were and still are under prepared for the amount of people who are and can be infected. The vaccine will allow the people who are most at risk of the virus from getting it and help prevent long lasting Symptoms of the people who do get it. Lockdown will end eventually but the people who fought so hard against it are morons especially the anti-makers because they are putting others at risk. </p>
<p>I’m not going to respond to your China or other comments because you are speculating which isn’t helpful in making a point.</p>

        <p>What do you think the deaths would be if hospitals got paid 15K to report deaths as being ‘suspected vaccine reactions’? </p>
<p>Data is useless without context - kind of like that fact that the median age of death for Covid is above life expectancy and individuals who have multiple co-morbidity. That or the fact that flu deaths have magically disappeared this year for the first time since we’ve started measuring it....</p>

        <p>This is a leading question that doesn’t have an answer. It also doesn’t add anything to the argument so I’m not going to address it.</p>
<p>Why does it matter if the median age of death? Do people deserve to die because they are older? Also, Covid has been proven to cause longer term health to individuals who do recover. Even in younger people. </p>
<p>Lastly, Flu deaths are most likely down due to more people wearing masks, people not going into work sick because they have too aka lockdown measures. If people don’t go out and infect other people then there will be significantly less deaths. Most people who die from the flu are older and have health issues so I guess you believe those people should die too. Maybe we should all wear masks more often especially when we’re sick. Oh and maybe employers will let their employees actually use their sick days so they don’t infect the whole office like they used to a year ago.</p>

        <p>The leading question was rhetorical, meant to help you think a little more critically about the current conditions. If hospitals were paid $15K to report a death as vaccine related, you'd says 'well that is a clear bias that will skew the numbers'. Likewise, if I said we were going to say that every single death that occurred within 30 days of taking a vaccine was a vaccine death, you'd say 'that's bullshit, you can't attribute completely unrelated deaths to the vaccine', yet that's exactly what they're doing with covid. The question is why do you only apply critical thinking in one direction?  </p>
<p>The median age of death matters because its provides context for how likely a person is to die of any cause. Old people are far more likely to die of heart disease, cancer, stroke, etc. It's funny how when old people die after getting a vaccine, it was 'they were old and had multiple risk factors' or 'they were likely going to die anyways'. But when those exact same old people die after testing positive for covid, it was they were ravaged by a ruthless and deadly virus. </p>
<p>"It has been proven to cause longer term health issues to individuals who do recover", this is straight out of the mainstream fear mongering narrative. If you actually dove into the occurrences of long term health issues, you'd find they are actually quite rare. </p>
<p>On the topic of flu, you cannot simultaneously hold the belief belief that mask wearing and lock-down measures have obliterated the flu and also believe that covid was spreading like wildfire and killed millions in the same conditions. Is it really that much of a stretch for you to consider that flu deaths and cases are being re-attributed to covid. Especially after it has come to light that the PCR test and the cycle counts they were using were brutally inaccurate.</p>

        <p>Your argument doesn’t make sense and you are assuming a lot of things that have not been proven. You tried to bait me into an answer and then completely mess up your own argument. Taking a bribe for unrelated deaths is not the same thing as attributing deaths from a vaccine 30 days after. You are also assuming the results of deaths are being misreported at an extremely level which doesn’t make sense considering covid is world wide. Like maybe maybe one state could pull that off but you are saying every hospital in every state is mislabeling deaths in the hundreds of thousands? You then say that maybe the Flu deaths are being misreported at Covid deaths. We currently have 535k deaths this year the annual flu deaths in 2018 well before covid-19 there were only 34,200 deaths. So only you know short by like 500k no big deal. Even if it was every death after getting covid that is still not enough to make up the difference. So yeah none of what you said true. This should also show you how much for infectious Covid-19 is to the Flu. Hence way more cases. </p>
<p>You are again making assumptions that I have not said.  No one would say “They were likely to going to die anyways” after taking a vaccine. That’s just stupid. What people have said is that some people might have already been in critical for bad condition and were given the vaccine to help improve their condition but ended up dying anyways. It has nothing to do with the age. If someone did get covid and died of covid yeah I would say they might have been ravaged by a virus. If they didn’t die of covid then yeah I wouldn’t say that I would say the died of the other thing. What you are assuming with this point again is that people are misreporting deaths so I’m just going to say see above to answer his one again. </p>
<p>Still didn’t answer if it ok to sacrifice old people for the economy? So why does age matter? </p>
<p>I can hold this belief if I agree on two points. A. Covid-19 is waaaay more infectious than the Flu. (Spoiler it is by a lot). B. Not everyone is following the guidelines which is causing way more cases. Places that have followed the mask guidelines has way less cases and deaths than ones that didn’t. 
You seem to jump to a lot of conclusions without any actual proof or numbers to back your claims.</p>

        <p>When I said they were likely going to die after the vaccine anyways - it referred to the age demographic, meaning there is a vastly greater probability that a person above the age of 80 is going to die within the next 30 days, than say a 40 year old. The point is if you test loads of people in this demographic (or vaccinate loads), if your metric is anyone who dies within 30 days you are going to get a lot of people who were going to die anyways lumped into those stats. </p>
<p>You are asking the wrong question when you ask if it is okay to sacrifice old people for the economy. Is it okay the sacrifice the future and well being of an entire generation to extend the lives of the older people by a few years? When you double national debt in a year, who do you think the burden of that debt is going to fall on? Is the suicide of a teenager brought on by the pandemic irrelevant to you? How about a years worth of missed cancer screenings? Or how about skyrocketing alcohol and drug usage? How about society wide stress and anxiety? How about the fact that an entire nation that already has the highest levels of obesity was banned from going to gyms to work out and stayed home eating unprecedented levels of junk food. Or the hundreds of millions around the world who will be thrown into extreme poverty and face starvation. </p>
<p>So yes age does matter. The preventable deaths of a 16 year old does hold more weight to me than an 85 year old. That 85 year old may have lost a couple months or even years - however that 16 year old lost an entire lifetime. A better metric would be life years lost. </p>
<p>I think the assertion that places that followed make guidelines had way less deaths is not true. The highest per capita death rates in the US are all states that followed masking guidelines. If masking is what you describe it to be - the top deaths per capita would be occurring in places that do not mandate it - but that is not the case. How is it possible that Florida who has not been in lockdown or had any enforceable mask mandates for 6-8 months has less Covid deaths per capita, than more than half the US states? If you listen to people like yourself - you’d swear there would be bodies piling up on the streets. </p>
<p>This entire thing shifted from doing what we could to prevent the hospitals from being overrun, to nobody can get Covid and we must stop the entire disease. Can you point to a single hospital in the US that was legitimately overrun? How about a single person who died of Covid because hospitals had to turn them away?</p>

        <p>You still haven’t proven any of your points. Just linking Data without context doesn’t help your case. You need to be able to provide conclusions as to why you are correct. The burden of proof is on your end. My guess is you don’t really know how to analyze data so you see big numbers and jump to conclusions. There is more nuance to how this virus spreads than just saying look at the deaths or cases and say see lockdown doesn’t work. </p>
<p>Here’s an example. Northern California has had a lot more people following the lockdown rules in California compared to Southern California. See how Northern California is doing substantially better than Southern California. https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/covid-surge-los-angeles-sf-bay-area-orange-county-15837483.php </p>
<p>This is proof that lockdown measures work in helping prevent the spread of the virus. There are other examples not just from the US. This isn’t a conspiracy to limit people’s freedom or kill the economy. Hell had people actually followed guidelines originally instead of being dumb fucks and saying they would wear a mask we probably could have contained it much better. Also, notice how Explained my thought process about the data I linked instead of saying look here and providing no context.</p>

        <p>Okay, lets look at Florida. Florida has been open since when? August? Where is the all out devastation that was supposed to happen if we didn't 'control' this virus? Where are the hospitals in Florida that are over capacity and turning patients away? Their deaths per million should be off the charts, especially considering that Florida has more people over 65 than any other state in the US, and proportionally, only Maine has a higher percentage of their population over 65 (https://www.prb.org/which-us-states-are-the-oldest/). </p>
<p>Florida ranks 27th in covid deaths per capita. You either have to look at this as a miracle or come to the conclusion that something here isn't adding up. Stop looking at models, and projections, stop reading mainstream headlines. Look at results. Look outside, would you honestly even know there was a pandemic going on if not for all the interventions and media coverage? We are living in a real world version of Plato's Allegory of the Cave (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RWOpQXTltA), if you are no familiar with the concept, I highly encourage you take a look.  </p>
<p>I don't think this is a simple conspiracy, I think there are people who have a lot to gain by keeping this pandemic going - the worlds billionaires have added 1.9 trillion dollars of wealth to their net worth over in 2020 (https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2020/12/16/the-worlds-billionaires-have-gotten-19-trillion-richer-in-2020/?sh=3825ac867386)...We throw out numbers like trillion, without a real appreciate for what it is.... If I gave you 1 million dollars per hour, every single hour, of every single day, it would take me over 200 years to pay you 2 trillion dollars.  </p>
<p>They did this while everyone is losing their shirts, while all these small businesses are being shutting down being told its the sacrifice that needs to be made to save lives... You need to be able to see a situation and say, something here isn't adding up. These billionaires, they own the media companies, they own the pharmaceutical companies, they own silicon valley, they own the lobbying companies, they own the politicians; they control the narrative. The same narrative you've bought into hook, line and sinker. So go ahead and call the people who don't buy into it dumb fucks and continue believing whatever they tell you to. .</p>

        <p>What you just wrote is a the textbook definition of a conspiracy. Shouting the billionaires are perpetuating a global pandemic is a conspiracy. Again this is global so you think the entire worlds government is trying to keep lockdowns going? Get out of here. I even addressed this in my second response to you and you just never addressed it.</p>

        <p>No, the textbook definition of a a conspiracy is a secret plan to do something harmful or unlawful. This is not a secret plan, they ARE encouraging the pandemic wide out it out in the open. I don't think its the billionaires by themselves, I think many governments and politicians are power hungry sociopaths, and the pandemic has given them an unprecedented opportunity to seize an unbelievable amount of power. I also think the pandemic has been quite adventitious to countries like china (do you honestly believe a virus from wuhan could shut down the entire western world, but the rest of china chugged right on along). </p>
<p>There are a lot of moving pieces, the one thing that is for sure unless you have your head buried 20 feet in the sand to think this is an honest pandemic and everyone is really doing this to protect you. Why is smoking an alcohol still legal, it kills more people every year than covid? Why hasn't public health cared about those preventable deaths? </p>
<p>Do you really think that unified messaging around the world to lockdown, wear masks, socially distance, 2 weeks to flatten the curve, build back better, just happens? It takes insane co-ordination and communication resources. Do you really think its normal for the 'science' on masks to change 360 in less than a month after decades of scientific consensus on mask wearing in public? Do you think that the millions of videos and tweets that have been pulled/deleted by social media giants for going against their narrative 'just happens'. Do you think governments around the world just happen to choose the same terminology and taglines at the same time. This is a massive global PR effort, and you have to ask yourself who has the connections and the resources to pull it off and after you ask that, you have to ask yourself why would they do it?</p>

        <p>Conspiracy Theory “A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups, often political in motivation, when other explanations are more probable.”  Thats you. There much more probable answers to all of your questions. You are choosing to ignore them because the billionaires.</p>

        <p>You did say textbook conspiracy not conspiracy theory.... anyways, I get your point. </p>
<p>Your assertion is that everything that has been done over the last year has been because our leaders are good people and genuinely care about our health so they were willing to do everything they possible could to save and protect us all from covid. And that we all need to do our part to save lives.  </p>
<p>From where I'm standing seems to be your stance, but you welcome to correct me if I'm wrong.  </p>
<p>So answer this one question, why haven't our leaders who care about our health shutdown and made tobacco illegal? </p>
<p>8 million deaths per year, 1.2m of which is second hand smoke. This is 4X more deaths than covid (<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco</a>). And its occurring every single year for decades! You are talking about 160M casualties over the last 20 years.... </p>
<p>If our leaders truly care about us, why have they let tobacco slide despite its negative impacts on society?</p>

        <p>No I saying they are idiots but we’re doing their best to protect people with what little information they had. Never attribute something to malice when it can be explained by stupidity. </p>
<p>I do agree billionaires influence this country/ countries a lot but they had no part in a global pandemic. while some are making money they would probably be making more without this pandemic. Hell you just mentioned a good example of how money can influence policy with tobacco. Companies will target specific issues that help them directly. They will not lobby the government to shut down the country that would be silly. </p>
<p>I don’t think most politicians have our best interest at heart. I think some try but if you really cared about how our government was run you wouldn’t support anyone that is willing to take PAC money. That should be your #1 issue not the Covid lockdown shit. At least if your goal is to stop the control by the billionaires. You should also support legislation overturning citizens united. Don’t waste your time on conspiracy theories.</p>

        <p>&rt;The data is from the CDC VAERS which stands for "Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System".  I assumed by now most people on this sub would know about VAERS and recognize the screenshot - sorry.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What is VAERS: "Every Friday, the CDC VAERS makes public all vaccine injury reports received by the system as of Friday of the previous week. Today’s data show that between Dec. 14, 2020, and March 5, a total of 31,079 total adverse events were reported to VAERS [re the Covid-19 Vaccine], including 1,524 deaths — an increase of 259 over the previous 7 days."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;this is a quote from: https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaers-reports-death-up/<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The 5% number is the 1500 deaths out of the total 31k adverse events.</p>
