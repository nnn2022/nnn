    <strong>Assistance for saving Grandma(s rights)</strong>
    <p><p>Hoping someone might give me some options to take back for my mum.</p>
<p>She works in a remote community in the northern Territory of Australia, as  a primary school teacher.</p>
<p>The push for getting the vaccine is strong. They had a doctor come to the staff meeting and accuse them of "not encouraging community to get vaccinated" </p>
<p>The doctor said all the teachers need to ambassador the vaccine. </p>
<p>They have been given a week before he returns and she feels like if she doesn't vaccinate she won't really be able to leave the community (cause of each states laborious lockdown laws) this troubles her as her family all live in Victoria. Technically she could leave but she would potentially be looking at locking down for two week in both directions at her own expense ( all her holidays) </p>
<p>I'm wondering how she could potentially approach her doctor for an exemption. She's in her 60's, smoked most of her life and takes a pill for cholesterol. ( All these are reasons to vaccinate apparently ) </p>
<p>My Mum taught me to question things and has been an activist I'm proud of my whole life, it's hard to see her looking defeated...</p>
<p>How else could she hand this? She's not against the vaccine but agrees that it's not completely above board and would rather wait til there is more long term data. </p>
<p>This community has helped me stay sane so thought it was worth picking your brains for strategies to give her. </p>
<p>TL:DR
When feeling force to take the vaccine in Australia what is the best strategy to tell them no, when you have to travel interstate a lot. Help my mum.</p></p>

        <p>No half way normal person ever wants to use there gun. But itâ€™s the only deterrent. Just imagine if US gave up the nukes. People want to rule people. Itâ€™s always been and always will be that way.</p>
