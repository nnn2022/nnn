    <strong>Anyone else worried about things being permanently Zoomed?</strong>
    <p><p>Here in Ontario, the Premier Doug Ford mused pre-lockdowns on having high school be partly online to save money. I fear that he would now make the partial online high school permanent in order to pay for the lockdowns and the next round of corporate tax cuts.</p>
<p>I also fear that Universities will becomed Zoomed as well creating a two tier system where in person tuition becomes more expensive and only for the rich while the masses get relegated to inferior online education.</p>
<p>Ford is a massive deficit hawk and would be full Tea Party if Ontarians would allow him, and so is our new finance minister Peter Bethlenfavy.</p>
<p>I also think big corps will use this as an excuse to permanently end all office Christmas parties, get togethers, in-person conferences etc. in order to ensure that their CEO can afford a 5th Ferrari.</p></p>

        <p>CEO's are going to realize that there are parts of the world that have caught up in education and if you're going to be doing all your work via Zoom it doesn't matter if that work is done 5 miles or 5000 miles away.  A lot of those white collar jobs are going to move to Asia or automated out of existence.  </p>
<p>White collar workers in the burbs that voted for Biden are going to watch what happened to Blue collar workers in the 90's happen to them in the 2020's.</p>

        <p>Yep. Outsourcing has hurt us all. The thing is blue collar outsourcing has already hurt white collar workers by lowering our wages due to blue collar people having to shift to white collar work.</p>

        <p>I find it funny that Chinese-owned Zoom decided to go public on the stock market in 2019.</p>
