    <strong>[META] This sub has been a sanctuary and I'm grateful for its content, but some of the Rachel Levine posts go too far.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm prepared for this to get downvoted heavily and for myself to be called several cruel names but here we go...</p>
<p>I don't like Rachel Levine either. She gives bad advice, her public statements are contradictory to science, and both she and the media are using her status as the first senate confirmed trans official  to elevate her publuc profile. But a lot of the content centered on her does not mock her because she is a bad public health official, but because she is trans; and that's wrong.</p>
<p>Think about how the people who hate this sub and try to ban it see us: as a bunch of far right conspiracy theorists who push bigotry beyond our views on the pandemic. That's not to say there aren't far right conspiracy theorists among us, but that's not what I am, and I'd like to think that's not most of us.</p>
<p>So when I see posts and comments calling Levine a man, referring to her by her dead name, and saying things like she "lies about covid as much as her gender," I can't help feeling a bit uncomfortable. I have multiple transgender friends, and I've seen them be on the receiving end of discrimination. Comments like those described above only serve to affirm the perceptions of the people who hate us, and they detract from our valid perspective on the pandemic and public health policies. After seeing a score of transphobic comments in one post, I began to wonder if there really were too many wingnuts in here, and maybe it's no longer for me.I hope I'm wrong, and the response to this post will reveal the answer.</p></p>

        <p>Believing in delusions just to make other people feel better is what lead us here in the first place. Up is not down, down is not left. I will not restrict my cognisance of the world to appease anyone. Richard Levine is a man.</p>
