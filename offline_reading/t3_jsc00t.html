        <p>They already created a situation where even a single case in the entire country is a moral government failure or the sin of the population. In other words, someone has to be punished for every single case, and the politicians coming into office won't accept the blame for themselves.</p>

        <p>Such a garbage assertion. You could "prevent the need for lockdown" by just...not having lockdowns. We can just choose to not do it. They're treating it like a foregone cause-and-effect when it's not. The fucking universe does not spawn lockdowns at X case numbers.</p>

        <p>Nice point. But I just think it's ridiculous that the CDC cannot make up its mind on whether or not the masks work. That's why I posted it here. I tried to post the link as a main post, but for some odd reason the site didn't let me.</p>

        <p>This is interesting because everywhere I go I say “forcing people to protect others, who they don’t want to protect, only foments resentment.” And “why would I want to protect anyone who would threaten me over what is or isn’t on my face?” Everyone agrees. Maybe the CDC caught wind of it lol.</p>

        <p>The study is deeply flawed for this reason alone: they didn’t take into account the difference a mask makes to the viral load, or viral dose. That’s the most important difference any face covering makes. It’s not about if they stop all virus particles entering your respiratory tract, it’s how much they allow through. The amount is correlated to how severe symptoms are, and if it’s low enough your white blood cells will fight the virus off without it leading to complications. I’m guessing this study is something to do with another shortage in masks.</p>

        <p>It’s misleading though. It might not reduce the chance of catching the virus by a large amount, but it could still be the difference between getting no symptoms whatsoever, or dying in a hospital bed. This type of report can and will cost lives.</p>

        <p>Have you seen the headlines today? Google the subject and have a look. So many uninformed people will assume a mask won’t save their lives if they see that on their news feed. Masks are probably the most important tool we have to keep our hospitals running and to prevent needless deaths. This type of study is reckless and the media is guilty too for how they are reporting the study.</p>

        <p>The study wasn't poorly done. It studied a very specific thing and found no statistical significance in the results. What enrages me is people being imprecise with their language and the actual documented data. What further enrages me is people making unreasonable universal mandates with no statistically significant rationale for said mandates all the while declaring empathically that the science is settled and supports their diktats.</p>

        <p>In what way wasn’t it poorly done? I guarantee it was deliberately done to cause confusion for a political reason. There’s no other reason for creating a study on an already well established subject and deliberately omitting and excluding the most important benefits of face masks and coverings. It’s like me making a study saying cars don’t work as transport because I decided not to put fuel in the cars in my study. It’s just ridiculous.</p>

        <p>&rt;In what way wasn’t it poorly done?</p>
<p>That's not how this works. If your claim is it was poorly done then you need to provide reasons for why you think it was poorly done. Your previous answer of "does not test the thing it doesn't claim to test" is insufficient.</p>
<p>&rt;There’s no other reason for creating a study on an already well established subject and deliberately omitting and excluding the most important benefits of face masks and coverings.</p>
<p>How is it a well-established subject? This is the only RCT that even attempts to answer the question of efficacy of mask wearing in preventing the spread of covid.</p>
<p>Hell, 6 months ago Fauci told everyone wearing a mask was unnecessary and provided no benefit. So in 6 months the contrary became so <em>well-established</em> it's now completely beyond reproach? Give me a break. <em>That's</em> what's ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I claimed it was poorly done because it didn’t include the main reason why masks actually DO work. That is how it works. You’ve got to tell me why you think it was fair. </p>
<p>Viral loads and viral dose has been researched for many decades along with how and why masks work, there’s thousands of studies on the subject. Just because this virus is a new one, doesn’t make it exempt from the science behind masks and viral load/dose/inoculum etc.</p>
<p>As for Fauci, he admitted on live T.V that he lied due to a world shortage of masks. If you want the link I’ll provide it. Everyone in the scientific community knew masks helped against Covid back in February. If you went back in my post history you’d see me making these same arguments and talking about the outrage in the community that was being ignored by the world media.</p>

        <p>The study wasn't meant to be the final word on the value of wearing masks for the entire population. It studied a very specific element, which is how much protection do they afford to the <em>wearers</em>. This was clearly explained in the paper. If you were scientifically literate understanding this wouldn't be a difficult concept for you.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what part you don’t understand here. You can’t publish a half arsed study talking about a specific element if you ignore the most important elements. A mask DOES offer a LOT of protection to the wearer, even a cheap nasty cloth mask with no rating. It’s because of the viral dose you’ll breathe in. Any mask will reduce the amount of virus you breathe in, giving your white blood cells a chance to possibly fight it off without even getting symptoms, or at least reduce the severity of the symptoms you get. Wearing a mask is beneficial in every way vs a virus. This paper is a sham and the people behind it need investigated. It was either done by incompetent scientists, or it was done to be maliciously misleading. Pick one?</p>

<p>Why don't you publish a paper with your findings here then? That would be big news! Make sure to include your p-values!</p>

<p>Why would the journal publish it if it was a "sham"? Do you understand how that process works?</p>

        <p>I’m working on a similar paper actually. There’s a lot of terrible papers being published since this pandemic started. If you were in the industry you’d know about them. Even the lancet had to retract papers recently that were shown to be bogus and deliberately misleading. To an outsider like yourself with limited knowledge on the subject you might not understand the potential implications of a paper like this, but just keep in mind that this will cost lives. People will read the headlines and they’ll add this to their already misguided biases and use this as an excuse not to wear a mask. You should be angry about this, you shouldn’t be complacent. Bringing up fascism means you’ve already lost the argument. If you want to have an opinion on a subject then I suggest you learn that subject before you sit on Reddit making lots of noise because you can’t bear to think that you might be wrong. If you want to keep pretending this study is ok, then you’re basically turning a blind eye to countless needless deaths.</p>

<p>Wonderful. Please do update me when it's accepted into a prominent journal.</p>

<p>You're the one talking about <em>investigating</em> scientists for conducting a published study with perfectly verifiable results. What would you call that sort of behavior?</p>

        <p>If you follow me I’m sure you’ll see it posted next year at some point. What’s wrong with investigating possible fraud? If they are just terrible scientists then no harm done. If they are being paid to deliberately lie and spread misinformation to cause confusion to the general public then the public has a right to know. An investigation is in the public interest when there’s lives at risk. I think all evidence of fraud or deliberate misinformation should be investigated or it’ll become the new normal. I fear we’ve already gone beyond that stage though. You just can’t believe anything you read now, you just need to arm yourself with the facts and learn how to deal with the data in a logical way.</p>
