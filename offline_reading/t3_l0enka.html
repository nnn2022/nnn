    <strong>Unpopular opinion here: I think the hysteria over the vaccine in this subreddit is a little ridiculous and unwarranted (please read the entire thing before attacking me)</strong>
    <p><p>From what I've seen, people here seem unjustifiably scared of the vaccine. It's really not any different from any other vaccine you've gotten before. I've had a ton of friends and even my parents already receive the vaccine and they've been all absolutely fine. The 'side effects' that people seem to be pointing to (fever, diarrhea, headaches, muscle soreness) are normal for a vaccine; that means it's working. Obviously, a few people are going to experience more severe reactions, but that's happened with many other vaccines. I know someone who got Guillain-Barre syndrome from a flu shot years ago; this shit happens. But the COVID vaccine isn't some toxic injection that's trying to kill you.</p>
<p>What we need to continue attacking in full force are the draconian measures enforced by governments that have ruined and are continuing to ruin lives. The economy is getting further destroyed, people can't earn a living, depression is at an all time high, suicides are rising, all while your favourite politicians continue to earn a paycheck and take nice expensive vacations (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55503789">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55503789</a>).</p>
<p>This shit is literally destroying lives.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.</p></p>

        <p>The issue is not only the side effects. 
It's also the fact that the vaccine isn't necessarily. Most people can deal with covid without it.
And also it doesn't prevent you from spreading it, so it just doesn't make sense.
I don't even take a paracetamol unless I really need it, let alone an injection of any kind.</p>

        <p>I get where you are coming from. This sub is pretty open gated when it comes to people who have different stances on what they disagree with. I personally am not anti vax, some in this sub are and that‚Äôs fine. I still do not trust a rushed vaccine and have decided to wait until I see the results of having millions of people vaccinated. </p>

        <p>This vaccine is not FDA approved; it only has an emergency authorization.   There is not yet enough data for it to be approved.  I am not anti-vaccine and am fully up to date on vaccines plus extras for travel.   I don‚Äôt think it is unreasonable to refuse these vaccines until more data is available.  Also, the health authorities give us little confidence.   They have been wrong and sometimes straight up dishonest.  Why should anyone trust them when they say it‚Äôs safe?  They don‚Äôt know that.  It wasn‚Äôt tested in pregnant or nursing women.  It wasn‚Äôt tested on the frail.  There is a lot that nobody knows yet.</p>

        <p>Totally appreciate your thoughts and position my friend. And yes fighting lockdown is essential.</p>
<p>What I'd offer, regarding the vaccine. Is that it is not any normal kind of vaccine, it is a totally new tech (mRNA) which has never completed trials on human hosts. It doesn't contain trace of the virus.... We simply won't know how safe it is for another 6-12 months at a push.</p>
<p>Now re. Lockdown, for myself - the trajectory through lockdowns, facemasks towards enforced vaccines and health passports is all part of the same plan.</p>
<p>To just worry about lockdowns, (which yes I think are the easiest fight to pick) while ignoring the connection to facemasks and the end game of vaccinations, passports etc.... I just think is missing the full context.</p>
<p>That being said, super grateful you are onboard! Unpopular opinions always welcome as far as I'm concerned! It's good to talk ü§úü§õ</p>

        <p>Nah, I hear ya. I am not always super gung-ho about vaccines. I vaxxed my kids on an alternative schedule, even before that was a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. </p>
<p>I also get that there may be some hesitation with this one. But from what I understand, it seems to be safer then say, the MMR, for the general population. Its new, yes. But, as far as ThE ScIeNcE goes, I am pretty comfortable with it. </p>
<p>As far as I am concerned though, it doesn‚Äôt even matter what I think, because:</p>
<p>A.) my family &amp; and I are all young-ish (Hubby is 42, I am 39, kids are 11 &amp; 14) and we are all generally healthy and fit (besides my nee found drinking problem. Thanks, lockdowns.) This means we are in the last phase to be vaccinated anyways. </p>
<p>B.) what does it even matter when we (apparently) don‚Äôt even have enough? </p>
<p>But, I do advocate for everyone who wants a vaccine to get one. In fact, my area has been begging for volunteers. I have a few different certifications that qualify me to be a volunteer in helping to vaccinate people. They are literally begging for volunteers in my area, and my surrounding cities. I e-mailed all of them for more info. Signed up. Even said I would be happy to drive a few hours to another city to help. </p>
<p>Crickets. </p>
<p>Apparently they are soooo desperado for help, and they plaster their pleas all over the local news, but they must be too busy marketing to actually check their e-mail. It kinda weirds me out actually.</p>

        <p>I don't think you're getting it right. There's very few real anti-vaxxers here as far as I can tell. Most people I see here have issues with the way it is being pushed on people and underlying dishonesty, rather than with the vaccine itself.</p>

<p>Scared? When someone who wants to inject unknown substances into your tissues you will call yourself "unjustifiably scared"? So what you do when a stranger tells you take a substance you have no clue what it is? </p>

<p>&rt;    Santa Clara County, California officials are now warning that a specific batch of doses shouldn‚Äôt be administered because of an increased risk of allergic reactions. Santa Clara County received about 21,800 doses of the Moderna Lot 41L20A distributed Jan. 5 and Jan. 12. More than 330,000 doses from the lot were distributed across the state. Now, health officials are pausing vaccines from the lot and warning that some individuals might experience an acute allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, after receiving their shot.</p>
