    <strong>What do you guys think about creating a subreddit for coronavirus-related mental health?</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously everyone knows that the lockdowns are putting a lot of mental stress on people. Unfortunately, the one thing that's been proven to curb mental illness, socialization and friendship, is being discouraged and even shamed on the usual mental health subs. Some people are even getting banned from mental health subs (the irony), for questioning and complaining about the lockdown. And unfortunately the lockdown sceptic subs aren't exactly focused on mental health issues. When I did talk about my mental health difficulties in a post someone told me to stop whining about my life.</p>
<p>So I could use such a sub myself. It would be specifically about mental health issues related to the lockdowns and will take a sceptic stance. This means that fearmongering about the coronavirus and shaming people for wanting to socialise will not be allowed. It may sound a bit exclusionary at first, but the sub will be aimed for the minority of people who question the narrative of lockdowns and masks and who are being shamed and censored on the regular mental health subreddits.</p>
<p>I'm hesitant about starting the sub myself for two reasons. I'm paranoid about getting tracked down and arrested, and I'm not sure if I can run an entire subreddit by myself. If someone would like to collaborate I'd welcome them.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think it's a good idea, as it will mostly attract people who are either a) hysterical about the virus which isn't good for anyone's mental health to be around, or b) will have a place to come to attack those who are struggling and call them selfish</p>

        <p>Wouldn't having a calm, factual approach help those who are hysterical about catching the virus? And as I said those who will start fear mongering and calling people selfish will get banned.</p>

        <p>It doesn't help. I've tried. It won't remain calm as they will attack in response. It will also be brigaded by those who hate anyone who struggles, and that will harm those in pain further.</p>
<p>It's really sad that such a place couldn't exist in this environment and actually be helpful to anyone. It would just be a magnet for all of that harm. Reddit isn't the place, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Right now those people only have doomerism to fall into headfirst. It would be good to have a community focused on de-escalating them instead of radicalizing them into corona zealots</p>

        <p>We cannot de-escalate them, and they cannot be rationalized with. Not on Reddit. Even in a professional environment (I'm a psychologist) it is damn near impossible to help them, to break the hysteria that is making them sick.</p>

        <p>Even if that's true, and I'm not sure it is, I think visible counternarratives are very important, and there are many people on the fence who need support "in these trying times" too.</p>

        <p>If we spread this community out too thin we won't have a critical mass to maintain decent discussions.  There are only 10K folks subscribed here.  We should focus on building up one place.</p>
