        <p>it's pretty chilling if you watch this bill gates clip back to back with the big plot reveal for the 2013 tv show Utopia. Janus is a vaccine they cooked up for a fake pandemic and made everyone take: https://streamable.com/dk1rg2</p>
<p>Recommended viewing </p>
<ul>
<li>Contagion (movie, 2011)</li>
<li>Utopia (tv show, 2013, season 1, summarized above)</li>
<li>Snowpiercer (movie, 2013, skip the action and focus on the conversation between the main characters at the end)</li>

        <p>The Gates (both bill and Melinda) claim that childhood vaccines save children's lives and therefore reduce overpopulation because women in 3rd world countries don't feel the need to keep having more children if theirs die from illness. What my question is..... if I am in a 3rd world country and my child dies from illness due to not being vaccinated by the benevolent gates foundation so I decide to have another child.....how does that lead to over population? Wouldn't those scenarios end up with equal population? One dying, one being born and all that? Or am I missing something...</p>

        <p>My guess is Gates would argue 3rd world families overshoot, so to speak, and end up having more children than they otherwise would have, because they overestimated child mortality? You're right, it is backward thinking. I'm not sure. He really just wants to "domesticate" them as if they were his cattle so he can better control and track them. I honestly don't think he really cares about the planet. He gets off on being in people's business, it gives him the feeling of more power. He's a sociopath. </p>
<p>Anyways, socioeconomic status is correlated with higher birth rate even in 1st world countries with lots of vaccines. Childhood vaccines isn't going to accomplish lower birthrates, you're right... It doesn't follow. So what's his real motive with the vaccines? The people are his experiments, his pin cushions... But for what ultimate purpose I'm not sure.</p>

        <p>Heâ€™s saying lowering the population growth rate or birth rate. Heâ€™s always been open about this. He believes 3rd world countries have too many kids, and vaccines will help lower child mortality rates so that parents donâ€™t feel the need to overproduce. Economic progress is obviously much better than child vaccines, but this is what he's talking about. Letâ€™s not misconstrue that heâ€™s saying using vaccines to kill people or make them infertile. Of course, vaccines have done some of that, and that may even be a part of his secret, diabolical plan, but this quote isnâ€™t the Freudian slip some people think it is.</p>
