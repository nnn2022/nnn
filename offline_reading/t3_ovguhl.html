        <p>I see a very disturbing trend with a very large number of people who think that anyone who doesn't take the vaccine (for any reason) should be denied medical care, denied their basic rights like to work or travel and should even be sent to camps.  It is deeply disturbing that people genuinely believe these things.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't have an issue with vaccines or if people choose to take them knowing all the information.  The key word being choose.  I am an ardent defender of personal rights and the freedom of the individual.  </p>
<p>All of the vaccines on the market currently available in North America, Europe and Australia all either directly contain in them, or where tested on aborted fetal tissue.  I am morally opposed to this and will not take any of them. I also have serious concerns with both the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.</p>
<p>I am not opposed to the newer vaccines coming out from novavax, which is not an mRNA vaccine and, from what I've read, is in no way related to or tested on aborted fetuses.  If it is proven to be safe in the future, I would consider taking it.</p>
<p>But because I have genuine moral and safety issues with these current vaccinations apparently I am less than a human, should be denied basic human rights and even left to die or put in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>This is seriously disturbing that people are this insane.</p>

        <p>"All of the vaccines on the market currently available in North America, Europe and Australia all either directly contain in them, or where tested on aborted fetal tissue. I am morally opposed to this and will not take any of them."</p>
<p>Can I ask you a few questions on your moral stance of the vaccines? Have you ever gotten a rabies shot for your dog or cat? Have you ever taken a Tylenol? Aspirin? Advil? Maybe some Pepto-Bismal? Even Benadryl or Tums? If you have participated in using these medications at all in your life or even recently, you are supporting the use of a product tested of fetal embryos. To be specific, all these products have been tested using Human Embryonic Kidney 293 or HEK 293. This is the same embryonic strain used in the mRNA vaccines life Pfizer and Moderna. </p>
<p>Are you a fan of Donald Trump? Have you ever worn his hat or sported a MAGA shirt? Donald Trump is a big pro-life advocate. Do you know the drug known as Regeneron Donald Trump took to help aid in his COVID-19 recovery, was tested on the same fetal tissue that Pfizer and Moderna used? Trump then cut funding for any medical treatments using the HEK 293 line because of the moral stance he has on pro-life issues. Why are HEK 293 treatments good enough for him and not good enough for the rest of us? </p>
<p>Let's go one step further. Has Trump ever encouraged the use of Plaquenil? Has anyone else here supported the use of Plaquenil as a treatment for COVID 19? Did you know that Plaquenil was also tested using the HEK 293 strain? Plaquenil is also known as the famous, yet controversial drug Hydroxychloroquine. HCQ is still branded today by many as the superior treatment method for treating COVID. Have you or anyone else had or expressed the same stance on HCQ as you do on the vaccine because it's been tested on the fetal embryo strain? If I remember correctly this sub HIGHLY supported its use. </p>
<p>Can I also ask, have you had this same moral stance or this desire for this same moral stance you do with the mRNA vaccines with any other common drug? Have you refused to get your pet updated rabie shots in the past? Have you refused to take a Tylenol or a bit of Pepto-Bismal because of your strong, moral stance against using HEK 293 strains? If not, why havent any of these products elecet the same strong reaction as the vaccines have for you? Will you stand strong on any of these other extremely common treatment plans like you do the vaccine? If this is the case you better not support treatments used in diabetic research or HIV cures because those two areas of science use a the same strain of fetal embryo tissue. These are massive areas of science you would have to openly stand against to be consistent. </p>
<p>We can make this moral stance as big or as small as you want. So many medical treatments and areas of science use fetal embryos to help advance treatments in science. Are you prepared to remove most common treatment plans, prescriptions, over the counter medicine, and medical treatment? It pays to be consistent. </p>
<p>In the past have you consistently been against Trumps promotion of HCQ? Did you slam Trump when he supported his own treatment of Regeneron because it uses HEK 293 in its development? Did you question whether Trumps need to cut funding for any treatments containing HEK 293 matched his previous actions? Is there some hypocrisy there? Are you ready to ban most over the counter medicines out of your life? I hope you dont have a pet because in most areas it's a legal requirement for them to get their rabies shot. Will you withhold this treatment from your pet as well? Will you also openly denounce areas of science that use HEK 293 in their testing such as the field of diabetic and HIV research? </p>
<p>Is it possible to be consistent with your moral stance against the use of fetal embryos? Because if you will be against the vaccine because of its use in fetal embryos testing, you better be prepared to openly be against most of science and advanced treatment and medication that most of use on the daily and dont even think about (because we havent been programmed to).</p>
