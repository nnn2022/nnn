    <strong>Freedom</strong>
    <p><p>This is how I see it. For those that want to wear a mask, great, go ahead and wear masks. But don’t make us others wear masks. For those of you that get mad at us for not wearing our mask because some of us say it’s taking away our freedom, the same can go the other way as well. There are systems in place, like online pickup/delivery, for you not to leave your car/house, but what’s the reason why you don’t self quarantine? Is it because you don’t want to be stuck at home? Is it because you want to still have your freedom to go outside and still do what you want? If you want the freedom to still go outside and do what you want and refuse to self quarantine, then you shouldn’t make us wear a mask just because you want the freedom to go outside. It’s the same concept that we want to have, the freedom to not wear masks. Just like the great Benjamin Franklin once said, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." This quote applies to this whole mask wearing business.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. Mask wearing should not be forced upon anybody. But on the same token, people who do shit like wear masks in their car alone or while hiking outside, etc. deserve to be mocked.</p>

        <p>You’ve got it all wrong, it’s about virtue signaling and control.  The pro-maskers are just waiting for someone like you to go out into public so they can harass you and make you look evil so they can post their heroic actions on social media.  They want to lord over you, they don’t care about your freedom or even their freedom because the current regime allows them the opportunity to flex power that they have nowhere else in their pathetic lives.</p>
