    <strong>Are You Really Waiting For The Government to One Day Tell You This COVID Thing is Over?</strong>
    <p><p>So you agreed to pretend the constitution doesn't exist for 2 weeks, which was your first mistake. </p>
<p>Then you let the 2 weeks linger and become 2 months. </p>
<p>Then you sheepishly listened to Fauci and other puppets, and now you're celebrating the anniversary of the original 2 weeks. </p>
<p>Now the <em>experts</em> are telling you that you'll be getting 2 vaccines every year for the never-ending "new and deadly variants" and you'll be wearing the muzzle until the end of 2022. And then as we get close to end of 2020 maybe wear that muzzle until 2024 and get 4 vaccines a year, and so on.</p>
<p>Are you really hoping that one day the <em>experts</em> will come on TV and announce that this <em>pandemic</em> is officially over?</p>
<p>Only YOU can end this hoax. How? Well, remember how you lived before this hoax started... Did you wear a muzzle everywhere you went? If so, continue to wear your muzzle. If not, DITCH THE MUZZLE NOW AND LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. you only have this one life. Do not waste another single day of it. </p>
<p>This charade will NOT end until you stop wearing the muzzle, the constant reminder that tells everyone that the common cold is the deadliest disease in history. </p>
<p>No excuses. You are letting this hoax be with us forever. If you act like sheep and just follow along there will be a day when it will be too late; When they write into law a crime punishable by jail not to wear a muzzle. When the vaccine passports become a legal required document. And many more...</p>
<p>STOP WEARING THE FUCKING MUZZLE NOW.</p></p>

        <p>No, for real, it's the one part I don't see mentioned in anti-lockdown/mask posts - people call it a scamdemic, saying people are being manipulated into these behaviours, but I never see an explanation as to who would be benefitting from all this.</p>

        <p>It rewrites human culture to fit in better with the computer</p>
<p>Everything is now done through a screen where your every move is monitored </p>
<p>If you look at the net worth of the big names at the top from the last few years you will see the insane amount of money that was made when everyone else was put on government aid </p>
<p>The goal of all the measures is not to go back to normal as soon as possible, its to stay locked down indefinitely</p>
<p>They want you to eat, sleep, work from home, consume their garbage, watch their TV, pay your taxes, and take their medicine</p>
<p>They don't want you to escape that box</p>
<p>Life is supposed to be so much more then that </p>
<p>They want to keep the people divided on as many nonsense issues as possible because they know that when that genuine face to face human interaction happens that pushes you out of that box</p>
<p>Totally recommend reading books like 1984, Farinhight  451, and Brave New World</p>
<p>Every authoritarian in history has used the same play book as what is going on now adays </p>
<p>"Emergency Powers" "Its for your own good" "Its only temporary" "Frontline Heros" ect.</p>

        <p>The big "They" is not very convincing.</p>
<p>I do fully believe there are constantly nefarious actors at play trying to gain power and control like this but, as an answer to "who could benefit from this?", the big mysterious "They" managing to enforce a needless lockdown on almost entire continents is not compelling. </p>
<p>Seeing that the rich get even richer from the pandemic is not a good enough reason to believe that they were in fact able to manufacture a (potentially fake) pandemic.</p>

        <p>The whole "they" thing doesn't necessarily refer to an individual, it refers to the whole system. Its much bigger then any individual. The same rich groups own the corporations that produce the news, produce the funding for scientists, and in turn big pharma. They legally bribe the politicians (google Citizens United) to bring favorable public policy to reality. Its not a conspiracy when like interests converge. </p>
<p>Kinda like the military industrial complex </p>
<p>Even the guy who developed the PCR tests has came out against public figures like Faucci. The matter is not that the disease is fake, its the response that is unwarranted, all for a virus with an insanely high survival rate </p>
<p>Remember when Iraq had weapons of mass destruction? Remember the whole thing with Dick Cheany making a fortune off of needless war? </p>
<p>Its the same song and dance that has been the alibi for tyrants all throughout history, "public safety" </p>
<p>It's never about safety, its about exploiting a perceived crisis for profit and control</p>

        <p>It’s about power; they want to eradicate small businesses and the middle class because they want only two classes: the elites and the Slaves.  Small businesses actually are a huge blockade to the elites’ power.  They openly hate gun-touting freedom loving Americans because they’re sovereign individuals who refuse to worship the elites.  For all of Human history, the elite/ruling class has hated any group that would limit its power.  They want simply
To be king/God Over everyone.  They can’t stand the idea that there is a huge percentage of people who are living freely and couldn’t care less about the elites.  They want to own them.  That’s my thoughts anyway.  It’s just a very fundamentally human psychological desire for power</p>

        <p>There are many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Money, big corps are shitti** cash right now so there is some pressure from there to keep lockdowns going. Small businesses are closing shops, big companies can either buy them or just make more profits from people having less options.</li>
<li>Money again, impartial opinions from "experts" being paid by pharmas profiting of the "pandemic". It's like the studies on sugar financed by Coca-Cola or the studies on tobacco nociveness financed by Marlboro.</li>
<li>Politicians are cowards, they all want power when everything is going well but nobody is willing to do the job when things go south. They are also scared of being accused of anything negative, it's easier to lockdown people until vaccine is out or their mandate is done so it's not their fault anymore.</li>
<li>Ego, politicians went so far down that road that it becomes really really hard to back track. Have you ever seen a politician admitting being wrong?</li>
<li>Assymetry of information, control of information. It's surprising how many people think TV is a trustworthy source of information and don't bother to see the other side of the coin. Critical thinking is dead...</li>
<li>People, there is no fighting whatsoever. I'm amazed at how easily people are manipulated and how hard the media is shilling.</li>
</ol>
<p>All those actions will have consequences, the economy is destroyed, wealth concentrated and the printing presses running 24/7 will bring massive inflation but hey, it's not going to be the problems of the one running the show anymore, so who cares?</p>
<p>That's why lockdown keep going, it's not politicians only (also they play a major role), it's a combination of aligned interests.</p>

        <p>I think at the most basic level, there's obviously some ideological force out there that is in the process of consolidating its power and taking over the world. Nobody wants to be on the bad side of this force, because this force is the one with the power. In fact, many want to be on the good side of this force, because this force is the one who has the ability to reward those who do its bidding. So the wave starts moving, and where it started, maybe nobody knows. But what a lot of these guys know is that, yes, this is the wave, and yes, we don't want to be under it. Rather, we want to take this opportunity to help consolidate this power, because that's where the wave is going, and we want to be on top of it.</p>

        <p>I heard from some government officials that they are planning lockdowns till at least 2023. At least that's what all the internal memos are preparing them for. Yet no one knows who exactly is in charge of creating those guidelines considering they are consistent across different countries and continents.</p>

        <p>But once you’re vaccinated you’ll feel OK to resume life as normal—no masks or social distancing? What blows my mind, personally, is that even after you get the vaccine, you’re told you still need to wear a mask and distance. So if you needed to do that for the next 10-20 years, would you? I’m interested to know when others expect to go back to their normal lives.</p>

        <p>a lot of people don’t think in a very critical or rational manner for various reasons. they either don’t see a slippery slope or don’t want to. what I can respect is someone who does think it through and then denies that it is a slippery slope. I’d like to talk that person with no emotional arguments involved because I don’t exactly see it and I want to hear him define when it reaosnably ends with no bullshittery so we can hold the <strong><em>*ing </em></strong>*stain governments to account on the terms of someone who agrees with them, apparently.</p>
