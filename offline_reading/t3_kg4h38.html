    <strong>Does the brainwashing seem cult like?</strong>
    <p><p>My husband’s sister and her family refuse to come for Christmas. We live in the same town. I got separate emails from each niece lecturing me about death. These girls are in college. They are healthy. The risk of them or even their parents dying is very low. </p>
<p>One email </p>
<p>&rt; Excuse me? I think not wanting my family to contract a life-threatening disease is pretty reasonable. If you don’t think that, maybe you should look up the words “family” and “coronavirus”. Clearly you need a refresher</p>
<p>I just finished the Scientology series on Netflix. The discussion about family member refusing to see the ones who left the cult made me think of now.  There are some parallels. For example, inability to think critically. It’s clear they are being kept in a state of fear. </p>
<p>I’m really not sure if they truly think they’re going to die from coming to my house. Could it be they will get virtual head pats from telling this story to their friends? Maybe both are true. </p>
<p>It feels like the cult is mainstream and I’m the sane person.</p></p>

<p>I don't know what will pull people out of this 'masks to continue even after the vaccine' mindset.</p>
<p>Tons of people on reddit want to keep wearing a mask indefinitely to cover up their acne and shit.</p>

        <p>I'm sure.  I had pretty bad acne as a kid long before masks though so I can understand the anxiety it causes.  But yeah, wrapping your face up isn't the solution.</p>

        <p>Let them do whatever they want and move on with your life. There is zero, ZERO point trying to have any rational or logical discussion with someone who has been indoctrinated by fear. They're operating off pure emotion, not an ounce of logic or common sense.</p>

        <p>It’s sad because I feel like this caused us to disconnect, like in a cult where you shun the person that the cult says is bad. </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I’m the one being unreasonable but they decided not to come over. Do they seriously go nowhere? My house is safer than the grocery store. Nobody in my home has a job. We don’t go anywhere hardly. I can’t wear a mask for health reasons and the general public is ignoring the exemptions that the government wrote. So I stay home. They don’t even know that because they don’t talk to me. (I have not tried conversations since July either).</p>

        <p>It is sad and you can be assured that this whole thing is wrecking relationships across the board. However with these kinds of people once they get their magical cure-all vaccine they will then more than likely return to normal. That will cure 99% of their fear and they will feel that they are back in control of their lives again and safe from the greatest illness known to mankind. After that point most people can resume normal interactions and relationships again I think. And given a long enough time line, even the insanity from this will pass. So its not like the rifts are irreparable. Best to do your own thing and let them do theirs.</p>

        <p>That would be enough for me to break contact.
My sister (3 yrs younger, I'm 33) has turned extreme left and it is taking a huge toll on me just being friendly towards her. </p>
<p>She has turned vegan and can't stop talking about it, the covid 'pandemic'is the worst thing that has happened to us and we should all mask up and keep our distance (unless she wants to hang out with her friends) black people are a minority that she as a skinny white girl has to speak up for.</p>
<p>It's taking all my energy to just talk to her on the phone or keep in contact with her. </p>
<p>I applaud you for still wanting to see your family. Let's hope that once they all had their vaccine your family will turn back to their regular selfs.</p>

        <p>My younger sister by about 6 years (I am 28) is also the same. She is a skinny white girl who constantly preaches about the ‘systemic racism of minorities’ and feels like a megaphone for their injustices. She told me point blank, with a serious face that white people can not experience racism.</p>
<p>I told her that I got called a ‘faggot cracker’ by a black woman and she said that was not homophobic or racist because I am a white male and basically needed to atone for being a part of the patriarchy. I was gobsmacked and stopped communicating with her after that.</p>
<p>Plus she is on the COVID hypetrain, with virtue signaling galore. I think the liberal bubble in her university (I attended the same university, I know what it was like and only anticipate it has gotten worse) has a lot to explain for this brainwashing. So sad really, we used to be thick as thieves :(</p>

        <p>Omg that's like a higher level of nutcase liberal. She is not quite there yet but I'm sure she'll get there. 
I stopped being liberal when the whole pc thing started. I'm glad I got out then cause right after the pc thing the whole racism and cultural appropriation stuff started happening. Goddamn what happened to normal human beings?</p>

        <p>Like your sister I went to a very liberal university. It's sad that there is such an immense pressure to conform to the popular group think, especially among girls. I can only confirm that as a girl if you don't follow the crowd it's super hard to make friends since girls usually make friends who are very similar to each other. And university it doesn't matter about your hobbies but instead your ideology.</p>
<p>I hope she grows out of it. But as a girl myself I can attest the pressure to act like that won't go away unless she finds her own identity away from the group.</p>

        <p>Damn that sucks. I have some family that live far away that say they won't come but they were super nice about it and I know they feel bad about it.</p>
<p>But yea, def, seems super cult like with the brainwashing going on but its a huge cult that's for sure. </p>
<p>I still believe the vast majority of people aren't like this tho. On reddit it seems way worse than the real world is.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  The most committed cultists are hardcore liberals who seemed to have moved to SF for that environment.</p>

        <p>Hmm let’s see, some characteristics of cults include: unquestioning commitment to a leader, <em>if</em> one does question they can be subjected to humiliation or rejection from the group, the use of mind-altering chants or mantras (“build back better”?), the leader of the group dictates how others in the group are supposed to think, feel and act, the group is elitist and feel like their way is the only <em>right</em> way of doing things, the leader is not accountable to authority, the groups teachings are based around having an appropriate and justifiable means to an end (they think what they are doing is for the greater good of themselves and others), group members are not encouraged to socialize with or communicate with members who are outside of the group, and complete subservience to the leader (which means cutting off ones “outside” connections to friends and family members). </p>
<p>To answer your question, yes. It 100% is a cult</p>

        <p>There's a reason I've been referring to them as the "Branch Covidians" (if you don't get the reference, don't worry; it just means you're under 40).  It's absolutely like a cult.  The sheer levels of incoherent panic I've seen...</p>
<p>Now, they say that as you age, you inevitably get more conservative, but I haven't changed a single political belief I had the first time I voted.  When Obama won the presidency, I sat and laughed with my sisters as the news showed us a series of (presumably) conservative whackjobs panicking as they feared the End Times were upon us.  You can imagine my surprise when, a mere eight years later, I sat and laughed at the (presumably) liberal whackjobs panicking as <em>they</em> feared the End Times were upon us, only to find my sisters among them (though thankfully not on the news, as far as I know); my attitude was much more wait-and-see-how-he-does (which has been an extremely isolating attitude in and of itself, but that's another story).</p>
<p>Then the Covid madness began, and they were freaking out with the best of them.  The last time we spoke together, I lost my patience and finally asked them, point blank: "Donald Trump is in the White House.  He didn't wander away from the tour and get lost; he's the duly elected President of the United States.  If that doesn't make you start questioning authority, <strong><em>what will</em></strong>?".  A reasonable person could certainly argue with that, but it'd at least serve as a verbal cuff upside the head that'd show a person that they were being inconsistent.  Not here.  I was met with angry recriminations and realized I'd lost them completely.  I'd challenged the orthodoxy and become just another heretic.</p>

        <p>Not sure what "wokeness" is (and given the madnesses that seem to be gripping both parties we have here, I'm not sure I want to know; hopefully your political parties are less insane than ours), but I can relate.  Although the Covid response has been more of a symptom than a cause, there's been a large (and increasing) amount of political homelessness here in the States over the last several years.</p>

        <p>YES </p>
<p>I was in a legit cult, Jehovah’s Witnesses for over 25 years. They practiced shunning, childhood indoctrination, double think, intimidation, unquestioning loyalty, gaslighting, etc.</p>
<p>This corona virus cult is very “triggering” to me, it’s eerily similar to the tactics used by the JW cult.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of 1984 by George Orwell.</p>
<p>it is %100 a cult.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing that. It’s super weird because there’s no real leader. It’s all misinformation.</p>
