        <p>If covid was so contagious that you couldn't go two months or a year without getting it, everyone on earth would already have had it and it would have burnt itself out.</p>
<p>It's weird how people who got through a year without catching covid can look at us now that a shot is offered and assume we will instantly and certainly catch covid and have to face our respective age bracket death rate.</p>
<p>A whole year suggests otherwise.</p>

        <p>For your information;</p>
<p>Black Death lasted 7 years,</p>
<p>Plague of Justinian lasted 8 years,</p>
<p>and Spanish Flu, which is more contagious than coronavirus, lasted 2 years.</p>

        <p>Your post is completely irrelevant, because I think that covid is just endemic now.  I guess there's a chance it might fade back like Spanish flu.</p>
<p>The point I am making is that one has to catch covid before they are any risk of dying from covid, but catching covid is not a certainty within any time period.  The vaccine reduces your risk of contracting covid a bit more than all the social distancing did. I guess we'll have to see how well it works when social distancing is not active.</p>
<p>However, even if I opt not to get the vaccine, at least for a few more months, there's a chance I will never get covid before herd immunity lowers the prevalence of covid to the point where it's a negligible risk.  Statistically speaking, the chances are good I could make it another year or two without catching covid.</p>
<p>Waiting a handful of months to make sure no weird effects of the vaccine pop up is not particularly dangerous.  This disease is astronomically less deadly than any of the things you mentioned, and also less contagious.</p>

        <p>Not really, for a disease to be in an endemic state, the infection rate should be around 1, like in flu. Coronavirus can't become an endemic, because without restrictions, every sick person would infect 2.5 people, and the disease would spread rapidly. </p>
<p>And if we take the fact that at least 2.5% of the world is confirmed to have carried the virus in the past, we can safely assume that coronavirus cannot be considered an endemic disease, and requires us to respond to it harsher than your seasonal flu.</p>
<p>And even though the disease might not be deadly for you, it can be extremely deadly for old people and people with medical conditions. It's extremely selfish to let someone die just because you couldn't be bothered to wear a mask or didn't want to take the vaccine. Let's keep in mind, 1 less infected person today will be thousands of less infected people next year. And even if you don't die, you will probably not have a great 2 weeks being infected by the virus.</p>
<p>And I really don't understand the "I will wait a few months to see if it is okay" attitude. The vaccine, even though it was rushed, was already tested for a year before being released to the public. Every short-term side effect would be known by now. And you definetly won't learn of the vaccine's long term side effects by waiting a few months. All you are doing is doing exactly what the experts did before releasing the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Endemic doesn't have a lot to do with the r0.  It's already endemic, but you can live in denial for awhile longer if you want.  Humanity has only succeeded in eliminating one virus.  We're going to fail with this one too.  Pfizer even wants us to fail, they have plans for yearly shots.  They would be quite disappointed if it just went away.</p>
<p>I live alone, so if I get covid I wouldn't spread it to anyone.  I would be fine having covid and coughing for a few weeks over taking a vaccine that causes nausea and vomiting.  I have no obligation to protect other people, though. I do wear a mask indoors, it is not required outdoors here.  </p>
<p>Several of my friends caught covid and recovered, so I guess if they are going to die of some terrible slow forming zombie plague, I will be lonely and have less reason to live anyhow, so Might as well become a zombie with them.</p>

        <p>Ok you want to define what an endemic is then? I pulled my definition from wikipedia which literally says an endemic is when R value times the proportion of people who are not immune to the disease (S) is equal to 1 (R x S) = 1. So I have no idea where you are coming from.</p>
<p>And you can't simply claim that pfizer wants us to fail without evidence. That's not how critical thinking works.</p>
<p>And no, covid is far worse than a mild headache and fever you would get from a vaccine. Young and healthy people can get severely infected as well, and living with a respirator for a few weeks is probably not that comparable to a mild nausea.</p>
<p>I'm going to pretend you never wrote the third paragraph, especially considering the fact that you claimed Pfizer is trying to get us purposefully infected so that they can sell viruses to people.</p>

        <p>The 'study' referenced by WebMD was an analytical model based on several assumptions.  It was not based on actual cases.  From the study:</p>
<p>"The proportion of individuals with infection who never have apparent symptoms is difficult to quantify because it requires intensive prospective clinical sampling and symptom screening from a representative sample of individuals with and without infection. "</p>
<p>It references other studies, which simply say that 'asymptomatic' people can test positive and not have symptoms, but since they are positive they must be spreading the 'virus'.  </p>
<p>There is no actual proof of asymptomatic people infecting others.</p>
