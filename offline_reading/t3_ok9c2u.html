    <strong>We live in one of the Most Extreme Societies in History - HARM</strong>
    <p><p>This New Normal is a result of Liberal/Left Wing Morality going off the rails to the Extreme.    </p>
<p><strong>TL:DR - We are an Extreme Society, most of what we call Western Culture and Civilization is in the same state.</strong>  All it will take is one big event to make the entire system collapse, and we are going through that event right now.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There are <strong>Five</strong> Pillars of Morality according to the Moral Foundations Theory:</p>
<p><strong>CARE</strong> as opposed to Harm - Protecting others</p>
<p><strong>Fairness</strong> as opposed to Cheating - Justice and shared rules</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty(In group)</strong> as opposed to Betrayal - Standing with your group, Family, Nation, </p>
<p><strong>Authority/Respect</strong> as opposed to Subversion - Tradition and Legitimate Authority</p>
<p><strong>Sanctity/Purity</strong> as opposed to Degradation - Abhorrence of disgusting things, foods, actions</p>
<p>The sometimes added is a Sixth:</p>
<p><strong>Liberty</strong> as opposed to Oppression </p>
<p>A Balance of all pillars makes for a fairly stable society.  When any <strong>ONE</strong> is taken to the extreme morality falls apart.  </p>
<p>On average people who are more <strong>Conservative</strong> have a better balance between all the pillars while those who identify as <strong>Liberals</strong> are most sensitive to Care and Fairness nearly ignoring the others.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>So how does this relate to our world today?  </p>
<p>We are an Extreme Harm Avoidance Society.  I am assuming I am preaching to the choir here as I am sure you all see what I am referring to.</p>
<p>Lockdowns/Restrictions - Can't risk making people sick, even if they consent to the risk.  </p>
<p>Vaccinations - Can't risk transmitting </p>
<p>Masks - despite all the evidence they are useless.  </p>
<p>But it goes deeper than just that.  We see it every aspect of society now.</p>
<p>Look around at things people are no longer allowed to do because it might not be safe.  <br>
So many things require Waivers to be signed because everyone is afraid of being sued.  We live in a bubble wrapped society.</p>
<p>Words are Violence!  In the UK one can be arrested for Mean Tweets.  But really only if certain groups are offended. Certain groups are allowed to be made fun off and mocked as it suits the current narrative.  </p>
<p>Radical Trans Activists pushing for Affirmation only for children who <em>Maybe</em> experiencing Gender Identity Disorder.. - It would be harmful to deny trans kids treatments that could help them.  Completely ignoring the harm that is caused to children when they by that same treatment.</p>
<p>Look at how Gender Identity Disorder in the DSM-IV was redefined to Gender Dysphoria in the DSM-V.  They completely removed the actual Diagnostic criteria, it is all now just personal feelings based.</p>
<p>We are not allowed to discuss why what before 2012 had no literature of ever showing up in females.  What typically only presented in Males and first showed signs between the ages of 2-4 and was persistent suddenly flips sexes and moves up a decade...and we are not allowed to question this as it might be harmful to some people to be forced to accept that their subjective feelings are nor reality.</p>
<p>We see it here on Reddit and all of Social Media.  You can not say something even if is true about certain groups for fear of causing harm or offense.  Like saying that all Transwomen are Men or just not playing along with the subjective pronouns.  Can't state True things if that truth might be offensive.  </p>
<p><a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-36/first-reading">In Canada the recent Bill C-36 is one such example</a>  </p>
<p>&rt;Bill C-36 would allow a person to appear before a provincial court, with the Attorney General’s consent, if the person fears that another will commit an offence “motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other similar factor.”</p>
<p>So anyone who <strong>FEARS</strong>  that another will commit an offense can take a person before the courts for possibly saying mean things.  Canada is going the way of the UK.  </p>
<p>I predict if this goes through it will bite the Progressive Left in the ASS, Rules for Radicals make them live up to their own rules.  By the wording the bill calling someone AntiVaxx could have one taken to court under this bill.  AS Vaccination Status is an "any other similar factor"</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>We see the Liberal Morality Pillars of Care and Fairness being taken to the extremes all over the place.  All while ignoring Loyalty, Purity, Authority, and even Liberty.  </p>
<p>Liberals have an Out Group preference, the prefer the other - which is counter to most of Human History and behavior.  </p>
<p>Purity/Sanctity -  The Modern Progressive Left are the ones who embrace PRIDE and everything about it.  PRIDE Parades at least here in Canada and elsewhere have been shifting to huge outdoor Fetish displays.  They are not Child Friendly.   </p>
<p>The UK just had a library with a man in a Rainbow Monkey costume who has his ass hanging out with a large dildo swinging between his legs to help promote reading to children.  And no one thought this was inappropriate during the planning or advertising process.   </p>
<p>Similar to the San Francisco Gay Men's Choir who put out the Song that <strong>They are coming for your children and they do have an agenda.</strong>  And again no one involved in any of that thought that telling people you are going to convert their children was not appropriate.  </p>
<p>IMO there is very little respect for the Sanctity and perseveration of Childhood Innocence.  </p>
<p>Authority/Respect - Unless you repeat their beliefs and talking points you can never gain their respect or have authority in their world.  This is the "Not My President" Crowd.  The same type of people who did all they could to try to remove a democratically elected president based off lies and bias fueled by hatred.  </p>
<p>Liberty - WEAR THE DAMN MASK!! TAKE THE VACCINE!!  Not allowed to make decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>Well unless you want to kill your baby, then it is Your Body Your Choice.  This is an example how they twist the fairness pillar to only apply when it suits them.</p>
<p>The British Empire of the 1800's is a good example of Fairness taken to Far.  If you were poor you deserved it because your own actions lead there.</p>
<p>Wahhabism (Exteme Islam) of groups like Al Qaeda are an example of extreme Purity.  No other form of faith is allowed...and they follow their version to the extreme.  </p>
<p>There are societies that reflect all the extremes and they all are/were very dysfunctional societies.  All it takes is 1 Major event to make the entire society crumble.</p></p>

        <p>This is a great post. I think a lot of people would benefit from learning about Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundation's Theory. It explains so much about the differences in moral systems that different people have.</p>
<p>I wrote a post a while back talking about some of the things I see going on based on his framework:</p>

<p>What do you mean despite all evidence? This sentence reads like: Despite all the water falling from the sky outside, there is no rain.</p>

<p>There is no evidence they work.</p>
<p>Every study people link to that claims they work....are all from Late Spring Early Summer last year.  When cases were going down in relation to the weather.</p>
<p>Everywhere there have been mask mandates they have proven not to make any difference in the rise of cases.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Can you point to any study that has not been proven wrong with the passage of time?  </p>
<p>All the data over the past 18 months have done nothing but confirm what we already knew for well over 100 years.</p>
