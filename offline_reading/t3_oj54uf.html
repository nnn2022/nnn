    <strong>We already are in the new normal. Or am I wrong?</strong>
    <p><p>Every thriving civilization in antiquity used to worship multiple gods.</p>
<p>But for some reason those civilizations were always attacked until their religion was replaced. (citing civilizations such as the aztecs,greece,germanic tribes,egypt etc.)</p>
<p>Now we call it mythology , who proved it to be myth? Or is that clever terminology for people to forget the past?</p>
<p>-Insert MARVEL movies-</p>
<p>Nothing to see here folks, nope Thor is just Chris Hemsworth in the movies, haha......&rt;.&rt;</p></p>

        <p>Pretty sure every civilization you mentioned was war focused and it was not really a one sided wipe out. Aggression and conflict lead to wars they lost or their own internal economy collapsed. Longevity and sustainability are the signs of a strong culture. History is written by the winners.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what you are talking about with movies &amp; mythology, but yes, we are in the 'new normal' &amp; it only gets worse. We have (again) saw TEOTWAWKI. </p>
<p>I really thought it would be more exciting... Boring dystopia. 1/10 would not recommend.</p>

        <p>I'm talking before there was the story of Jesus , everyone believed in multiple gods....</p>
<p>So 2 thousand years from now or so , everyone will be watching movies about super heroes named Jesus and his disciples....</p>
<p>Do you not see how the beliefs of people were wiped away and replaced with folklore? Who does that folklore benefit? 1 god? 1 king? 1 president?</p>
<p>It's called indoctrination.</p>

        <p>LMAO! Ok... Good luck finding history not written by man. (Ummm, your post is written by "man" too) Yes, BC &amp; AD are used commonly to track timeline by "man". </p>
<p>So, just as a lark, who do you think the Jews worshiped (man-made timeline) 1BC? Do you believe in the (written by man) "Holy Bible"? Who did Jesus worship?</p>

        <p>Well there is a lot to breakdown to fully answer your questions so I'll try my best with what I have and you can agree to disagree or you can further investigate and we go from there...</p>
<p>-Yes BC AD is used by man to track history hence me asking last ice age or beyond because we all know about Mesopotamia etc.</p>
<p>-Who did I think they worshipped? Well whoever it was I'm sure it was a singular god.</p>
<p>-Do I believe in the bible? Who did Jesus worship? I sure don't , sorry if that butters your biscuit. Pretty sure he worshipped a singular god as well.</p>
<p>I know this is probably a hit to your everyday life and this isn't meant to be personal.</p>
<p>I just know about the story of Alexander the Great (written by man?) yes but he also has many cities named after him etc... And it's funny to me because 300 years before Jesus , the people of the world called Alexander the son of god and he just so happened to be poisoned at 32 years of age in babylon (go ahead find the religions of babylon at the time).</p>
<p>So like I said , that history was wiped away and written off as folklore to usher in the NEW NORMAL. Hence skull n bones is 322 and the story behind that ..... It's all there you just have to open up and look for it.</p>
