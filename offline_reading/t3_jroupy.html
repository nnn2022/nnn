    <strong>Their Politeness Is Almost Worse</strong>
    <p><p>Some rabid maskers will scream and shout at you, but their feigned civility gets on my nerves more, making it almost worse.</p>
<p>In the summer, I was working a part-time job at a grocery store. The state, city, and my store did not mandate masks at the time. This old couple (one of the supposedly endangered groups!) walked in and a younger woman who was on her way out after buying a Starbucks coffee (yeah, it is a stereotype) turned around and said in a cheerful voice, "Oh guys, looks like you forgot your masks! :)" The couple just walked on in as though they hadn't heard her.</p>
<p>This morning, I was sitting in my college of business building doing homework. I'm up on the fourth floor and it's not even 8:00 am yet, so there's absolutely no one around. I take my mask off, since there's no point pretending to be afraid of a virus with no one to virtue-signal to. Then a few minutes later, this guy walks by, stops and turns around to me to stare at me incredulously. "Did you remember to bring your mask?" he asks in that sickly sweet feigned politeness.</p>
<p>I just want to be left alone to do my schoolwork or my job or just enjoy my day. Their tone is so condescending! Masks just make life so much more miserable and make work so much more inefficient. I'd almost rather have the rage than this fake-politeness.</p></p>

        <p>It's not "politeness", it's passive-aggressive bullshit. </p>
<p>That couple responded perfectly. Just ignore these people, or if they demand an answer, be short, blunt and don't engage them in conversation. "Did you forget your mask?" "No." and just keep on walking or doing whatever activity you were doing.</p>

        <p>The best thing you can do is walk, sit, or do whatever you were doing as if they didn't even talk. </p>
<p>No eye contact, no words, nothing. </p>
<p>I don't know how they react, because I don't give it a second thought, but they don't react to me.</p>

        <p>I know exactly what you're talking about! Right before the mask mandates swallowed everything there was a short time where at work we didn't need to wear one and I got just those kinds of comments. So I put it on but with my nose out so I didn't suffocate to death, but still got the sickly sweet comments that I just ignored. But every single week we would get complaints and one time there was someone or a small group of people that came in all at once and reported multiple people for being oxygen breathers and reported all of us, in the same time frame, and then they had to crack down on that too. No idea who they were but what that implies is going on is infuriating. Now I have no choice but to wear one of those cup one's and give it air flow so I don't die but of course they are hard find online these days cause a lot of people probably had the same idea. I can't even wear the blue one's that lay right on your mouth all day because I get mouth infections and it's even worse for my sinuses and throat which gets it bad enough anyways with what I need to wear now. The end of this mandate is supposedly in the beginning of February but I'm afraid it might get extended. The stress is unbearable, I don't know how much longer I can stand wearing the disgusting thing there for 6+ hours at a time.</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure not reacting is the best option in this scenario.</p>
<p>If someone is yelling and screaming at you, you should walk away to avoid a potential violent confrontation.</p>
<p>If they're coming at you with the passive aggressive bullshit though, they're not gonna get violent. Might as well take the opportunity to argue/educate them. You might be surprised how many of these people lack basic knowledge about covid. Just explaining that the fatality rate is so low can make some progress.</p>
