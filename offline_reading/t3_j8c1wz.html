    <strong>My mask was driving me crazy today</strong>
    <p><p>I have to wear a mask all day at work, with an obvious exception for lunch. Even on the campus I have to wear it outside. There’s no stand I could take that wouldn’t result in my being fired, and with a hiring freeze across much of my industry, I would rather keep my job. </p>
<p>I wear a surgical mask because I’ve found they’re actually breathable and don’t suffocate me or turn my face into a Petri dish as much as some of the triple layered cloth masks.</p>
<p>Some days it’s fine, I get used to it like a hat. Today though I don’t know what was up. I could feel it scratching and rubbing all day. I was pretty busy and my face was just moist all day long from breathing slightly heavier running around all over my department. I found myself sneaking into a closet area to just take it off and have a moment of air on my skin. Got home and I have a nice big ugly zit on my chin that’s been festering in dampness. </p>
<p>I’m so fucking sick of masks. I don’t even bother wearing makeup anymore, something I used to enjoy. I’m so sick to death of this piece of shit on my face ruining my skin. </p>
<p>Anyone else have days where you just can’t stand it?</p></p>

        <p>self torture?</p>
<p>i can't think of any other way to describe it.</p>
<p>literally ordered to torture yourself, you get (under) paid for it, so there is that, i guess</p>
<p>what if you said, 'fuck this' and refused to wear them? would boss-man fire you all?</p>

        <p>i'd be down the road, my background and inclinations differs from yours significantly. </p>
<p>i would quit (or at least let them fire me from) any job that 'forced' me to wear a mask or get a vax, that's just me though, i am a ballsy guy that way.</p>
<p>the only way i would even consider it, is if i was being paid 6 or 7 figures, which i doubt is the case with you :(</p>
<p>that said, my 'working' days are behind me. F.I.R.E.</p>
<p>policies are just that, policies. if masks weren't in the employment deal i agreed to, and they later demand that i wear them, then they are in breach of contract. the contract IS the 'law' and you cannot agree in advance to comply with unknown future policies.</p>
<p>is there an employment agreement or contract?</p>

        <p>Yeah, one day I just got sick of it all and went to a fast food place without a face covering. I also made sure to smile at everyone who gave me a dirty look. I went back to wearing a face covering the next day, but somehow, that was satisfying (and my area has 0 cases, so I'm as positive as one can be that I'm not infected).</p>

<p>That's how they trap you. In my opinion covid has been a great catalyst to rethink what I value in life most and to see if the rat race is really worth it.</p>
<p>The longer you go without rebelling or speaking your mind the more it will destroy your soul and you will become a shell of a person. Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.</p>
<p>Ps: as an alternative I would suggest a homemade cheesecloth mask.</p>

        <p>I don't either, I have a decent job now with good pay but the more I make I realize it's not making me any happier. All I'm saying is there are always other jobs out there, if your current one is destroying your life it might not be worth sticking with. 
I'm not saying quit your job but what I am saying is self-respect is worth far more than a cushy salary, trust me on that.</p>

        <p>Oh it’s certainly not destroying my life I just had a day of annoyance with my mask. My job otherwise is highly enjoyable and I have a large degree of freedom and control over when and how I work, plus a great benefits package. Pay could always be better.</p>
<p>But I do agree that self respect and happiness is worth a lot more than money. Although right now even just $3k more in my pocket would solve a lot of problems and make me very happy.</p>

        <p>Yes!  I used to have the surgical ones for my job, and they scratched terribly.  Eventually I cut a short sleeve off a polo shirt made of stretchy soft material and used that.  There was only slight pressure on the cheekbones and it just drapes down (sort of like the gaithers).  So it's not under the chin, which means air can flow freely from outside, and also it doesn't itch.  So I would recommend it in cases where you believe there is no other choice. My life improved by a factor of 10 after that.  I apologize if it sounds like I'm defending the requirement.  I'm not, but thought I would mention it since it was the difference for me between feeling like I was going to tear my eyes out and actually being able to concentrate at work.</p>

        <p>I am on a flight right now and my gaiter is annoying. I usually use that at work too, but where I work we don’t have a lot of walk in customers, and my boss doesn’t really care if we don’t wear it if people aren’t around. I usually don’t wear one this long, and I can’t stand the smell of my own breath anymore.</p>

        <p>&rt; Anyone else have days where you just can’t stand it?</p>
<p>Yes.  We're in week 5 of a heat wave in CA.  Pair the heat with my claustrophobia and just going to the grocery store sees me fighting off panic attacks.</p>

        <p>So anyone working in healthcare does this for their entire career. Surgeons wear masks for operations that sometimes go in for 16 hours. I’d say you’re being a little dramatic maybe...</p>

        <p>Ok yikerinos, so here's the deal. This is the internet and you're anonymous and you don't have to pretend to love everything about lockdowns and masks. You're lying to yourself. It's ok to not love the situation we are in. It's sane and normal to not enjoy a wet cloth over your face. </p>
<p>OP wears it all day and follows the rules and it irks you that they wrote a paragraph on the internet to vent? Do you see how inappropriate it is to shame them?</p>

        <p>Did you know people who becomes doctors often have different personalities and tends to be less sensitive? Doctors consented to have a job involving blood, masks, organs, bodily fluids etc. They're people that are less sensitive and handle things good.</p>
<p>Not everyone are like doctors and therefor don't work as doctors. People in the general public may feel anxious, claustrophobic, have sensory issues etc. and that's okay.</p>

        <p>Yeah and sanitation workers spend 8 hours or more smelling garbage, does that mean they love the smell of garbage or that I have to love the smell of it too? I wear my mask all day long and am compliant, but no one can force me to love every minute of it, I still have a right to an opinion at least. </p>
<p>Also, surgeons wear masks so they’re not flinging spit and bacteria into people’s open bodies, while I have to wear one while I’m sitting alone at my computer desk. Bit of a different scenario and circumstances.</p>
