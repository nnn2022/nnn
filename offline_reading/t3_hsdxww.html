    <strong>Anyone know what the british goverment are threatening for not wearing a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>They're making them mandatory in a few days and my mother is going insane saying that she doesn't want a 'criminal conviction' and how she wants to wear a mask, i keep telling her its nothing to be scared of and that they won't bother chasing some stupid mask fine but she keeps talking as if police will tackle her down if she doesn't wear a mask, what's going on? this is the same woman who racked parking ticket after parking ticket and didn't care whatsoever about the fines.</p></p>

        <p>A £100 fine. That is it. It's totally un-enforcable just like various other offences like dog littering. Besides, the mandate only applies to shops and while they obviously have the right to refuse you entry, I'm hoping many won't enforce it.</p>

        <p>In the UK, people with medical conditions such as autism, asthma, anxiety etc. etc. are exempt from wearing a mask. No one, not even the police are allowed to ask your mother for proof of her medical exemption as that is against the law.</p>
<p>So no, no one will fine her or anyone else if she says she is exempt. That is if the police even tries to enforce this, which I doubt they will.</p>

        <p>America: “Even if you are deathly allergic to dogs, you MUST let service dogs into your business. “ </p>
<p>Also (Democrat) America: “Even if you have a medical condition that makes wearing a mask dangerous, you MUST risk your own health with a useless device to make sure others don’t feel scared.”</p>
<p>The government inconvenienced (forced) businesses to comply with so many ADA regulations over the years (ramps, elevators, handicap parking, motorised carts, wheelchair bathrooms, ect.) but as soon as the people with disabilities literally need help and protection the government just shoves them off a cliff. Shameful. The DOJ needs to get on this.</p>

        <p>They still have to accomodate you, but that can be done by gathering your requested items for you and bringing them outside.</p>
<p>It's like that for other ADA items too. I visit one mostly to go restaurant which is completely wheelchair inaccessible, and they comply by prominently displaying a sign for how those who can not physically get in the shop can get helped and get their orders taken to them outside. It's not even just a masks thing, alternative accomodations work for the whole ADA.</p>

        <p>Im assuming the restaurant you go to is in a pre ADA building that it would be impossible to add a wheelchair ramp to. I understand that. </p>
<p>What I am saying is that new buildings must be designed for ADA compliance. </p>
<p>Its not really fair for the wheelchair guy to have to eat outside/at home if he doesn’t want to though.</p>
