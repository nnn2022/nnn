    <strong>Their plan</strong>
    <p><p>The illuminati are building a new matrix, their old one filled with fear as the last attempt to keep humanity from a mass awakening is becoming weaker. They become empowered when people are afraid. It's warfare on a spiritual level.</p>
<p>When you take the vaccine, it will change your DNA and turn you into a obedient slave and then slowly the transformation to AI begins.</p>
<p>You become a product owned by the government and are no longer an individual. They want you to be dependant on their system. Stuck in welfare, you'll own nothing and be happy! Watching Netflix, dying away like a sack of shit without a immune system and living off universal basic income and garbage food, that is if you live through the preparations.</p>
<p>People want to go back to the old, 'the normal' and the jab will get them there. But think about it, the old matrix wasn't good either.</p>
<p>You feel out of place with others as you recognize you are different than most people. You can tend toward being a loner or rebel, unwilling to compromise just to fit in. Keep it up, keep fighting and know that you are not alone.</p></p>
