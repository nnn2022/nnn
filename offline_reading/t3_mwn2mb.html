        <p>He doesn’t actually do anything, people who don’t actually do anything will always try to do whatever will keep them in the spotlight and liked by as much people as possible. If you want to find people with real opinions and thoughts follow people who do things regardless of the media presence it brings and sadly these people usually have much less of a following because their thoughts aren’t marketable bullshit</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you. Used to watch them all the time and was my favorite channel for a long time. But then something happened, maybe 1-2 years ago and I couldn't watch anymore. Especially since they started bringing that girl Trisha on every episode. The whole thing with the podcast was great at start but now feels so pointless and uninteresting, and it seems like Ethan's opinions has changed for the worse. He used to be quite objective and detached but now seem very political and lefty. I don't know, maybe I just miss their old content.</p>

        <p>I had to stop listing to my favorite podcast (Doughboys) because they are still speaking and acting like it’s March 2020. It’s a podcast about restaurants and neither of the hosts has dined at a restaurant (outside or in) for over a year. I’m fine with them reviewing take out, but lately when they go to pick up their food and the restaurant is always inevitably crowded with people trying to live their goddamn life, they always comment on it as if everyone who would dare to eat (outside!) is a brain dead moron. At one point someone was talking about eating under a tent at a restaurant- not a four sided tent, just a top covering- and one of the hosts described it as “perilous.” They constantly ask guests about their eating habits during quarantine ands it’s like Jesus, I don’t know anyone who’s living like that anymore. I swear some people are just waiting for an “all clear” from the government that is never going to come.</p>
