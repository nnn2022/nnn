    <strong>Fat deaths should be reported separately from healthy BMI deaths</strong>
    <p><p>As an American, I believe you have a god-given right to be as fat as you please. I strongly believe that nobody should be able to tell you how big of a big gulp you can buy, and nobody can force you to get off your fat ass if you don't want to. However in order to hold this live-and-let-live philosophy, those who choose the fat life need to bear their own burden of resulting health and mobility issues. If your fatness is influencing the liklihood of your mortality - and thus statistics that result in policies that affect my life - I no longer can "let" you be fat without suffering myself.</p>
<p>And I really don't want to change my philosophy. </p>
<p>Side note: media has tried to hide this fact by racializing it: since African-Americans have significantly higher rates of obesity the media get to use their higher mortality rate as evidence of racism, and that's enough to keep people from talking about it.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not saying that a fat death doesn't count for anything, but I think if they were reported as separate statistics (particularly per-capita), people would naturally value them differently. And I think that the race statistics are being used to cover up the correlation with obesity just to prevent people from bringing it up.</p></p>

        <p>I get that you’re trying to discredit my argument but I don’t really see your point. My proposal would be very easy to do objectively as BMI is a simple (albeit imperfect heuristic), I’m not sure how you would hope to determine yours. </p>
<p>I also don’t see why someone couldn’t agree with both of us, so again I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make here.</p>
