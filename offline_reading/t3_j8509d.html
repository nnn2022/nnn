    <strong>Trader Joes - taking it to a new level......of insanity! [Would you like some hand sanitizer?]</strong>
    <p><p>So, I popped into a nearby Trader Joes (USA chain). Right at the entrance was a kind employee holding out a bottle of you know what and she asks me - Would you like some hand sanitizer?</p>
<p>My reply - "definitely not."</p>
<p>So...we've gone from just having the dispensers to actively accosting people at entrances.</p>
<p>Seattle-area.  </p>
<p>What's next - Putin-style disinfectant tunnels?</p>
<p>You hear about certain stories and you think, is that really true? And then you see it and experience it and you realize, holy shit -- a lot of it must be! I don't carry a phone, otherwise I would have videotaped her. Of course, not her fault, but someone in TJ mgmt - locally or regionally, or dear god, nationally. I'll try a different TJ to see. Maybe someone else can chime in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- I'm an unclean Neanderthal who just scratched my butt and then coughed into it.</p></p>

        <p>Back in March, I heard the TJ's in my neighborhood was making people stand outside to wait to get into the store like it was some kind of club. I decided I would not set foot in there as long as that goes on and 8 months later I haven't been back.</p>

        <p>I experienced that in April - in Redding area.  Have also seen it in another TJ nearby in Seattle-area. I saw the line and drove off.</p>

        <p>I love their products and made the mistake of listening to the TJ‚Äôs podcasts thinking it would be a discussion of new products and recipes and whatever.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs some of that but the rest is a TJ‚Äôs internal operations circlejerk complete with interviews from random store employees. I‚Äôve never listened to such nothing be discussed in such a self satisfied way.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm also in the Seattle area. They‚Äôve got that going on at small businesses too.... sadly I feel like they think they‚Äôre doing us a favor and doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù. I just politely decline every time. Some lady one time said ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù So I was like I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt trust strangers‚Äô sanitizer especially in a pandemic. The look on her face üòÇ because I‚Äôm just basically using their logic against them. I have actually been into a place where the person at the door literally almost forcibly squirted sanitizer into my hands. I was like what in the actual fuck?? Like it was a requirement to get in. That shit dries out your hands so bad too especially with their ‚Äúnew‚Äù recipe lmao I swear it‚Äôs just tequila in a bottle</p>

        <p>Denver here. They‚Äôre still doing all the same protocols as if it were March. At my local store we have to stand outside until we‚Äôre allowed in because they‚Äôre limiting the number of people in the store. You have to have a cart to enter (even if just getting one thing, baskets apparently spread covid but not carts), and they‚Äôre spraying down carts after one use with some superbug creating spray. No one is asking us if we want hand sanitizer but it‚Äôs out to use. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs TJ‚Äôs. They‚Äôve always been super woke and smug. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll keep up with this for months after every other store has stopped.</p>

        <p>no, I scratched my butt, then I coughed into my head. So fecal particles and my toxic poison breath on my hand - u know, it lives for 9 hours on skin. I was touching products left and right while reading the labels.</p>
<p>I swear...everyone in this area will be dead soon, it's all my fault.</p>

        <p>The one near me in LA still has a line outside to get in when it‚Äôs busy. I went in several months ago and got yelled at multiple times by the cashier for not standing <em>exactly</em> in the box in the floor. And they had this whole routine you had to follow precisely where you had to wait in the box which was 6 feet away from the cashier, then when he signaled you could walk up and set your basket on the shelf and then immediately had to retreat back to the box 6‚Äô away while he rang the items up and bagged them. Then he signaled that I could come up to process the payment. Never mind the fact that there was also plexiglas completely surrounding him, so what was the difference if I stood there or stood on the box? It was the biggest, most ridiculous show of security theater I had seen yet and I haven‚Äôt been back since so I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre still doing all of that.</p>
