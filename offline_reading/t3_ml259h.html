    <strong>Important message from this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>You all are spreading misinformation about Covid and I want no part of it. I hope all of you realize just how wrong you all are. There have been 2.3 million deaths because of this virus, and more are sure to come because you idiots won‚Äôt wear a damn mask. I hope all of you wake up and realize the truth. You all are living a lie perpetuated by your own selfishness, and people are dying because of it. You all will probably ban me from your echo chamber without a second thought, but I won‚Äôt stand for this. I hope everyone in here wakes up and does their duty to help others. Here is a link to covid resources that can help you if you are sick. Stay safe: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/treating-covid-19-at-home/art-20483273</p></p>

        <p>From link above:</p>
<p>Most people who become sick with COVID-19 will only experience mild illness and can recover at home. Symptoms might last a few days, and people who have the virus might feel better in about a week. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and includes rest, fluid intake and pain relievers.</p>
<p>Sound the alarms!!!</p>

        <p>Obesity alone kills 330k annual in just america, smoking another 200 some thousand, drinking close to 100k. We were told covid 19 would kill 2.2 million in just america even with social distancing, in just ten months. Its been over a year and its 2.3 million WORLDWIDE? I think we‚Äôre gonna be alright especially since most of the above 60 population is either vaccinated or has already recovered from the disease. You seem to forget that 2 million have died but nearly 130 million have recovered</p>

        <p>A real pandemic wouldn't require constant media in order for people to even realise anything is happening.  The people who are being labelled as covid deaths are dying from other causes and simply had a possitive test at some point in the month prior.  This was confirmed by the cdc's own data when they stated that only 6% of covid deaths did not have other comorbid causes and the average number of additional comorbidities was 2.6.  The global death rate changed by the exact same percentage in 2020 as it did in 2019 (0.44%) when there was no pandemic.  Furthermore, you can count on 1 hand the number of years in history where the death rate was lower than 2020 yet you act as if we are living through the Black Death.  You are an easily manipulated sheep.</p>
