    <strong>Last night a woman stood strong with me.</strong>
    <p><p>I had to wait in line outside to enter a building, as I walk up about 5 sheep are already in line with their masks on, all standing on the "6ft" circles on the ground. A lady comes up and is in line behind me and it was obvious she hated wearing her mask. I gave a small nod, and she looked surprised at first that I wasn't wearing a mask. I turn around a few seconds later and guess what? She had her mask off and left if off with me while we both stood getting judging looks. We were outside, fresh air, everyone 6ft if not more away.. but we're the conspiracy theorists.</p></p>

        <p>These aren't judgmental looks, they're fear response.</p>
<p>"OMG what are you doing youre gonna get us all in trouble" is the vibe i get, well, as much as i can tell from seeing eyes only.</p>

        <p>I agree some people do have that feeling, some I can just see the glare. If I walk past people or get close ill be respectful and pull my mask up. But if I'm no where near anyone there's absolutely no reason to have to wear it. Especially being outside with constant fresh air blowing.</p>

        <p>Fuck that, I never wear my mask if I'm lining up outside. They want me to mask in their facility/store fine I'll play along but no way in hell I'm putting it on when I'm outside in fresh air waiting to get in. You're not getting covid outside there's no evidence known as of yet of transmission outdoors. UV rays, cold air, wind all work against a virus out in the open air. Don't mask outside, enjoy your brief mask free time.</p>

        <p>I had my mask down. I have asthma and I get extremely overheated in the store (according to medical professionals ALL people with asthma can breathe with a mask 🙄). This guy comes over and tells me to put my mask up. I told him I have a medical condition. He says "where's your doctor's excuse?". I said "we can call them to verify". I wish I would have thought to pull out my inhaler. He threatens to make me leave. I said,  "it's not good for me. It's not good for anyone. If we accept this, what will we accept next?". He started walking away and talking some shit "you think I wanna wear it? We'll be shut down if we don't" and threatening to throw me out. I severely regretted even bothering trying to argue. It was extremely embarrassing. I'm sure I was called a Karen. And the lady at the checkout purposely tried to stall so she didn't have to wait on me. She started scrolling through her phone, rearranging her desk, looking for any excuse to take as long as possible to make me wait. I didn't really care. I wasn't in a hurry, but it was awkward. I cried all the way home and regretted it. It wasn't appreciated that I was trying to stand up (for everyone really). I was seen as an spoiled, entitled "Karen" bitch.</p>
<p>Note: The reason compliance is so high at this particular store is because it's a Goodwill outlet. Most of the people there rely on this place for income (including me). They are resellers (selling on ebay, poshmark, etc.) and they don't want the store to get shut down again so they are willing to jump through any hoops, no matter how strict. There are people there who don't follow any other of the store's rules, but religiously follow the mask rule. Some of these people are at the store from open till close, 7 days a week. So the shutdown was rough for them.</p>
<p>So maybe I should not have not chose this place to take my mask off, but it wasn't meant to be a political statement. When you are at a place for hours, it's harder to breathe &amp; control heat. I'm fine with stores that I'm only going to be 15 mins in. But because digging through bins is the name of the game, it takes awhile (2-3 hours minimum) and all the digging makes you hot.</p>
<p>I have tried lots of things to control heat and get more air: Masks with fans embedded, I have an ice vest that I wear, I wear minimal clothing, I have a cordless fan that hooks onto the shopping cart, and even the mask that was around my neck that day is made of sports mesh, so it's very thin. It still traps heat.</p>
<p>I've been avoiding going back. Yesterday I drove to a branch that was kind of far, just to avoid the workers at the one where I caused a scene.</p>
