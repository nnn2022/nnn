    <strong>Cancel Rent &amp; Defund The Police: Communism Is Remaking The World In The " New Normal "</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/opinion/sunday/defund-police-cancel-rent.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/opinion/sunday/defund-police-cancel-rent.html</a> </p>
<p>These movements are in conversation with one another, cross-endorsing demands as they expand their grass-roots bases. Cancel the rent campaigns have joined the call to defund the police. This month, racial, climate and economic justice organizations are hosting <a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/jXJg_qqNz06j42m0Q-0R9w2">a four-day crash course</a> on defunding the police. </p>
<p>Instead, the people making these demands want a new society. They want a break from prisons and the police, from carbon and rent. They want counselors in place of cops, housing for all and a jobs guarantee. While many may find this naïve, polls, participation in protests and growing membership in social movement organizations show these demands are drawing larger and larger parts of the public toward a fundamental critique of the status quo and a radical vision for the future. </p>
<p>Taking money away from the police is not the sole demand. Consider the push to cancel rent. It asks the state to abolish tenants’ obligations to pay their landlords each month. But rent is the product of a private contract about private property: the foundation of our social, economic and political order.</p>
<p>So when organizers make the demand to cancel rent, they are conjuring up a state whose primary allegiance is to people’s needs instead of profit. The demand raises the possibility of a world where housing is an entitlement rather than a commodity. It aims to shift power from landlords to tenants, in the service of visions of housing for all.</p>
<p>I told you guys, communism is the hidden agenda behind the lockdown hoax besides the obvious mandatory vaccines and cashless societies... Create enough economic crisis with the hoax and all of sudden advanced economies will be in need of a " change ".</p>
<p>Propaganda Times is a mouth piece of the American deep state, comrade klaus schwab must be proud.</p></p>

        <p>The push to cancel rent comes from the fact that the government forcibly shut down businesses and thus made it literally impossible to PAY rent. Any landlord with a lick of sense knows tenants need to get back on their feet now or entire developments will be empty, which benefits no one involved. </p>
<p>And considering that it’s huge corporations coming out ahead with those government loans (plus while conveniently being “essential” like Walmart), while small businesses (often “nonessential”) wither on the vine, it seems like we are heading the opposite way of communism into some hellscape where we are owned by a handful of large entities alike serfs.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how this is heading the opposite way of communism ? The opposite way of communism is free market, where supply and demand are the driving forces behind price determination, like modern society in every advanced economy. </p>

<p>Communism is a political and economic ideology that positions itself in opposition to liberal democracy and capitalism, advocating instead a classless system in which the means of production are owned communally and private property is nonexistent or severely curtailed. </p>

        <p>Thing is, I don’t know anyone actually asking for rent to be canceled. All the business owners I know are asking to either defer the payments or blend them into later payments. Forcing a non operating startup to pay 10-15k rent for 4 months is basically a one way ticket to bankruptcy which again, serves neither party.</p>

        <p>The cancel rent people are talking more about the places people live, in my experience.  None of them care about businesses at all.  They assume all business owners are Jeff Bezos types.  They actively seem to think it would be for the best if all restaurants and bars close forever. Once that happens, the owner and the employees can live in their rent cancelled apartment on the dole and watch Netflix until there is a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Exactly that... No where in the article she mentions small business rent relief, it's cancelling living rent.</p>
<p>Madness, then Universal Basic Income, free everything and let big daddy government own everything including the people it's suppose to look after, life will be filled with " utopia " as they like to say in socialists circles.</p>
<p>I'm Canadian, I'm all for free health care and private health care if one can afford it, like we have here. Subsidized childcare is also a wonderful thing Quebec has, and other provinces are hoping on. Our education is pretty cheap compared to elsewhere globally, the US should adapt the same, I'm not some extreme right wing cut the taxes to 0 type, I voted liberals last elections we had, but cancelling the rent is literally a start to communism, there's just no other way to try and spin it</p>

<p>Someone has to pay the doctors and nurses.</p>

        <p>You're right however it's not quite right to call him a dope for liking socialised healthcare. If you pay for healthcare through taxes that means the government is buying services on your behalf (and on behalf of all the other people in your country), which works out cheaper per-person because of economies of scale. It's not free but he's also not a dope!</p>

        <p>It's not "free" and anyone who uses the word "free" is either a dope or a propagandist (and therefore a dope).</p>
<p>The person didn't say anything about shared tax burden. That's something you inserted into the dope's response.</p>
<p>"Free" and "shared tax burden" are two different things. I take the dope at his word when he said "free". Or she, whatever.</p>
<p>People need to start thinking critically for themselves. Maybe if we called more of them dopes and idiots instead of coddling them and making excuses like you did here, they'd take a look at their own lives and try to impvoe.</p>

        <p>Would you be in favour of the movement if the call was to cancel rent and mortgages and business loans until the tenant goes back to work or the business starts operating again? Would it be acceptable if both were achieved instead of just cancelling private rent? It sounds like they're very similar ideas and the issue is that only private rent is being considered</p>

        <p>Global governments created a massive recession with the lockdown hoax that seems to target specifically small business owners, and put oligopolies ahead... In that scenario some kind of rent relief and other costs associated with the hoax should be covered, but as far as living rent, it's straight communism.</p>
<p>I'll never be for communism anywhere in the world, communism is the most evil and oppressive systems ever designed. It slowly erodes then implodes any society who adopts it... And somehow, a portion of mentally challenged in the US are hoping for communism to become the thing</p>

        <p>You are trying to assume that there some thought (Marxist or otherwise) going into all this.      To me, this seems like people following the loudest shouters.   That’s why it is this weird hybrid of Communism (cancel rent) and techno feudalism (run all small businesses out in favor of Amazon and their ilk).  People are just reacting to whatever they see  on social media.  If you ask any of them what is going to happen after we cancel rent, there are no answers.  Just like if you ask them what they think should happen when the virus resurges after each lockdown.   None of this is being thought through at all.  That’s why the politician’s actions are so schizophrenic. They are trying to follow the thoughtless population because they are all gutless.</p>

        <p>But there has to be if people wholeheartedly believe this kind of non sense... Communism always starts with social issues and later goes into economic issues.</p>
<p>Klaus Schwab the creator of davos and WEF, wrote this article in beginning June. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a> </p>
<p>He wants to remove free markets, go from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism, with is a fancy word for communism... The creator of davos and the WEF wants to enable global governments to own company shares and install new boards according to his vision... Governments can dictate central banks to conjure out of thin air, the fiat monetary system isn't going out of style anytime soon, we are never going back to money being backed by anything, de facto government can and will own anything the leadership wants. As soon as you run out of favour your jailed and wealth taking away immediately in classical communist style, every single time it ever went in power that's what happened.</p>
<p>Amazon and other oligopolies will be able to be owned and governed by government. Now in the US, cancel the rent is actually a thing, it's complete non sense to a level that's unimaginable. How to erode society 101 should of been the title of the her article.</p>

<p>Why did Communism Fail?</p>
<p>While  there has been extensive study of the reasons for communism's failure,  researchers have pinpointed a couple of common factors that contributed  to its demise.</p>
<p>The first is an  absence of incentives among citizens to produce for profit. The profit  incentive leads to competition and innovation in a society. But an ideal  citizen in a communist society was selflessly devoted to societal  causes and rarely stopped to think about his or her welfare. "At all  times and all questions a party member should give first consideration  to the interests of the Party as a whole and put them in the foremost  and place personal matters and interests second," <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/liu-shaoqi/1939/how-to-be/ch06.htm">wrote</a> Liu Shaoqi, the second chairman of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>The  second reason for communism's failure were the system's inherent  inefficiencies, such as centralized planning. This form of planning  requires aggregation and synthesis of enormous amounts of data at a  granular level. Because all projects were planned centrally, this form  of planning was also complex. In several instances, growth data was   fudged or error-prone in <a href="https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9386/f/publications/mateidaianhonorsthesis-2012.pdf">order to make</a> facts fit into planned statistics and create an illusion of progress.</p>
<p>The  concentration of power into the hands of select few also bred  inefficiency and, paradoxically enough, provided them with incentives to  game the system for their benefit and retain their hold on power.  Corruption and laziness became endemic features of this system and  surveillance, such as the one that characterized East German and Soviet   societies, was common. It also disincentivized industrious and hard  working people. The end result was that the economy suffered.</p>
<p>Point me to one case where free rent and communism worked in world history... Just one example</p>

        <p>I don’t understand - not all houses are equal so if nobody’s paying, how do we decide who lives where? Who gets the self-contained flat in the nice area of town and who gets the flat-share with the mould on the walls?</p>

        <p>That's the key question isn't it... In the past the person who got the nice flat was the person who was friendliest with "the party", and which is why those systems never lasted. They never truly replaced the unequal systems that they promised they would.</p>
<p>If you can solve this question - or make it so that each flat meets a minimum requirement (like no mold, and running hot water, etc) - then you would be one of the very first!</p>

        <p>Isn't the idea that those would all be but on hold? If the government can pause rent then they can pause mortgage repayments and property tax. You're right that only cancelling rent would mean that the financial hardship would just move from the tenant to the landlord and it wouldn't necessarily be better</p>

        <p>I think I understand your point. Would it be acceptable to put the rent/mortgage/property tax on hold until the government stay-at-home mandate is lifted? As in, not cancel<em>, but postpone</em>? The debt would start gathering interest again and the debtor would be required to make repayments after the stay-at-home mandate is lifted.</p>
