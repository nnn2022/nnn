    <strong>UK announces plan for mandatory vaccination to attend university lectures - How far will you go?</strong>
    <p><p>https://twitter.com/politicsforali/status/1419417441885696002?s=21</p>
<p>In the UK it has been announced that the government want all university students double dosed or they cannot attend lectures. I attend a top university in the world, for a top course in the world, and am halfway through this degree. Nothing, no matter how strong the coercion, will make me submit to this tyranny. I will quite happily be kicked out of university and be left to die on this hill - god knows at this rate I don’t even want the bloody thing. </p>
<p>It is not solely about this ‘vaccine’ - though I have my doubts - to live a world where we now must submit to mandatory medical procedures or suffer the loss of our god given liberties truly boggles the mind. It seems no matter how unkind history looks upon this, we cannot help ourselves but keep reliving the same mistakes. </p>
<p>If it all be for nothing, I shall at least let history show I did not stand for it. I hope you know you’re all not alone, and I cannot fault you for giving in, how far will you go for what you believe in?</p></p>

        <p>To anyone in america reading this with the same problem,</p>
<p>Most universities will still be offering a religious exception so that you will be able to continue going to university without getting the covid mrna therapy.</p>

        <p>I've just finished my degree and wanna go onto the masters.</p>
<p>If my university makes it mandatory, which I'm expecting them to, I'll either go for online university (even though it would be a quality level below what I'd get at my university), or forget the masters for now and find any kind of work I could do from home.</p>
<p>I'm lucky that I still live at home (not often I say that), so if I couldn't pay any rent i won't be kicked out. I'll also get a side hustle going for extra money.</p>
<p>Feel blessed to have just finished my degree, can't imagine wtf I'd do in your situation. I know I'm not getting it no matter what.</p>
<p>You could always try religious exemptions, or challenge them on the contradictory logic, maybe argue that providing a negative test once a week would make you the safest person around.</p>
<p>I'm assuming most universities will still provide some sort of online lectures for undergraduates, since it's possible for those with double dose mRNA jabs to still catch it and display symptoms, meaning they'd have to self-isolate. I know its not as good, and at top universities they're gonna be closely monitoring attendance, so it might not even be possible, but you could try do the course mostly online. When they check up, you explain the stress of the last 18 months has led to a big decline for your mental health, in particular real bad anxiety when leaving the house, making seminars daunting. Try bullshitting your way through the last half of the degree</p>
