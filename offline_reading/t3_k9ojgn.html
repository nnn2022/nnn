        <p>This is the weirdest part about a lot of countries now banning the use of face shields but still allowing makeshift cloth masks. Surely shields work better than masks in general because they also block your eyes? How are you going to demand mass masking because "eye droplets" but then ban the one thing that was covering your eyes, too? It's literally just to make people as uncomfortable and dehumanized as possible.</p>

        <p>How can they ban face shields while requiring masks?  U.S. is fucked up in a lot of ways, but at least I know it's not us.</p>
<p>Anyway in the beginning of all this, I actually thought you'd be <em>better</em> off if you got it through your eyes, or anything other than your respiratory system, first?</p>
<p>That way, your body has a few days head start on the antibodies by the time it gets to your respiratory system, where it seemed to cause the most harm?</p>

        <p>They don't want you to get it at all. The whole idea of the mass-masking was to protect others and not yourself, and when asked to explain how that works, they talk about droplets getting into people's eyeballs so everyone has to wear a mask. I've never seen anyone explain why they can't just wear goggles or face shields to prevent these eye droplets but that's par the course for the mask cult.</p>

<p>Btw I'm not talking about "official" people saying that, I'm talking about the "Donkeys" like you who come here and demand everyone to wear their masks, and when asked why you think masks protect others but not yourself (and they don't protect yourself), that's the bullshit answer I'm given. They clearly got this bullshit from these sorts of articles and Fair saying it must be how he caught it because he was wearing his mask and gloves, how else could he have gotten it!</p>

        <p>Sorry, what are you saying? Could you try re-phrasing your point? The first thing I seen when I clicked on one of your links:</p>
<p>&rt; Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite. These shifting guidelines may have sowed confusion among the public about the utility of masks.</p>
<p>&rt; But health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better.</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>Then the headline of the other article you link:</p>
<p>&rt; Can You Catch the Coronavirus Through Your Eyes?
&rt; Experts say it's not a big concern, but there are ways to lower your risk</p>
<p>You catch it much more readily through aerosols, that's proven fact. Fuuuuuuck me. </p>
<p>Please stop this childishness.</p>

        <p>The whole point of the mask is to prevent the droplets from being spread from when you speak and breathe. There is theorized protection from wearing it too but that’s getting away from it. The shields don’t stop any spread and they work best to prevent a cough or sneeze from getting your eyes. Masks are definitely safer but combining them is optimal as evidenced by the doctors and nurses who do use both precautions</p>

        <p>I did actually when this all started in the UK.</p>
<p>Rather than wasting money furloughing people, why not just buy everyone one of these suits?</p>
<p>I mean if the virus is so deadly and going to kill us all, then surely this is what we need moving forward? Cheaper than furlough.</p>

        <p>Virologists are also working extremely close to the virus trying to find ways to combat it so they need extra protection, you fucking idiot. We are supposed to be staying away from anything that can contain the virus. Also, why do you people complain about masks. They are not limiting you from doing anything, and don't give me that bullshit about not being able to breathe in them. I literally have asthma, and I've done physical activity while wearing a mask, and I was fine.</p>

        <p>don't worry, we can actually look at meta analysis studies on whether face- /surgical masks work at all against virus based infections:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>....</p>
<p>and.....</p>
<p>&rt;Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, <strong>we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</strong> (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25)</p>
<p>0 effect from masks.</p>
<p>that's what the research clearly says.</p>
<p>peer review meta analysis &rt; your blind believe.</p>
<p>naturally you would need to change your believe seeing this research, but i somehow doubt you will.</p>

        <p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt; In lower-income settings, it is more likely that reusable cloth masks will be used rather than disposable medical masks because of cost and availability (38). There are still few uncertainties in the practice of face mask use, such as who should wear the mask and how long it should be used for. In theory, transmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (12,34). Proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (39). Thus, education on the proper use and disposal of used face masks, including hand hygiene, is also needed.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&rt; We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility (Figure 2). However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>It is essential to note that the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols (3,46). Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and other surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and successful inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of another person. All of these components of the transmission route have not been studied extensively. The impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, on influenza transmission is also uncertain (47). These uncertainties over basic transmission modes and mechanisms hinder the optimization of control measures.</strong></p>
<p>You've gone too far down the road of playing devils advocate, it's time to actually read what you've linked now. Also please note this is from May.</p>

<p>This is all I needed. The rest of the stuff is fluff. I don't care whether we don't fully understand the method of transmission, the point is that it was tested and their studies show that it was ineffective as both source control and personal protection. Period. The rest is bullshit.</p>

<p>Like I said: I don't care that we don't know the route of transmission! The point of the study is that they could not show the effectiveness of masks. The rest of it is fluff!</p>
<p>If it is contact through surfaces then simply washing hands will do.</p>
<p>If it is fine-particle aeorsol, then there is nothing we can do. Just open a window and let there be ventilation.</p>

<p>Well that proves you understand what you're talking about horse, because conditions of transmission is very much a massive hole in their research as they allude to. What they're saying is a mask works in such a way in one environment, that's it. Note their comments on AEROSOLS and the fact this is from May.</p>

        <p>&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and <strong>2.0</strong> percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than <strong>200,000</strong> COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. </p>
<p>2.0 percentage points!!!??? Only averted an <em>estimated</em> <strong>200,000</strong> cases across <strong>15</strong> fucking states and D.C.??!! That's it? This is your strong evidence?</p>
<p>Not nearly good enough for me. All that effort for such minimal outcomes. You don't get to threaten me with fines and jail for such minute gains.</p>
<p>&rt;There has always been and will always be people like you: morons who think they know better than everyone else regardless of the actual evidence</p>
<p>Everywhere that has mandated any restrictions has fared the same, worse or just marginally better. Barring isolated islands. These measures don't work. I don't care about mechanistic studies of face mask effectiveness when the real world doesn't agree with it.</p>
<p>&rt;Here's a summary of the evidence which I doubt you'll read</p>
<p>You assume I haven't read any of the studies. I have, quite a lot of them. They're either mechanistic studies done in labs, or on fucking hamsters, observational studies that later get retracted, or misrepresent the numbers like the latest CDC one or fucking <strong>computer models.</strong></p>

<p>I guess every doctor to ever wear a mask ever even before the pandemic is just wasting his/her time too. It's all apart of the conspiracy. Also you realize influenza and coronavirus are two different viruses right? So studying the effects of masks on <strong>influenza</strong> is completely moot here.</p>
<p>You'll trust one source that fits your narrative but ignore all the other evidence saying the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Edit: What's even more fucking hilarious is <strong>YOUR OWN SOURCE</strong> is directing people to the CDC to learn about covid 19 calling it a "rapidly evolving situation" right at the top when you click on your link. You literally can't make this stuff up. Thanks for the laugh lol</p>

<p>do you not understand what pubmed is?</p>
<p>sadly there is this propaganda now on pubmed, but that is not the reference, that i linked to. i linked to a meta analysis, that is easiest to find and look at at pubmed.</p>
<p>what is pubmed?</p>
<p>&rt; PubMed® comprises more than 30 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. Citations may include links to full-text content from PubMed Central and publisher web sites. </p>
<p>it's a research library containing tons of studies from many different journals.</p>
<p>it also uses unique pmid numbers, so that studies or papers can get uniquely identified without having to quote the whole name of it.</p>
<p>so where does this meta analysis actually come from?</p>
<p>it got published in the emerging infectious diseases journal</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/about">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/about</a> </p>
<p>&rt; <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>, an open access, peer reviewed journal published monthly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </p>
<p>so this journal actually is from the CDC, for all those people, who still think, that the CDC has much credibility.</p>
<p>i could have linked you the journal link:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</a> </p>
<p>but linking to pubmed instead is a common practice among researchers.</p>
<p>researchers will throw up pubmed numbers in their presentations instead of writing out study names too.</p>
<p>it seems to me, that you are not aware what  pubmed is and how it works. i hope that you won't throw out such weird comments  and claims like:</p>
<p>&rt;YOUR OWN SOURCE<br>

<p>&rt;Conclusion: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing <strong>increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control.</strong> Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.</p>

        <p>you are linking some modeling nonsense now:</p>
<p>&rt; We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (<em>Rt</em> &lt;1) for each state and week. </p>
<p>it even says itself, that it can't show causality:</p>
<p>&rt; however, this ecological study cannot inform questions of causality.  </p>
<p>again: this is modeling garbage. it has NO control group, it is garbage.</p>
<p>hell i could also tear this one a new one by pointing to the fact, that there is no real covid-19 test and that the numbers of infections and deaths are made up nonsense.</p>
<p>example reference to that would be this external peer review, that tears the original paper claiming to have a test for "covid-19" a new one:</p>
<p><a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a> </p>
<p>but i don't need to do that anyways, because you just linked me modeling garbage.</p>
<p>i linked you a peer reviewed meta analysis based on RCTs (randomized controlled trials)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/">Figure 2</a>). </p>
<p>and you link me some modeling garbage, that itself says can't inform questions of causality.</p>
<p>worthless modeling garbage like the one, that you linked was also used in the first place to fake the pandemic.</p>
<p>neil ferguson from the imperial college used a worthless fake model, that deliberately threw out millions of deaths and was closed source. this model was used as excuse for criminal lockdowns and government measures:</p>

<p>i linked you proper studies with proper control groups and testing on real humans. these studies give proper results, that can be applied to the real world.</p>
<p>you are linking me modeling nonsense, that has nothing to do with the real world and should never be used to base any of your decisions on.</p>

<p>No? If you are impying they wear them to protect themselves from viruses than that's incorrect. They actually wear them during surgery to prevent the passage of germs from mouth (saliva) into the patient's wound and to protect the surgeon's face from sprays and splashes from the patient. </p>

<p>It vastly depends on context. This virus is spread through respiratory droplets. "Germs" as you say. It's literally common sense that masks would help lower the spread. Think back in 2019 pre pandemic. Would you let anyone who was sick sneeze on you? Breathe on you? I highly doubt you would be comfortable with that. Why do you think that is? Is it because bodily fluids fucking spread diseases?????</p>
<p>&rt;Anyone with two brain cells would know that that the fact that a virus such as covid having a higher rate of transmission is actually a great thing because 1. It shows how mild this virus is that the vast majority of people don't even really get sick from contracting it </p>
<p>Except that's an outright fabrication. <strong>Millions</strong> of people have contracted it in a matter of months. 280k have died in the United States alone in a matter of months. Many lose their taste sense, have long term damage done to their lungs, and are put on ventilators with it being up in the air as to whether or not you will survive. That is <strong>not</strong> fucking mild. You repeating that it's mild doesn't make it so. </p>
<p>&rt;It shows the IFR is extremely low</p>
<p>68 million cases in not even a year. In 2017 60k people died from the flu compared to <strong>280k</strong> right now from the virus. Not even comparable. </p>
<p>&rt;and along the lines of the annual flu. </p>
<p>You're literally just flat out wrong. Either you're willfully ignorant or you're lying because the data doesn't reflect anything you're saying.</p>

<p>I agree with that. I agree that if you are sick you wear a mask so you don't cough on people. But you should also probably just stay at home untill you get better, the same thing you would do if got a cold for example. </p>
<p>Though it doesn't make sense for healthy people to wear them. In most cases it can be even worse since a lot of people don't wash their masks or replace them regularly which makes the masks full of germs.</p>
<p>&rt;Millions of people have contracted it in a matter of months. 280k have died in the United States alone in a matter of months. </p>
<p>The WHO actually estimated that almost a billion people worldwide could have already contracted the virus. </p>
<p>Before March of 2020, it was generally understood that every year of a fraction of elderly people die from respiratory illnesses. That's just a fact. Go look up the CDC's stats from previous years on pneumonia deaths...a very common cause of death for the elderly. </p>
<p>The 85 year-old that can die of covid would have also died of the flu or pneumonia. Even in people who are over 90, the mortality rate of covid does not exceed the mortality rate of just being that age. Also, the average age of a "covid death" is the age of life expectancy in the West. 
People who are "vulnerable" to covid, are also vulnerable to other causes of natural death that no one ever claimed to want to protect them from. </p>
<p>&rt;That is not fucking mild. You repeating that it's mild doesn't make it so. </p>
<p>Covid doesn't "kill" people because it is especially harmful of a virus. Covid "kills" by being too much for someone with a very weak immune system to handle...just like any mild virus can and does do. This is why there are warnings about taking immuno suppressing drugs, for example. There are viruses and bacteria that exist in the bodies of every single human and ones we come into contact with every single day. They are completely harmless for the average immune system. But when someone has a severely suppressed immune system, such harmless pathogens can cause death.</p>
<p>&rt;Many lose their taste sense, have long term damage done to their lungs, and are put on ventilators with it being up in the air as to whether or not you will survive. </p>
<p>Every viral disease in the world, including the flu, common cold, and gastroenteritis, can result in "long term effects". Whether that be postviral lactase deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, scarring, or whatever.</p>
<p>None of those were dealbreakers then. We accept those complications as potential risks for every single viral infection (including other coronaviruses). Now those same complications are suddenly unnacceptable for COVID19?</p>

        <p>&rt;Many lose their taste sense</p>
<p>this is not a unique symptom at all:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/</a> </p>
<p>26% of all smell and taste loss in this study was from upper respiratory infections/colds.</p>
<p>loss of smell or taste is NOT a new unique symptom of a new unique respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>it is not new at all. it has been known for ages, but the mainstream media propaganda FALSE claims, that it is very unique and new and comes from "covid-19". this is false information.</p>
<p>i just shows you  a peer reviewed study to prove to you, that this is nothing new. i suggest, that you change your view based on the evidence.</p>
<p>&rt; have long term damage done to their lungs, and are put on ventilators with it being up in the air as to whether or not you will survive. </p>
<p>for this we will look at what actually happened in hospitals:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8262351/Nurse-New-York-claims-city-killing-COVID-19-patients-putting-ventilators.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8262351/Nurse-New-York-claims-city-killing-COVID-19-patients-putting-ventilators.html</a>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sara said COVID-19 patients are placed on ventilators rather than less invasive CPAP or BiPAP machines due to fears about the virus spreading</strong></li>
<li><strong>She explained: 'The ventilators have high pressure, which then causes barotrauma, it causes trauma to the lungs'</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z">https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/">https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/</a> </p>
<p>so you get into the hospital with some breathing issue, they do a worthless pcr covid-19 "test" on you. it says positive, which is completely meaningless, BUT now what happens is, that you WON'T get proper treatments of CPAP and BiPAP to help you breath as would have been done before the fakedemic was created.</p>
<p>no no.</p>
<p>now they wait to see you crash and then  put you on invasive ventilation and blow your lungs out and kill you.</p>
<p>this is what actually happened in hospitals.</p>
<p>the ventilators were and are killing people. the deadly guidelines to not use CPAP and BiPAP are killing people.</p>
<p>not any new virus.</p>

        <p>&rt;I guess every doctor to ever wear a mask ever even before the pandemic is just wasting his/her time too.</p>
<p>if you would have read my original reference, then you would know why doctors and nurses were wearing surgical masks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic#R36"><em>36</em></a>).  </p>
<p>so it was not at all about viruses. however the wearing of surgical masks during surgery is even highly up for debate these days.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11512642/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11512642/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; <strong>There is little evidence to suggest that the wearing of surgical face masks by staff in the operating theatre decreases postoperative wound infections.</strong> Published evidence indicates that postoperative wound infection rates are not significantly different in unmasked versus masked theatre staff. However, there is evidence indicating a significant reduction in postoperative wound infection rates when theatre staff are unmasked. Currently there is no evidence that removing masks presents any additional hazard to the patient</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; These studies provide sound scientifically-based evidence that, in the setting of a modern operating theatre with laminar flow/steriflow systems, surgical masks should no longer be considered mandatory for anaesthetists and non-scrub staff during most surgical procedures. The available evidence indicates that, for the wearer, surgical masks offer incomplete protection from airborne bacteria and viruses. Protection of the anaesthetist from infection by the patient may better be accomplished with the use of plastic face shields, which afford a higher level of protection from contamination.  </p>
<p>face shields against splashes of bodily fluids might be the far better options for some surgeries  and the use of surgical masks during operations also carries with it the issue if reduced blood oxygen saturation:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18500410/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18500410/</a> </p>
<p>which of course can negatively effect the surgeon, which can negatively effect the surgery result.</p>
<p>i could go on, but i guess 3 huge responses  going into detail with peer reviewed references on why your statement is wrong should be enough.</p>
<p>again i hope, that you actually read the references.</p>
<p>i provided you with proper peer reviewed research, that far far FAR over rules the opinions of some random people in interviews from your links, so please read what i wrote and reflect on the research.</p>

        <p>but let's go over your links:</p>
<p>first link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know</a> </p>
<p>is a random opinion piece, that i don't see any actual references in.</p>
<p>2nd link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html</a> </p>
<p>it has references, but let's go over some:</p>
<p><a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590238520303647">https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2590238520303647</a> </p>
<p>it does NOT test whether masks prevent virus based infections at all. it tests whether masks filter some things out.</p>
<p>this can NOT at all be compared to actual studies on humans, which is what i linked you.  this is a theoretical look on how things might work, i linked to a meta analysis of practical real world tests.</p>
<p>it DOES NOT compare at all. if you would understand studies somewhat you would understand this of course.</p>
<p>2nd reference of your 2nd link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ijisrt.com/assets/upload/files/IJISRT20MAY228.pdf">https://www.ijisrt.com/assets/upload/files/IJISRT20MAY228.pdf</a> </p>
<p>going over the references in this paper doesn't provide any proper evidence either.</p>
<p>their references are for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0239_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0239_article</a> </p>
<p>no mention of masks.</p>
<p>or this study:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31479137/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31479137/</a> </p>
<p>which shows, that n95 masks aren't better at preventing lab confirmed influenza than  surgical masks. this does not state whether neither are better than nothing though.</p>
<p>or this paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1422">https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1422</a> </p>
<p>named:  </p>
<p>&rt;Covid-19: What is the evidence for cloth masks?</p>
<p>must be great evidence for your claims in that one right?</p>
<p>&rt; One randomised controlled clinical trial of cloth masks, published in <em>BMJ Open</em> in 2015, compared their effectiveness with that of medical masks worn by hospital healthcare workers.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1422#ref-2"><strong>2</strong></a> The study, involving the industry partner 3M (which makes medical masks), reported that healthcare workers “should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. <strong>Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm.”</strong> </p>
<p>the result of this study was, that cloth masks had worse outcomes than the control groups.</p>
<p>meaning, that cloth masks result in a higher attack rate, than the control arm.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Conclusions</strong> This study is the first RCT <strong>of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.</strong> This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, <strong>cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs</strong>, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. </p>
<p>so here you have the references from your links saying, that people should not use cloth masks.....</p>
<p>of course this requires you to actually dive into the references brought up by your links, instead of taking CDC quotes at face value.</p>
<p>i could go on, but let's go to the other links:</p>
<p>3rd link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/masks/wearing-mask">https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/masks/wearing-mask</a> </p>
<p>has no references in it as far as i can see. the hyperlinks in it link to their own website, rather than peer reviewed studies.</p>
<p>so this is a worthless garbage referenceless opinion link.</p>
<p>then you got a CGI render of the new york times as the 4th link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html</a> </p>
<p>there are NO references, no research nothing, it is just a fancy CGI render, that is supposed to wow people into thinking, that masks have any effect through fancy animations.</p>
<p>this is not science, this is propaganda.</p>
<p>5th link:</p>
<p><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/stanford-scientists-contribute-to-who-mask-guidelines.html">https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/stanford-scientists-contribute-to-who-mask-guidelines.html</a> </p>
<p>this is a Q&amp;A with a random person.</p>
<p>i don't see any reference in it. it is just a random appeal to authority, trying to get people to think, that the person answering those question must know best.</p>
<p>it is also EXTREMELY misleading with stating this:</p>
<p>&rt; Stanford experts share <strong>the evidence</strong> that informed the World Health Organization’s recommendations. </p>
<p>there is 0 evidence shown here.</p>
<p>0 evidence!</p>
<p>evidence are peer reviewed studies. i linked you evidence, that masks don't work at all. this person in this Q&amp;A through out random opinions.</p>
<p>opinions =/= evidence.</p>
<p>so here you go. i broke down all your 5 links with great detail.</p>
<p>non of them even remotely compare to the peer reviewed  meta analysis i linked.</p>
<p>i really hope, that you go over my very detailed response, because i actually care for you and care for your health.</p>
