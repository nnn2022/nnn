    <strong>Two different realities.</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone else notice that people on this Sub appear to be much more intact and successful in life compared to your average Redditor? Like you can actually tell that people on this sub have a life and responsibilities, and also aspirations. Counter to the media narrative there are plenty of college-educated professionals on this sub, and hard-working students. This debunks the narrative that right-wingers are somehow "Dumb".  On the other hand, Liberal Redditors appear to be a bunch of losers who went college and have nothing to show for it, other than being a social recluse.</p>
<p>However, real-life is different. I am a teen in an affluent liberal family, and half of our family friends are liberal and half conservative. All highly educated, some with Ph.D.'s. </p>
<p>I guess what I am trying to ask is why are there two types of liberals, some wildly successful and educated, the types to live in NYC and read the NYTimes. And why are other liberals some loser guy or girl that went to college and makes 40k or some shit like that.</p>
<p>Also, why is it that the same can be said about Conservatives, it seems that half of the conservatives are plumbers from Arkansas, who to be fair still have their life well-together, and others are highly successful hard-working professionals who are extroverted and get the job done!</p>
<p>Reading this sub, I get hard-working professional successful conservative vibes, not some rural guy who didn't get an education and sits there complaining "DER Takin ar Jobs"</p>
<p>Not that not going to college is bad. I have nothing but respect for electricians, and I am considering becoming one.</p>
<p>Also, the final question, how do some of you successful blue-collar conservatives who make good money cope, with your opinion being dismissed because you didn't go to college?</p></p>

        <p>By the way, I have nothing but respect for our liberal family friends. Why do some people on this sub have anger towards anyone who complies even those who lean conservative? It's not their fault. By the way, I could certainly convince my dad who hates trump, to oppose the new normal. He is a democrat and a "real estate investor" and he wants the economy reopened immediately, as well as the schools. He likes masks though. He thinks they are an effective tool for reopening.</p>

        <p>One reason for that may be because most people for the lockdowns have no lives so it doesn't bother them anyway.</p>

        <p>Not conservative and not a liberal. Politics is bullshit and this left/right scheme is made to divide the population and kill each other, while the big ole club of fat billionaires are all having luxurious dinners in their yacht and being all besties to each other. Trump, hillary, Biden, Obama, putin, xi, bolsonaro, are probably best mates, and laughing at you while you fight for them.
We can govern ourselves, we don't need them. Let them scrub toilets.</p>
<p>And 2020 is the example. The conservatives have shown themselves to be all for freedom and rights while the liberals are all for internment camps. It's all a joke. A big one. Left/right is a little game created for the peasants.</p>

        <p>The category you are missing is young guys that haven't even had a shot at life. They're in high school or college. They wanted to be meeting girls and hanging out. Making the most of their youth - and they can't.  </p>
<p>Sadly, those posts seem to come from the most depressed people.</p>
