    <strong>Anti-Vaccine Misinformation vs Anti-Vaccine Good Information</strong>
    <p><p>We need to push back on this un-scientific idea that anything that is even remotely critical of vaccines, is automatically "misinformation" </p>
<p>The scientific method compels us to be critical of science, and yet, when it comes to vaccines, all criticism is off limits. </p>
<p>We are just supposed to accept whatever they call science, or else we are called "science deniers" if we don't.</p>
<p>The state of vaccine "science" is NOT in a good place right now. I suspect its never been in a good place. </p>
<p>Its become a dangerous death cult, even <a href="https://i.redd.it/0bjnz4nwnnz21.png">"Bigger Than Jesus"</a> complete with its own rituals, priests, brainwashing, infallible religious texts, and the excommunication of any apostates and infidels. </p>
<p><em>The difference between a cult, and a religion, is what happens to you when you try to leave</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Right now, any study that is published, that makes vaccines look good, is automatically considered to be gospel truth, that you aren't allowed to criticize at all, because dangerous misinformation kills grandma. </p>
<p>And any study that is published that makes vaccines look bad, it automatically considered to be fatally flawed, and any petty criticism is sufficient to "debunk" the study, because misinformation kills babies. </p>
<p>Thats if the "bad" study gets published at all... </p>
<p>Any study that makes vaccines look good, is a good study. </p>
<p>Any study that makes vaccines look bad, is a bad study.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these "studies" are utterly worthless anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fun Fact: nobody in the history of the world has ever been able to successfully use a "study" to discover any long-term vaccine problem. </p>
<p>source: <a href="https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/">myth #6</a> </p>
<p>To the vaccine cult victims, this is irrefutable proof that vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>To me, this is irrefutable proof that "studies" are not the right tool for the job. </p>
<hr>
<p>Vaccine studies are NOT done to see "IF" a vaccine is safe...</p>
<p>The sole purpose of a vaccine study, is so the pro-vaccine can claim that they, </p>
<p>"can't find any evidence that the vaccine is NOT safe".</p>
<p>"The evidence", of course, is whatever they decide to cherry-pick. </p>
<p>Then "not finding the evidence" deliberately gets conflated into "proves vaccines do NOT..."</p>
<p>Many pro-vaccine people are supposedly atheist, and every atheist knows "you can't prove a negative"</p>
<p>Atheists know this because thats their standard answer when you ask them to "prove God does NOT exist"</p>
<p>But when it comes to vaccines, all of the sudden these "atheists" magically acquire the ability to prove a negative? </p>
<hr>
<p>The result of vaccine study is already known, before the study even begins.</p>
<p>The data are fixed around the pre-determined conclusion. </p>
<p>They use another supposedly safe vaccine, as a supposedly inert placebo. </p>
<p>And invariably, the studies ALWAYS find that the vaccines are "safe and effective" (and necessary!) </p>
<p>The way studies are done is like this...</p>
<p>They start with the assumption that the vaccine is safe. They call this the null hypothesis. </p>
<p>Then they don't try very hard to disprove their null hypothesis. </p>
<p>They arbitrarily decide what "statistical significance" means. </p>
<p>Their answers are always given in a very binary (YES or NO) </p>
<p>Q: how often does this vaccine a cause fever?</p>
<p>A: NO! </p>
<p>So we have pro-vaccine people who are highly motivated to please their "sponsors", by getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wySaC_z12GY">the results their sponsors want</a>, </p>
<p>And to get the results that they themselves WANT, </p>
<p>And at the end of the day, even if <a href="https://i.redd.it/e8e8m1w24qy61.jpg">a vaccine kills someone within a few hours</a>, they will say its "safe" anyway, because death is just another anecdote.   </p>
<p>And this mentality applies to studies AND people. </p>
<p>If someone is pro-vaccine, then they are automatically considered to be a credible source of info.</p>
<p>If someone is <a href="https://respectfulinsolence.com/2015/08/05/the-cdc-whistleblower-william-thompson-appears-to-have-gone-full-antivaccine/">anti-vaccine, then they are automatically considered to be NOT a credible source of info</a>. </p>
<p>Ask a vaccine cult victim the following question, and see how they react. </p>
<p>&rt;Can you name a single pro-vaccine person who IS NOT credible?</p>
<p>&rt;Can you name a single anti-vaccine person who IS credible? </p>
<hr>
<p>So what has happened over time is that the phrase "anti-vaccine" has been permanently suffixed with the word "misinformation"</p>
<p>If you get a vaccine, and had any issues with it at all, and you try to describe your own personal experience with that vaccine, then your own personal experience is considered "misinformation"  </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because its "anecdotal"</p>
<p>So, by this logic, if you have a fever after a vaccine, that's just an anecdotal observation, and not a scientific study, and therefore, logically, your fever <em>didn't actually happen</em>. </p>
<p>So i have been observing these phenomenon in the wild for many years, and I think i may have come up with an interesting rebuttal.</p>
<p>Any time we see someone talking about "anti-vaccine misinformation", </p>
<p>We say to them, "Gee whiz, i sure would hate to be spreading anti-vaccine misinformation... And since you seem to be so much smarter than me... Would you mind helping me understand vaccines better, by pointing me in the direction of the anti-vaccine <em>good</em> information?" </p>
<p>And of course they won't be able to point you in the direction of the "anti-vaccine good information", which proves the point that vaccines aren't real science, because they don't follow the scientific method, and don't allow criticism.</p>
<p>Let's demand something like "bi-partisanship", where we have a panel of equally divided pro-vaccine people, and anti-vaccine people, and let them debate the issues, and let the public decide what to think.</p>
<p>Oh wait, they already tried that, and guess what happens every single time? </p>
<p>The pro-vaccine people will "back out" at the last minute, because they never had any intention of participating in an honest debate in the first place. </p>
<p>They have utter contempt for anyone who is critical of vaccines, and they claim they don't want to legitimize the idea that vaccine science is even debatable.  </p>
<p>The pro-vaxxers know they can't win a debate in an open forum, so they refuse to show up.</p>
<p>Thats why they are trying so hard to <a href="https://i.redd.it/o4u7dskfvhzy.jpg">shut down every vaccine debate, wherever it may occur</a>, using the dubious claim any vaccine debate only serves to contribute to the spreading "anti-vaccine misinformation" </p>
<p>They have done this enough times, that the anti-vaccine people are now reluctant to make arrangements to go to any debate, because they got burned on plane tickets too many times. </p>
<p>TLDR: when they claim "anti vaccine misinformation", you politely request the "anti-vaccine good information"</p></p>
