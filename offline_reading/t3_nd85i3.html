    <strong>Is this a bipartisan issue, or is it just more media sensationalism? I'd like to hear from our brothers and sisters on the left.</strong>
    <p><p>Is there a split among party lines in regards to the lockdown/mask mandate debate?  I want to hear from the Biden voters, and from the liberals and democrats (who I know aren't always Biden voters), that have had enough of the technocracy.  I don't believe in monoliths, and I want to hear the nuance.</p>
<p>It hurts me, to see the "I'm going to keep wearing my mask for fear of being labeled a Trump fan" crowd.  It does a disservice to those of us that aren't Trump fanboys, to those of us that lean left or center, to carry this brand just because we won't bend to the guidelines set by unelected administrators.  And I don't believe it!  I'm hoping that it's just amplified by media coverage - this notion that the nation is divided evenly by a Left(masked) v. Right(unmasked) paradigm.  And maybe it means that your voices need to be elevated, to dispel this illusion that the matter of lockdowns and mask mandates is bipartisan, and that it's only white, racist conservatives fighting government mandates by what they see as an illegitimate administration.</p>
<p>But the issue should transcend party allegiance.  Let's prove that our humanity bears more importance than our politics.  Any ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, lots of interesting takes here!  Thanks for the discussion.  I think there's some confusion as to my personal political leanings, which a quick browse of my post history may clear up (not that any of us need to prove anything to anybody else).  I think the main takeaway is that Reddit is cancer and the internet was a mistake, but thanks everybody for participating!</p></p>

        <p>I was never into politics, but I was into "live and let live". I did not like Trump's weird, over the top tweeting, but I didn't hate the guy. I didn't vote for Biden because he came right out and said he gave ZERO FUCKS about the rights of Americans. And his tweets are even worse. WAY worse. And what he is doing to this country is horrifying. </p>
<p>I suspect I will vote Republican from now on. I never want to see another lockdown, mask mandate, or threats of mandating vaccines, so whoever is staunchly against that will get my vote.</p>

        <p>Good comment.</p>
<p>Biden is a straight up war criminal.  There's no way anyone who is familiar with his terror campaign in South America could think he has anyone's best interests at heart.  Anyone who supports him should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>I don’t give a crap about political affiliation anymore, and I know when some people say that they still are Biden supporters, but I would rather see someone who knows how properly run a country in a position of power, and Biden/ Harris are just god awful... would have Trump any day.</p>
<p>Apparently people are labeling political party affiliation in the same boat as general intelligence, and the majority of the left has clearly shown low signs of intelligence relating to the coronavirus deal.</p>
