        <p>Nah he died of preexisting conditions. Vaccine had nothing to do with it üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Now of course, if you die of heart disease while having covid, you died of covid. We're not experts, let's just listen to them and vaccinate!</p>

        <p>I'm not taking this damn vaccine. </p>
<p>I'm not scared of getting covid (I mean a cold- slight flu or asymptomatic) 
The possibility of dying from the vaccine or bells palsy scares the shit out of me tho.</p>

        <p>Covid is a dangerous illness. You should read the experience and pain the people who survived it had gone through. It's not just a slight flu. Of course, you can recover from it, but those who do are left with permanent conditions.</p>

        <p>&rt; NEW YORK CITY (<a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/manhattan/man-in-70s-dies-after-getting-vaccine-at-javits-center-not-believed-to-be-allergic-reaction-officials">WPIX</a>)  ‚Äì Health officials confirmed early Monday that a man died shortly after  getting the COVID-19 vaccine Sunday morning at the Jacob Javits  Convention Center in Manhattan.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The man collapsed as he was leaving the Hudson Yards¬†<a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/cuomo-de-blasio-ask-for-more-shots-as-javits-center-opens-for-covid-19-vaccines">vaccination site</a>, New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;On-site security and first responders rushed to his side within  seconds, however the man died at a local hospital a short time later,  according to Zucker.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The FDNY said the man was taken to the hospital by Senior Care just  before 11 a.m. Sunday. According to Zucker, the incident occurred about  25 minutes after the man received the vaccine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This was following the required 15-minute observation period, ‚Äúwhere  he exhibited no adverse reactions or any distress,‚Äù Zucker said in a  statement.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‚ÄúInitial indications are that the man did not have any allergic reaction to the vaccine,‚Äù the health official continued.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Zucker said that he and other public-health experts agree that the coronavirus vaccine is safe.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‚ÄúI encourage all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated,‚Äù Zucker‚Äôs statement concluded.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The NYPD had no further information on the incident when Nexstar‚Äôs PIX11 reached out early Monday.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The mass-vaccination site first¬†<a href="https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/cuomo-de-blasio-ask-for-more-shots-as-javits-center-opens-for-covid-19-vaccines">opened at the Javits Center</a>¬†on  Jan. 13. The convention center was originally used as a field hospital  after the coronavirus pandemic first struck last spring.</p>

        <p>I think what gets most individuals into the boat is the idea of the vaccine and what you were told for a long time about them, the idea that when injected, it would assist you into fighting and even stopping future diseases, which in saying it sounds amazing, right? </p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>What many people still fail to realize, is that if you dig deeper into the more harsher reality of the giant pharmacy corporations, the many scandals and lawsuits of the medical world, the blatant corruption of those who you thought were there to help, and the medical industry and how it works in general, you get a more dark and very unsettling truth of how the entire system works. </p>
<p>These people who created and made these products do not care for you. These career politicians who brandish their arms on television and showcase that they're getting it don't really care for you. The industry wants customers and the system wants profit and to them, the average joe, us, is more of a means to an end. </p>
<p>The whole industry is to create more customers, not cure them. </p>
<p>That is why we are skeptical of the vaccine and now the entire industries of the world in general. Why do we put faith into people who clearly see the world as a place to scam us and get rich? If history has taught us, it is that we don't fall for that same trap again, and yet as history is about to write in the books of what happened during this time, many will fall into the trap. </p>
<p>Again.</p>
