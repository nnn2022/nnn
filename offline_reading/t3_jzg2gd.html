    <strong>Danish study on masks - should we really use that study to say masks are not effective? I'm perplexed.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone. I've run into a bit of a conundrum.</p>
<p>TLDR: Got in an argument with former lecturer about article by Dr. Heneghan on the Danish mask study. Have to admit I don't know how to answer her points effectively. I may have lost this "fight" with a pro-masker. </p>
<p>All of us were waiting for the Danish study on masks to be published, despite the veiled censorship and refusal to publish by big journals. It was finally published <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">here</a> and many of us jumped to say "Here's the proof! Masks are useless!". Many of us also shared an <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/do-masks-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19-?fbclid=IwAR1qo8LIMWRVMx6Oiy7Tn9epZNhfbmyYInWFUu7F7IKfPBqr7_2ULLvYras">article on the Spectator written by Dr. Carl Heneghan</a>, a professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, implying that surely what he was saying had to be heard. I shared this article on facebook, which was then labelled as "false information", and I shouted "CENSORSHIP". Recently, I got into an argument with a former University lecturer, who is basically saying that me sharing the article, " if this was an essay you'd have failed on scrutinising your sources ". When sharing the article, I argued:</p>
<p>"Definitely worth a read, it is now clear that masks seem to be more of a political tool rather than a proven "miraculous" virus spread inhibitor, as many would like us to believe. Surely, any coercion on such a large scale should be backed by irrefutable data that demonstrates that said coercion is absolutely necessary because, otherwise, the consequences would be dire. If there is little statistical significance to justify mass use of masks (both cloth and surgical), can Governments drop the exhausting narrative where mask sceptics are "granny killers", the "new nazis" and the worst scum on Earth?". </p>
<p>The lecturer took what <a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/danish-face-mask-study-did-not-show-that-masks-were-ineffective-at-reducing-spread-of-covid-19-study-was-underpowered-and-results-were-inconclusive/?fbclid=IwAR3D88ee9ZV77sU_TeKyAS016Fb9YLcbScUBy_yc4nd9xI_bFHxbwNtXCyE">this "fact-checking" article</a> says about it being a misleading title and inconclusive study and copy-pasted it in a response.</p>
<p>I then answered:</p>
<p>" We can agree that the article's title is misleading, but it's not my fault if someone only reads the title and not the content. I never stated "masks are not effective", but I certainly question the statistical significance of wearing one to stop virus spread (for both my own protection and protection of others) given the heavy limitations to our personal freedom unless masks are used. Many Italians who are in favour of mass mask-use seem to believe it's some kind of miraculous protection, seeing as many drive around alone while wearing one. It is now law in Italy to wear it even when one is alone out in the open: if you run you don't have to wear a mask, but if you walk you do. That's why I firmly believe that they have become more of a political tool than anything else, they are a clear visual sign of compliance/non compliance.". I also added I was waiting for hard evidence on mask effectiveness and that many pro-mask studies are based on lab results and not real-life use/misuse. These studies, in my opinion, shouldn't drive mandatory state policies.</p>
<p>The lecturer posted a very long comment. This is the main bit:</p>
<p>"If we share an article with the heading "Landmark Danish study shows facemasks have no significant effect." we are condoning that headline - it is the first thing our readers see and, unless we explicitly state otherwise, and yes, then we are responsible for them leaving with only the headline. Furthermore, sources are immensely important, especially for scientific study, and you are not sharing the study, you are sharing an article from the Spectator and it's that article that is being flagged.</p>
<p>There are many faults with how people are wearing masks, but that's the fault of people, not masks, not research. And that 'censorship' as you call it (if it was censored you would not be able to visit the link, which you absolutely can here) is based on the leading scientific facts, information provided although you have now deleted that component. I'm not going to participate in argument about this.<br>
I know you to be smart, caring, and conscientious and I do respect you, but I strongly disagree with your decision to share damaging misinformation."</p>
<p>I am kind of stumped. Any thoughts?</p></p>

<p>N95 masks in particular require training to use effectively, and per OSHA, typically annual fit tests to make sure you can get a good seal while moving your head, talking, etc.  (If you have a beard, you aren't passing this test.)  Blaming the populace for not being able to wear masks effectively is absurd.  Telling people they have to wear masks, and that masks will save them, is no better than pointing to a study whose title can be misconstrued.</p>
<p>People justify it because "it's for the right cause" or the usual liberal bullshit, but lying to people to control them simply isn't acceptable from any direction.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your input :) Someone below our comments made a detailed analysis, and I have to agree that I feel I lost the argument. But I don't think I completely lost, seeing as she (the lecturer) didn't provide any hard evidence of masks being effective.</p>
<p>It's an argument that I will not keep driving, simply because I got the feeling that I could say anything but she will not want to listen. She's too involved emotionally and personally I think.</p>

        <p>Masks don’t work. The end. I don’t want to hear “IF EVERYONE JUST WORE THEM RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” </p>
<p>You are a fucking idiot if you believe that. People can’t even wear a condom right and you only need to wear that for maybe 15 minutes depending on how good that dick works. Soooooo shut the fuck up. Masks don’t work.</p>

        <p>No, the lecturer didn't provide any evidence herself. Told me to read both sides and that so far evidence is very much in favour of masks. I didn't share the whole conversation because the main bits about masks were the ones I shared.</p>

        <p>This is more of an FYI, because if you're arguing with people no doubt they'll source this. The team that did this trial wrote a separate follow up: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-7448</p>
<p>Apparently, they say it "does not address" the question: "is transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reduced if most people in a community wear masks?" It also "does not disprove the effectiveness of widespread mask wearing." Also, "The DANMASK-19 trial was designed to examine only the masks' protective effect, not source control."</p>
<p>But then they go on to say "We explain how this trial adds to what we know about masks in the community and risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection."</p>
<p>"Masks may mitigate transmission...(no citation, reference)."</p>
<p>"Source control is believed to be the predominant mechanism...(no citation, reference)."</p>
<p>And they recommend widespread use of masks because of "observational studies that show lower SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities with widespread mask wearing (4–7) and the absence of serious adverse health effects of wearing masks (8),...."</p>

        <p>This study does not show that masks don't work. Neither does it show that they do.</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<p>“The most important limitation is the that the findings are inconclusive.”</p>
<p>“Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting.”</p>
<p>Limitations were:</p>
<p>“Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.”</p>
<p>Because of the small sample size, the confidence interval of the results was huge and, based on this data, the effect of mask wearing could range from a 46% decrease in infection to a 23% increase in infection. That is very inconclusive.</p>
<p>All we can conclude (because this is what they were actually testing) is that in places where infection rates are generally low, and other protective measures are in place, this specific mask recommendation (plus a box of masks) made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with background rates of 2% PCR acquisition, failed to show that mask wearing reduces risk by 50%. It may have reduced risk by 46%. It may have increased risk by 23%. Or somewhere in between. We don’t know, because of the way the study was designed and the results they got.</p>
<p>A failure to show statistical difference is not evidence that there is no statistical difference, and the statistical analysis of the results on this study show that it is impossible to give a conclusive answer to the question of whether or not masks work.</p>
