    <strong>Taking a leave at work over our mask policy</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a daycare/summer camp that still requires us to wear masks indoors and outdoors regardless of whether we're vaccinated (I am).  The reasoning is that the kids aren't vaccinated yet.  I am diagnosed with autism and have sensory issues that make wearing a mask anywhere difficult but wearing it outside in this heat is literal torture for me.  I think that these issues I have with mask wearing is partly why I was drawn to lockdown skeptic communities like this one the first place.  On the basis of my disability I requested an accommodation from HR to at least be allowed to take my mask off outside.  My psychiatrist wrote HR a letter to confirm that I am diagnosed with autism.  Her suggested accommodations were that I be allowed to remove my mask outside and that I get 5 minute breaks every hour to take my mask off.</p>
<p>In a call with HR today, they said I could pull my mask down outside with the stipulation that I pull it back up if I was within six feet of a child.  They didn't care that I was vaccinated, they said "You can still spread the virus even if you're vaccinated."  Then why did I even get vaccinated? What was the point?  They were basically asking me to either continue wearing a mask outside or stay six feet away from the children at all times.  Since I obviously can't do either of those things, I told them I would not be able to abide by that accommodation since it did not meet my needs as a person with a disability.  They said they would continue to review the accommodation request.</p>
<p>I then told my boss that I could not continue working in the current environment, and that I would not be able to come to work until either they changed the accommodation to remove that stipulation, or the company changes their mask guidelines to allow staff to remove them outside (which they mentioned they might be doing in the next few weeks).  So today was my last day of work until that happens.  I don't know when or if I'm going back, or if I will have any legal options worth pursuing if they do decide to terminate me.</p>
<p>I really do like my job there.  I was planning on student teaching in the kindergarten class there next fall, as I'm currently working on my elementary teaching certification.  I didn't want to quit, which was why I asked for this accommodation in the first place- to find a way to be able to stay.  This is just getting to be too much.  I have never asked for a disability accommodation at any job before, because I never wanted to let my autism hold me back and I always felt like I could do anything everyone else could do.  I just can't do this anymore.  The pandemic is over.  I don't wear a mask anywhere else except at work.  I just can't handle it anymore.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was rambling.  Thanks if you can give me any support.</p></p>

        <p>Really, if you’re vaccinated, you are set. You don’t need a mask. This isn’t a dichotomy. It’s just that in this specific example with dealing with children that people want masks on all the time, which I agree is too much to ask. But you’re playing the conspiracy card, and that’s just nonsense and not helpful.</p>

        <p>Even for people without autism, the fact that they're making people wear masks outdoors is disgusting. I'm sorry you've had to do this, but I understand why you had to leave. I don't have autism but I have asthma and I can't tolerate a mask for very long. I've worn a bandanna in stores, which apparently makes me some sort of bioterrorist, according to some people on Reddit.</p>

        <p>Yeah, haha. They seemed mad that I said it was more comfortable, as if they'd like me to be uncomfortable, even though that doesn't do anything different to prevent the virus.</p>

        <p>It's ridiculous how much these dumb mask requirements are imposing on people. Outside masks make no sense at all. The cdc relaxed that a while ago.</p>
<p>It sucks but it may be time to start looking for another position. Focus on places where the employees are not wearing masks.</p>

        <p>I have been looking for stuff for the fall but i have been having trouble finding anything that meets my requirements for student teaching. If I didn’t really want to stay, I wouldn’t have even requested the accommodation, I would have just quit and been done with it. I asked for the accommodation to find a way to stay. </p>
<p>The place I worked at last summer didn’t require masks outside. And that was when nobody was vaccinated. Then we closed because the pandemic killed our enrollment. I still miss that place.</p>

        <p>I have Aspergers… unfortunately considered part of the Autism spectrum since 2013…</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure i hated the masks ever since we had no clue what was in store back in February 2020, after trying one and finding it uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I also struggle with social cues so trying to communicate with people wearing masks doesn’t work too well… and you can’t audibly hear them either, the sound is too muffled. All I can see are what looks like a pair of worried eyes and a dumb bag over the face…</p>
