    <strong>What level of compliance to the mask rules is there, and how much social or legal trouble has non-compliance led to for you? (UK experience particularly welcome).</strong>
    <p><p>I live in England, where mask use on public transport has become mandatory. I work in a non-clinical role in the NHS, and now masks have become compulsory at work even in a building off the main site and a good 500m from the nearest patient.</p>
<p>It's not just inconvenient, it's pointless and dystopian.</p>
<p>Luckily I don't use public transport, but at work when I get off my bicycle I have to mask up before I enter the building.it doesn't make any of us feel safer, it just appeases the gibbering virtue signallers. </p>
<p>If I don't wear one I will be subject to disciplinary action (the exact nature of which is unclear).</p>
<p>I'm not sure yet how far to push it. I understand that if wearing a mask will cause you 'severe distress' you are exempt on transport etc.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried this, and how much grief did you get from staff or passengers?</p>
<p>Anyone else in a similar position at work and how do you handle it?</p></p>

        <p>It's hard because if your job depends on it, your livelihood depends on compliance. But if your job doesn't depend on it, you could just show your pretty face wherever and see what happens.</p>

        <p>Northern Virginia, United States here. Mask usage is pretty much 100% inside of stores and buildings as it’s required for businesses. You’ll see about 60-70% of people walking outdoors in masks as well. If you try to go to pretty much anywhere indoors without a mask you’ll be asked to leave or have security/cops called.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much still full dystopia here.</p>

        <p>Jesus. We keep hearing everyone 'feels more comfortable' if they see others wearing masks, but I really don't.</p>
<p>My main concern is there is (yet again) no time limit or exit strategy. About 1 in 2000 people in the UK are currently infected, so the number of unwitting asymptomatic potential spreaders is tiny. </p>
<p>We don't react like this to any other risk, so I just can't understand why covid has become so dominant in our lives.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. Seeing so many mas wearers makes me pretty damn uncomfortable, for some reason I just can't get past it. It makes me feel like I'm living in some dystopian 1984 like nightmare, and from a practical standpoint I can't see people's expressions and have a hard time communicating with them because of the mask, and I'm so fixated on it. What scares me the most are these measures are supposedly temporary, but governments conveniently leave out an end date. Is there an end to this?</p>

        <p>I noticed your comment was downvoted initially, and it really bothers me that people in this sub tend to downvote and bury the stories of people whose cities/states have a lot of mask usage. The narrative pushed here is that "everyone is sick of masks, so my (location) has maybe 5% mask usage even when mandatory!". I personally feel like this is not the case. I can't say for places down south, but I've been around PA (my state), NJ, and DE in recent times, and everyone is wearing masks basically everywhere. Masks are mandated for businesses, and I still see basically 99% compliance outdoors recently as well (...the 1% being me, my spouse, and maybe a teenager or old person every so often). YEsterday, it was 92 degrees up here, and everyone had masks on outside in the heat. No complaining, and not even masks dangling down on chins or whatever.</p>

        <p>I'm in Hampton Roads. The amount of people wearing masks is significantly lower here than up there. However Northam's phase 3 sounds good on paper with most things opening, however it sounds like he's really trying to enforce pandemic guidelines (even though a lot of people here don't give a damn and its not being enforced heavily)</p>

        <p>London. I’ve taken the tube and I don’t wear one. I’m in the minority, but I’ve not been the only one. No one given me any bother, I just put my earphones in and avoid eye contact. If I’m asked, by staff, I’ll say I have an exemption. If I’m asked by Karen, they’ll either get silence or a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>My colleague said she saw inspectors ask a man to get off the tube for not wearing one - which he did. She said they then started on another lady who gave it back to them about how they couldn’t make her wear a mask, mental health issues etc and apparently they just let her be. </p>
<p>I really don’t think they’ll push it, and I am hopeful compliance will slip gradually so it becomes even more difficult to police. </p>
<p>I’ve been trying to cycle more as, similar to a previous poster, I resent giving them my money right now.</p>

        <p>Mask compliance went from about 15% to 85% overnight here (Southwestern US) when the mask order was signed.  It's a warning on first violation and a $50 fine thereafter.  I don't expect police to be very enthusiastic enforcing it after all the heat they've been under recently.</p>
<p>I don't wear one out and about, even while working, but if someone complains in my direction about it then I'll strap a mask over my chin and carry on, until sufficient time passes that I could have had a plausible reason for taking it off.</p>

        <p>You can imagine most of that compliance is not because of the consequences that not wearing masks will bring, but the punishment. (You see something similar with drunk driving laws, and the stiff fines that accompany DUI offenses: it's because the justice systems determined that people are more responsive to threats to their wallets. That's why you always hear people say "I can't afford a DUI" and never "I could kill someone by driving drunk")</p>

        <p>I live in Yorkshire, and I'm refusing to use public transport while they keep up their ridiculous requirements. I may make an exception in order to leave the country soon.</p>
<p>I've not actually had that much grief from people in shops though. I did change which supermarkets I use to ones without one-way systems though, and the doomers appear to have changed in the other direction.</p>
<p>The worse I've had in recent weeks was B&amp;Q who insisted I take a trolley, and that they wouldn't serve me otherwise. I then had to park up my trolley with a single item on it and step back for it to be priced up. I will not be returning.</p>

<p>Their heads must be struggling to square the circle of woke logic of mask virtue signalling Vs respecting the hidden disabilities most of the non wearers don't have.</p>
<p>These are exactly the same people who would have pulled the whole companion animal nonsense and taken a peacock or a pet pig on a plane, and called you a nazi if you objected or took the piss.</p>

        <p>As an outsider, UK sounds like it has terminal dystopia. I hope things turn around for you guys.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, we have had much of the same bullshit, but at least where I live people have seemingly been just living their lives. I see a mask here 'n there (usually worn incorrectly). It isn't all good though, some places have started mandating masks, so I have been avoiding those establishments. And there is talk of mandating masks for everyone in public spaces. I sincerely hope that doesn't happen, otherwise I will have to reconsider living here. I am unwilling to comply with unreasonable draconian bullshit should my employer decide to impose any. We need more people to take a stand on this even if it's difficult.</p>

        <p>That's good to know. Thankfully at work the rules calmed down a bit today, as in masks now required in communal areas but not at the desk if people are distanced, frequent touch surfaces sanitised etc. </p>
<p>I can live with that I guess, hopefully in a few weeks they'll drop the mask hysteria completely so long as there isn't a massive increase in deaths in 3-4 weeks time following today's announcement.</p>
<p>Pub open from July... definitely up for a pint or 6.</p>

        <p>Rural US, masks started in mid April, were unquestioned in May, people started taking them off beginning of June and like a week ago no one wore them, now everyone is wearing them again.</p>

        <p>Small town, southern Wisconsin. I work at a small, local hardware store, where masks are not required. Many of our customers don't wear masks. We did have a "crazy cat lady" come in the other day and scold us for not wearing masks. She has been a problem in the past for our store, and my boss dislikes her, a lot. I understand having a conversation and trying to convince us to wear masks, but the way she handled it just made me want to wear a mask even less.</p>

        <p>I'm in the West Mids. Thankfully, hardly anyone wears a face covering around here - when I go to ASDA it's about one in every twenty people that wear one. </p>
<p>I haven't set foot on public transport since the face covering restrictions came in, but I've been keeping track when I see buses go past and it's been a relief to see at least half of the passengers don't wear them.</p>
<p>In addition, I've looked through the government's guidance for businesses ahead of the July reopening (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches) and they go to lengths to say that there isn't much evidence about the benefits of using face coverings and that they are not a replacement for other risk measures - so I'm really hopeful that we won't see businessess expecting customers to use them.</p>

        <p>Good to know, let's hope the usage fades away with the warm weather. I dread to think how the country will react to normal, everyday colds and sniffles folk will start showing in a few months time.</p>
<p>It'll be panic all over again I bet.</p>
