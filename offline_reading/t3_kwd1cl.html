        <p>I don't give money. I can't. Being 3 fucking thousand dollars in debt because of COVID does that.</p>
<p>Instead I give out food when I can because it's what's going to be better for them.</p>
<p>I'd rather spend five dollars to get a homeless person a light meal and a bottle of water than giving them that five dollars to go get their next drug fix.</p>

        <p>No, you whine about it on the internet (just like a neck beard) call other people bigots when they refuse to hire you (gee I wonder why?) and spend your time on Reddit talking about video games and anime bullshit (just like a neck beard) all whilst living with your parents ( you say family but there's no way in hell you mean a wife and child) and going deeper into debt. </p>
<p>The sheer hubris for you to think you can then blame your own personal failings, not only only on a virus, but on the people in this sub is astonishing. </p>

        <p>$3k in debt, unemployed, sponging off family/friends and still want to blame a virus for all your hardships? </p>
<p>Seems like those wheels were in motion long before COVID, my friend.</p>
<p>Have you tried introspection? Or therapy?</p>

        <p>All that debt? Accumulated in 2020.</p>
<p>Unemployed? I've had 5 jobs in the past year. All of them barely made ends meet.</p>
<p>I don't like sponging as you say. I live with my can't because I know I can't be on my own yet. I don't have the tools or the knowledge or the resources. I didn't when I tried to move out in early March. Just before things went south with Covid.</p>
<p>I blame a lot more than the virus. Including myself.</p>
<p>Yes, actually, to both. I'd still be in therapy, but insurance doesn't exist and neither do decent therapists.</p>

        <p>That would be perfectly rational, were this virus a significant clinical risk to healthy under-50s. It isn't. The highest estimates for CFR in that age group (using only confirmed cases in hospital) give it a death rate equal to e-coli. I know, you could say, "but they could spread it to others more vulnerable!" Not if the vulnerable are more shielded, they can't ;)</p>

        <p>There shouldn't be deaths at all. And if the world handled this properly instead of 3.5 billion people telling everyone else to fuck off, it would have no death rate.</p>
<p>And not all of the more vulnerable ARE shielded. Not everyone has protections. Because that costs money and time not every being has.</p>

        <p>No, there shouldn't, and if our governments had been honest with us about its true origins right from the start we may have clamped down on its international spread half a year earlier than we did. But they weren't.</p>
<p>Now, we have to decide whether to shield the vulnerable as best we can, or lock down everyone until...well, no-one knows when until. The latter causes unprecedented preventable death about the young and healthy around the world. The former does not.</p>

        <p>I'm lucky too by that logic. Doesn't mean I won't keep up the measures of safety legally put in place to protect others. Because I've seen others who do put those precautions up and fall prey. I've also seen more who don't and get it even worse.</p>
<p>The virus is as transmissible as you told, because that's the entire reason it's a virus. The genetic makeup of a virus makes it so transmissible. Basic biology and science.</p>
<p>It is also deadly. Does it always kill? No.
Does a gunshot wound always kill? No.
But both are things one should take proper precautions to avoid, yes?</p>

<p>&rt; I may be uninformed and an average guy trying to survive. But I've seen enough with my own two eyes to justify what I'm saying.  </p>

<p>From what you've described; happiness isn't much of a fixture in your life anyway. </p>
<p>What is life without happiness? Looks like you died a long time ago. </p>
<p>You are now just an NPC living in fear and trying to ensure everyone else does the same.</p>

<p>Yes, I admit I'm uninformed. But I'd rather be uninformed than misinformed.</p>
<p>You're right, happiness isn't a bit fixture in my life. And yet it's still there. Barely, sometimes, but it is. I know where it started to go wrong, but I won't bore you with a story you wouldn't even read because you care so little.</p>
<p>Fear? Ha. I live how I do out of concern, because ar least I have a heart.</p>
<p>Also, scare tactics? Really? I haven't lived in a home with an attic or basement since I was in diapers. I'd tell you to try again but that's a waste of both of our time.</p>

        <p>Have you read any of the threads on here? </p>
<p>The people committing suicide or overdosing don’t lie. 
The people losing everything - jobs, businesses, homes - don’t lie.
There are no excess deaths. Deaths are attributed to COVID, in many cases due to a test whose Nobel prize winning creator said was not designed to detect infection with a disease. And which has a false positive rate of up to 90%. Notice how the ever more draconian measures get worse the more people are tested? Healthy people being forced to get tested in order to work or travel or attend school?
There’s no evidence of asymptomatic spread. Or surface transmission.<br>
Masks don’t work. 
The elderly everyone is so desperate to protect are dying alone and often confused, with their only happiness denied to them. 
Children are being stunted in their development and education. 
People are dying of other things like cancer and stroke because they can’t get medical treatment. 
I could go on and on. 
All for a disease which is no more deadly to those under 70 than the flu.</p>
<p>Nobody is denying that it exists or that some people don’t get ill or even die (although fewer than 400 people in the UK have died from rather than with COVID since this all began. For context, about 1600 people die in the UK every single day). We’re saying the cure is worse than the disease. Especially now that several cures have been found which actually work. But that info is suppressed, like so much else. </p>
<p>I’ve done masses of research and you can come in this sub and attack all you want but I for one am here because I care about the millions of people who are suffering as a result of the measures AS WELL as those who are ill with COVID.  </p>
<p>We’re a handy scapegoat but maybe turn your eyes to those who are in charge and who are lying to you while not following their own rules to blame.</p>

        <p>Likely they work in a high contact area that due to the nature of their workplace, is a Covid risk but also an essential business. Thus, that is an actual safety reason to not mingle unless necessary.</p>

        <p>It is an essential business, but there are also safety reasons to 'mingle.' People need to see those they care about. If they can see hundreds of strangers, they can see a handful of friends without making a dent in the R-rate.</p>
<p>COVID deaths (leaving aside the tricky question of how governments are recording them for now, I'm sure someone else will bring it up) are an order of magnitude fewer than famine deaths due to general lockdowns. And that's just famine deaths. Deaths from other treatable illnesses, due to the stalling of vaccinations for other diseases like malaria and TB in the developing world, are skyrocketing too.</p>

<p>Fewer? Fewer my left foot. I don't think a famine has killed 22 thousand people in a single week. However, I can be proven wrong as history classes in US schools do not teach anything of good note.</p>

        <p>&rt;you're all acting like it isn't real</p>
<p>It's very real, we just disagree on the measures that should be taken to combat it.</p>
<p>&rt;Wear your mask. If you don't want to wear one, don't leave your home.</p>
<p>You sould have a strong point here, if life before a year ago involved constantly being forced and/or pressured into wearing a mask in public. But that's not the case. So if you're so terrified and paranoid about this virus, don't leave your home, and let others live their lives.</p>
<p>&rt;Consider other people.</p>
<p>I do. That's why I'm against all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns that harm far more people than they help, especially at this point.</p>
<p>&rt;That person wearing a mask that you pass by while you don't wear a mask may have family at risk.</p>
<p>Then they need to take their own personal precautions, likewise for the family member at risk. If it's that drastic, they shouldn't be out in public, let alone passing by someone without a mask if they're so concerned.</p>
<p>&rt;People like you all are why there's still so much trouble.</p>
<p>So an incredibly small minority of people is the sole reason why all of this is still going on?</p>
<p>&rt;when you idiots all get sick and hospitalized</p>
<p>Considering I'm quite healthy and in my 20s, it's doubtful I'll even catch this virus, let alone be mildly harmed from it, and let alone be hospitalized. I have a way higher chance of being harmed by the "cure" you're so fond of, than the virus itself. But nice of you to laugh at the idea of those you disagree with being harmed.</p>
<p>&rt;sick and unable to be compensated by your jobs</p>
<p>I'd rather be sick and unable to be compensated by my job than to not have a job at all due to all these wide-reaching mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;freely spread COVID-19</p>
<p>So now disagreeing with the policies regarding a virus is equal to freely spreading a virus? I hope you've worn a mask all the time before this virus hit. That'd be awkward if you didn't.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe when your closest family members die you'll realize you're being selfish pieces of shit.</p>
<p>Maybe when your closest family members die from their hugely increased risk of homelessness, starvation, missed health screenings, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, depression, and suicide, you'll realize you're being a selfish piece of shit.</p>

        <p>You disagreeing makes the virus spread further.</p>
<p>It's being forced into us because people didn't take t seriously. It's why we're at this point.</p>
<p>I'm for these mandates to consider people as well. I understand the damage being cooped up causes. I know I'm going stir crazy.</p>
<p>If a person is outside, mask on, and doing all they can do be safe, they're outside for a reason. Travelling to work. Getting needed groceries or toiletries. Dropping off paperwork to file for unemployment. And so on.</p>
<p>Incredibly small minority, my left foot. You're at least one third of this entire country, and who knows how much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>You see the problem there. Jobs aren't able to handle this situation because of no support. From up high or down below.</p>
<p>I'm also perfectly healthy, in my 20s, and still know the virus can damage me. And if it doesn't harm me, it can and will affect those I live with.</p>
<p>Yes, disagreeing with those policies equals spreading the virus freely, as that's what you're doing.  Going out in public with no protection, no care in the world, pretending the world is as it was before January of 2020, is spreading the virus. Because you're likely to be a carrier as you travel.</p>
<p>I have had family members, friends, and co workers die of that list. I have suffered, and still do suffer, parts of that list. I admit I'm not the best human or role model, but at least I have a semblance of care for human beings I can keep safe with my actions.</p>

        <p>&rt;You disagreeing makes the virus spread further.</p>
<p>So I make the virus spread even if I'm a good boy and wear a mask when required, etc.? Then what's the points of masks, geez.</p>
<p>&rt;It's being forced into us because people didn't take t seriously. It's why we're at this point.</p>
<p>So if people haven't been takin it seriously for the past year or so, what makes you think they'll all of the sudden start now, especially with vaccines rolling out? I'm sure you're aware of the defenition of insanity.</p>
<p>&rt;If a person is outside, mask on, and doing all they can do be safe, they're outside for a reason.</p>
<p>But if this virus is so horrible, they should be doing everything they can do stay inside and use all the tools, resources, and opportunities provided by countless companies in order to stay home and be safe. I know if I were so spooked by this virus, that's what I'd do. I think you should be trying to convince the masses of people who willingly go out into public just to get their pumpkin spice latte, thinking that their mask serves as a completely effective tool to shield them from the virus. You'd have better luck.</p>
<p>&rt;You're at least one third of this entire country</p>
<p>I disagree, but even if the 1/3+ number is proven accurate, the vast majority of people still are wearing masks, distancing, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;Jobs aren't able to handle this situation because of no support. From up high or down below.</p>
<p>What are you referring to?</p>
<p>&rt;the virus can damage me</p>
<p>Of course it can. It can damage anyone. But I'm personally much more concerned about the "cure" harming/killing me than the virus harming/killing me.</p>
<p>&rt;it can and will affect those I live with</p>
<p>But it's all built on a possibility. The possibility that you'll maybe catch the virus, then potentially spread it to those you live with, who will then have the slim chance of kinda maybe sorta being harmed from it.</p>
<p>&rt;Going out in public with no protection, no care in the world, pretending the world is as it was before January of 2020, is spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Disagreeing with the measures taken to combat the virus doesn't mean that I'm never wearing a masm when required, socially diatancing, etc. But even if that was 100% the case, going without a mask doesn't equate to knowingly and willingly spreading a virus that there's a stupidly high chance you don't even have.</p>
<p>&rt;at least I have a semblance of care for human beings I can keep safe with my actions.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Protect your elderly and vulnerable, if they want you to. Take all the personal precautions necessary in order to make you feel safe, and let everyone else do the same. As opposed to shutting down the world, causing massive spikes in all those categories. Categories that disproportionately harm the young and/or not particularly vulnerable, such as us and the majority of other people. Similarly to you, I also have friends and family who have suffered from all those issues. On the flip side, I have zero friends or family who have been directly harmed from this virus itself, and that includes my aunt and uncle in their 50s who've caught it. Anecdotal, sure, but one that applies to so many others as well.</p>

        <p>Grow up you ignorant child. Open your eyes. Realize the government is lying to you. This doesn’t end with compliance. This ends with mass unrest and civil disobedience. </p>
<p>What are you hoping to accomplish posting this ?  One scroll thru this sub and you’ll see you’re changing no ones mind real fast and you’ll only get downvoted to hell. </p>

        <p>The government is lying, what a remarkable idea. A newborn knows this. My after-dinner dump knows this. The idea of government is more rotten than a gallon of milk left out on the Hollywood walk of fame for 24 hours in summer.</p>
<p>What doesn't lie is body count. True dead bodies I've seen, some I've mourned. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm irrational. I know I'm not the brightest. But I'd like to think I'm trying not to spread a deadly disease.</p>

        <p>NGL. I got a laugh out of your first paragraph. </p>
<p>That said, you really believe that they aren’t lying on the numbers as well ?  I haven’t seen many flu cases this year. Couldn’t be because they’re marking them as covid now for number inflation ?</p>

        <p>How many doctors, nurses, technicians, assistants, and various other trained staff with degrees up the ass, do you think are going to compromise their license they spent more than their trip to college on to spread a hoax? That they're being bribed by people who refuse to give money to anyone, the bigwig suits who want nothing but money and think us poor folk deserve nothing?</p>
<p>Is there a chance of lying? Yes, that's human nature and human error. </p>
<p>Is there a chance there's no lying? Also yes, because human nature is also to try to be kind. Some people have morals.</p>
