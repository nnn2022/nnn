    <strong>My aunt is about to pass away. She's in hospice now.</strong>
    <p><p>I just got off the phone with my dad,  trying to explain my concerns about her getting vaccinated and how there's a connection to her lung cancer.  He told me there's no connection,  that that's just an "old wives tale" or something,  and I explained how it is kind of strange how she progressed to stage 4 lung cancer in only 2 months.  He said she could have had it for months and it just went undetected.  And he went on about delta variant, how dangerous it is to be unvaxxed, that people are dying only .1% and any adverse reactions are minor and nothing to worry about.  I tried to explain to him how untrue this is.  And I'm going on.  And he's like I can give you the number to my friends immunologist. And after a while of me going on, he's like I'm not a scientist so I don't have answers for you.  But you should talk to that immunology, he can give you better answers. </p>
<p>My cousin is a medical malpractice lawyer and she's taking care of my aunt.  I find it so absurd that she isn't seeing the connection.  I asked her if my aunt got the vaccine,  she said yup she was one of the first ones,  waited in line for 2 hours.  But it's not covid related. </p>
<p>I love how she just assumes I'm taking about covid and not the vaccine. </p>
<p>Even my sister texted today "I can't believe how fast her cancer has progressed.  Is there anything we can do"</p>
<p>But nobody wants to listen to me or take me seriously when I try to tell them how questionable the vaccine is and how questionable the entire thing is. </p>
<p>I told my dad they keep changing the rules and his response is that they are catering to the change in the variants, because covid is so unpredictable.</p>
<p>I think I'll be met with this same argument every time someone in my family tries to talk to me about getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I live in a blue state in the US. Right by Washington DC.  My mom has Biden signs and BLM signs in the front yard.  </p>
<p>I can't win.</p></p>

        <p>I live a little over an hour outside DC and we all love guns, freedom, and the space to do with what we please. There is a stark difference in life if you drive down Rt. 7 a few minutes. It's more rare to find people wearing a mask than not.</p>
<p>Cities contain generally unhappy people who are always in a rush and narcissistic, they lack a freedom bubble.</p>
<p>Rural areas allow people to breath and live life at their own pace which garners more happiness and sense of community, as people respect others more since they aren't breathing down each other's necks.</p>

        <p>Yeah you cannot win I was the same way with everyone close to me and I just caved recently. I am young and I just felt weird the day after the 1st dose but I would continue to stay away. The connection is totally prevalent because it can cause extra lipids in your body. My mum was diagnosed with cyrosis very quickly as well its fucked dude.</p>

        <p>Wait, she went from no cancer to S4 in 2 months after getting vaxxed and your dad sees no connection?</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your ailing aunt and your family that refuses to see what is right in front of them. I am not sure if you are a spiritual person, but the deception and ensuing blindness are just so demonic. All we can do is to pray and to NOT get vaxxed whilst still pleading with our family and friends.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear this. Similar story in my family, I‚Äôve lost family members after they took the second dose. The first deteriorated suddenly without any other obvious reason. The second had already had covid 12 months ago, been in hospital and recovered‚Ä¶ and then got really sick after the vaccine. Neither will be listed as vaccine deaths as there isn‚Äôt any ‚Äòevidence‚Äô.</p>

        <p>Well my cousin,  her daughter,  has power of attorney or whatever.  She's a medical malpractice lawyer,  and still doesn't want to look at the connection. 
Yeah it's heartbreaking.  I don't think I can convince my family.  My dad said no that's no connection.  Like without any info to back up why it isn't.

        <p>I‚Äòm truly sorry for your situation. </p>
<p>But could it be that you are overreacting regarding the vaccine because of your emotional state? I did a quick google search and could not find any relation between vaccines and cancer (apart from a vaccine against cancer being tested right now). Your cousin probably has expertise in the field. So if they don‚Äòt see any connection, your gut feeling is not enough evidence, and you are probably wrong about this argument against vaccines.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish you and your family the best.</p>

        <p>But there is also no indication that mRNA vaccines cause cancer. Without indication, long term studies are unneccesary.</p>
<p>The cancer effects are mere claims based a the misunderstanding of how mRNA-vaccines work. They don't alter the cells DNA in any way, nor does the mRNA stay in the body for more than a few hours.</p>

        <p>But we biologically and chemically understand the mechanisms of mRNA well enough to almost certainly exclude any correlation between mRNA and cancer.</p>
<p>Studies are ongoing and may prove me otherwise, but the probability is low. Low enough to get the vaccine for me.</p>

        <p>No, we don‚Äôt. We do not have the data on long term effects on human subjects. Excluding any correlation without that data is unscientific and irresponsible. Period.</p>

        <p>We do not exclude it, we exclude it almost certainly. Small but significant difference.</p>
<p>Just because we cannot exclude something, that doesn't mean that it happens. Statistically we cannot exclude that milk causes a small penis. Or that playing guitar on a friday causes a hurricane. But we understand the world well enough to almost certainly say that it doesn't. </p>
<p>You can mention for the 100th time that we don't have long-term studies yet. But still, as of now the risk/reward factor of the vaccine is in favor of the reward.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for monitoting the side-effects of mRNA. Just your specific claim about mRNA and cancer is absolutely baseless.</p>

        <p>Please. I understand you are in a hard situation, but please don‚Äòt let strangers on the internet tell you what to think and what not, without any evidence. That is the way conspiracy ideologists operate: they scout for people at their lowest, and lure them into their simple worldview. But sadly the world is not that simple.</p>
<p>Please take some time to come to terms with your emotions before settling on this. You don‚Äòt have to simply believe me when I say that there is no connection. But please try not to fall for anyone on the internet.</p>
