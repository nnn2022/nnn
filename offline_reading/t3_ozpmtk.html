    <strong>This is an ideological war, and we are losing.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Make no mistake: this is a war</strong>. Except instead of bullets, bombs, and guns, the COVID-19 war is being fought with marketing, messaging, and ideology.</p>
<p>Instead of <em>overt</em> violence, as was done in the past, our governments and mainstream media have realized it is significantly easier and more powerful to use <em>covert</em> violence to control the populace and dictate what we can and can't do.</p>
<p><strong>Shaming. Coercion. Loaded language. Bots</strong>. These are not just emergent properties of a pandemic - they are conscious choices by our officials, proven sociological engineering techniques that are being applied to all of us to achieve a desired outcome.</p>
<p>I work in marketing. I use these techniques every day, for profit, and I can tell you sincerely that this is a <em>psychological assault</em>. The majority of us here have been weathering it for the better part of eighteen months, but unfortunately, we are losing.</p>
<p>The goalposts will not stop shifting, because it is not advantageous for the government to do so. Most people understand this on an intuitive level and have resigned to their fate. Look at your friends, family members, and colleagues and you can probably count on one hand the number of people that <em>haven't</em> compromised their integrity re: vaccines, masks, restrictions, and so on.</p>
<p>All for an illness that has, in all likelihood, had a lower probability of killing them over the last eighteen months <em>than their daily drive to work.</em></p>
<p>No help is coming. There is no endgame. You have no choice as to your participation in this <strong>ideological war</strong>, but you <em>do</em> have a choice as to whether you'll give up, or fight against the lunacy. I have chosen the latter.</p>
<p>Stand strong and do not comply.</p></p>

        <p>remember that trying to cirvumvent the system by getting fake certs etc only prolong the system and prolong the whole nightmare giving us nothing while giving them the time to master next step - probably chips or tattoos or other technique thats not possible to being faked.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. It's important to voice your concerns. Attempting to sneak through or subtly circumvent restrictions validates their existence by default, and tells the enemy that we're willing to play their game. We're not.</p>

        <p>Exactly. This is what the absolute <strong>morons</strong> in this sub don't understand. Sure, you'll have your fake health passport/card/whatever so you can continue going to McDonalds and the movies, but the tyranny is going to continue on, and then we'll "own nothing and be happy" (but I guess the "critical thinkers" in our sub don't mind that as long as they can get their dicks hard from gaming the system so they can participate in the society they claim to hate).</p>
<p>Oh, and I doubt the "geniuses" on here can get away with their fake cards and crap for long either. They're going to implement a QR code system eventually, and those are hard to falsify even for expert hackers. Good luck.</p>

        <p>You’re spot on. </p>
<p>But this is why I think we short circuit ourselves. Hope, rebellion, rage are messages we control too as a people. It’s slower but we offer a broader spectrum than the State ever could. We can message to those around us. Thing is... it can’t be online.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. If this <em>is</em> to be won, it will be won locally through unity, collective anger, and hope for a better tomorrow. </p>
<p>But it won't be easy, and it'll take a significant push outside of most people's social comfort zones. And that's exactly what our opponents are relying on - your fear of social reprimand or consequences. </p>
<p>We need to be willing to rise above petty tribalism, to let it be known that we will not comply with ludicrous restrictions, and to make it clear that there is no compromise. If you give an inch, they'll take a mile (as we've all seen).</p>

        <p>I appreciate the optimism, but we have certainly not won in any sense of the word. The majority of citizens across Earth (yes, our <em>entire planet</em>) have lost an unprecedented number and breadth of rights over the last eighteen months, and much of the populace is passive to the point of resignation.</p>
<p>If we don't act decisively, <em>now</em> - not later - we will never get out of this.</p>

We who carry the idea of freedom and free world have won. </p>
<p>It's not about injecting you with vaccine. That's just the tool to take away your freedom. They have all the money in the world and still can't rule our minds. What they try to do is to put ideas in our heads that we are to small to win. There is many ways to do that. One of them is trying to act like one if us, but speak what they speak. Not going to work this time. You know why? Because we won!</p>
<p>For thousands of  years they were doing exactly the same thing you tried to do, subtly, in your post. To break people's spirit. They didn't manage to do that. So I'm telling you again, we won! I know that it's hard for you to handle, but I'll say it again. We won!</p>

        <p>Just imagine an army in which every other soldier is thinking that they will lose the war. That kind of mentality is the reason why we are where we are right now. Be strong mentally.

        <p>I am pretty pessimistic out in CA. </p>
<p>A prominent VP for Pfizer said all of this is war gamed by the killer global
Marxists and, of course, they have been planning for years. This has always been about the vaccine passport and global control. </p>
<p>There’s not a lot we can do other than flee to red states or live in the shadows as long as possible. The recall of Gavin Newsom may be the only unexpected thing we have done. If he stays in office, all hope is lost and it’s just a matter of time before every country becomes Australia and then China. </p>
<p>Think I am wrong? Look at what the CDC and the Biden administration just did to private property rights. As they have infringed on our property rights, what is to keep them from assaulting the person directly? They are doing it indirectly and it may lead to threatened jail unless you take the clot shot and get the passport.</p>

        <p>Tbh i have much more hope for usa as for example france or italy.</p>
<p>Your states have a lot of power, the central government cant do everything on its own. Many states already banned covid passports. In france they implemented the passport at the central government and they are done. In the usa that will not work. So.. some states will get it, others dont. That iy much better as if the whole nation gets it</p>

        <p>We have shifted from a military industrial complex to a pharmaceutical industrial complex. The mainstream media and politicians have been saying we are at war with covid since the beginning of this mess. They've calmed the rhetoric but go back to early broadcasts of this coverage and compare it to 'weapons of mass destruction' and 'the war on terror'. Exact same psychological warfare. </p>
<p>Same thing being done with January 6. When I hear a politician compare that to Pearl Harbor it makes me want to puke. Only comparison of the two I see relevant is our government saw both coming.</p>
