    <strong>Please help me</strong>
    <p><p>Are the hospitals at full capacity and struggling horribly or completely empty? Someone almost convinced me that they saw a full hospital. If it's actually the truth I'll have to start wearing masks and attacking those who don't, so please please save me if you can</p></p>

        <p>Hospitals are designed to be used, ICU wards are designed to be full.<br>
If Covid was so bad it meant the hospitals were having to turn away other emergencies it would be bad, if they're having to turn away non-emergency but routine operations and treatment it's still bad, if, they think Covid isn't another illness that may require hospital treatment and could be eradicated totally we'd play ball. </p>
<p>But, if it is just another illness and will always be around and may also mean folks need hospital treatment then the money spent this year would have been better off building new permanent hospitals. </p>
<p>But more people I know have had it now than first wave, and none require hospital treatment.</p>

        <p>OK, basically what you're saying everyone should be prepared to catch the covid and pray it's not a bad case. If it is bad then tough luck, but a hospital will have a free bed because covid is a priority?</p>

        <p>Yes, stay fit and healty and you 'may' catch it like any other virus, but it 'probably' will be just fine, 'if' you are taken ill enough to warrant a hospital visit the hospital will be available to you and will prioritise your case based o the severity of your illness. As we are now seeing Covid is far from a priority case in most people who catch it.</p>

        <p>Ok, it seems like it's been a while since I'd had a flu, but even if it happened I was never afraid of dying from it until this year. Though most often I got flu as a kid, and they say kids are immune to dying to covid... so they're also probably immune to flu. Mean with more age it *does* become a deadly threat, with ever growing percentages</p>

        <p>With age every virus and illness is more risky but saying it *does* become a deadly threat is wrong. It's another thing that may cause death if the patient has underlying conditions or is weak anyway.</p>
<p>Cov19 is now something like 27th down the list of causes of death.</p>
<p>I know a few older poeple who had it and it wasn't a death sentence, same with old folks in the care home my mother in law works at. Non have died, 70-90 yr olds.</p>
<p>I had flu at 21, it was way worse than any of the people I know who have had Cov19 in the last few months.</p>
<p>Everyone will react to illness differently, we've all just got to keep fit and stay healthy enough, to what level is your choice, and to risk your health is your choice, the hospitals will be there for you if you need them. </p>
<p>At the end of the day you asses your own individual risk from anything, if you don't fancy a hospital visit don't do anything that means you would more than likely get one. Viruses are way down the list. </p>
<p>Now where's my parachute, just gonna go BASE jumping.</p>

        <p>Hospitals get much busier during winter, add to that a whole floor of "covid" that has a different treatment than the flu while covid was cold and influenza until 2020, add lots of protocols and you'll create a whole bunch of new work. </p>
<p>Also hospitals get more stimulus if they have a vivid case Vs influenza or pneumonia, so it's very possible that they diagnose you with covid and make you be in the hospital.</p>

        <p>The person said "the covid wing was full", I guess they could have simply renamed a wing into a covid wing for more narrative compliance. Do hospitals really get full each winter?</p>

        <p>What I'm trying to say is that until 2019 you wouldn't go to the hospital for a flu in 99% of cases even if you're really sick. </p>
<p>Now if you get the flu very bad, first of all you gonna think that you might have covid and that makes 99% of people really paranoid and give an excuse to full fill covid floors in hospitals which have tight protocols hard to follow. </p>
<p>I remember many times going to emergency in hospitals and after waiting hours in the reception I would seen people in bed in hallways cause no space for rooms.</p>
<p>Notice that for covid I doubt you will hear a private hospital is full. Most full hospitals and most deaths normally come for hospitals for lower class.</p>

        <p>Good to know that being white-collar increases chance of survival. I can certainly feel the fear and paranoia and I've been fighting these for years... people who haven't are probably more affected. Question is whether the fear is justified. I know my personal fears are mostly not justified... in fact there some kind of thrill in fearing stuff so it's actually attractive to fear.</p>
