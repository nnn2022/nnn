    <strong>Am I crazy, or is this completely unveiled discrimination against mentally and physically disabled people?</strong>
    <p><p>I was walking around this CVS grocery store, just killing time when I heard an announcement over the loudspeaker.  It started out like a typical COVID policy announcement (wash your hands, wear a mask, social distance). But then they said something along the lines of 'If you have a disability that makes you unable to wear a mask, please use our store website instead of shopping here.'</p>
<p>I hate to be offended for other people, but I feel like they might as well have giant steps going to the front door with a sign at the bottom saying, 'We didn't feel like building a wheelchair ramp, so if you can't walk, please shop online.'.</p>
<p>Is this just me?</p></p>

        <p>Yup, they've been doing that the whole time where I live to get around the ADA by providing an alternate service so they can legally refuse those who can't wear a mask.</p>
<p>Of course it only works because small businesses got tossed to the curb, and conglomerates have been trying to shift to online ordering for years anyways to reduce employee and cashier labor costs.</p>

        <p>A year ago, can you imagine what people would have said if CVS announced they were getting rid of disabled parking, because disabled people can “just get delivery.”   This is definitely a violation of the ADA, because ordering curbside or delivery is not equivalent to shipping in the store. What if people want browse or don’t know exactly what item they want to get until they see them?  I hope people sue.</p>

        <p>Even beyond that .. even if they could somehow say it's the same thing...  My next question is "Well what if they're disabled, and they also don't have internet access at home?". Which you know CVS would respond with 'They can go to the library or McDonald's.' </p>
<p>So CVS is subjecting physically and mentally disabled people to not being able to shop without using unsecure network connections, risking credit card theft when they could have just... Let them not wear a mask.</p>

        <p>For a number of years in my early and mid twenties, I didn't have a credit card or a bank account, and didn't have means of getting one either. Which meant online shopping simply wasn't an option for me. I would've been f****d now. This is exactly why I reuse to do business with places that don't take cash. Do I have an alternative form of payment? Yes. Does everybody else have one? No. It's social economical discrimination plain and simple.</p>

        <p>THIS. I work in retail and so many places are cashless. The pandemic has made me more pro-cash because I realize that if we were to say no, there's a lot of people who would be out: older people, people visiting from overseas, under 18's who don't have Mommy's credit card (or one of the kiddie cards), people who are unbanked, people who use cash for budgeting, people who use their cash tips as fun money...whatever reason one has is valid.</p>

        <p>They’re not. According to them when public health is at risk all their stuff can go out the window to preserve it. Even if these businesses didn’t provide alternate accommodations it isn’t an issue to the ADA. I’ve filed numerous complaints with them and this is what they’ve told me. It’s absolute insanity.</p>

Ok, maybe they aren't mentally well enough to live on their own, but they should still have some amount of rights over their own bodies.

        <p>Yup. I was in the Dollar Store today. My first time out in over a month. I can't wear a mask; no love lost there, except that it makes me an outcast, and every time I do go into a store I feel like I'm running the gauntlet, hoping no one takes out their COVID fatigue on me. </p>
<p>I took a road trip and panicked when I realised I needed to use a washroom. It felt like there were "closed to un-masked" signs everywhere. </p>
<p>I'm not equating my struggles to anyone. But, at this rate, Segregation will repeat itself, only in a slightly different form. Next, I'll have to dodge "unvaxxed are not welcome" in addition to "no mask no service." I'm not the confrontational type; I wish I had it in me to fight and stand up for my right to use my Medical Exemption. But I'm not so right now I'm the second-class citizen, relegated to settling for online shopping and banishment. :-(</p>

        <p>It's crazy.  I just .. if their masks are so effective, they should feel safe wearing them.  They shouldn't need everybody else to to feel okay.  And I know they'll say "They don't protect the wearer: they protect everyone else," but they always go back on that claim whenever it helps them win an argument.  "It's for your own good!" </p>
<p>If their vaccines are so effective... Why should they care if anybody around them has the shot?  They're protected, right?  </p>
<p>If I'm riding my bike, and I'm wearing my helmet, I don't care what anybody else does.  I don't yell at people to wear theirs.  The same goes for my seatbelt.  If the other drivers don't wear one, it's not my problem.  I guess the difference is that I actually believe my seatbelt and my helmet work... They aren't so sure if their masks or vaccines do...</p>
<p>I just... Ugh</p>

        <p>That is offensive. I wear the masks, but have COPD [never smoked in my case] and breathing is very hard in them. If my COPD advances, I may not be able to wear one. I feel like ADA has been gutted. I know the effect on my well being of being told over and over physically and [mentally too] disabled people should be triaged and that we don't matter has really been horrifying. I belong to disability rights groups too but have been afraid to broach this topic. If anyone knows ANY disability activists who are questioning the narrative, please inform me. I want to write them. </p>
<p>I feel like even with the vaccines, there is HUGE DISCRIMINATION going on, pushing them on people no matter their medical background or risk and that is disgusting, and against sanity. This world has grown far more cruel for the disabled very fast. They don't give a crap about anyone's health.</p>

<p>This BS will end when we all grow a pair and start using the legal system to fight them just like they’ve done to us. We deserve equal access, a little social equity if you will.</p>
<p>In my community its half price books, in fact they tossed me out a couple weeks ago, despite a valid medical reason (recurrent sinus infections). Would love to have the time to go after them, and just might if they don’t drop their signs soon.</p>
<p>More importantly, I believe our waiters, bartenders, cashiers, etc should be able to choose for themselves, and Im ready to see smiles again.</p>

        <p>Well I work retail and I am very lucky my job allows me to wear a shield. I had some Karen today who was all "You know, you need to be wearing a mask with that". I told her "This is what I can do". She said "It isn't safe". I said "Wearing an actual mask would be a risk". She muttered some other comment. Luckily the one other more conservative coworker asked me what her problem was. </p>
<p>I do get some Karens, but people generally appreciate the shield because they see an actual face.</p>

        <p>It's exactly discrimination against the disabled. Had that exact experience with one of CVS' brownshirts (literally was BTW) when I asked if I could just get some water and Gatorade right quick and go. Guess what the answer was. Then again, I'm in an infamous pinko hellhole where muzzle and vax fanaticism are the state religion, so I don't know what I was expecting. </p>
<p>I was technically in the middle of a workout, so I decided not to bring up the disability that makes muzzling literal torture, so I just left to get it at a gas station that didn't give a fuck.</p>

Since disabled people have no choice but to pay these fees under policies like the one I mentioned, I consider these fees 'fines' for the 'crime' of being disabled.</p>
<p>In terms of wheelchair ramps, I was saying that if it's okay for stores to not allow disabled people in their stores as long as they have a website they can use, wouldn't this mean it would be okay for them to not build wheelchair ramps and to remove their handicapped parking, by this logic?</p>

        <p>Your articles from September 2019, and I have no idea where you got the idea that a vast majority of grocery stores charged for curbside, because it certainly isn't listed in that article.</p>
<p>Regardless that isn't the case nowadays. Every municipality and state has an access for persons with disability act, and they don't differ very much.  All people with disabilities must have reasonable accommodations made for them to access a business.  Building wheelchair ramps and having automatic doors, emergency signaling lighting and auditory signals, Braille menus etc etc are all legally defined reasonable accommodations.  This assumes that the coronavirus is real and that is passed between people's respiratory systems, which is a separate debate from the legality of disability Acts, but assuming the aforementioned mentioned things the reasonable accommodation for a person who cannot wear a mask is to provide them with online and curbside pickup options.  That means that legally if you ask a person not to wear a mask in the store and they cannot due to a medical condition then they must provide curbside for free.  This is the law, there is no slippery slope.</p>

        <p>My argument isn't 'Because they made a policy banning people with certain disabilities from shopping in-person, they're going to remove their wheel chair ramps and handicapped parking.'. Rather, I am taking things that the vast majority of my audience agrees would be immoral or otherwise objectionable (ie removing handicapped stalls) and arguing that this new policy is objectionable for the same reasons why those policies would be immoral.  I'm saying that not allowing someone into my store because she has a respiratory illness that I'm unwilling to accommodate is the same thing as me not building a wheelchair ramp for people who cannot walk, my justification being "Well I offer online options, so I'm not discriminating.".</p>

        <p>Yeah, but not believing that the coronavirus is a thing isn't a legal thing.  I'm not arguing that in a sub like this, it is what it is.  The equivalent would be not having to accommodate a disabled person with an 8 foot wide medical bed in your grocery store.  It's an unreasonable expectation.  Keep in mind that "reasonable" is a quantifiable legal term.  Since States and municipal boards universally except that coronavirus is real and is spread through respiratory systems this is not an unreasonable expectation.  You can disagree with them but that does not give you legal standing nor does it increase the chances of disabled people being discriminated against.  Unless you are arguing that absolutely every single disability and every piece of modified equipment must be accommodated by all businesses at all times then this is within the morals and ethics of the laws that have been developed over the last 100 years to serve disabled people.  Would you allow a person in a grocery store with their emotional support bison?  No.  You may not even see support animals for emotional reasons as a valid disability.  But if you argue that people who cannot wear masks during a respiratory pandemic must not only the accommodated but without modification because of their personal beliefs and feelings then you have to also argue for the emotional support bison because legally that is based off their personal beliefs and feelings.</p>
<p>However if State municipal boards are convinced that masks are completely and totally unnecessary by some legal definition then your argument has some merit.  Until then though your personal feelings are not creating an ethical crisis for the disabled.  There are plenty of things to get angry about, I don't think this is one of them.</p>
