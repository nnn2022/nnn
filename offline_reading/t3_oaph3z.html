    <strong>Walked around an airport with no mask and no one said anything to me</strong>
    <p><p>I was in LAX (los angeles international airport) and PDX (portland international airport) (possibly the 2 most Left leaning cities lol) and took off my mask after I went through the TSA security line and not one person said a word to me about wearing a mask.</p>
<p>While waiting in line for the shuttle, I didnt have my mask on and 4-5 airport employees were around the shuttle line as well and not one of them told me to put on my mask (I was the first in line and they could have easily said something).  No one said anything about wearing a mask while I was in the ~~packed~~ shuttle as well. Also, I was walking to the baggage claim in PDX and walked right past 2 airport police officers as they were standing around and neither of them said anything.</p>
<p>So much for all the ''It is required by federal law to wear a mask while inside the airport.'', I saw those signs posted on the entries/exits of the airport, yet no airport employee/police officer enforced it.</p>
<p>Side note: I saw a total of 4 other people not wearing masks (2 in PDX 2 in LAX). I was surprised to see people not wearing their masks while waiting around at their gate, it was maybe 10%, but I was still surprised.</p>

        <p>You're playing with fire.  <em>Everyone</em> knows that the virus is more deadly in an airport than it is at Walmart.  And it gets even stronger after 10pm.</p>

        <p>Everyone takes off their mask to eat and drink the snacks and drinks they give you on the plane, but you better put it <em>right</em> back on after you're done! All while being shoulder to shoulder with 120 other people. If people just thought about it for literally 30 seconds they would see how silly it is, but most people are followers and not leaders.</p>

        <p>This was about 5 days ago, I'm not too sure when this Delta/Delta Plus talk started, but I'd definitely do it again. The worst an employee will say is ''can you please put on your mask?''. I highly doubt anyone waiting to catch their flight will say anything.</p>

        <p>Yep same here, they're ridiculous about it. On a MEA flight all the attendants were dressed as surgeons, gloves, 2-3 masks, those weird blue scrub like suits...it was nuts</p>

        <p>The flight attendants union were the ones that lobbied to extend the mask mandate last time. They'll do the same in September. It gives them power, and they can reduce drink and food service, so they do less work.</p>
