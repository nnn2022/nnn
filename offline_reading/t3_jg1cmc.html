    <strong>"Seriously lock everything down this time, except for..."</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing this <strong>a lot.</strong> The whole gaslighting around why we are still not allowed to do 'fun' things anymore, followed by their empty justification and finger-pointing: "had we SERIOUSLY locked down before we would be fine now, but no one wanted to listen," which we know is complete bullocks but I digress. So we already know that these people defend tyrannical measures, but I've noticed something that really puts their solution to shame. They almost 100% of the time say, "close everything this time, except for..." followed by some service they could easily take care of themselves at home for 2 weeks had they applied themselves. Its usually food delivery for some reason. Sounds like <em>they're</em> not serious if they can't give up DoorDash for two weeks and tend to never address the fact that other people work to make and deliver their food so I guess those lives don't matter? No one cared for the medical staff who were losing their jobs while they were clapping for "healthcare heroes" every night, so shut them down too. You can wait 2 weeks to get your ADHD medication prescription, its a sacrifice for everyone, but you're saving lives! Or, even better, plan ahead! Grocery shop workers? Stock up for the lockdown, it's only for two weeks, and those people should have the chance to "stop the spread" too. The list of examples goes on. Every time I see that "except for" it drives me nuts, it really shows how ignorant they are to how the world works. But now I think I will reply with this rant. The generation that loves to make you "check your privilege" at every turn is really showing their true colors and it will be magnificent when everyone sees the bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>we could this time try to put the government and mainstream media under 2 weeks lockdown (I mean, 7 months), and let the rest of the country to get on with the life. just to see what happen, it could possibly have better outcome at the end :)</p>

        <p>This would be perfect! If we stopped testing and paying attention to the 24-7 propaganda, this whole thing would go away overnight and nobody would know the difference.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have a friend from grad school that chastised me for going to dinner with a friend, but it was totally Ok for her teenage stepdaughter to be playing a contact sport.  It’s classic ‘what I do is the exception’</p>

        <p>These are the same people who will suddenly want to go out for a politically acceptable protest and if you dare point out the legal and health rammications, they will label you as a white supremaist or trump supporter because dying of covid from a protest is morally better than dying of covid for any other reason</p>

        <p>I think that’s when a lot of people started to wake up. You have to be a special kind of stupid to believe that going to a wedding with more than 50 people will kill you but going to a protest of 5,000 strangers is totally fine</p>
