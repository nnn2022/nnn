    <strong>Voting in UK, didn't wear mask</strong>
    <p><p>Me and my partner just went to the polling station and didn't wear one, people working in there didn't ask any questions or make any comments, two of the people working and who spoke to us weren't wearing a mask. Yet there's a big sign on the door saying you have to wear one, no mention of 'unless exempt', no doubt creating anxiety for people who might be thinking of not wearing one.</p>
<p>Anyone else experience similar today in the UK? I have to admit I felt anxious beforehand, was quite surprised at the fact no one said a thing.</p>
<p>Felt like not having my mask on was a bigger vote than the actual vote itself.</p></p>

        <p>Yeh, most people don't say anything, just as long as you don't get rude, impose your ideas or interact. </p>
<p>If they ask, smile and say "no thanks" and just carry on. </p>
<p>Most people have voted for fear, so sometimes it might feel like you're the only one. 
The biggest secret is: Most people wearing masks are just complying and probably wish they were as brave as you.</p>

        <p>I just didn't bother to vote for the first time in decades. Really what's the point? The options are worthless tosspot Tories (up until the lockdown I was a Tory card holder), even worse Labour that will just demand more restrictions, the unliberal undemocratic LibDems or throwing your vote away.</p>

        <p>I know exactly what you mean. I voted differently for the first time ever and was very close to not voting at all. I felt incredibly disillusioned. I normally walk out after voting feeling some level of hope.</p>
