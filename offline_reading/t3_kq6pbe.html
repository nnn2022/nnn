        <p>Actually yes: You were lucky because according to doctors now about 25% of the populace who catch CoVid-19 have what they call "Moderate symptoms" which include heart pain due to the virus attacking the heart, severe high blood pressure spikes, the virus attacking your kidneys, etc.</p>
<p>Yes, it is for those under 50 a 99.97% survivable virus but there is a difference between 'survivable' and 'totally without lasting effects'.</p>
<p>Vascular damage due to viruses is common... I won't deny that. However the vascular damage that they are finding in some people who had CoVid-19 (about 5% of them according to my primary care doctor) is serious damage that will take a long time period of up to a year to heal, if it heals.</p>
<p>All this said: Lockdowns and masking were not the properly way to combat this virus. What would have been? Care packages to citizens with the immune building vitamins and minerals that so many of us today run perpetually low on.</p>

<p>"we surveyed a cohort of 100 critically ill icu patients that had no prior scans to verify the damage we found was caused recently, not to mention they were fighting 12 other things any of which could also have been the culprit."</p>

        <p>A Reddit account is not a source. As for what you linked as the second reference, an experimental population of 100 people is not a good sample size. </p>
<p>The median age is also 49, well into the age bracket for emerging symptoms of heart disease and the like. </p>
<p>I appreciate you linking an actual study, but the sample size and median age alone leads me to believe that there isn’t much in the way of Covid causing cardiovascular issues on a serious enough level</p>

<p>&rt;    an experimental population of 100 people is not a good sample size.</p>
<p>Then what is a good enough sample size for you?</p>
<p>&rt;    The median age is also 49</p>

<p>That’s a wild conclusion to make. “I don’t like this evidence so Covid definitely doesn’t cause heart issues.” Do you understand how dumb that sounds? </p>
<p>All the while, you’re ignoring the fact that this study matches <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7487338/">what we already know about the disease</a>.</p>

        <p>A good experimental population for a cohort study like this should be in the thousands. Similarly, the population should have a varied age distribution to see if there is indeed a correlation between the variables which I didn’t see happening here. </p>
<p>As for my conclusion, it isn’t dumb. I’m using the data that you provided to draw it. The study only uses 100 patients with a median age of 49. With something like 60% of the German population being overweight, I highly doubt that Covid is causing these cardiovascular issues. </p>
<p>Think about it logically. Contracting and fighting off a virus takes several weeks right? If that depending on the hosts health. Becoming overweight and developing heart issues is something that takes years of shitty diets and lack of exercise. As per the study a majority of the subjects recovered at home indicating a very mild infection in the first place. </p>
<p>After rereading it, I noticed that they make no mention of the structure and age distribution of the control group. So unless I’m missing something here, I do not trust the results of this study very much.</p>

<p>Really?  You have a source that verifies this statement?  Because I'm quite sure that you can't prove that every single cardiologist in the world would agree that covid has been the cause of all the heart complications attributed to it.  I'd be really surprised in fact.  So if you can prove that all of the cardiologists in the world agree that covid really did in fact cause all of the heart diseases that you say it did, I'll change my belief.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that even before Covid-19, heart disease has been killing, on average, 650,000 people each year.  Just keep that in mind before you start giving covid credit for something that's been happening without it for a long time.</p>

        <p>Even if this virus was worse than that, lockdowns and masks are still not the answer!</p>
<p>-Care packages to the vulnerable with info, vitamins, and other preventives!  <br>
-Make it easy for them to stay home!  <br>
-Give them stipends for having to miss work instead of the general public!  <br>
-Make sure they are getting food delivered!    </p>
<p>And they are not forced to do this either! If they decide they aren’t worried about risk of catching the virus they can go about their lives as normal.</p>
