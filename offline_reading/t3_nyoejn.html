    <strong>Pastors who were previously strongly against these vaccines, now changing their tune</strong>
    <p><p>I spend a lot of time in church circles, and I've noticed a worrying trend lately.</p>
<p>A lot of Christian ministers were spent the whole of 2020 telling their congregations to be discerning and wary of the Great Reset and these dangerous jabs, are now preaching "it's a private decision" or "matter of conscience". Some are actively encouraging their congregations to get it.</p>
<p>It's a complete 180.</p>
<p>I think they're caving to government and societal pressure. It's a really sad thing to see and is going to leave a lot of believers feeling total despair and isolation.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced this?</p></p>

        <p>Yup. Being a tax write off equates to being in the same pocket with politicians and the government. To put a play on the famous Christian saying, “The government giveth tax write offs and the government taketh them.”</p>

        <p>I unfortunately feel that many of those, such as pastors or talkIng heads that have reversed their stance on vaccines, were only soapboxing during the pandemic in the first place. Just doing it to make a name for themselves or bring light to their causes or churches.</p>

        <p>The church has been infected by leftists and the woke cult. You wil see alot of pastors just regurgitate the marxist party line.</p>

        <p>Yes, I worked in my church's childcare program...something I've been doing since my teens, even though I am no longer an active church member....just kind of a refreshing change from my 9-5. I was told that in order to come back, I needed to be fully vaccinated, even though the prior sentiment was that it was a personal choice. Not surprisingly, members who are just attending services are not required to be vaccinated, which leads me to believe there is an incentive-similar to the ones in place for flu shots at medical facilities-for them to mandate the vaccine for employees. </p>
<p>I think it's so much deeper than just wanting people to feel "safe." Needless to say, I declined to come back.</p>

        <p>I experienced this as well. We were taught to be discerning. All sudden a pastor is telling me the vax is good for you and he is looking forward to the 2nd jab. </p>
<p>The last time i was at the church was to do some volunteer work. I have difficulties with wearing a mask without panicking (was smothered with a pillow as a kid and it freaks me out to feel fabric over my mouth). The pastor came by for a rare visit and told me i had to put a mask on. I refused and left the building. I feel isolated from the chuch now and won't go back</p>
<p>The only reason I can think this would be is either some churches are paid to support the vax or the pastors are succumbing to the fear spread on the news.</p>

        <p>Because they're cowards. They have the ability to be back in power if they juuussssttt listen to the rules.</p>
<p>They are not men of God, they are sevants of Satan. They are so diluted with their own desire for normalicy that they'll willingly abandon sense in favor of getting what they want.</p>

        <p>Mine said his dr told him not to get it. </p>
<p>I have spoken with him and anyone else who would listen, pleading that they would not take it. Some already had concerns. Ultimately, each of us stands or falls before God—what my brothers and sisters choose…I can’t control. </p>
<p>They will have to submit to God’s guidance, and ultimately that is what I plead with them to do—not to take my word, but His guidance.</p>
