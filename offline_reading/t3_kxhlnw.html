    <strong>The prevention is worse than the disease, and more permanent.</strong>
    <p><p>In English speaking countries, we show our faces to those we're interacting with. It is one of the cornerstones of our relatively high-trust societies that people take for granted and so do not realise what we will be giving up. I know how much we rely on cues from other peoples' facial expressions in order to get along relatively harmoniously. This permeates every single kind of <strong>face-to-face</strong> - the clue is in the name - interaction we have, big and small. From understanding that their faces may be remembered dissuading some who might otherwise commit criminal acts on the spur of the moment, to smiling to show that a potentially nasty comment is meant in fun and avoid a falling out, we need to see and show our faces to get by in the kind of societies that we have. If we give that up our societies will be infinitely the worse off.</p>
<p>Yes you can communicate without the lower face, and without words. Communication is resilient in sapient species. We can adapt to many impediments. Communication involves tone, cadence, breathing, facial expression, eye contact, eye movement and pupil dilation, the way someone is leaning and their angle relative to you, gestures, distance between participants, frequency of hesitation markers, detection of whether any of these things are being affected in the other person and many more besides.</p>
<p>We can absolutely cut off some of these things, leaving few or just one, and often still communicate. That doesn't mean that communication is not clearer, more optimised, and therefore objectively better when we don't. Almost everyone is aware of all of these small elements of communication on some level, and it's why in interactions where some are cut off such as over text, misunderstandings occur with much greater frequency.</p>
<p>In an extreme and probably untrue but interesting and favourite example of mine, since you mentioned Japan: it is the source of one of the more famous (alleged by the Japanese) disasters leading from a misunderstanding. The short version is that when the Allies demanded in no uncertain terms Japan's unconditional surrender, the Japanese response included a word I've borrowed from them quite frequently, "mokusatsu", which is a short and mellifluous word for refusing to deign to address something in an attempt to kill it by ostentatious, contemptuous, condescending starving it of attention. Some Japanese have since claimed that what was meant by PM Suzuki was that he withheld comment on the threat of the new weapon, and that lazy or poor translating by the Allies' translators is to blame for the woes of Hiroshima. It's a probably untrue story, but like all myths, it still contains lessons. For example, I bring it up because it's an example of how the possibly most stripped down method of communication humans have (translated text) is infinitely less preferable than a method with more potential for conveying meaning.</p>
<p>So no. I'm not wearing the mask and don't want anyone else to. Aside from the cultural damage (which I want to stress is not restricted to "optimal communication" - that is a digression from the intangible moral norm that in this country we show our faces), it's more hassle for everyone to get a clear and positive read on mask-wearers, and more hassle to make others see what I want them to see if I put one on, so it's not happening.</p>
<p>They're also a shifting of the burden of responsibility for one's health too far on to the collective than the individual. I believe in collectivization of healthcare - more than a lot of British people, even. You get people who want to see smokers or the obese paying extra for healthcare; I don't. There's a difference though between all of us paying into a system which is there to prevent unspeakable ugliness like occurs in the USA but which doesn't demand anything of us in our daily lives, and incorporating an inconvenient, uncomfortable, and socially detrimental shibboleth into our lives just to give an illusion of safety to people who aren't yet adjusted to life with a new kind of flu as a constant.</p>
<p>Managing your own risk of most illness is your own responsibility, as it always has been. Nobody thin wants to see sugar banned to help address the obesity epidemic, for that precise reason. In exactly the same way that managing your weight is your own responsibility and no one else is required to change to help you diet, managing your coronavirus risk is your problem. If we are allowed to normalise shaming and legislating people into massive lifestyle changes so that public healthcare can afford to continue, I would rather public healthcare not continue - it's there to increase freedoms and life choices, not remove them, and if that relationship turns on its head then public healthcare is unfit for purpose.</p>
<p>Let's not forget how many opportunities to be out and about, in public, outside of our own bubbles and property, are permanently gone due to the lockdowns too. Businesses which have saved fortunes (which won't be passed on to either employee or consumer, by the way) by moving everyone out of offices aren't going to embrace rent and utility bills and OSHA compliant rest facilities and liability insurance again. Gathering around the water cooler, knowing your colleagues, a pool of potential friends or at least drinking buddies, meeting your future spouse at the office - that's all gone for good, in a lot of cases. Liaising with your boss - that's now impersonal, done via a screen, and you're a fungible electronic resource to him now, not a human colleague with a face and a personality outside of contributions which make the spreadsheet figures go up.</p>
<p>Let's not pretend that it's temporary, either. Mask culture is already here to stay among certain sorts of people - at least until we ban them in public after some high-profile crime ends up not caught because the facial recognition tech doesn't agree with masks. The longer this "temporary" demand - which is being driven by a movement of people like you selling the mask as a socially responsible obligation, which is particularly difficult to undo once it is done - continues the more people will incorporate mask-wearing into their lives on a long term basis, forcing a horrible change to our society which involves treating everyone else as a biohazard, as evil for not wearing a mask, and being at a disadvantage in sharing jokes, detecting lies or sincerity or sympathy, or asserting yourself.</p>
<p>We've already been primed quite thoroughly to expect this plague or similar ones to be factors in our lives going forward, too. Covid-19 hasn't been given a proper name for a reason. There's been a lot of talk about it perhaps being seasonal, or mutating beyond the power of a single vaccine to exterminate. So that's another reason not to expect mask culture to go away any time soon. That's why we have to fight it.</p>
<p>The economic harms are bad enough, but /u/walkthepattern has talked about them at length in here. The places of business you may have frequented since childhood, shuttered. The year of disrupted, crucial early education for your children. Your own livelihoods decimated or completely gone - therefore your grandchildrens' chances too. These are nightmares, but I would rather have poor great-grandchildren than great-grandchildren who were raised never knowing that once we used to smile at strangers in our neighbourhoods.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think that would necessarily be an issue, but that's because I'm from the UK - I don't mind collectivised healthcare. It's less free than insurance, sure, but we're mostly fine with that as part of the cost of not letting anyone's grandmother choose between cancer treatment or leaving her home to the family. That is - it's fine as long as it's keeping people free to do what they want with their lives, not locking out life choices in the name of the collective purse.</p>
