        <p>My hubs and I were talking about this. I think they'll try to avoid putting Kamala in as long as they can since A) very few people like her, and B) she can't be controlled and isn't a puppet like he is. <br>
But I'd agree that his decline is steadily getting worse and worse. That last Q and A with all the whispering what pretty creepy. Along with ya know, telling Americans they don't need guns cuz he can just nuke us</p>

        <p>I think the big wake-up call would occur if people realize their social fabric breaks. It will start with permanent injury made to distant family members maybe (they won't care much). Then they'll realize lower quality of service in their day-to-day interactions (deliveries taking more time, less cashiers at supermarket, not able to find a plumber nor an electrician, etc.).</p>
<p>Only at this condition. If their core habits in life are not impacted, the cognitive dissonance will keep their feelings safe.</p>

        <p>Didn't Vaers say only about 1% of adverse effects are reported for any medication?</p>
<p>That means you have to multiply all these numbers by 100 to get the real data set, however that seems pretty high to me so lets give them the benefit of the doubt and only a 10x multiplication</p>
<p>That would mean at least 60k people dead in the US because of the vaccine... and that's just in the first 6 months, yikes.</p>

        <p>let me take the wild guess and say those numbers of deaths are entirely from AstraZeneca, if that's true, then you're pushing your shit to make your viewers think that not just AstraZeneca but all brands of the covid vaccine have a risk of blood clots and other forms of death</p>

        <p>Okay assuming some are false. How many people in real life do you think even know about VAERS? It hasn‚Äôt been advertised anywhere unlike every covid resource ever, so I‚Äôd conclude if every death and adverse reaction were posted the 6k death number would be much higher. And that‚Äôs only a couple months of vaccine rollout</p>
<p>Also take into account that medically there‚Äôs a much more strict definition to a vaccine death compared to a covid death, so a meaningful comparison can‚Äôt be made about both fatality rates</p>

        <p>VAERS has no strict definition of vaccine death. Reports can be submitted by anyone, they won‚Äôt require proof to accept it. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù involved. And you‚Äôre making a collection of assumptions that absolutely do not follow and also directly contradict the way that VAERS says their data should be used and interpreted. Additionally, VAERS is well-known among covid deniers and anti-vax folks bc it‚Äôs the only evidence they have. Who is to say fake reports aren‚Äôt being submitted by them to boost numbers? Since we know no details, we have no idea of number of fake reports (since VAERS has been aggressively publicized by anti-vax people recently), number of reports that are just things that happened to occur after the vaccine, etc etc. Again, anyone can submit one. No proof. No ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù like you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs a self-reported database that has been spread heavily among anti-vax people clearly already willing to lie about how VAERS works and how data is collected. And all of you are using the data in a way VAERS explicitly says not to BECAUSE it is a self-reported database that requires no proof.</p>

        <p>Vaccine or not people die everyday, of course when you have a millions of people in a population, some of those people are naturally going to die.  </p>
<p>Now if you compared these numbers to a similar population of people who didn't get the vaccine and the deaths were significantly higher, then that would be something to be concerned about, but just looking at these numbers doesn't really tell me anything.  </p>

        <p>Actually they don't say that, they say it's less, that doesn't mean %1. And also, I'm not arguing for the efficacy of the VAERS system. I don't think it's a good system, but I also don't know how it could be improved.  </p>
<p>They also say on the website "A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine."  </p>
<p>Lets break this down. That VAERS data represents about 3 months. </p>
<p>Every month, about 237,903 people die in the US and the US has a population of 328.2M people.</p>
<p>According to the statics from VAERS that we have, only about 1,997 vaccinated people die every month out of 151M who are vaccinated in the US.</p>
<p>EVEN IF we fudge the numbers and say that the VAERS system is under-reporting by 90%, meaning 19,970 died in a month after receiving the vaccination, that still means that the people who died after being vaccinated is 5X less than the average population (0.072% of total population died vs 0.013% of vaccinated people died).</p>

        <p>If you follow the math, less people have actually died who have gotten the vaccine than people overall. Meaning the people aren't dying from the vaccine, they're dying of normal causes.

        <p>What about the long term effects of the vaccine? A normal drug trial takes 8 - 15 years to determine the long term effects. And why is the UK preparing for massive deaths coming in the future?</p>
<p>"The Authority seeks to procure a framework agreement for temporary body storage in the event of an excess deaths situation for the 32 London boroughs and the City of London, led by Westminster City Council. The framework agreement will appoint a single provider and will be for a period of 4 years. This will be a contingency contract, only called upon in the event that an excess deaths situation arises in the future and existing local body storage capacity needs to be augmented.<br>
The over-arching aim of this tender is to provide a single framework supplier that will be able to provide temporary body storage facilities to house deceased in the event of an excess deaths situation. The deceased will be stored with dignity and respect, at locations to be determined based on local London needs at the time and will require some design elements to accommodate local site conditions and constraints, while being capable of rapid deployment, construction and commissioning to an agreed standard. This framework will be procured by the Authority as the pan-London lead, but all London local authorities may call-off against the framework."</p>

        <p>The only thing from the vaccine that stays with you relatively long term is the antibodies. You get these same antibodies when you contract the virus, except when you contract the virus you get a whole bunch of other antibodies that may or may not cause issues down the road.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not familiar with the infrastructure thing in London. My guess is that they saw how unprepared they were and other places were for the virus and they‚Äôre trying to make sure if anything else like that happens in the future, they‚Äôll be prepared.</p>

        <p>It is impossible to know the long term medical effects because the study was not long term. This is why they follow the trial participants with pharmacovigilance to gather as much data to determine if the vaccine is safe, for a period of 10 - 15 years. You can take this spike toxin and I encourage your whole family.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, you don't know the long term effects, but if the choice is between getting a bunch of unknown antibodies from COVID that have been shown to potentially cause mental disorders, or just a few antibodies that have at least been studied in the short term (which is when negative outcomes tend to happen) the logical choice is the less risky one, which is the vaccine. And yes, I've taken it and my whole family has, as well, and none of us have had bad reactions.</p>

        <p>"Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. <br>
Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. <br>
Result: The NNTV is between 200‚Äì700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11 per 100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination. <br>
Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy."</p>

        <p>That study suffers from the same fallacy that I just explained. <br>
You can't just use the raw data of people who died after getting the vaccines, you have to use the discrepancy between the natural death ratio and the ratio of death after vaccination, which is actually negative, like I showed before.<br>
What that study is basically saying is that because people die from non-vaccine related causes, they shouldn't be vaccinated. That's absurd, because those people were going to die vaccine or not.</p>

Until then your words have absolutely zero backing.

        <p>I'm sorry. Are you saying you need me to type out the math for you? Do you not know how to do simple cross-multiplication? I mean I can give you a lesson in math if you want...</p>
<p>19,970/151,000,000 = x/100 (where x is the percentage)</p>
<p>So, 19,970*100 = 1,997,000 then 1,997,000/151,000,000 = 0.013%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is an inflated number, because you said you thought the VAERS numbers were 99% under reported, so these numbers represent the VAERS numbers for one month (original number/3 because the VAERS numbers were collected over 3 months) multiplied by 10.  </p>
<p>You can use the same formula I gave above for the overall population, and then compare the rate of death (percentage of population that died in one month.)</p>

That means that if a vaccinated person drowns, gets in a car crash, is struck by lightning, or OD‚Äôs on Fox News, their death must be reported to VAERS as an adverse event. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have been vaccinated and many deaths will occur coincidentally after vaccination.</p>

        <p>How come people who died in an accident 30 days after getting a positive covid test (even if they were asymptomatic and needed the covid test for their job or for travel), their deaths were marked down as covid deaths?</p>
<p>Interesting how you want to apply that COINCIDENCE; CORRELATION NOT CAUSATION logic to the ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù, but not to covid.</p>
<p>Hypocrite.</p>

        <p>Sounds a lot like how covid deaths were reported. You know, if someone died from a car accident or a heart attack but had Covid in their system that somehow counts as a covid death.</p>

        <p>Yet, VAERs states on every page that it‚Äôs a federal offense if you lie. Also takes about 30 minutes or longer to fill out a report</p>
