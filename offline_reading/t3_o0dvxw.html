        <p>Thanks for the source, but I'm not seeing where he is declaring himself a "Socialist". He's outlining some legitimate criticisms against our system of capitalism in the US, but he's not suggesting that "Socialism" is the answer. He's actually saying Communism isn't the answer either.   </p>
<p>"And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis.”  </p>
<p>My original point is that MLK's message of enacting change through peaceful protest and civil disobedience was not widely embraced. Many people who supported the Civil Rights movement felt that his efforts were not extreme enough. Plenty of people simply wanted an eye for an eye, and you're seeing the exact same sentiment among those allegedly "seeking racial equity" today. I wish the man was alive today, we need someone like him to unite people instead of the extreme division that leads to censorship/bans from other subreddits  for participating in a conversation.</p>

        <p>Levying criticisms against capitalism is basically the crux of the umbrella of socialism as ideologically it exists as a response to capitalism. It is not exclusive to communism. A ‘synthesis’ of socialism and capitalism would inherently be socialistic (comparable to Bernie Sander’s platform). The degree of which would vary however from social democracies to market socialism. Either way he wanted socioeconomics to shift considerably to the left.</p>

        <p>That's where we disagree. Today's leftist policies are purely Marxist, which is responsible for massive genocide. There's no way that MLK would advocate for those failed policies. Sorry, the guy was a Christian, not a Marxist. </p>
<p>What I'm understanding from his quotes is that he had a problem with America's economic disparity. A criticism of our economic policies does not equate to an endorsement of Marxism, Socialism, or Communism which are all the exact same thing. If the private ownership of property is outlawed, you have a tyrannical government. It doesn't appear that ANYONE has a better solution than Capitalism as it's practiced today.</p>

        <p>What leftist policies are you referring to? Equating Socialism, Communism, and Marxism as all the same is disingenuous. There are clearly very different schools of thought when it comes to socialism ranging from anarchical or libertarian to more centralized forms of organization.</p>
<p>Also Christian socialism is very much a thing. Religion and socialism are not mutually exclusive.</p>

        <p>You can call them different if you want, but governments that institute "Socialism" or "Marxism" or "Communism" make the private ownership of property illegal. And then they kill everyone they don't agree with. It happened in the USSR, it happened in China, it happened in Southern Asia, it happened in Germany and so on. </p>
<p>Do you have a better, more concise definition of the difference between Capitalism and Socialism, Communism, or Marxism? It's very clearly when the government outlaws the ownership of private property. If you can own property and the government can't take it, then that's a form of Capitalism. Capitalism needs some rules, and we're certainly living in a form of Capitalism that is omega corrupted, but that does not mean we need to relive the hell of the 20th century just cuz "cap is bad so socialism is good".</p>

        <p>Yes I do but you can never really encapsulate complex economic theories in concise definitions. Socialism is an umbrella term for a more collectivized approach to society. Communism is a form in which private property (not personal property) and monetization of commodities would be abolished. Capitalism is a system in which private individuals with capital own the means of production. Market socialism is socialism in which a market system isn’t abolished but key industries such as healthcare would be nationalized and ownership would be collectivized with coops. Marxism is a way of analyzing and critiquing the current political economy through dialectal materialism. But you will not learn about socialism from me. I used to believe the same as you until I really started investigating what socialism means to people outside of America. </p>
<p>And if communism will never work, then why did America try so hard to stop it? You realize that everything you know about socialism has been taught to you through American institutions? The same institutions that are controlled by capitalists. If anyone kills people they don’t agree with, it’s America. Look at Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties and for what? Vietnamese communists literally just wanted their country back from the Western colonizers who had stripped Vietnam from its resources and after the Vietnamese defeated the French, the US decided that it was it’s duty to enter a foreign country and gun down poor rice farmers.</p>
<p>Socialism is trying to build a better society after capitalism. Building a new society in a world where it threatens the power of capitalists is going to require violence in order to build that society. Capitalists control the world, they control the narrative. Of course you’re going to believe communist nations are nothing but murderous regimes, and fail to recognize that your cushy life in America is the result of America being a murderous regime itself.</p>

        <p>I was taught nothing about Socialism by American institutions. I educated myself on the history of the USSR and other Marxist governments. I can assure you that communism didn't fail because America stopped it, it fails all by itself. It failed, for example, right at the beginning of the USSR during the Holodomor, and continued to fail again and again with genocidal results. Our Capitalist society is far from perfect, but with the other forms of government we've discussed the power is too concentrated in the hands of the government. It corrupts absolutely. So no, I'm not buying the lie that Communism or Socialism or Marxist influenced ANYTHING can succeed if we just leave it alone. Maybe at the beginning of the 20th century I could have been convinced, but there's too much history in the books at this point. They're all fundamentally murderous at heart and have never turned out otherwise. Better off dead than red.</p>

        <p>Where has it failed by itself? There never has been an instance in which the influence of outside capitalist forces didn’t bring the downfall of socialist experiments. Also you didn’t educate yourself on shit if you’ve only read blog articles on the history of the USSR. If you really want to be educated, I would start with actually reading Marx directly and forming your critiques directly from his work. Not by taking tidbits from other people’s opinions.</p>
<p>In fact if you are so confident about your knowledge about the failures of socialism, I would love to see you battle out your ideas in r/debatecommunism. History is written by the victors, and those who are victorious aren’t those who are just. Just those who have bigger guns.</p>

        <p>Hurdurrrr 1984. How about you read some real economic theory like Capital instead of fiction books? Even Solzhenitsyn’s wife admitted it was more lore than historical fact. http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/06/world/natalya-reshetovskaya-84-is-dead-solzhenitsyn-s-wife-questioned-gulag.html  Even then America has the highest incarceration rate in the history of the world and they certainly don’t refrain from torture and the use of slave labor. Statistically you’re more likely to be imprisoned in America than you would be in the Soviet Union.</p>

        <p>False appeal to credibility. You can’t accept one anecdotal account and reject the other.</p>
<p>If anyone is brainwashed, it is the one who wants to fight and die for an ideology that makes billionaires oligarchs. Sorry pal, but if you never really do true investigation on the motivations of Socialists by reading their literature, anything you say about their claims will be invariably wrong.</p>

        <p>I would genuinely like to answer your question in good faith. I completely hate the USSR and China. What you're describing, the government owning private property, is state capitalism. That is also what China currently is.</p>
<p>First of all private property in the marxian sense only relates to the means of production like a factory. Under socialism, your house or the things you own are more classified as personal property.</p>
<p>In my mind, the goal of socialism wouldn't be to make it "illegal", but to make it so all the workers own the factory equally and can vote on the decision-making together, resulting in more freedom.
Also it would mean a welfare state in which the basic needs are met and gives everyone equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Communism is a completely stateless, moneyless, classless society.</p>
<p>The reason people advocate for this instead of regulated capitalism is because at the root of the issue will always remain. Millionaires and billionaires will be able to basically hold people hostage since they can simply move somewhere else if politicians dare make life better for workers in your state, and they will find ways to corrupt the restrictions you put in place constantly making you go one step forward and two steps backwards.</p>
<p>If you can already agree they have an agenda, why defend their existence?</p>

        <p>&rt;If MLK Jr. was still alive, y’all would have denounced him for being a socialist.</p>
<p>I don't need him to be alive for that, bucko.</p>
<p>Besides the fact of the matter is the legislation he helped cause is in fact unconstitutional, and was ultimately unneeded to ease racial tensions. They were easing anyway, he just helped herald in some regulation that trampled on some people's rights on the way along.</p>
<p>It's like how people will point out that the assault weapons ban in the 90s reduced crime.. but in fact, violent crime was already declining beforehand and continued to decline after the ban lifted.</p>
<p>MLK ultimately did more bad than good because we're obviously to the point where the civil rights act isn't helping anyone at all anymore, but it's still there and has the potential for abuse.</p>

        <p>okay I admit that ones on me for not specifying: </p>
<p>they make you wear clothing in public right? because that is basically public dress code if you’ll think of it that way. it’s essentially amending the dress code so that you don’t give everyone covid and kill them. and the best part is? it fucking works and if everyone actually does it, it won’t last as long</p>

        <p>No it doesn't, mask wearing actually spreads diseases. Masks don't stop viruses either, it even says this on the box they come in.</p>
<p>Places with no mask mandate have comparable infection rates to places that do.</p>

        <p>The virus is tiny, much much smaller than the holes in your mask, and that's for a medical mask - not a bandana, snood or a bit of fabric with daisies on it like many people wear. Masks do not stop viruses, that's why in virus labs they don't wear them, they wear plastic bubble suits with positive pressure and an air supply.</p>
<p>They spread diseases, including covid, because if you just stand and watch crowds of people wearing them you will see - they are constantly touching them, adjusting them, taking them off, stuffing them in a pocket.</p>
<p>Now the inside of the mask is compromised, their hands, pocket, anything they touch, and anything they put in that pocket from now on. People wear the same mask over and over, meaning it gets hours and even days worth of wear time.  </p>
<p>Its just basic common sense, as you put it.</p>

        <p>Speaking of logical fallacies, perhaps you should look up "ad hominem".  </p>
<p>I didnt say we were living under the Taliban either, so you should also look up "strawman fallacy" while you are at it.  </p>
<p>Dictating you must wear clothing items without proper scientific evidence for it is tyranny. So is locking people up under house arrest despite them committing no crime.</p>
