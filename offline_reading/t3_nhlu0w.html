    <strong>Data of bad outcomes risk: Unvaccinated &lt; one dose &lt; double dose &lt; booster shots</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://de.rt.com/meinung/117756-geimpfte-covid-19-tote-und-geheime-pcr-tests/">https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://de.rt.com/meinung/117756-geimpfte-covid-19-tote-und-geheime-pcr-tests/</a></p>
<p>The article claims 36 million vaccine doses given in Germany. We use 24 M one-dosers and 6 M two-dosers, it's close enough to the actual ratio  (77% to 23%). With that division it follows that:</p>
<p>In 1-dosers, one in 544 got covid, one in 5260 got hospitalized due covid, and one in 11735 died of covid</p>
<p>In 2-dosers, one in 458 go covid, one in 3616 got hospitalized due covid, and one in 9063 died of covid</p>
<p>First of all, these are very high numbers. Higher than risks for unvaccinated people. But more importantly, show that double dosers have higher risk than one dosers.</p>
<p>Sure may be for various reasons like double vaccinating risk groups first, but  that is just an assumption, not a proven fact. Just as viable assumption is that vaccine increases mortality. We do not know which one is real, or if the reason is something else.</p>
<p>Risk for unvaccinated is not included here but is readily available from many places.</p>
<p>Risk for booster shots is conjecture to make the title more 'cathcy'</p></p>
