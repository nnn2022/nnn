    <strong>How is covid affecting your lives?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm curious.   It's affected my life worse than anything else.  My entire way of life was changed.  I used to go to several concerts a week. A handful of music festivals a year. Move around regularly and find a new social network within days.</p>
<p>Covid restrictions took all of that from me.</p>
<p>Besides having to wear a mask, what's changed for you to get y'all so upset?</p></p>

        <p>As I've said before, I am used to have a difficult life. I have faced a lot of challenging situations. But I've never felt like this.</p>
<p>This is a true nightmare. Not being able to plan anything. Everyone insulting you because you refuse to let fear control you. Everyone thinking you are crazy because you say the economy cannot be shut down without horrible consequences. This is madness.</p>
<p>And then your mental health deteriorating rapidly. I had been depressed before. I have had anxiety before. This is 1,000,000 times worse. I haven't slept well in 8 months. My sex drive is practically gone. Sometimes I want to scream. Sometimes I just want to die.</p>
<p>I feel so sad and powerless.</p>

        <p>Damn, that's rough.</p>
<p>Most of your struggles with it are internal, then?</p>
<p>Has the economy really been shit down where you are?</p>
<p>On the west coast it was only 1 month, and then minor stuff like gym showers, movies, concerts and such.  </p>
<p>I've really noticed very minimal change in other people's behavior other than mask wearing and keeping distance when in lines.</p>
<p>Even in bars, the mask wearing isn't even really that enforced (mind you, I have mainly stayed in very liberal cities in liberal states). Though, outside dining is more of a thing.</p>
<p>My main annoyance is that I wish these places would just keep the door or window cracked open to let the fresh air in.</p>
<p>I was just in a laundromat and there wasn't much ventilation at all.  Ugh</p>
<p>Oh, wait.   I was just in Sacramento and while I did venture downtown, only at night, there weren't too many places open, mainly restaurants and nightlife ended at 10pm.</p>
<p>But it's all going to be over soon.two vaccines with near perfect scores.  Next summer will be back to the old normal!</p>

        <p>Can't go to concerts. Can't go to movies. Can't even buy groceries without butterflies in my stomach. I'm a filmmaker who can't make films. Can't do my hobbies. Can't go a couple of nights without nightmares. Can't meet new people (and since I'm new to my area, I'm extremely lonely). Can't meet and flirt with girls since they're all faceless IRL (and since I don't have a stupid smartphone/dating apps, I'm sexually abstinent). Can't go to pubs or karaoke. Can't go to festivals and historical reenactments. Couldn't go to Halloween events (my favourite holiday). Can't stop thinking about suicide. Can't get over a crippling anxiety of the dystopian future. Can't find any real reason to continue living, other than a stubborn reptile-brained refusal to give up.</p>
<p>This sucks...</p>

        <p>Dude, I can relate to you, totally.</p>
<p>How the fuck do you connect with strangers without seeing their faces? I think I miss that the most out of everything.  A smile and nod is just a fucking nod. It sucks.  Everyone is so emotionally distant because of that, I couldn't imagine living the rest of my life like this.  I don't think I'd want to.</p>
<p>I got over the anxiety of the virus months ago, the initial phase of reading the news about it in China, then it comes here, then it starts spreading, that shit had me freaked.</p>
<p>I quit my job in Phoenix and drove to Eastern Washington, Spokane, because if there's going to be a plague, motherfucker I'm going to get in the thick of it!</p>
<p>I've just been moving around like I always do, spend a few months working in a city and then move along.</p>
<p>It's so thought though, I'm afraid of what other areas are like with the unemployed people and the job demand.</p>
<p>I've actually seen a lot of jobs that ask for resumes!  Resumes!  Fuck.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worked since March, the industry I had worked so hard to break into the past year and half completely shut down and it doesn’t look like it’s coming back any time soon. The ski resort job that I can normally count on as extra money is up in the air. This time last year I had already been through instructor training and was getting ready to start teaching. I don’t even have an offer for this upcoming season yet. </p>
<p>My daughter is highly special needs and home schooling has been a nightmare. This system is not designed for ppl like her. My mental health is completely going to shit and none of the things I normally do to stabilize it are working. </p>
<p>And for what exactly? To protect a group of ppl who if you asked them would rather see their families then be locked down? My parents are in the high risk group and they still would rather see their kids then be without us for the holidays. Did anyone even ask grandma and grandpa if they wanted this? </p>
<p>Sorry rant over, it’s been a tough bunch of months</p>

        <p>It's not COVID that's affecting our lives, it's the random, harmful, nonsensical restrictions that are imposed on us.</p>
<p>I miss going to bars and restaurants, just sitting outside with a beer and watching people. People, not masked zombies.</p>

        <p>My kids missed a big chunk of school, which was awful for all of us. We were trapped at home almost 24/7. Thankfully my area lifted many restrictions, restaurants are open again and my kids are back in school. However there's always the threat, for lack of a better word, that the schools will close again if my area gets too many new cases. I already have anxiety and the thought of going back to online school makes me feel crazy. My kids hated it and so did I. My non verbal asd son benefits greatly from going to school and this lockdown set him back.</p>
<p>I can't go certain places because my 3 year old won't wear a mask and I've been harassed by employees before because of it. So places I used to enjoy going to, I can't go anymore.</p>
<p>My favorite thing I look forward to every year, ren fest, was cancelled because of this shit. I might sound whiny but as a mom of 3 I already don't get to go do a lot of stuff that I enjoy. Now it's like what little I do get to go enjoy was taken away. If biden gets his way and we have another lockdown I'm going to lose my mind. Again I'm living in fear and anxiety of the threat of a lockdown.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being brainwashed into almost feeling guilty if I don't wear a mask in public. It feels so unnatural. So I said fuck it and didn't wear a mask when I was grocery shopping the other day. I never thought I'd feel rebellious simply for not covering my face. It felt good though. I noticed there are more and more people doing that. I hope it keeps going that way.</p>
