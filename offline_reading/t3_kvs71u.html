    <strong>New lockdown in China and its meaning</strong>
    <p><p>"If everyone wore masks and observed quarantine measures, it would have been over long ago. Look at China! They have already returned to normal life!" One often hears this from bourgeois propagandists, from paid "experts" and from "simpletons who out of stupidity or by force of habit defend views prevalent in certain bourgeois circles", to quote Lenin from his article "Who benefits?". Bad news, people: in China, millions have once again been put in fascist "quarantine" and again in the country's largest industrial center, Hebei Province. Schools are closed, public transport isn't working properly. In some residential areas, journals of comings and goings have been introduced to keep track of who left home and how many times. In some neighborhoods, only one family member can leave the apartment at a time and only every other day. This will for sure lead to mass weakening of the immune system and rise in respiratory infections. Just what the fraudsters need.</p>
<p>Giant masses of people are being tested right outside in the street or in empty pavilions/warehouses, using PCR, not designed, as we know, for diagnosing diseases (according to its inventor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLU4Udx5XYM&amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLU4Udx5XYM&amp;t=2s</a>). Pseudoscientific results are declared to be the "growing number of cases". Martial law has been imposed in the capital of Hebei province. People are being intimidated by sirens, loudspeakers and hysterics in the media. Some plants and factories are put in "quarantine" and production is stopped, others continue to operate. <a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2174473-hebei-limits-steel-logistics-amid-new-covid19-outbreak">https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2174473-hebei-limits-steel-logistics-amid-new-covid19-outbreak</a></p>
<p>Basically, it's just like last time with Wuhan. The same thing is happening - people are not getting paid for months, they are being kicked out and laid off, and all under the pretext of "coping with the damage caused by the coronavirus". DEFINITELY NOT BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS caused by the internal contradictions of the capitalist way of production that led to massive oversupply and the need to slow down/stop the production process. Definitely not because of that, no. It's all the mighty virus's fault. </p>
<p>Back in February, Bloomberg wrote that "China's private companies have no money to pay their workers." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/chinese-companies-say-they-can-t-afford-to-pay-workers-right-now">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/chinese-companies-say-they-can-t-afford-to-pay-workers-right-now</a>. (btw, almost 85% of all enterprises in "socialist" China are owned by private companies). No surprise there - Chinese capitalists and their globalist pals have been suffering from huge losses of profit for years now - because of the overproduction. When offer greatly exceeds demand, profits plummet. In 2015, the profits of the owners of the Chinese steel sector plummeted by 30%!</p>
<p>So isn't it obvious now that COVID-19 is just a cover-up show for an unprecedented economic crisis and the capitalists' attempts to overcome it (by slowing down the production, kicking out surplus workers, destroying extra goods, cutting expenses on plebs' education and healthcare, etc)?</p></p>

<p>No, it isn't. People still think this is all about a virus, and about politicians not understanding the "real" data. I was just at /r/lockdownskepticism, and I still see this shit being peddled there even. Even after the very blatant talks of a "Great Reset" and "Build(ing) Back Better", people still say this is a "conspiracy theory" even in this sub.</p>

        <p>I mean, if we just assume none of this was planned and there is an actual disaster (deadly pandemic). Everything automatically slows down. Isn't it just a great opportinity to build back better? Especially if it's actually better. </p>
<p>Of course can't "build back" with tearing stuff down first. But it's less about actually building things and more like about relationships and stuff. Hence "disintegration" first</p>
