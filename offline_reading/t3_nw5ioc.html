    <strong>I'm so tired of seeing people say "I'm not anti-vax but-"</strong>
    <p><p>Look buddy, this has nothing to do with being anti-vax. It's bad enough seeing people say this shit on other terrible subs, but seeing people come on this sub saying this is fucking ridiculous. If I'm going to be called an anti-vaxxer simply because I believe I myself, and anyone else shouldn't get the nazi jab, then so be it!</p>
<p>Sorry, not sorry. But most of the "choice" people are getting on my nerves because these are same people that don't have a backbone. Yes I understand people will make their own choices...but if you're willing to get the jab simply because reasons...then you're no better than the sheeple you complain about.</p>
<p>Either stand up for your freedom, or don't! Because to sit here and act like this jab isn't deadly, as we all know it is, and to just act like it's a neutral thing. Is proving the exact point I'm making! This is what the sheeple want! And most important the government!</p>
<p>I'm against the jab, and no people I will never address this disgusting experimental jab as a vaccine. It's an experimental jab, and I'll never support it. Every person whose had a brain to question this madness I've told them to not get this jab. We all know this scamdemic was a hoax, so why would I, or even anybody else trust the government with knowing everything we know, trust that a jab wouldn't somehow give terrible long-term effects?</p>
<p>If this whole thing wasn't a whole scam that ruined the world, and was just an everyday life thing...then sure, I don't think any of us would care. But this is a big deal, because the system is using this jab, and the masks as control. Yes, I understand people have the right to make bad decisions, but I cannot respect what people are doing themselves, their kids, their families all because they won't understand that life is about risks.</p>
<p>But the thing is, we all would be better off taking our risks in the world itself, than to sit here and let the government make us guinea pigs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I know my post is pretty radical, but so fucking be it! Because I'd rather die than to take this jab. I'm not going to give up my health, and my freedom to be reduced down to nothing. This is the most crucial time where we need to stand up and so say no to deadly jabs, and bullshit scams.</p></p>

        <p>Yea, as much as much I hate in person conflict, I refuse to act like this jab is ok. Because it's not. If the government can make people take this jab,  god only knows what else they can do in the future.</p>

        <p>i can promise you this, the little discomfort we may experience now will be nothing compared to what the future will entail if we continue to capitulate and kow tow. who fucking cares what anybody may think about you. these are not normal fucking times, it's time to resist even harder. </p>
<p>btw did you hear congress can't pass a law to stop human animal hybrids from being grown in the US bc the lobby for it is so powerful it's the same lobby that owns and controls big tech. it's the real power. the scientific global dictatorship. </p>
<p>https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/05/27/senate-kills-gop-legislation-to-prohibit-certain-human-animal-chimeras/?sh=69eb80104207</p>
<p>congress can't even pass a law to prohibit splicing humans with animals because there are special interests so powerful and so entrenched that it will remain legal until we say no. so if we will put up with that what else will we put up with.</p>

<p>This is what people need to realize already. The writing has been there on the wall! And we need to restrain from the governments control. By not standing up against this, we're allowing the government and the politicians to say "hey, while some won't get the jab, those of you who do are better than those, so why don't you get more jabs by choice to be better and stay safe". </p>
<p>We need to stop giving the system the upper hand.</p>

        <p>I agree. What is really so wrong with being anti vax? Bill Gates doesn't vaccinate his own kids. Maybe vaccines aren't as great as we make them out to be. It's just like conspiracy theorist is supposed to be an insult now. Nothing wrong with conspiracies.  They are interesting actually.</p>

        <p>I've had 2 vaccines in my life and before covid no one gave a shit. Now I'm hitler or whatever. I really don't care what other people do but I do get pissed when people can't realise the fact I'm not dead kinda supports my point that not all vaccines are necessary. I mean I was born in fking Manaus in the Amazon and after being eaten to death by insects and visiting like 20 countries I'm still super healthy and was winning kickboxing competitions until covid showed up. I should be dead apparently and anyone I talk to can't change their opinion based on new information because the main stream media did not approve that opinion.</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you. Their bodies their choices, but I'm still sick and tired of these milquetoast-ass people on here getting the jab while claiming to be skeptics. Some of these poor suckers still think it will benefit their health I guess.</p>
<p>But how can someone be against the new normal while voluntarily getting the jab? It's pretty much giving pharmaceutical companies their blessing to implement medical tyranny. With all this talk about health passports and booster shots, why won't they read the writing on the wall? How can they not see where this is heading?</p>
<p>And it defeats the whole purpose of of fighting back! This is how we lost on masks. Too many people acquiesced, whether they agreed or not, and now we have masks AND vaccines shoved down our throats! The masks are disappearing in some areas, but I don't know if they will ever be completely gone.</p>

<p>All of this right here is my exact point! Being a little bitch and standing up for yourself is exactly what I'm trying to illustrate here! I'm not saying "Oh stop being a little baby, and just be aggressive because fuck everyone!" What I'm saying is that the government is trying kill us, control us, in the most disturbing way possible so we need to stand up now before it gets any worse.</p>
<p>Honestly, as a person who has some progressive views, and conservative views. People who stand in the middle are extremely unreliable, because they're too busy trying not to "offend someone" and trying to act like they don't care because people can do what they want. </p>
<p>Well guess what? That right there is exactly why the enemy gets the upper hand. Because of the cowards that refuse to pick a side. Someone is going to get offended, let em die mad about it! I've been a pro-abortion advocate for a long time, and it kills me how each and every time a pro-choice person comes around, you'll notice that immediately they'll act like "Oh yes we care about women but..." "No one's pro-abortion! We just-"</p>
<p>Then what the fuck are you advocating for then!? I always ask myself why do people always feel the need to kiss the asses of the people they hate? Either be for abortion or don't! </p>
<p>And it's the same here! Either be for the jab, or don't! But there's no in between. Yes there are some scenarios in which call for a gray area. But the scenarios we're in now doesn't! </p>
<p>Sorry to hurt hearts when I write all this, but all these "choice" people, are fucking useless. And all they're doing is ruining what we stand for. If they were truly skeptical, they would never touch the jab in the first place. If they were truly bothered by the world's bs, they wouldn't sit here acting like we should treat it like it's ok for people to be this dumb.</p>
<p>No offense...but I'm starting to feel like we shouldn't allow these people in this sub. It's like saying the abuse is wrong, but they just keep trying to passively justify it by just saying it's their choice. Yes it's your choice, but your choice is wrong, and you know it because you come here all worried.</p>

<p>Exactly! This is not the time to be walking on eggshells and caring what other people think. All of our futures are at stake, but God forbid we speak up and people call us lunatics! </p>

<p>It's funny because I've noticed every subculture seems to have covid politics shoehorned in now. Looking at other subreddits and even talking to some people in real life, I finally realized why gatekeeping is so important. </p>
<p>For example in r/aves, I remember someone posting video of a rave they had and majority of the comments were complaining about the lack of masks, asking if people were vaccinated, and saying they were being irresponsible. A culture that started underground is being overrun by shills. There's also festival subreddits that are asking for vaccines to be a requirement to go. </p>
<p>Since being against the new normal is the counter-culture, we need to protect our ethos. We shouldn't lead with, "oh it's a personal choice" but rather "fuck the new normal/great reset and everything that comes with it". </p>
<p>Last year in this sub and lockdownskepticism, some of us were called reverse doomers for predicting vaccine passports and medical tyranny. I don't see that anymore because we were right. And we cannot let this escalate any further.</p>

        <p>&rt; Honestly, as a person who has some progressive views, and conservative views. People who stand in the middle are extremely unreliable, because they're too busy trying not to "offend someone" and trying to act like they don't care because people can do what they want. </p>
<p>There is a term for this group of people: Little Eichmanns.</p>
<p>&rt; "Little Eichmanns" is a term used to describe people whose actions, while on an individual scale may seem relatively harmless even to themselves, taken collectively create destructive and immoral systems in which they are actually complicit. The name comes from Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi bureaucrat who helped to orchestrate the Holocaust, but claimed that he did so without feeling anything about his actions, merely following the orders given to him. </p>

        <p>Is this talking about all vaccines or just the covid ones? Cause I'm pro-vax, just anti-covid-vax (at the very least until it gets very seriously tested like any other vaccine). But the reason why I'll sometimes say something similar to "I'm not anti-vax but refuse covid vax" is simply because the #1 argument on me is "Oh you're not taking it? You must be an anti-vaxxer". It's a simple way to dismiss that stupid argument. Generally it's also their only argument lol, then they just resort to some kind of personal attack</p>

        <p>Sorry, OP, have to respectfully disagree. Everyone has their reasons for or against getting the jab. I won't encourage or discourage anyone from making the choice they have to make for themselves. I'm not getting it because I feel it is the best decision I can make for my own health.</p>

        <p>So you're willing to just sit there and not stand up against the government and it's bullshit? I understand people have their choices, but it's honestly disappointing to see people like you not literally pick a side of safety simply because you' don't have a spine to be more concerned for people in your life. What if god forbid your own mother/father/other family/friends/etc took this jab and died from it? Or what happens when the government wins, and realizes it can force us to take other experimental jabs just so we can have a living?</p>
<p>You don't feel the least bit concerned about the long term effects that this could have on the masses? Yes people have the right to make any choice they want, and they must live with the results of bad choices sure.</p>
<p>But what we're talking about now is a shit government that's literally using this jab as a way to segregate the masses, to control the people into believing that they're somehow doing good, by deluding them into being guinea pigs for experiment.</p>
<p>If you can't see the writing on the wall by now, then you're as much as a sheep as the rest. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand trying to be middle-grounded, but there are certain situations in life where things need to be fought for. And if it means fighting for people to not be injected by something that could damage them, and possibly future generations, then it's a fight worth fighting for.</p>
<p>People like you aren't helping anyone by trying to remain silent on the issue. You, me, and everyone else on this sub are here for a reason! We're here because we don't want the government to keep doing this insane bullshit on us. This isn't about being an extremist...it's about fighting for something meaningful, and powerful! Which is our freedom from the government.</p>
<p>Either stand up or don't. But don't pretend that you care, when all you do is nothing but be in shadows because you don't want to be involved.</p>

        <p>You won't convince people by calling them idiots, shouting at them, or starting from "actually we don't need <em>any</em> vaccines... and as for these covid ones...". </p>
<p>You have to validate yourself in their eyes by first saying you're not anti-vax in general, you just have serious concerns about the covid vaccinations. It's also true, I'm not against genuinely safe and proven vaccinations. So that's handy. </p>
<p>My main problem is I don't see many people due to lockdown and working from home, so it's almost impossible to convince anybody they are potentially fucking up their bodies without having those face to face conversations.</p>

        <p>"Nazi jab" Lol. Dude, calm the fuck down. Even states like MA are opening up. No mask requirements, not limitations on the capacity for businesses or venues. It's now entirely up to either mayors or individual businesses. If you don't want to get a jab, don't get the fucking jab, end of story.</p>
