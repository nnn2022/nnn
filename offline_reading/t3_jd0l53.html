    <strong>Mask Vigilantes, Social Media, And Truth</strong>
    <p><p>I don't wear a mask. Anywhere. For anyone. I have never been accosted, but I can feel the rising tensions in the area where I live. I see more and more people doing ridiculous crap like wearing masks in their car, while walking alone, while exercising, etc. Very few seem to be willing to spit on their hands, hoist the black flag, and refuse to wear a muzzle.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen a "public freakout" moment yet, at any business I have been in, but a friend of mine encountered one at a grocery store near me (one I never set foot in, because I consider it a chaotic, dirty zoo). From what he told me, it was an elderly man, the store staff were not involved, and the masked harassers were the typical fat, badly dressed slags that tend to frequent this type of store.</p>
<p>They literally chased him away, cursing, swearing, uttering threats. The store staff did nothing to intervene - and they had allowed him into the store sans-mask.</p>
<p>Since when have vigilante customers gained the right to kick other shoppers out of a store???</p>
<p>Also, he told me that people were filming the whole episode - and you just know it will end up on Fecesbook and Twatter as "evil anti-masker is abusive and rude, and righteous shoppers escort him from store".</p>
<p>I suspect 90% of the "public freakout" mask conflict videos are this way - the person not wearing a mask is minding his/her own business and is attacked or harassed, but the person posting the video edits this out, so when the victim is forced to defend himself from the mob either physically or verbally, he can be cast as  the bad guy.</p>
<p>Have any of you experienced this? Or been the victim of it?</p></p>

        <p>i notice that these pro-mask people only get aggressive when they know they can’t get hurt.</p>
<p>they’re quick to harass the elderly, women, children, and religious people but i’ve never seen one of these people have the balls to gang up on a 6’ middle-aged man to call him a ‘cOviDiOt’. </p>
<p>they call us the Karens, but they’re the nerds and geeks begging for the managers and police to escort people out stores if they aren’t wearing masks.</p>

        <p>People have essentially been given license from the authorities to attack “those selfish people who don’t care about anyone but themselves”.</p>
<p>“My mask protects you” was the perfect marketing slogan to portray someone who chooses to think for themselves as the evil one. They feel perfectly justified. Because <em>they</em> care about others.</p>

        <p>I’m a six foot tall male and I can confirm that I have never been verbally accosted for not wearing a mask. I do wear a mask in stores where they are required but I rarely wear one when I am walking outdoors. I do get dirty looks, people adjusting their mask or rushing to put theirs on as we pass each other, and the people walking way out into the street or trying to cross to the other side of the street as we are about to pass each other.</p>

        <p>I’m in Canada so I haven’t really encountered vigilantes. Then again I haven’t really gone mask free, and neither does anyone I’ve seen. However I’ve noticed when I do have my mask off, even outside, people look at me with these fake concerned eyes, like their eyes are saying, “yo, put it on! They’ll get you if you don’t!”</p>

        <p>Yep - we’ve have made society lepers unless you’re wearing a piece of cloth over your face - even outside. </p>
<p>Divide the people, don’t let them congregate, don’t let them interact with anyone except their inner circle. Once that’s done, it’s pretty easy to control the narrative.</p>

        <p>Fuck then I’m the worst kind of person thanks for making me hate myself today ;)</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, that’s good. I just got more weird looks today when I was at the gas station filling up entirely at the pump without a mask. OUTSIDE. It’s crazy af. It seems like where I’m at (Toronto area) is fracturing &amp; polarizing between a majority of extreme doomers &amp; a FEW people who want everything to Thanos-snap back to pre-COVID normal today. Honestly i don’t care if I get covid &amp; die because I want off this planet anyway.</p>
<p>I’m scared to go mask free though. What do you say when people offer you a mask or ask you to put it on &amp; insist? Do you think you could defend yourself if a few wannabe “gangstas” or thuggish cops decided to stomp you out &amp; jump you if you refused? Could you live with being cancelled for the rest of your life &amp; being persona non grata in a world that requires you to be “in the system” to survive? And if so, how would you do it? You’d have to think of all of that.</p>

        <p>It's nice to hear you have the freedom to not ever have to wear a mask. I have a mask mandate where I live so they're required at all gatherings and businesses. I've been shamed multiple times for not wearing one on the street and one time someone even threatened to kill me. People have completely lost it.</p>

I saw a man encircled and verbally assaulted (like, 1 inch from his face screaming like psychos, bordering on physical assault) by angry doomers in a market.

        <p>I'm starting to have a theory on this behaviour. Those of us who are sane realize that the whole thing was a scam from the get-go, that we are committing societal suicide on our present course, and that the masks, lockdowns, and restrictions are useless theatre.</p>
<p>Those who drank the Kool-Aid, at least many of them, are starting to have doubts, too - but they are too cowardly to change, and can't admit they are wrong without being faced with their own cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Therefore they double down on their stupidity, and attack anyone who, by defying the "rules", makes them face said stupidity.</p>
<p>Think Germany, 1944. Everyone knew the war was lost, but the "Sieg Heils" and cries for "total war" got louder and more fervent the more obvious it became...</p>

        <p>I don't wear a mask outside, and only wear one to get in stores. I haven't really been accosted, but I'm 5'10" 200 lbs. I look like a younger version of Anton Chigurh, down to the permanent poker face and the hair so that might scare some people. As someone else said, if you look like you can defend yourself, they won't fuck with you because they're cowards and only attack people they think they can get one over on.</p>
<p>I had one woman hassle me at the Costco gas station "Don't you care about others? you should wear a mask." I just smiled and said "I'm outside. Do I know you? No? Well then, no I actually don't really care about you. Bye!" she just stomped off like a petulant child back into her car and drove away.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it feels like the tide has shifted on this. I live in San Diego, and mask usage outside is the minority. Most people don't wear them outside, and I only see people putting them on when required to shop somewhere.</p>

        <p>Thus far, I've only had the occasional comment or 'dirty look'. Including from (I'm in the UK) supermarket "safety marshalls" who have, on a couple of occasions, tried to badger me about my non-mask wearing. I just walked past and nothing more came of it.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is that just today (first time), I was absolutely refused entrance to a business without a mask - even after indicating I would pay for the service I wanted and then go outside to wait.</p>
<p>They quoted "company policy". I reminded them of the city's exemption clauses - no dice.</p>
<p>I have had my cars washed and detailed there for for over five years - the staff know my face, and I theirs. </p>
<p>I told them in no uncertain terms, "I and the hundred bucks or so I spend here in a month, will not be back - including after the restriction is gone".</p>
<p>Where I am, the mask craziness seems to be getting worse by the day.</p>

        <p>I’ve been to a few states with no mask mandates and I went to a few before they had them. I never got shit from employees of stores but I did get some complaints from people who chose to wear a mask. I carry a gun with me everywhere I go so I’m confident that nothing will ever escalate. It’s visible and if someone has an issue I calmly handle it and walk away.</p>

        <p>I’ve been a minor victim. I will in the US (in a very nice and crowded city). I generally follow the rules, mainly because I don’t have a choice when it comes to grocery shopping (they won’t let in without one, there aren’t any other options but to comply unfortunately). I live in a large apartment building. I went to check my mail, I did not leave my building, and someone walked in and saw my unmasked face. This couple just threw a multitude of horrible insults at me. The room is large enough that they were about 50 feet or so away from me, open doors and windows too. Same story when I took my trash out, or walk down my hallway. I’ve been reported as “violating community guidelines” for not wearing a mask in my own home during the above listed activities. However, I formed them when I moved in a community tule was not mask wearing and I did not agree to that. 
My child got yelled at while I picked her up from her pretend school at the park (schools are closed, we have a small group that pays for a teacher). This is not a public park we meet at, it’s military. A woman verbally attached my small elementary aged child for not wearing a mask outside. There are no rules at this park about masks. People be crazy. I know my stories aren’t too intense, but it is adding up. (Sorry for format- on my phone).</p>
