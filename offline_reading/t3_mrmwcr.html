        <p>...you don’t know shit about religion. Only fucking idiot psycho evangelical protestants follow the Bible word for word, the reason Catholics don’t is because the Old Testament is there to give context and the New Testament is there to teach the values to live by</p>
<p>You fucking idiot anti-theists are so god damn stupid it’s insane, I’m not even religious and I know this basic shit cause I actually look shit up instead of being told what to believe by some idiot with a blog and Twitter  account, grow the fuck up</p>

        <p>Nice, you're defending religious people except one specific group because they're fucking idiots right?</p>
<p>First of all, I grew up in an extremely religious context, so you claiming I don't know shit about religion is absurd. Second, if you want to talk about Catholics, is the Pope a good example? Does the pope not hold socially distanced mass? Third, people who use Christianity to justify not observing social distancing don't know shit about Christianity for several reason.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, Jesus said: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." John 13:34. That includes not spreading a potentially lethal virus, even if it's mostly lethal for a subset of the population. Jesus was tortured and brutally murdered for the sins of ALL humanity, but these supposed Christians can't put a mask on for 10 minutes?</p>
<p>Now, on the subject of disobeying social distancing and mask rules/mandates. Jesus didn't teach rebellion. "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves." Romans 13:1-2 And "Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him." Mark 12:17</p>
<p>I can't be an antitheist since there is no absolute way to prove that there is no god and holding this position would be dishonest. But calling them fucking idiots is pretty rude and pointless.</p>

        <p>The Bible also explicitly calls believers to love everyone, including the subset of population who are more vulnerable to covid, and include the people who don't want to catch it.</p>
<p>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." John 13:34</p>
<p>"Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in, I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you visited Me.’</p>
<p>Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You?’</p>
<p>And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’" Matthew 25 34:40</p>
<p>If you transmits an illness to your brothers and sisters in Christ, do you not, according to Christ's teaching, effectively transmit it to the Lord Himself?</p>
<p>Jesus was brutally tortured and died for the sins of ALL humanity, but you can't wear a mask for like 10 minutes and observe social distancing? That's fucked up man.</p>

        <p>Tell me, is it better for me to love my neighbor by imprisoning them -- free from all harm and danger, with food security and constant protection -- or to love them by giving them freedom? Does God smile more on a person with security and no liberty? And what happens with that lack of liberty also creates a lack of morality? </p>
<p>You assume I'm intentionally spreading disease -- like I'll jump and holler like Uncle Joe when I find out I'm extremely contagious with a disease like Ebola (not Covid, with a 99.9% survival rate). This is incorrect and dishonest, and you know it. And if I didn't know I had the disease, but still spread it freely (you know, like what happened every single year before March, 2020), I cannot see a reasonable argument that that was done out of hatred for the health of others. </p>
<p>You act like I cannot love the freedoms of my neighbor, only their fears. I love my neighbor enough to resist the tyrannical government overreach. It's not just me who benefits from having liberty -- it's everyone. Of course, planks-in-eyes. Is it loving to force individuals to get vaccinated? To prevent individuals from worshiping in their buildings or in their homes? To watch as jobs are lost, lives as destroyed, children commit suicide, domestic abuse soars, the homeless freeze outside of shelters? Is that love to you?</p>
<p>You view the world in such a way that many things you disagree with are hatred, rather than seeing love for something else. If I have formed my opinions over this crisis theatre from a place of hate, than God will be my judge. I love what we're losing (liberty) more than I hate what we're gaining (authoritarian government overreach with security).</p>

        <p>You're not imprisoned, no one is imprisoned, why are you so melodramatic? These rules don't create a lack of morality, your disregard for them because of your own self centered reasons create a lack of morality.</p>
<p>Not taking the proper precautions <em>on purpose</em> knowing that you could risk contracting and then spreading the disease is the very definition of intentionally spreading the disease. Covid does not have a 99.9% survival rate, you are either a liar or have been deceived. And regardless of the survival would Jesus not reward you for taking care of the more vulnerable ones? "‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.’" Matthew 25 40</p>
<p>Again, no one is removing your freedoms, the faster you realise that, the faster things can start getting better. The problems you are attributing to lockdowns already existed before them and will persist after lockdowns. To solve them, we need adequate social programs that offer support to people suffering or in need.</p>
<p>You pretend like you're acting out of love for your neighbour and freedoms. But hospitals were overcrowded, even with the measures in place. Even with measures in place, life saving surgeries and other health care services were delayed or cancelled. Is depriving people from health care also a manifestation of love?</p>
<p>You act like you don't understand these concepts. But the way you speak makes you sound like you do understand what's actually at stake, you just can't be bothered to change your lifestyle because you're either lazy, self centered, evil, or a combination of the 3.</p>

        <p>Again, streaming. Both my parents usually spend more time in church than at home. Both churches they attend respect the limits imposed by the government and  stream the service for people who can't attend. When they have meetings, for administration or some religious activity, they use zoom. If they can do it, so can you.</p>

        <p>Ok, so regardless of what is legal. Most religions advocate for their followers to follow a moral code. Most of the time, this moral code includes selflessness, charity, care and love for everyone equally, etc... Given that there is a virus going around, affecting some groups more than others, and, sometimes, hits people unexpectedly hard. Given that this virus has the ability to infect a large number of people in a small period of time, send a good number to the hospital thus overwhelming them, their personnel and deprive other people of some necessary health services. Given that some people might unknowingly be spreading it. And given that some people actually die from this. Don't you think that the deity who loves everyone equally would want them to be careful <em>not</em> to spread the virus? Don't you think that this deity would have liked people to have done whatever is possible to avoid or reduce the insanely high number of deaths in some regions of the world?</p>
<p>And again, you still have the right to assemble, you just need to respect the rules. Either small numbers with masks or on zoom. No one is taking away any constitutional rights here. I understand that it's hard, I understand that it's not the same. But that doesn't justify putting other people at risk. I'll be the first to admit that lockdowns are shitty and have a lot of downsides, but they serve a purpose. The problems we are encountering with lockdowns aren't new, they've just been put in foreground. These problems will persist even after lockdowns. So the solution isn't for the government to remove lockdowns and isn't for citizens to violate lockdown rules, it's to have social programs to help people who need support in these trying times.</p>
<p>Bonus argument for Christians: Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</p>

        <p>Oh no, it seems you're affected by this idiocy virus.</p>
<p>I was clearly talking about the Sars-CoV-2. A real virus that causes COVID19. An illness that has claimed well over 550 thousand people in the US alone. A virus who has already claimed 2 people in my family, 2 people in the family of a close friend, and at least 5 other people I personally know have caught it.</p>

You are a delusional egocentric sociopath who blindly follows scammers because masks and social distancing hurt your poor little feelings.

        <p>Well, the person who told you that "the only virus that’s been spreading is idiocy". And if no one told you and you came up with that on your own because you did some research on youtube, then the people on facebook and youtube that you followed are the scammers. And if you came up with that on your own, without the need for external information, then i digress, you're not blindly following any scammers, you're either a scammer or a complete idiot.</p>

        <p>Well, I'm not the ignorant sociopath who's entire world view can only be justified by basically having the whole world against me. I gain nothing from lying. You, on the other hand, only have handwave dismissal and dishonesty to protect your  silly little beliefs. Because if you were to admit that you're wrong, your fragile ego would be shattered. Even if I sent you the death certificates, you'd find an excuse to dismiss the evidence. You're a sad individual.</p>
<p>But hey, I have to hand it to you, it takes genuine effort to be able to defend such a backwards way of thinking and still believe that you have the upper hand in the discussion. Are you able to prove that the entire world is lying to you or is it just something you say to help you sleep at night?</p>

        <p>Listen, a very good friend of mine died "due to the virus" as well. I personally think that it was him being put on the ventilator too soon. Do you think that your deceased family members would want you to dwell on society and whether or not we are "doing our best to stop the spread." Perhaps that is what they would have wanted, but perhaps not. You cannot tell me what a person would have wanted if they had never written it down.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you're talking about, but if you're thinking that lockdowns are the cause of everything bad going on in the world, you'd be wrong. Lockdowns do hinder society, but the problems that seem to arose from them were present before. Lockdowns just amplified them and put them in the foreground. They will persist after lockdowns. What would fix them would be social programs to offer support to people in need.</p>

        <p>That's a gross generalization. But, since I'm not religious, I'll give you the example of both my parents. They usually spend more time in church than at home. Both churches they attend respect the limits imposed by the government and stream the service for people who can't attend. When they have meetings, for administration or some religious activity, they use zoom. If they can do it, so can you.</p>

        <p>No, I don't think I will. An entire year of isolation has been enough for me and I'm not going to follow any stupid rules for a disease that's as deadly as the flu. I've already gotten covid and have been completely fine so I'm not worried about getting it and dying. Even if I do get it and die then I don't care.

        <p>I forgot that literally the entire universe revolves around you and your egotistical self.</p>
<p>I couldn't care less about what you do to yourself, you could shove a giant rock in your ear for all I care. You're free to do as you please with your own body and possessions. But pointlessly endangering other people is pretty fucking low considering your excuse is that you're sad. This illness affects people differently, it's why hospital were overwhelmed and had to delay or cancel healthcare services (like life saving treatments or surgeries) that were not related to covid. And the death rate of influenza is 0.1% in the USA when covid19's death rate currently sits at 2.8%. I know that math can be hard for some people, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that 2.8% is greater than 0.1%. But you know that already, you're just too petty and self centered to change your habits because masks and social distancing make you mildly uncomfortable so fuck everyone else.</p>

        <p>Well, are you living in an isolated bubble outside of society or are you part of codependent relationship between many humans in order for you to achieve the level of comfort that you are currently enjoying? And don't get it twisted, you aren't normal, normal people want this to end safely, you just want this to end so that you can stop being told to put a mask on because masks make you sad. You falsely believe that the only person affected by your stupid behaviour is you. But since you will need to go to the store to buy your groceries, clothes, etc... You will interact with essential workers. People who are currently working their asses off because society can't afford to lose them. Some of the poorer people who are working these jobs do so out of financial necessity and can't afford to fall ill and take a sick day, especially not because of some idiot who's too dumb to understand basic biology. And just as everyone else, normal people who do follow the precautionary measures still need to go out to get food and essential goods. They do so out of necessity and have the right to a safe environment. If you're so unhappy with our current society, why don't you elect an official to make laws that conform to your twisted view of the world, it shouldn't be hard given that, according to you, you're part of the norm. Or better yet, why don't you pack up your shit and leave with all your little friends, you'll be able to create your own society with your own silly little rules and your own silly little pseudoscience and your own silly little religions. Oh, and don't forget to bring the flat earthers with you.</p>

        <p>You're right, some people are less religious than them, therefore can probably go without going to church every day. And why is it not the same? As I said earlier, is God not present everywhere, including in your home? And if it's for the social aspect, you can still meet outside in small numbers while respecting social distancing and wearing masks. It's not ideal, but manageable. There are much worse problems in the world that deserve some of the outrage these measures are getting.</p>

        <p>Both my parents usually spend more time in church than at home (this is not an exaggeration, my dad is a member of the clergy and my mom is part of most committees and religious activities). Both churches they attend respect the limits imposed by the government and stream the service for people who can't attend. When they have meetings, for administration or some religious activity, they use zoom. If they can do it, so can you.</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, it's everyone else's fault but yours. It can absolutely not be the fact that people are spreading the virus faster than hospitals can deal deal with it. It can absolutely not be the fact that there are a number of factors that can make it have unpredictable effects on people. Because that would shatter your bubble and that would make poor little you uncomfortable. Vitamin D is obviously the magical cure that big pharma is hiding, even though the studies are inconclusive or do not have enough data.</p>

        <p>The worst were the 'churches' that closed down, shamed others for remaining opening, worked with the state to get the open churches to be shut, and transformed their churches into vaxx centres. </p>
<p>The reason that Christianity expanded in Europe during the successive waves of bubonic plague was because the Body of Christ was the one that continued to help others and care for them whilst the rest fled in terror. </p>
<p>I was hugely disappointed with most Christians last year and I am stunned that they continue to double-down in their unbelief (because that's what it is!) instead of actually believing the Lord they profess to have faith in. The good thing is that it made it VERY clear who the true Christians were, and who the intellectual and in-name-only 'Christians' were. </p>
<p>Christians, from the days of Jesus, prayed for the sick. Modern-day 'Christians' pray to BigPharma whilst also being members of the cult of scientism as they (literally) tell others to "trust/believe the science."</p>
<p>I am blessed to be in a church that never went through this phase and was a dissident church from the beginning.</p>
