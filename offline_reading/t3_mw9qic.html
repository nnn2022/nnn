    <strong>I'm a respiratory therapist working in an ICU in America</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccine doesn't work. I work in a hospital and almost as many vaxxed are coming in with covid as unvaxed. Small sample size for me, but 38% of my icu covids are fully vaccinated and admitted positive for covid. There are also many people coming in with some random strange symptoms post vax. 
Not to mention the 3500 deaths reported so far from the vax. In reality, that number is probably about 25k to 50k. Historically, only about 1% of events are reported to VAERS. So even if we're conservative, the number of deaths from this shit show is pushing 50k. It is, without a doubt, the most deadly vaccine ever, and by far.</p></p>

        <p>Yes! I’m a nurse on step down ICU and our floor has been converted to the COVID unit. I’ve taken care of several patients that developed Guillan-Barre after they got their vaccine and it’s not even being reported. The doctors are saying “you don’t know it’s related to that,” and aren’t even mentioning they were vaccinated in the progress notes.</p>
<p>On another note, my mom got the COVID vaccine and died of an ischemic bowel afterwards. She had a lot of comorbidities so it’s hard to say for sure what happened, but she had nearly beaten cancer and I have a hard time thinking the vaccine and the ischemic bowel, which can be caused by clotting, aren’t connected.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your input. It is amazing how these doctors refuse to see it. They still tell these people, "good for you for getting the vaccine...you might have been more sick without it".  Or refusing to even try to understand what may be happening with side effects. I question everything...it seems only reasonable. Thanks again. Keep on spreading the truth</p>

<p>I think those first few docs who lost their licenses were meant to be a chilling example to physicians who don't toe the party line.</p>

        <p>I agree. Obviously not all doctors are idiots, But a lot are. It's extremely hard to get kicked out of medical school. If they fail classes and tests, they have remedial classes for them to take and then put them back to where they left off. Also the standards for getting into medical school is getting easier. Students are admitted based on interviews. They care more about personality and diversity than they do test scores, grades, and clinical experience.</p>

        <p>One of my favourite books (it's more of an essay than a book) - "The basic laws of human stupidity" advocates that in any group of people, no matter how intelligent, you will always underestimate how many of them are incredibly stupid.</p>

        <p>My dad developed severe diarrhea, basically pissing blood out of his ass, exactly 3 weeks following second Pfizer shot. He was keeled over on bathroom floor. I didn’t leave his house for days and he was refusing medical treatment and kept saying it must be food poisoning. It did not resolve. Eventually got him to ER, where they diagnosed it as ischemic colitis. They felt the vax was irrelevant, of course. They said his scans of his colon “were very ugly.” He is hanging in there presently - 5 day stay in ER though and now on a very strict diet. Interestingly, he had stool tests done about a month prior to jab! All was fine.</p>

        <p>Really sorry about your dad... that is terrible. I want answers. My wife got it and after 12 hours started to feel worse and worse, extreme body aches and then unexpectedly fell and had a seizure in the bathroom. The fall woke me up luckily, I rushed in and put her in recovery position she eventually came out of it but it was one of the scariest things I’ve had to deal with in my life</p>
<p>I’m prone to seizures so I know what to do when somebody has one but never had to deal with somebody else having one yet alone my lady. I’ve felt weird about it all since the info started leaking out. That night confirmed it for me.. I really wanted to be wrong. She also has no prior medical issues and is very healthy </p>
<p>Sad I would be banned for talking about this on vaccine subreddits. I don’t know who to turn to. I got her to report it to VAERS, I am currently trying to overcome the severe trauma but it’s going to take a long time. It’s put me off wanting to get the jab altogether, it really became emotionally charged. 2nd shot btw</p>

        <p>I’m glad she’s okay. It’s very scary. Please know that her incident is not an isolated event. Hundreds of reports of seizures. Sadly, the vast majority probably aren’t even reporting their adverse effects because they aren’t correlating it to jab when the media isn’t discussing these side effects openly. Most people who are reporting (other than family who was already on edge about new medical experiment) are folks who experience immediate side effects. But the side effects come anywhere from instantly to 6 weeks later, it seems.</p>

        <p>Yes you’re right, she’s doing better now thankfully but I’m still VERY concerned and keeping an eye on her.</p>
<p>Especially in regards to long term side effects I mean.. that’s a whole other package to unwrap. This cover up is huge. </p>
<p>Thanks for the resource too btw I appreciate it, my mental health has been deteriorating. I have good days and bad days but being gaslighted as much as I have and not being able to talk to anyone about it has made me not want to live anymore especially after seeing my wife in that state... it breaks my heart. I’m thankful there’s still places we can freely share info</p>

        <p>I was going to ask if there was a higher prevalance of GBS. My husband got it with the flu shot 2 years ago and can never have another vaccine again. He was paralysed from the neck down and nearly put in a coma. He had 4 or 5 ivig treatments and still was hospitalised for 4 months; and came out in a wheelchair. He's walking now (not great but... oh well) and completely stuffed his body :( </p>
<p>I'm on the fence about getting this covid shot.</p>

        <p>Here's mine. COVID does cause reinfection and the subsequent ones are worse usually life threatening.</p>
<p>Most COVID+ patients who were asymptomatic likely never had it. Though the hospitals and clinics were more than happy to admit with COVID diagnosis.</p>

        <p>I’ve had covid 2 or 3 times. The first time sucked, the second time was barely anything. The third time I was completely immune, sleeping in the same bed as my exgf for 7 days who lost her sense of smell and who’s sister also lost her sense of smell and tested positive.</p>
<p>Just an anecdote but it did not cause a severe reaction for me. Generally what is life threatening is the cytokine storm (immune system overreacting) and you won’t have a cytokine storm if your vitamin D levels are adequate.</p>

        <p>This mRNA injection is not a vaccine. It does not fulfil the legal definition of vaccine. It does however fulfill the definition of a device on:- https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/how-determine-if-your-product-medical-device</p>
<p>The phase 3 trials should be of great concern. Not completed. This is when a cohort is watched through a period of 7-15 years to determine delayed ADRs. One cannot stop the cascade of events that will happen with an mRNA device inserted into each cell of the body.</p>
<p>When you come into contact with the virus and your immune system is stimulated to get rid of the virus and your own body sees that you have the viral proteins in your own cells and organs and your memory antibodies… the mechanism that makes specific long term antibodies against a pathogen ….your adaptive immune system….YOUR OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOING TO START KILLING YOU. ORGAN FAILURE! ** the condition will initially present as sepsis and organ failure follows!</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the phase 1 &amp; 2 animal trials.</p>
<p>This is the irreversible effect.</p>
<p>We have around 10 billion miles of DNA. It’s our blue print. Our binary code. Our computer program. Take out one piece. Put in an extra piece. Translocate a piece from one place to another. You are changed forever. ** RNA or any RNA messenger can be potentially converted into DNA in the presence of the enzyme ‘reverse transcriptase’. Then that DNA could then link to your native DNA. There is the possibility of vaccine RNA being converted to DNA and then permanently inserted into your own DNA.</p>
<p>People, you are being left without excuse at this point.  If you take the COVID vaccine, you have no one to blame but yourself should you fall ill or die.  You’ve been warned.</p>

        <p>I love real information from real people. Some questions, if you're willing to answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you find media reports of Covid-19 hospital overwhelm to be exaggerated or accurate?</li>
<li>Have you personally witnessed or experienced anything that makes you feel Covid-19 deaths or diagnoses are exaggerated?</li>
<li>Is there an answer to the weird "hospitals are overwhelmed" combined with an endless stream of "choreographed nurse dancing tiktoks?"</li>
<li>Do you recognize a commonality with serious Covid-19 cases? Age, obesity, prior conditions. How many serious "healthy Covid-19 victims" have you encountered?</li>
<li>Are your peers skeptical? Do you feel silenced at all, like maybe your career is at stake if you ask the wrong questions?</li>
<li>Have you witnessed anyone lose their positions as a result of being skeptical of the official narrative?</li>
<li>What is your personal opinion about this vaccine? If it was just about money, why would they push something with so many serious side effects? Why is it so important to them that we take it? (I can't believe the intention was health considering how fast food companies were declared essential while shutting down parks, playgrounds, gyms, and ordering people indoors into sedentary stressful lifestyles where they consumed terrifying news 24/7. I believe this caused a lot of people to stress-eat and obesity to increase. Not to mention the health effects of stress.) But sorry to sound so biased, I don't want to scare you away from an honest answer!</li>
<li>Do you really think Covid-19 is THAT different from seasonal illnesses we've seen before?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for sharing your insight on these matters!  If I disagree with any of your responses I won't argue, this is just an honest solicitation for inside information from someone on the front line.</p>

        <p>Many urban hospitals were indeed full. Deaths are definitely exaggerated. Almost all extreme cases involve obesity and or old age and diabetes. Unfortunately, most practitioners believe the mainstream narrative, but I think they are starting to question now. Nobody I know has lost their job, but I definitely watch what I say. I think the vaccine is dangerous and I don't get it...can't be all about money. I believe there may be something more sinister happening. I do indeed believe covid is unique and new. The xray appearance is very unique as is the happy hypoxia (very odd) along with the micro clotting we are seeing post mortem.  I believe 100% it's man made and was likely made in NC Chappel Hill in 2015 and taken to Wuhan in 2017.  There is a lot of info on the studies they were doing and...they were making this virus.  It's apparent if you dig deep and read about it.  Fauci was deeply involved.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your insight.</p>
<p>There is a "soft blacklisting" that is happening naturally, caused by the extreme divide. One side is pushing lockdowns, masks, and vaccines REALLY hard and they've managed to turn those of us who want "choice" into extremists.</p>
<p>Consequently, many of us can't speak out the way we we'd want to because we don't want to lose our network which we rely on for work. I just work in games, but I know people from all walks who have said similar in private -- an insurance executive, a federal judge, etc.</p>
<p>Combined with the way people are silenced online -- this goes a long way to shifting the perception of public opinion.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the differences you speak of are interesting. I don't know enough about it to judge but I will definitely read up on it. It sounds like you're saying the differences are yet another indicator that this was a manmade thing.</p>
<p>There are some things we know for a fact, like Fauci's authorization of funding to accelerate the infectiousness of viruses with the ferrets, etc. (Sorry I forgot the technical terms.)</p>
<p>Anyhow sorry to carry on. Thanks again for the insight.</p>

        <p>Interesting about Chappel Hill/Fauci. Do you think it a possibility that’s why they are pushing for the vaccine? Because they know what it is? I would like to add I was working as an RN on a critical care floor/ICU until recently, and my thoughts on this pandemic haven’t changed once. The thing that initially had me so skeptical about the pandemic is that last September-November (before “covid came to America”) my area got hit with a flu like illness we had never seen before. Actual overcrowding, people in the hallways, etc. We were told we would get a huge covid spike in April/May of last year and it never came.....</p>

        <p>I'm an ICU nurse who works in every unit in the hospital.  I may get banned,  but if it helps one person it's worth it. </p>
<p>1 laughably exaggerated
2 hospice patients die of covid, not end stage terminal cancer.  There's no flu, death rate is like a bad flu season.  Swine flu seemed worse because it didn't take mostly the old and unhealthy. 
3 there's an ulterior motive.  People are irrational when they're scared so you can convince them all into an experimental injection because they aren't using normal discernment
4 I have never encountered a healthy covid victim.  The seemingly healthy old have poor nutrition.  Think of what they feed nursing home residents.  Ensure is mostly sugar and corn syrup.  How much sun do they get?   Side note, our covid icu has been basically closed for 6 weeks. Who cares about cases? Doesn't that mean it isn't anything to be afraid of?
5 no. Yes. Most people haven't figured out what's going on yet.  I've never wanted to be wrong so badly, but once you put the pieces together, you can't unlearn and choose ignorance.  I work for a company that prefers kool-aid drinkers over skill, but I'm still surprised how few people are questioning.  I think the doctors are too overwhelmed with work to dig deep into the research.  If this vaccine really hits like suggested by the former ceo of phizer in about two years I wonder who will be left to run healthcare. 
6 not yet.  Most are too afraid to speak up.  I'm getting daily emails about how anyone who cares about people would take the jab. We also got bribed with superbowl tickets 
7 population control. N-W-O implementation.  You can still find the fall_of_cabal on duckduckgo and bitchute.  Do a little research into agenda_21. Try proving each thing you learn wrong.  I couldn't.  I learned that snopes is the modern day equivalent to the Orwellian ministry of truth.  Dig deeper and look at Dolores Cannons work.  This is a spiritual battle that was planned long ago. We will all make our own decisions right now. I believe that it is in our contracts to be here right now. I remember choosing my mom and coming to earth paired with many things I've seen which guide me to believe this way.  Our old world isn't coming back,  but I believe that in the end the people who are left wake up, stop allowing ourselves to be enslaved, and build a new age where we live off the land in communities and are more connected with the earth.
8. No. It's a bad flu that was created in a lab therefore it doesn't follow the normal rules of a flu.  Normal flus have a season and can't survive anywhere on earth. </p>
<p>You can argue. I know I don't think like the average person.  I certainly don't think I have all the answers.  What I've gathered is based on my personal experience and research that resonated.</p>

        <p>Wow (!) I have nothing to add, but your response is important enough to me to have screenshot for future reference. You have given me much to research. And I know the basics about Agenda 21, the precursor to The Great Reset, but it becomes increasingly difficult to get information on.</p>
<p>Actually, that is across the board. Already many government resources that I pointed at previously to prove they counted all deaths within 30-60 days of a positive Covid-19 test have disappeared. My favorite was from an Alaska Dept of Health website that went on to explain that Covid-19 is "different" and if someone dies falling off a ladder or in a motorcycle accident, it's likely the virus affected them suddenly. But that page first went private followed by what is a dead link now.</p>
<p>But that's just one example. We really must screenshot things because they rewrite "history" now just like in 1984.</p>
<p>And you're spot on about Snopes. Thank you for responding. Good luck to you and your family in these coming times. We're in for a wild ride. :-/</p>

        <p>I can attest to this. I know that this statement borders on crazy talk but : The vaccine gave me COVID-19 all over again. And I had to get over it all over again. Albeit it took four days instead of a month and a week when I first contracted the virus, it was still COVID-19 and not a watered down version that I received in my arm. I felt betrayed by my county health organization.</p>

        <p>In my opinion no job should force or coerce anyone into taking this BS vaccine as a condition of employment. If they are allowed to continue of the use of coercion as a condition of employment, one would have to question where does it stop. They are setting a precedent that if allowed to go unchecked will only get worse the next time they need to use coercion to get people to comply.</p>

        <p>Are you sure that wasn't just an immune response?  I felt the same symptoms when I had been exposed very very thoroughly to someone with COVID, as when I had it the same time.  The watered down version like you said.  When I got the shot, I had the same symptoms all over again, but there's no way I could have actually caught COVID.  Both times they lasted 24 hours and were gone.  </p>

        <p>As a respiratory therapist, do you mind me asking for your perspective on where you think doctors/nurses and your colleagues are going wrong in their approach to Covid? I'd like to hear an expert's point of view on that.  I'm thinking specifically how early on doctor's were rushing to put people on ventilators but shortly after stopped because in some cases it was actually increasing risk of mortality.</p>

        <p>Early intubation is like saying catshit ice cream. Two words that should never be spoken together. You never early intubate. Mortality goes up 25% the second you jam that tube in...across the board, as a rule, even pre covid. The drugs needed and the barotrauma created are ridiculous risks to take. I knew that from day one, but my hospital did it. Intubating patients from 6L cannulas...just crazy as hell. Ignoring pulmicort! Ivermectin! There's a long list and I don't have the time.</p>

        <p>I'm confused, are you saying that we should not update our beliefs given new sets of information?  Even if we are to have new information and do update our beliefs based on that new information, are we somehow supposed to be ashamed of our decision-making when given imperfect information?</p>
<p>I take pride in the fact that I am not so self-centered and arrogant that I can update my beliefs based on new information, and I have a great deal of respect for anyone that does that beyond what I would give to someone who lucks into the right answer the first place on one situation and gets it wrong on countless other situations.</p>
<p>Can you at least say right now that you agree that vaccines are still in the stages of uncertainty and it is fine for people to make their own choices with their own bodies in regards to whether or not they want to take it, and should not be coerced into taking it through the discrimination by private businesses due to a medical decision?  Can you also agree that given masks only cause a 2% reduction in the increase in rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is such a small amount and does not have a real impact on the total number of cases, and therefore no one should be subject to wearing masks for the same reason they should not be subjected to vaccines?</p>
<p>I have admitted my shortcomings and have corrected my behavior accordingly, have you?</p>

        <p>&rt; I'm confused, are you saying that we should not update our beliefs given new sets of information?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. That concept is sweet sweet music to my ears, it’s fundamental to scientific skepticism. </p>
<p>And no, the limitations of decision-making with imperfect information are certainly understandable (though you don’t seem to apply that concept to the Fauci / masks issue you raised in your other comment), but the issue I am getting at is something substantively different. </p>
<p>You weren’t just making decisions based on imperfect information, you uncritically accepted misinformation that falls apart with just the slightest poking. And parroted that four-month-old misinformation, even attributing it to the CDC instead of the AMA (which is a huge distinction in this context). </p>
<p>What does that say about your process for processing and propagating information, and your potential biases?</p>
<p>Like sure, people make mistakes, but those mistakes can be revealing. And good on you to correcting and clarifying when you were called on it. But that’s the bare minimum for someone who wants to engage in issues with critical thinking and integrity. </p>
<p>As for vaccines, sure, they are still in a stage of uncertainty, but so is most everything else. There is a spectrum of uncertainty, from extremely uncertain to almost 100% certain, and the COVID-19 vaccines have progressed significantly through that spectrum. </p>
<p>With the best tools we have to assess the effectiveness and safety of medical interventions (namely large RCTs), we’ve been able to dramatically reduce the uncertainty of those considerations for the vaccines. </p>
<p>And sure, relevant uncertainty remains about things like rare adverse effects (that the RCTs just can’t be large enough to detect), protection against variants, duration of immunity, etc, those have to be weighed against the more-certain risk/benefits of the vaccines and the risks of the pandemic. Harken back to decision-making with imperfect information. </p>
<p>And I do think people should retain the right to make their own choices with their body. But I think the coercion is reasonable in this specific case as the cost of participating in a society that’s functioning is vulnerable to infectious diseases. </p>
<p>See my other comment for the discussion about your underlying premise about usefulness of masks.</p>

        <p>Yup, your body your choice, I’m all for everyone that wants a vaccine to be able to get one, even if they are not yet fully tested. Everyone should be allowed to make those choices without coercion being fully informed of known risks at the time. I just think the same goes for HCQ in that regard, and like you said, the side effects are well documented and for the vast majority of people are extremely minor, which is more than can be said for many of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Of course I’m also practical too, live in Wuhan and use the metro everyday so I have to wear a mask there. Culturally though, people here do not believe in rights the way we do in the US, and I just don’t want to see everyone back home going all crazy and authoritarian. Having nurses and doctors that have different opinions is a good thing, and letting people who want to make different choices should be allowed to as long as there is reasonable evidence that the treatment will work. For example I am not for using a knife to surgically remove all SARS-CoV-2 from the body, even if it sounds like a good idea for some cancers, and any doctor who suggests to do that should definitely be stopped.</p>

        <p>It’s kind of like smoking, everyone responds differently and it requires real research to study properly, something that has not been done sufficiently to this point, similar to mRNA vaccines.  For example, graphene is bad for the lungs when inhaled and there is evidence that at least some masks being manufactured have graphene in them. Perhaps the way some masks are being manufactured are safe and the recent influx in demand has caused innovative new practices that are less safe, just too many variables.</p>
<p>On a more pragmatic level, I get headaches easily in certain situations, including wearing surgical masks for maybe an hour or more at a time, just depends on the day I suppose. Honestly, I consider the risk of getting SARS-CoV-2 and dying from it or having lifelong suffering low enough (especially when taking Vitamin D), that it is not worth the literal headaches. Again, we’re talking about a 2% decrease in the rate of increase of spread, these masks are not actually preventing cases from a practical prospective, the only situation they will matter is when a hospital is on the cusp of being overwhelmed and forced into triage, otherwise it really does nothing, why risk the unknown for a known benefit that is so minor?</p>

        <p>Is there anything specific to your concerns about mask safety beyond graphene?</p>
<p>Because that one’s easily avoided, just don’t wear masks that contain graphene. Graphene isn’t a material that’s cheap or easy to use, so manufacturers aren’t going to throw it in a mask without advertising it. </p>
<p>Where does your 2% figure come from? Do you have any sources or scientific literature about that?</p>
<p>And are you aware that any benefits of Vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 are unproven at best?

        <p>Many concerns about masks, I have seen various things at various times, but the simple reality is there is just no reason they are worth it given the study on the CDC website cited as why we should wear masks. The 2% study I do have:
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm?s_cid=mm7010e3_w#contribAff
Read it carefully to understand what it actually means, it’s statistically significant, sure, but at a level so minor it means virtually nothing.</p>
<p>If I use the same standard you are using with vitamin D, that the randomized studies to not consistently show vitamin D works, then we absolutely cannot trust the mask study because it didn’t go through the appropriate randomization process of trials like vitamin D did, and when vitamin D went through more rigorous ones that the mask study, it still got 97%. I also have reason to believe that some of those studies that did not do so well had conflicts of interest in their funding.  All of that said, I go with the best info at the time, back in January 2020, I was scared as shit of this thing because we knew nothing about it, but info has changed. If actual vaccine and/or mask studies come out later proving safety and effectiveness, then I’m all for them.  Meanwhile, I take a moderate amount of vitamin D so I don’t take too much, and have no side effects from it in the 8-10 months I’ve been taking it, and my understanding is that it’s much lower risk than any of these alternatives. Often the biggest argument against vitamin D is that studies related to other illnesses show now effect, but obviously the same could be said for masks as well.  Just think, did Fauci lie before about mask effectiveness or did the evidence really change that much? He already said he lied before, but honestly I think he was lying about the lie, and because he felt it was better for people to think him a liar than have no faith in masks.</p>

        <p>Wow, it’s fascinating to me that you and I can look at the same study and come away with very different impressions. And thanks for linking that study, I hadn’t seen it yet and rather enjoyed diving into it. </p>
<p>Your advice to read it carefully to understand what it actually means is very good advice, because I did, and I think you should perhaps take your own advice. </p>
<p>What do you think that ~2% value actually means, in practical terms? As in, can you lay out for me, as clearly as you can, what your understanding of that 2% (actually a range from -0.5 to -1.9) value is?</p>
<p>(And let’s leave the Vitamin D stuff aside, because it’s too much to get into on top of the mask stuff, but suffice to say I fully support you taking Vitamin D as described because the potential benefits surely outweigh the risks, I’m just not onboard with relying on it for protection from COVID-19)</p>

        <p>Simply put I am lazy on how to interpret the 2%.  Since we are talking about growth rates, I just think of it similar to interest rates and the rule of 70.  If we use that assumption, which is definitely an imperfect assumption, then it would imply that the number of people that getting sick will stop increasing after about 34 days as a result of wearing masks instead of 35 days while not wearing masks.  The 35 days chosen as a baseline is arbitrary and simple to illustrate with the rule of 70 from a practical way of looking at it using days because if I were to say it actually stopped the increase 1.4 days early, that is just a weird measurement to try to explain.</p>
<p>Now you can make the argument that you should be looking at the fact that you are reducing each day by that small amount, and over the course of that entire time it results in the actual number of people being sick being significantly lower, however, this assumes compliance with wearing masks by everyone for the duration that the virus exists.  Given that numerous animals have demonstrated the ability to be a reservoir for this virus, I think it is safe to say this is endemic and that means masks forever.</p>
<p>Let's assume, again for simplicity, we trust current estimates of the R0 and say it is between 4.7 and 7.3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321000436">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321000436</a></p>
<p>I will again be lazy for this exercise and use 5 because it is a nice round number, just like 2% is.  then that effectively means masks make the R0 of 5 become 4.8.  We take 1/4.8 instead of 1/5 and multiply that by the entire population and the IFR and compare the differences to get the number of lives saved by masks.</p>
<p>Now we have to demonstrate that this number is higher than the number of lives lost as a result of forcing people to wear masks.  This includes the fact that we are dehumanizing everyone and it results in many unintended consequences as a result.  There is a reason executions occur where the face of the person being executed is obscured.  It is not simply that, there are so many other factors including economic well-being, ability to seek medical care, etc.  If you look at Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/five-hour-ambulance-delays-outside-hospitals-a-public-health-disaster-20210421-p57l5k.html">https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/five-hour-ambulance-delays-outside-hospitals-a-public-health-disaster-20210421-p57l5k.html</a></p>
<p>The mistake is assuming these things exist in a vacuum.  This is a horrible assumption because other negative consequences occur.  The best defense against pandemics is having a robust healthcare, economic, and sanitation system.</p>
<p>Just an aside on the Vitamin D, the point is there is more evidence to suggest it is effective than masks and I have no respect for anyone that is pushing masks before Vitamin D because I consider that virtue signaling at the expense of health.  If you are going to push masks, on someone, you should ALWAYS be asking if they are taking Vitamin D first, and be trying to push that on them, before you ever even think about bringing up the topic of masks.</p>

        <p>You could’ve saved yourself a lot of effort with the subsequent analysis (even <em>if</em> it was internally valid, which I suspect it isn’t), because your understanding of the 2% value is flawed. </p>
<p>And no shade on you for that, it’s very much not straightforward stuff. It took me a while to wrap my head around it after playing with some numbers. And I hope you can agree that the lazy approach to interpretation is prone to error.</p>
<p>So the main basic outcome, or variable, that the study looked at was daily growth rate for cases or deaths, which is essentially a percentage increase of one day compared to the previous. The formula is available in the paper, but here’s an example to make it clear what it means. </p>
<p>So hypothetically if the total case value for a given day is 1010, and was 1000 the previous day, their formula gives a value of 0.995%, so effectively a ~1% daily increase in cases for that given day. </p>
<p>Then they took those daily growth rates and segregated them into a bunch of 20 day blocks, relative to when a mask mandate was put into place (pre- and post-) and determined an average daily growth rate for each of those blocks of 20 days. </p>
<p>And then to look at the effect of implementing a mask mandate, they used the average daily growth rate for the 20 day block immediately prior to the mandate as a baseline, and determined the difference between that and the other 20 day blocks. And difference in this scientific context has a specific meaning, a subtractive difference. </p>
<p>So to get the ‘2%’ value, they take the average daily growth rate from the 20 day block of interest and subtracted the average daily growth rate of the baseline 20 day block. So if the growth rate is lower in the 20 day block of interest, you get a negative value (like the ones you see in the “Percentage point change” columns in Table 1. </p>
<p>They do that whole process for each of the instances of counties where masks were mandated and then averaged them all together, so that they can combine the data of many counties with different case and death rates. </p>
<p>So what the ‘2%’ value actually means is that the average daily growth rate for that 20 day block was ‘2’ percentage points less in than what it was for the 20 day block before before the mask mandate in absolute terms, not that the daily growth rate with masks was 98% of what it was without them.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if the average daily case rate at baseline was 4%, and masks were found to reduce it by ‘2’ percentage points, that would mean the average daily case rate for the 20 day block with masks would be 2%. That would be 50% less new cases per day on average. </p>
<p>And of course if the baseline was 20%, a ‘2’ percentage point decrease to 18% wouldn’t be that significant (only a 10% decrease). But remember that this is the daily case rate averaged over 20 days, so the magnitude are constrained to pretty low values by the nature of the data. Otherwise, you’d be getting into exponential runaway territory pretty quick (eg if the 20 day average was 10%, that would be going from 1000 to ~6700 cases over those 20 days. If it was 20%, it would go from 1000 to ~38000. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the nature of this type study is that there isn’t a defined baseline average daily case rate, so I don’t think you can directly quantify how much the statistically-significant effect of masks is. But hopefully I’ve explained it well enough that you can see how dismissing the effectiveness of masks as only ‘2%’ based on this study is entirely misleading. </p>
<p>And I’m not going to go to bat for this study that it’s the be-all end-all of mask efficacy, because it isn’t, it has weaknesses for sure. But it’s a decent piece of evidence  contributing to the totality of the evidence supporting their usefulness. And to take the the study as indicating masks have minimal benefit is a just plain wrong interpretation.</p>

<p>People believing different things is vital to reforming bad behavior and practices. If everyone simply followed the "advice" and narrative, we would still be killing people by placing them on ventilators.

        <p>Well, I wouldn't be surprised if the shots are less effective than reported. I heard the two mRNA ones were tested earlier and under less harsh conditions than the J&amp;J.  Under real strain they might trend towards 68% relative risk reduction, which would mean you'd be around a 2/3rds  not vaxxed to 1/3rd vax covid patients.</p>

        <p>Maybe, but I really doubt it going to be effective at all. New strains will bypass it and who knows what variants may come from a vaccinated population. Then you have immune enhanced infection as a risk for the vaxxed.  Also, what about 2 years from now. How many shots will you have to have...if you even live that long.</p>

        <p>In my country there are some worrying numbers of people who have serious health problems after the vax. Some young and healthy people died after taking it but media and the government don't want to talk about them at all because it would be like admitting a mistake as the pro vax propaganda was very strong and is still going on.</p>

        <p>Are the deaths really recently vaccinated? Like less than the 2 weeks they say are needed to get immunity?</p>
<p>I actually don’t think in this case that VAERS reporting is going to be as low as 1%. I think it could easily be as high as 50% because of these unique circumstances where it WAS rushed, and where it’s brand new. People are paying attention to side effects of this vaccine way more than like MMR vaccine before school. So there’s hope to believe deaths aren’t as high as 50k</p>
<p>(I’m an “anti-vaxxer” for the record - I used to be pro vaccine but now fuck that and fuck it all, my trust is gone with this rushed vaccine and now the passports)</p>

        <p>I agree with your thinking, that reporting is higher than 1%. However the real question is how much risk is too much? 25k deaths? 15k? What risk category do they fall under, because I'm seeing a lot of deaths in young people who aren't even at risk when they catch covid.</p>

Pneumopathologies including atypical were used to be treated early with various antibiotics before 2020 and for decades
Why not treating this now with available antibiotics protocols including azithromycin, ivermectin and so on?</p>

        <p>Well it's also because emergency authorization for vaxx is only possible if no official treatment and of course if you don't treat old seek people you crowd hospital icu and boost deaths so it looks like a pandemic if you add the Drosten scam pcr, but I wanted to hear op on that</p>

<p>You guys have no proper education on medical research, you're educated and trained just as technicians to perform your tasks but confuse that with expertise on things beyond your scope. </p>
<p>You're prone to DK and now here you are spreading bullshit. Not that it matters, this sub is for loons like you but I can't help but be disgusted at seeing people take your word as authority on a subject you're not. It's like taking the "expert opinion" of dental assistant on oral herpes. They are trained to support the dentist and to treat, they are not experts on infectious diseases or the mouth.</p>

<p>&rt;Now, let’s talk about the protein folding. Can you characterize the in vivo protein folding of the coronavirus spike protein, or do we just hope it folds properly? I think you know the answer</p>
<p>What reason do you have to think the spike protein is misfolding?</p>
<p>If it is misfolding, what are your concerns? The spike protein isn't meant to have any functuality and instead is only meant to be recognized by the immune system to confer antibodies that are effective at recognizing the natural spike protein.</p>

        <p>My concerns are performing the “produce the antigen” phase of vaccine production inside of cells. We really confirm that the spike protein was folded correctly by antibody assay, yet we’re do not know the downstream in vivo implications of this type of therapy, since we did not complete the long term studies. We technically understand more about covid, it’s not like sars 2 is magically unlike the other coronaviruses.</p>
<p>Tell me: why not produce the spike protein in a lab, and verify that you have created the correct molecule, and then inject people with that? That’s what I’m looking to have injected into me ASAP. Getting my flu vaccine now regularly, since I don’t want to die when I get exposed to the flu again.</p>
<p>Injecting the instructions and assuming it will work with no deleterious effects, begs a much larger question. What cellular chaperones will be responsible to fold the coronavirus spike protein? Instead of answering the question, where you have to admit that human understanding of protein synthesis is limited, you come back at me with a follow up question.</p>
<p>Just admit: the post-translation processes are not fully understood, and we do take a leap of faith in trusting their proper execution. No single paper has ever attempts to characterize past primary sequence—-&rt; properly folded protein. Misfolded proteins can be benign or pathological.</p>

<p>We wouldn't have any vaccines now, that method is more expensive and takes longer.</p>
<p>However, these type of vaccines are being manufactured still but they just aren't as fast or as easy to adapt for any new variants. Honestly, mRNAs are the way of the future.</p>
<p>&rt; Injecting the instructions and assuming it will work with no deleterious effects, begs a much larger question. What cellular chaperones will be responsible to fold the coronavirus spike protein? </p>
<p>Presumably the same, if any, that fold the natural spike protein. Assuming that the virus doesn't provide its own, otherwise the protein would likely fold fine on its own.</p>
<p>&rt; Just admit: the post-translation processes are not fully understood, and we do take a leap of faith in trusting their proper execution. No single paper has ever attempts to characterize past primary sequence—-&rt; properly folded protein. Misfolded proteins can be benign or pathological. </p>
<p>So basically all you have is hypothetical "something could go wrong" and ignoring what we do know.</p>
<p>All I know is that little harm has come from the vaccines so far in comparison to the virus, I'd take my odds with the vaccine over getting infected.</p>

<p>Degrees, proof of employment, licensing, etc, isn't patient info.</p>
<p>Even if they don't want to provide that info for their own privacy unrelated to HIPAA, they just said HIPAA as an excuse because they don't know what it is.</p>

        <p>Yea but we are just discussing similar situations like people do all the time. I'm thinking your trying to make a point that our discussion is pointless and amounts to nothing. If anything we are seeing a pattern in different locations that alone means something. </p>
<p>The thing is that generally in subsequent its all about like minded people so we're all group thinking. But this is such an insanely obvious situation that usually doesn't even need to be pointed out. People generally know we are talking to like minded people in this sub. It's kind of the point.</p>

        <p>Michigan is in fact a perplexing situation. The only explanation i would have is they didn't have as many per capita infections as other states had in the past year so the virus has more hosts to go through at this point over there. But i'm not sure if that's even correct</p>

        <p>I'll reply, but it's funny the same thing happens just about anywhere else. It's funny that, for the most part, popularity is tantamount to truth in the age of social media. It's funny that within the online public spaces, in which we live most of our lives, only specific ideas, thoughts, or beliefs, are shared in the grand scheme. It's funny that when examined social media is closer to antisocial media, instead of encouragement you see large scale shaming, a false sense of moral superiority, critique without solutions, all boiled down to very simple rhetoric anyone can understand. What you're witnessing is <strong>propaganda.</strong> </p>
<p>Some people are so used to seeing propaganda they see nothing wrong. Some people are so used to it they can't even recognize that it keeps telling them what other people's propaganda says, thinking what they just saw wasn't. They'll see the same perspective day in and day out, failing to recognize that they too are watching propaganda. If you're on Reddit, you see propaganda on the front page every single day. I don't expect anyone to read <a href="https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-reddit-headlines-pythons-nltk/">this link</a> at the very least I want you to read the title of the article, I truly hope the implications are apparent. I hope people understand one day what "selling data" truly means in the context of websites. I hope people see what this means on social media with your name on it. Of course I'm asking you to use your imagination, I'm not going to prime it with anything. All I want is for people to be aware of this implication. That's it. I'm not telling you you're wrong about what you're saying and anyone here is right. I apply this implication to even here. I think it's sad that the generation just after mine had to grow up on social media.</p>

        <p>Agree.  We do need people to speak out.  We need people that are trustworthy, don't have a previous "anti-vaxx" background, and will certify as to the validity of their claims.  </p>
<p>This entire sub has done a decent job of backing it's stance by showing the mindless rantings and meaningless rhetoric of the "new normal" crowd.  Let's be careful not to fall into traps of group-think by accepting every single post as the gospel truth.  Need some validation to this OP's post, without giving away their anonymity.</p>

        <p>That would be hard. We use v60's which have been upgraded to perform HFNC with a heated circuit? We use 980's but have some 840's.  We also are looking into some vapotherms because they ventilate vs just oxygenate with a traditional high flow system.  Anyway</p>

        <p>It’s difficult to do this, especially when wanting to remain anonymous. It’s better to hear first hand account from people you do know and can trust but I do appreciate people sharing. We’ve seen doctors come out and say this appears to be unethical from what they’re seeing in their patients so you can surmise that anecdotes like this are most likely happening. But I do get what you’re saying for sure.</p>

        <p>Technically they're right. If you want to be taken seriously, you should provide proof of occupation in some manner. Idk how it'd be reasonable to do so without giving up your private info however.</p>

        <p>So, I should say nothing.  All people seeing what's happening should just say nothing.  I mean...go trust the msm then.  Use your best judgement.</p>

        <p>No you can absolutely voice what you see. I believe you, but with a grain of salt. I would 100% take your words as truth if I had some proof.</p>
<p>And I think it's a bit silly of people to downvote me to oblivion for asking for evidence so I can be sure. I'm on your side guys, but it's best if I had something to back up your claims. :)</p>
