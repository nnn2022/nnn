    <strong>What to do if you "catch Covid"? Did you?</strong>
    <p><p>I've thought about this. What if I get sick and test positive for Covid? Or would I even get tested if I get flu symptoms? There are several treatments and much controversy. I think that the process of finding the best treatment is negatively influenced by politics a lot right now. It's probably better to power through and not get professional "help" than to seek treatment in a super spreader place like a hospital and catch god knows what. Artificial respiration is a topic for itself. I'm middle-aged, the danger is minimal. It's still scary. It would put your belief to the test. Certainly an extreme situation. Did you experience it?</p></p>

        <p>&rt; I'm middle-aged, the danger is minimal. It's still scary. </p>
<p>It shouldn't be. And you shouldn't be scared.</p>
<p>I'm middle aged too. I got covid back in March. It was a nasty flu. As far as I understand it (and it would make 100% sense given that's what viruses have always done, bar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease">humans trying to play god</a>) it's much milder now. Still it wasn't something I would have noticed back in say 2018.</p>
<p>Covid deaths have the exact same distribution age wise as all causes deaths. It means it's not something that <em>kills</em>, it's something that gives you that little push you need in case you're on the brink already. See median age of death and, again, the fact that it mimics the all causes distribution perfectly.</p>
<p>So if you're healthy, no matter what age you are, you have zero reason to worry about it. Well, if you worried about the flu killing you in 2018, then be scared. But, did you?</p>
<p>Say I take 100 people and I force them to jump into a very deep pool. 5 of them can't swim. Expected mortality for the event? 5%</p>
<p>Say now I do the same again, but <em>you</em> are one of those 100 people. What's your chance of dying?</p>
<p>See where I'm getting?</p>

        <p>Yes, I caught COVID back in May 2020 when it hadn’t mutated to be less serious. The only medical assistance I needed was for 1 day- I had my GP call in an rx for an emergency inhaler on the absolute worst day. The remaining 6-14 days recovering felt like a hangover.</p>
<p>I’m actually pretty glad I had COVID. There really doesn’t seem to be much evidence that you can get it twice at this moment.</p>

        <p>Everyone's bodies are different, obviously. We all have different genetics so this virus attacks us all differently.
For some of us it is a mild cold, for some of us it's the flu, or some of us it came and went without raising an eyebrow. Then there are us lucky few who for some reason won of the covid genetic lottery and get sicker than most.</p>
<p>For me personally, I was deathly sick. The spike proteins were hammering my kidneys, my blood, and my ability to produce testosterone. My blood was clotting in a way that could have killed me at any moment. Yay covid lottery! It's all a crap shoot really.</p>
<p>Should you be afraid of it? Absolutely not. You should take it at least partially serious if you get it but don't do anything extreme to avoid it. I'm happy I got my natural immunity.</p>
<p>Now that I have done my time with covid and have been intimate with it all the pro-vaxxers and pro-maskers can lick my naturally immune balls.</p>

        <p>Haven't been sick since 2017.<br>
But here's what I'd do now:  </p>
<p>I'd just call in sick and stay at home but avoid going to a doctor and getting tested. If they require proof of a doctor and don't just accept my own judgement (not sure if this has changed due to covid), I'd even take some of my vacation-days for that.</p>

        <p>I had it in November. First let me say I have a slew of health problems and expected to need treatment. At first it was just like a bad cold. After a few days I noticed I was getting out of breath and my lungs ached doing simple things like getting in and out of bed. I checked my oxygen it dropped into the low 90's, then 80's, then 70's. I packed a bag and went to the hospital figuring is be on oxygen for a few days.</p>
<p>I recommend picking up an oximeter so you can easily monitor your oxygen. But it wasn't as bad as they made it out to be.</p>

        <p>I got it. Had to be tested for work. Me and my gf just chilled and played video games and watch TV shows. It sucked it was in Feb so being trapped inside isn’t fun. </p>
<p>I was pretty tired (was also working 3rd shift at the time). Had normal cold like symptoms. No fever, no loss of taste, etc. I am 26 and workout 5-6 times a week and eat very healthy. </p>
<p>We made a bunch of fruit salad and ate a bunch more veggies than normal. I was also taking a multi w/ 5000iu D3, quercetin, zinc/elderberry gummies, and NAC through the entire winter in case I caught as I’ve read they’re all beneficial. I gave my girl some once we got sick but prior she was only taking the gummies daily. She’s also anemic. Her symptoms were same as mine. She even began to drink wine every night after like day 4. Our symptoms lasted 6-7 days</p>

        <p>People forget normal flu can be horrible but apparently that vanished last winter in the most of the world, it didn’t it was just rebranded. I was hallucinating, cold sweats and couldn’t eat in 2018 winter and had a really bad chest infection in 2019 that was most likely from flu.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  When people say how much worse "COVID" is than the 'flu, most haven't really experienced just how bad 'flu is.  You can die from it.  </p>
<p>And yes, I agree: the 'flu (and colds and all manner of other things) have just been rebranded as "COVID" (with the help of a dodgy "test").</p>

        <p>Speculation:
Convinced I had it bc a guy at work (kitchen) tested positive.. (twice) never went to the hospital (not telling anyone to avoid hospitals) and didn't feel anything until the one night it hit I couldn't breathe but I recovered by morning.. the not smelling anything was the strangest part.. that came and went.</p>
