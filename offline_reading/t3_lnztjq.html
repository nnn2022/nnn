    <strong>How is it possible that the "fiery but peaceful protests" over the summer didn't red pill everyone?</strong>
    <p><p>For me that was the moment when I stopped believing that the China Virus was a threat. If it was a real threat, then all of these medical associations wouldn't have put out statements saying that "racism is a public health crisis". Either the China Virus is deadly or it isn't.</p>
<p>We're meant to believe that gathering with friends makes us a grandma killer but BLM-Antifa Biden supporters were allowed to:</p>

<p>It's so weird how all of that shit got swept under the rug. No one criticizes these rioters for spreading the China Virus. Don't even get me started on the fact that the same people who lied and called those events "peaceful protests" are the same ones who are now expecting us to trust them about COVID. How is it possible that so many people believe politicians and media who are clearly liars? What makes them think that they wouldn't be lying about everything?</p>
<p>It's so disappointing to see how gullible people are.</p></p>

        <p>It was so crazy how one day they just switched from calling them "peaceful protesters" to calling them the "Trump riots". It was a seamless switch and every media outlet and democrat politician did it on the same day and no one addressed it.</p>

        <p>They didn't see it because they didn't want to. They wanted to virtue signal about BLM too badly. I saw acquaintances doing it left and right. I even saw comments calling it out and their response was to the effect of "this is more important than covid".</p>

        <p>Nobody I know actually tried that, but I've seen it around. They really felt that BLM was so important that it was worth the risk. And nobody questioned the whole world rallying behind the US suddenly? I did and so did my coworker who happens to be black. It was stupidly obvious that it was all planned. And before this I never gave a conspiracy "theory" even one second of my time. It didn't affect me too much, so I didn't care.</p>

        <p>Even without the violence, if coming into contact with others was supposedly so deadly, yet huge crowds were not only allowed, but encouraged. </p>
<p>I was cynical enough to have thought those cheering for the riots (&amp; they did cheer for rioting, not protesting) were hoping to kill off a huge amount of Black people. While cheering riots they were also saying that Blacks were more likely to die of Covid!</p>
<p>Then... No 'superspreaders', no tracing of even a single case. Yet Florida Spring Break was supposedly traced to hundreds? </p>
<p>That was when the bullshit started to stench.</p>

        <p>This was a major turning point for me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it's okay to protest?  What?  In the middle of a "fucking pandemic" (to steal their phrase)!?</p>
<p>I've spoken to people close to be about this, and their eyes gloss over.  Then they mutter something about "this was an important cause".</p>
<p>I shake my head as if I don't understand.</p>
<p>Then they say, "some things are more important than a pandemic".</p>
<p>And I say, "Yes!  Like our lives and freedom!!"</p>
<p>Then they get confused.  And usually at that point someone comes in and says something stupid like, "are you racist bruh?"</p>
<p>It's utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>I think everyone has gone completely insane.  They are blinded by a partisan requirement to be part of a group.  </p>
<p>Therefore, they can be coerced into believing what is obviously one of the biggest double standards this year.</p>

        <p>When george floyd tested positive for covid, I thought the new world order would be forced to choose between covid and “social justice” and couldn’t have both. How naive I was. They are all powerful, and they just saw it as an opportunity to further troll us. The riots in my city contributed to the lockdown bc it made going out in public dangerous.</p>

        <p>It certainly red pilled me lol, and this is coming from someone who was pretty liberal before 2020.</p>
<p>From what I gather from interactions, those who haven’t have been fed this idea that black people are still oppressed and cops just target them willynilly, which is especially exaggerated in how the news keeps portraying criminals as martyrs.  They think they’re fighting to protect an “oppressed group” because its what they’ve been fed. </p>
<p>2020 red pilled me as a whole, from seeing how the majority of those pushing for reopening being republican (I know that there are liberal skeptics though) and the TQWTF community ruining everything that the LGB community fought for.</p>

        <p>It was so insane to see how every. single. time. that they rioted it turned out to be a justified shooting. It was always a black guy pulling a gun or a knife on cops and getting what he deserved. </p>

        <p>Exactly!  I tried explaining this to an ex-friend who supported blm and it just went in one ear and out the other.  She just said “well, we’re just gonna have to disagree” and I thought “disagree with the truth?!”.  This is the kinda chick who casts judgment on cops from the comfort of her couch while cops are out risking their lives to keep us safe.  But this was also the special kinda case who thought cops should be replaced with social workers.</p>
<p>I used to work at a coffeeshop and always made sure to be super generous and give free drinks to officers in uniform when they came after that.  My co-workers gave me the stank eye but I don’t care, at least I let my actions reflect my beliefs.</p>

        <p>I sure don't want to touch it. It's often a code word for becoming a racist now. 10 years ago it was just a hip reference to enlightnement within buddhism. The false reality you woke up from was our inate human delusions about ego and such, the matrix was samsara. Now it's often a reference to full blown conspiracy theories and hate.</p>

        <p>You're confusing clickbait for politics. </p>
<p>Reddit massively upvoting things like "all cops are bastards" is stupid. But that's clickbait, not politics. My political beliefs aren't going to flip inside out just because of stupid clickbait which is only meant to farm my attention for advertising profits. </p>
<p>The stupid BLM shit was an entire exercise in the left confusing clickbait for politics. "Were being gunned down in the streets!" Then you saw people on reddit making the exact sort of posts like this one, shocked that anyone could possibly be conservative after seeing the george floyd video. "Aren't you outraged!? How can anyone possibly vote republican after this!" Think the right doesn't do that? Yeah they do, "Stop the Steal!"</p>
<p>Corrupt politicians are real, systematic racism is real, but most of the top posts you see about them on social media is tabloid level garbage.</p>
