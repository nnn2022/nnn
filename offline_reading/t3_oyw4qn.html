    <strong>The mindset of people not wearing masks since the latest stuff about the Delta Variant</strong>
    <p><p>This is the second time within the past 10 days that I've gone out to the store since it has been recommended that vaccinated people start wearing masks again, and I have to tell you, a lot of people were not wearing them, myself among them. I was quite surprised. My town is woke so I have been wondering about the people who were not wearing masks. Is it safe to assume that those not wearing the masks have the same mindset that we do here, or is there another possible explanation? I did notice that there's no "mask required" signs (but there are "masks strongly recommended" signs) at the front door of the stores I was at, maybe that's it; but wouldn't the people freaking out about the Delta Variant still be wearing their masks? (there were people wearing the masks as well)</p></p>

        <p>Variants are a lie.   They have not isolated the virus yet.   People are done with the bullshit.</p>

        <p>all they do behind the scenes is pose for pictures to put in the news. all the symptoms of covid are the exact same as the cold/flu. the doctors tell everyone who comes in they have covid because that's what theyre paid to do</p>

        <p>I have not seen much change. I live in an area that has handled the situation terribly with the harshest measures and worst results, but it is not in the south and thus not really on the radar for now, though "cases" are spiking. Deaths are also up 200% from a month ago (from 1 per day to 3). Scary when you use percentages.</p>
<p>I expect widespread panic in October or November, including another mandate. These businesses don't want to create a mandate on their own, though. People say they're private businesses and can do what they want. Sure, but you can't say they're doing what they want when they are being forced.</p>

        <p>I see a slight uptick in people wearing masks, but mainly from elderly people. And I guess they do have the most free time to watch the 6pm news and oh golly oh my the world is dangerous again.</p>
<p>As for not seeing the signs, I think if they put them up, it’d make them look weak. Because a lot of people will never wear them again. It will look like they’re not in control.</p>
