    <strong>Pfizer FDA Approval</strong>
    <p><p>One argument I see a lot from people who don't want to get vaccinated is that these vaccines only have emergency use approval. Pfizer applied for full FDA approval in the beginning of May, and the only difference between full approval and emergency use is providing the FDA with 6 months of safety data vs 2 months of safety data post vaccination.</p>
<p>My question is, when the FDA approves it fully, will you actually take the vaccine since this concern will have been addressed?</p></p>

        <p>All three absolutely will get approval though. There will be a lot of unprecedented things that happen, and it won't be because we've magically leapt forward with medical technology. It will be because of lies and corruption.</p>

        <p>They also haven't shown it is actually effective.  The absolute risk reduction is about 1% for them.  Also, they didn't challenge the vaccinated with the actual virus.  Then, the CDC stopped counting breakthrough cases unless the person is hospitalized or dies.  This is very suspicious.  Standard practice is to report all and stratify the data.</p>

        <p>Ive also read that approx 10% of vaccine side effects get reported my uncle in law got moderna and was found dead in his garden 5 days later, alone with no trauma his death was marked as natural, the man was very healthy. I can only imagine the magnitudes of cases where the vaccines side effects didnt count because the person was old. But if they have a heart attack with covid in their system its a covid death??</p>

        <p>The concern has not been addressed; quite the opposite. It's been subverted. Many people aren't taking it because it hasn't had ample time to be tested. Expediting doesn't do anything to assuage those fears. In fact, it makes it clear that they don't have any intention of making sure it is safe. </p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that the virus &rt;99.7 recovery rate, it makes zero sense why they're expediting the approval process. </p>
<p>If you don't see the issue behind that, I don't know what to tell you. </p>
<p>Besides that, it's up to each individual what they choose to do with their body, and the coercion and bribery hardly breed confidence, especially when they're bribing with unhealthy shit while saying it's "for your health". </p>
<p>Tbh they've already betrayed my trust, so there's very little that could be done to regain that trust. Just ask my ex wife about that.</p>

        <p>I completely agree that the pharmaceutical industry is screwed up for multiple reasons, but these vaccines went through all of the exact same amounts of testing as any other vaccine. The only reason it could happen so fast was that animal trials and human trials happened at the same time rather than one after the other (along with a decade+ of mRNA research that started after SARS). </p>
<p>I had the same concerns about rushed vaccines last year, but since then there's been overwhelming real world data that these vaccines are safe.</p>

        <p>That's absolutely malarkey. Most vaccines go through decades worth of testing. </p>
<p>There is no overwhelming data of them being safe, nor can there be. </p>
<p>Please tell me how the long-term testing has gone?</p>
<p>Ohh. Yeah. The long term studies are non-existent. That's right. You're not making any sense. </p>
<p>I'm curious. Do you know the outcome of the animal trials? I'm pretty sure nobody does because they were halted once the animals started dying. That's right when they moved onto human testing. </p>
<p>You must be getting paid to have this opinion, as it's just blatant misinformation. Please, find another platform for your lies; we are not interested.</p>

        <p>Even expidited, the approval takes about 8 months.  They also have to show the vaccine doesn't produce antibody dependent enhancement, and this can take 18-24 months to manifest.  The 6 months of safety data has to do with things like Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p>

        <p>I don't understand - what incentive would there be for the FDA to intentionally approve something that is harmful? If their findings show it's not safe why would they green light it anyway? While some amount of mistrust in government can be understandable, they're not out to kill you.</p>

        <p>As long as my risk factor is extremely low and my chance at death still less than 1 percent nope I am not taking this. If I I ever did there would have to be years of data. I am middle aged and not afraid of death at all. I am not fear driven and my trust has been completely destroyed in government and the healthcare industry and it wasn’t great to begin with. I work in healthcare and I wish I could get out of it now.</p>

<p>It's still gene therapy, which is okay if you're up front about that fact... Not to say gene therapy doesn't have the potential to be useful.. but it's too new for me to take it with confidence, especially as a preemptive treatment for something I'm very likely to survive.</p>

        <p>I am fully vaccinated for most things and have two vaccine books. I'd need to check for Africa recommendations/requirements, but I am so paranoid of Ebola I will not go anywhere near an old or potential outbreak site. I take biologics every few weeks so I am not adverse to jabs.</p>
<p>If (or when) it is approved at the end of the experiment then I will try to critically reexamine things. It will be hard because the push to take it is leaving a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>I know they are expediting things but do you have a link for the statement  <strong>"the only difference between full approval and emergency use is providing the FDA with 6 months of safety data vs 2 months of safety data post vaccination."</strong>?</p>
<p>That is not my understanding and is not the estimated study completion date provided by Moderna and Pfizer.</p>
<p>The documents filed by Moderna to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 6, 2020 explain some of the risks in marketing a mRNA drug. They also explain why it may take longer than the estimated study completion date. Moderna states “As a potential new class of medicines, <strong>no mRNA medicines have been approved to date by the FDA or other regulatory agency</strong>...Prior to the Phase 3 trial for mRNA-1273 and that of one other company, there had never been a Phase 3 trial in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient, and <strong>there has never been and there may never be a commercialized product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient.</strong> ... Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because <strong>no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain.</strong>”

<p>On 25 Feb, 2021 the National Library of Medicine (NIH) published the clinical trials documents submitted by Moderna. The documents state that the “Actual Study Start Date: July 27, 2020...Estimated Primary Completion Date: October 27, 2022...Estimated Study Completion Date: October 27, 2022”

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be veryexciting for medicine and groundbreaking as no mRNA vaccine has ever passed Phase III clinical trials. mRNA could potentially save many lives and help eradicate many diseases!</p>

        <p>I read the page and I trust NPR more than the cable news orgs. I also read the press release and can now see why you say it may be approved soon.</p>
<p>Traditionally Phase III trials take 3 years if my understanding is correct. Pfizer put down 2023 in their clinical trial document. On 4 May, 2021 the US National Library of Medicine (NIH) updated the published clinical trials documents submitted by Pfizer. The documents state that the “Actual Study Start Date: April 29, 2020 ... Estimated Primary Completion Date: October 29, 2021 ... Estimated Study Completion Date: April 6, 2023” You can read it yourself here: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?term=NCT04368728&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 or the permalink here https://archive.is/z3iIN</p>
<p>Maybe they mean in February?</p>
<p>I know FDA is putting a lot of horsepower behind it to get it approved fast but after things like the Thalidomide tragedy I really hope they give it at least another year of safety testing.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

        <p>So the long term/damaging side effects of COVID are not a big deal at all and not worth taking any mitigation measures against, but the overwhelmingly temporary ones for the vaccine are? I'm genuinely just trying to understand the distinction.</p>

        <p>Just being honest though no one has any long term data on either yet.  There just isn't.  Long term effects have been observed in the flu as well and most people accept that risk every day, they are just likely never linked to the flu.  I think most people on the fence don't have enough data yet to be convinced covid is more harmful in the long run is all.  Most of these people are mitigating risk in every other way we've been told so far and could very well manage to avoid getting it this whole time. That's the risk they want to take as of now and it's okay.</p>
<p>I think its mostly a thing of either subjecting yourself to something there's no reversal of if there ends up being a risk of disorders later on versus the very real possibility of successfuly avoiding covid during the whole outbreak. Asymptomatic cases aside of course.</p>
<p>Some people weighed the risks with the current data and went and got it and that's perfectly okay. Theres just a lot of people out there that dig into long term risks before taking any medication whatsoever.  Just like you have the opposite where people want pills and injections to cure every single ailment they have.  You should be able to be presented with the best available data and choose either one you'd like.</p>

        <p>No because it still doesn't address the concerns. It would add more concerns considering more adverse reactions are being reported more frequently. </p>
<p>I still don't see the need for me to get it, and so I won't. Even if it was without risks of adverse reactions. Same as I dont get the flu jab.</p>

        <p>I’m gonna let my T cells and non synthetic antibodies have a crack at covid</p>
<p>Update:  already happened I think. Who knows but not afraid of this virus anymore now that those who feel the need to “protect” themselves can do so.</p>

        <p>Lol no. The FDA is just another corrupt organization. </p>
<p>Approval of this vaccine will not make me get it. I am in the best shape of my life and don't subscribe to the bullshit of "its not about you" </p>
<p>Plus the FDA has a shit track record</p>
<p>https://allthatsinteresting.com/fda-mistakes</p>
<p>And I haven't been brainwashed by corrupt media into thinking  pharmaceutical companies are all of a sudden run by good people who are out to improve the world. They are run by and always have been run by greedy pieces of shit who would prostitute their children for profits. </p>
<p>https://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Article/2019/09/04/Reputation-of-pharma-industry-sinks-to-new-low</p>
<p>So no vaccine for me. I choose to exercise everyday and watch what I eat and drink. My body and immune system are healthy and fully capable of taking on whatever super viruses Dr. Fauci cooks up in CCP labs.</p>

        <p>Look at this fucking account. 3 years. Virtually no comment karma, whatever post(s) accrued the submission karma is gone. No posts older than a few months.</p>
<p>We need to stop responding to these "people". It's a waste of time.</p>
