    <strong>Vladimir Putin compared what is happening to the eve of WWII</strong>
    <p><p>Putin, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, compared what is happening to the eve of World War II.</p>
<p>"There is every reason to assume that there are risks of further escalation of contradictions. And such trends can manifest themselves practically in all spheres. Of course, there are no direct parallels in history. But some experts - I respect their opinion - compare the current situation with the 30s of the 20th century. You can agree or disagree with this, but in many respects, in terms of the scale and the complex, systemic nature of the challenges and potential threats, certain analogies can be drawn.</p>
<p>"International institutions are weakening, the number of regional conflicts is increasing, and the system of global security is degrading.</p>
<p>"Contradictions are spiraling... The failure to solve similar problems in the twentieth century resulted in the catastrophe of World War II."</p>
<p>"Such a global, heated conflict is impossible in our time.</p>
<p>I really hope so. It would mean the end of civilization.</p>
<p>"But the situation could develop unpredictably and uncontrollably. Unless, of course, nothing is done to prevent this from happening."</p>

<p>So there you go. Great Depression (massive crisis of overproduction) ended in a world war. And the current crisis of overproduction is also going to end in a war.</p>
<p>Unless the masses wake up. </p>

        <p>This is interesting, as I'd assumed Putin's longevity and success was due to being NWO compliant (as China appears to be).</p>

        <p>Unless we wake up..this feels so much like some sort of 'Inception of Wokeness'. Like you thought all was well and America is good..no, we are evil and always have been, but we're changing, no we're just following our material interests which diversity happens to fall into, and a virus now threatens the health of the world we suddenly give a shit about but no jk we're trying to soft ball yet another of our fuck ups while consolidating our power and crushing yours...They wonder why we distrust them</p>

        <p>Current geopolitical tensions like before-World War II, warned Russian President, Putin. He said if the tensions remain unresolved, it could cause an 'all against all' conflict leading to the 'End Of Civilization'. It is necessary to increase dialogue and cooperation at the international level to prevent that, said President Putin.</p>
