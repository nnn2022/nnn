    <strong>My father got the jab and I’m worried about him. I don’t know who to talk to about this.</strong>
    <p><p>My father is 60. His favorite thing to do is go on cruises. He got the first Phizer jab last week because he doesn’t want to be prohibited from going on cruise ships. </p>
<p>I’m worried about him. He said he has not experienced any side effects whatsoever. I refuse to get it and I told him my concerns but he made his own decision. </p>
<p>I tell myself that he’ll be fine and I shouldn’t worry about the vaccine, but if I were to lose him suddenly over this after everything that’s been taken from me this past year I don’t think I could handle it.</p></p>

        <p>Don't mean to upset anyone, but I honestly think if mass depopulation or sterility are the actual goals here, there likely isn't a placebo (except for celebrities and politicians who take it on live TV or streams).</p>

        <p>My parents almost got it and I was so worried, so I completely understand. I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this anxiety and all these unknowns. One thing we have to remember is that not every single person is going to have a reaction. Yes, a lot of people are, but much like Covid, it’s very easy to scare ourselves because we hear all the horror stories.
Keep an eye on him as best you can, and just pray for his continued health.
I definitely don’t think this is a safe vaccine, it’s wildly untested and sketchy, but it’s also not an automatic death sentence.</p>

        <p>I've said this before on this sub.  My mom pre jab was a level headed and fun 77 year old.  Oh sure like everybody she had her bad days but post jab?  Jesus she's a roller coaster of emotion.  One day she'll be a total raging bitch, the next she just wants to sit and cry, the next she's fine, and so on we go.  Both parents have been to the hospital since the jab with 'unrelated' issues.  Bullshit.  We moved in with them three years ago to help them out so they didn't have to go to assisted living but I'm starting to reconsider that decision just for my own mental health.  I love them to death but I don't know how much more of this roller coaster my wife and I can take.</p>

        <p>He will almost certainly be fine. Most people that get the vaccine are! and I think if he got it last week he’s now unlikely to have any additional side effects if they haven’t emerged already. </p>
<p>I think the Pfizer is one of the two shot ones, and with those I think people might have more side effects (e.g. feeling bad for a day or two) after the second shot. So just a heads up that he might feel bad after the second shot, but it doesn’t necessarily mean much and will very probably go away a few days after that.</p>

        <p>There’s absolutely ZERO way of you knowing this. That he didn’t die immediately or shortly thereafter is luck. These experimental gene therapies are what’s known as “soft kill” mechanisms. Research what’s possibly waiting for him down the line. He made this ill informed decision and he will have to live with the consequences.</p>
