        <p>Well a few days ago I would have agreed with you, but someone here kindly started following me around and responding to my posts in other subreddits to tell people that I post here. It really woke me up to how wrong I've been!</p>
<p>I don't know what I was thinking all this time. Gyms? Close those. Playgrounds? Pfft. My kids don't need exercise, they can get that from video games!  Lockdown everything, so I can watch more news and consume more media.</p>
<p>And those passports? Oh, we need those. They'll be real helpful if any of these nasty young antimaskers or antivaxxers try to dodge the draft that's coming as soon as we need more military to help encourage those little countries that don't want to be part of the new global government.</p>
<p>Build back better! Obey, consume and then die! The more you spend, the happier you are! Get your low interest rate loans and free vaccines today! WOO!!!</p>
<p>LOCKDOWN 4 EVA 2021!  MASKS 4 LIFE!!  FREE BIDEN CHECKS TO SPEND OUR WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT!!!!!!! WOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOO!</p>
<p>Big thanks to the cyberstalker that helped me see the light.</p>

        <p>No, I actually apologized to the guy for offending him to the point that it would drive him to do that and he wrote back with a rude response but stopped doing it, at least for now.</p>
<p>I wasn't even insincere with my apology. I mean --- my goal online really isn't to offend people. Sometimes I get snarky or sarcastic, but I'm really here to try to make sense of what's actually happening and I share info with others. (Most of my posts/comments are not silly sarcasm.)</p>
<p>The fact that the system has pushed us to this level of division and hostility is further proof that they don't have our well-being in mind. I wish these people could see that. They think that it's "us against them" --- but it really is them against us.</p>
<p>After all, we aren't the ones who have asked or demanded change of anyone. In fact, we're cool with people making their own choices over their own lives. That's what this is all about...</p>
<p>Masks? Great, wear one. Lockdowns? Sure. Stay inside forever if you want.</p>
<p>But don't force it on other people. And that's the problem -- they are forcing all of this onto us. And they're doing so because they've been tricked into thinking that our normal existence is a threat to them.</p>
<p>But weirdly -- I don't even think they actually believe that. It's more an issue of conformity and rule-following for them. "Their side" is setting rules and our refusal to follow them is an affront to them.</p>
<p>The whole thing is politicized to them. They support these policies because they think "Trump supports oppose them." Except --- many of us are not Trump supporters?!? It doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>But these people don't make any sense. They're operating on emotion, not logic. That is dangerous and scary.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I wonder if the shit you're saying even exists. I search hard among liberal friends who followed the whole mask/vaccine thing, but rarely ever see actual extreme stuff unless it's produced by:</p>
<p>1) random internet strangers who you don't even know who they are (could be organizations, government, etc trying to sway you)</p>

<p>2) media</p>

        <p>Did you ever see the Matrix? If you want to believe that our government is here to help you, banks aren't here to force you into debt, Big Pharma/Big Health isn't here to profit off your sickness, news media never lies, etc...</p>
<p>You can pretend, yeah. You can pretend your life is great. You can pretend you love having to work 5 days a week to do your part making a small number of people incredibly wealthy. You can pretend you love your debt burden, be it outrageously priced education or home. You can pretend you love working your life away until you retire just before you die, too old to actually enjoy your time off.</p>
<p>But no, our reality is dark. We live in a form of modern slavery where the system tricks us into thinking we aren't --- because we'll work harder for them if we believe we're free.</p>
<p>By all means, though, if you don't want to see things for what they are then don't.</p>
<p>But if you look around at all the addiction, the self-medication, the broken families, the obesity, the eager willingness to go along with authoritarian control, etc...  Or if you look at the ever growing gap between rich and poor, and what the average worker's pay &amp; benefits are today versus 1980.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But these are all abstractions. How about a very serious warning that's happening NOW?</p>
<p>The Fed's intervention into a certain market happened right before the 2008 Financial Crisis.  And it happened in September 2019 right before Covid-19 (because the timing of this was to obscure a very real financial crisis. Surely you noticed the trillions and trillions going by even though 700billion was controversial in 2008?!)</p>
<p>Well it's happening now with record numbers. Our US news media isn't even covering it but people that follow financial markets sure know. Just look:</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000">https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000</a></p>
<p>Take a look at the repo market transactions and you'll see that number getting bigger every day for weeks. Now at 369 billion and growing.</p>
<p>There's your biggest indicator that something is about to blow.</p>
<p>Here are some other documents if you're actually interested in catching up on what's happening:</p>

<p><strong>Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert - Parker Crutchfield</strong></p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/</p>
<p><strong>National Security Study Memorandum NSSM 200 (Henry Kissinger 1975, declassified in 1989)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf">https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a></p>
<p>The first two are the best place to start. By the time you see the Solari document -- that one gets very specific and shows the role of Blackrock in all of this. (This is where it starts to get scary, with Blackrock's instructions for the Fed predating the September 2019 repo market intervention by several weeks, followed by the Fed doing exactly what Blackrock ordered/advised.)</p>
<p>The compulsory moral bioenhancement document shows you that no, people aren't crazy. There are people within our government being lobbied by pharmaceutical industries to do things that most people would think are fairy tales. But notice that's from our own US government website.</p>
<p>Then, if you have the patience, there's a 123 page document written by Henry Kissinger. After reading that you'll understand that population control is a very serious thing, and a very real thing. You'll see that our government has been behaviorally engineering people to not want to have children, and to wait until they are older to have children.</p>
<p>You may not care about that issue, but it's the tip of the iceberg in terms of how we are manipulated. It really brings the question -- does this government belong to us? Or do we belong to the government?</p>
<p>But yeah, if you want to stay in the Matrix and pretend everything's great and we're not slowly sliding into something possible terrible that we have no control over... Well fine.</p>
<p>Otherwise I gave you a starter pack that might help to open your eyes.</p>
<p>But by all means, go ahead and say none of this is real and it's all a fairy tale and we are actually very free and when we vote we determine our future and our politicians don't represent corporations as salesmen to pitch their profit agendas to the citizen peasants.</p>

        <p>I can‚Äôt believe the Kissinger memorandum actually talks about the need to develop technology to reduce fertility via injections.</p>
<p>And suddenly all the focus on women‚Äôs rights in the workplace, state-controlled education for children beginning as early as possible, farm-subsidies for minorities... starts to make more sense.</p>

        <p>It gets really creepy when you combine multiple things together, such as Kissinger's writing:</p>
<p>&rt;2. Long-term approaches: Increased research toward better understanding of human<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;reproductive physiology will lead to better methods of fertility control for use in five to fifteen<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;years. A great deal has yet to be learned about basic aspects of male and female fertility and how<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;regulation can be effected. For example, an -effective and safe male contraceptive is needed, in<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;particular an injection which will be effective for specified periods of time. Fundamental<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;research must be done but there are reasons to believe that the development of an injectable male<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;contraceptive is feasible. Another method which should be developed is an injection which will<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;assure a woman of regular periods. The drug would be given by pare-professionals once a month<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;or as needed to regularize the menstrual cycle. Recent scientific advances indicate that this<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;CONFIDENTIAL<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;CONFIDENTIAL<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;method can be developed. Approx. Increased Cost: $20 million annually.</p>
<p>And Crutchfield's lobbying for covert moral bioenhancement - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/</p>
<p>But people are trained -- programmed -- to have a mental short-circuit reaction when they hear certain keywords. To them, everything is a "conspiracy theory."</p>
<p>If only their eyes could be opened, only the connections are hidden. The specifics, separate, are all wide open.</p>
<p>I mean -- if you read the Solari report I linked, you see the linkage between Blackrock's orders, the Fed's intervention in September 2019 --- and then the lockdowns to create a situation that will make Blackrock's recommendation (demand?) possible.</p>
<p>But Blackrock's document was public information, as is the Fed's reverse-repo operations:</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000">https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000</a></p>
<p>Which you will notice exceeded $369,000,000,000 today ( ! ) and yet... no mainstream news coverage.</p>
<p>It's unreal. But our population has been dumbed down to the point they don't have a long enough attention span or the mental acuity to put all this together.</p>
<p>They just attack and call names if you try to warn them.</p>

        <p>Thanks to you I‚Äôve learned a lot from the Solari website as well as the George Gammon and GPS YouTube channels you‚Äôve linked in your past comments. Do you frequent any other blogs/websites that might be worth checking out? I would love to expand beyond just Reddit for these types of information.</p>

        <p>Oh I would never link to George Gammon -- remember what I said about once a source either lies or is grossly incorrect, they must be discarded?</p>
<p>Early on in this mess he was a fearmonger and he was doing math on charts to show how bad the deaths were going to be. It was doomsday scenario nonsense, and it was scary... And then I rewatched with my wife and she goes "Wait -- he's not even doing the math right!"</p>
<p>And sure enough he fudged the numbers right on the screen and was just creating hysterical nonsense. I wrote him off as a schill and a sham right then... Whether deliberate or a gross error, I don't consider that guy a trustworthy source after that.</p>
<p>The most dangerous people will lure you in with nuggest of truth and then swindle you at the most critical moment. Alex Jones is perhaps the greatest example of this, but it's all over fraudsters on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The total debasement of our mainstream news created an opportunity for alternative media to step in. Motivated financially just like anyone else, they tend to err on the side of extremism and exaggeration to lure people in because views = money.</p>
<p>As far as sources go, I look everywhere. The only two that I repeatedly look at intentionally are Corbett Report and MoneyGPS and that's just because over the years it has been make clear that they put integrity first. They put accuracy and longterm growth above the immediacy of exaggerating current events for clicks.</p>
<p>Here's the actual source article, I accidentally linked to a partial repost:</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/06/blackrock-authored-the-bailout-plan-before-there-was-a-crisis-now-its-been-hired-by-three-central-banks-to-implement-the-plan/">https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/06/blackrock-authored-the-bailout-plan-before-there-was-a-crisis-now-its-been-hired-by-three-central-banks-to-implement-the-plan/</a></p>
<p>This is it. I've searched all over to get to the bottom of what this is all about and there it was, right out in the open... BlackRock's document was live as of August 2019 and that article was posted in June 2020. But there's so much damn noise it's very hard to get to the source, to the beginning.</p>
<p>BlackRock is sort of like "patient zero" for Covid-19!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Having finally figured out what's happening I might not be on Reddit so much anymore. I find a lot of the discourse to be disingenuous and it's getting to where the signal to noise ratio of what I know versus what I learn here is getting worse.</p>
<p>Reddit participates in dividing people. That's their role in all of these... They keep the left fighting with the right so that we never unite to attack our actual oppressors.</p>
<p>I love what Reddit could have been, but I hate what it actually is.</p>
