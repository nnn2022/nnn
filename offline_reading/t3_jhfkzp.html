    <strong>Can anyone actually remember getting sick because you attended a bar or a festival?</strong>
    <p><p>I seriously can't. Most of the time it's either workplace or education. Usually because of forced movement.</p>
<p>We were packed back in education as kids which meant we were often sick.</p>
<p>Also at festival I have contact with what, 15 people? And "touch" is probably down to 2-3 friends I know well. Where at work, education I have to touch so many things other people have touched before.</p>
<p>Are there any proof that Bars, Clubs etc spread flu's etc?</p></p>

        <p>I have a low immune system and I <em>always</em> get sick after going to concerts and theater. That’s life! Getting sick really isn’t the end of the world. Yes I’ve been in a bad way and wondered if I would die. All the more reason to live.</p>

        <p>I’m a huge concert/festival/club goer. It’s not those venues inherently that made me sick occasionally. It’s all the immune suppressing drugs I was partaking in. You always hear about people doing coke &amp; Molly getting hella sick after festival weekends. No shit. That stuff basically puts your immune system to sleep. Not to mention eating like shit, drinking too much &amp; not sleeping.</p>
<p>We need to have a much deeper conversation about how we treat ourselves and our bodies. It’s not a matter of “this venue made me sick”. It’s a matter of “I touched something with a germ on it because that’s part of being a biological being and because I trashed my immune system, my body couldn’t prevent it from making me ill.”</p>

So what. Humans get sick. We get better, our immune system gets stronger. That’s part of life.</p>

        <p>Back in March I went clubbing with a group of people after attending a house party. This was in Ireland, right before St. Patrick’s Day and right before they closed the bars and clubs. The next morning r/Ireland was FURIOUS at those who went out the night before. I felt awful.</p>
<p>I never got sick so I know I didn’t have it or spread it (and I lived with people and they never got sick either so I knew I never had it then) and I am now fully anti-lockdown so do I still regret it? No way. I’m so glad I went.</p>

        <p>I mean, aside from some very obvious instances with clear connections (ie many years ago my mom came home from her teaching job with an awful, debilitating flu, and a couple days later my dad and I were both sick too), I have never even bothered trying to figure out where I got an illness from.  Could be anywhere.  People get sick, it's a fact of life.</p>
<p>I guess I can think of a couple times when I played band gigs (late night at bars) and woke up the following morning with cold symptoms, but I attribute that more to the being drunk, exhausted, and sleep-deprived, than the act of being at a bar.</p>

        <p>Going to be honest, I used to be in management at a multi day festival and I would get very sick every time.  However this was mainly due to late nights and little sleep, difficult weather, and the massive stress of running such an event. Regardless it doesn’t matter, I used to also get sick every year working for a charity directly with the homeless, but I would do all over again because I choose the risk, it’s worth it to me.</p>

        <p>This is in fact a great question. I hardly ever get sick in general. But certainly have never gotten sick from going to a concert or hanging out at a bar (even when I lived somewhere with brutal 8 month long winters and was dating a bartender at a music venue).</p>
<p>The only times I have ever gotten sick in my adult life were from working so much that I wasn’t eating or sleeping and then flying. That combo never fails to bring me down. </p>
<p>What’s funny is that a couple weeks ago a came across some MSM article (never saved it, I don’t remember what it was from, I’m sorry) that attempted to twist some numbers around to say that flying rarely gets people sick and I just thought, “Oof, nice try but all also fuck you”.</p>

        <p>I hardly ever get sick but when I had covid it was because my roommate did and usually every other few illnesses I get it was because my partner did and we slept together always drank out of the same water bottles etc. so close contact, not concerts and stuff. Also there were times they got sick and I didn’t despite taking no measures to prevent it</p>

        <p>As a youngster, I went over to my grandparents' house every time I got sick. They always gave me warm soup and Tylenol to help me feel better. They're still alive and very well.</p>

        <p>I’ve gotten sick on vacation. Got a cold on a family vacation to Disneyworld. It sucked because I didn’t have a rental and needed to go to a drug store for cough drops. We were staying in a Camp Wilderness trailer.</p>

        <p>I always get sick after large potlucks or from taking the bus in winter where the air is dry and the weather is too harsh bike to work (before WFH was mandated). I live in Ottawa, Canada where it's winter and too icy to bike for 6 months of the year.</p>

        <p>No. When I was a kid I was actually a germaphobe, which started from me getting really bad colds which I hated and really wanted to avoid and also I read the book "The Hot Zone" at too young an age.</p>
<p>I remember being afraid to go to baseball games or fly on airplanes but I actually never once got sick after doing those things. Usually I'd get sick from school I think. I also noticed that being around someone who was sick was not a good predictor of whether I'd actually get sick. Often I'd have a friend or someone sitting close to me who was sick and I wouldn't catch it and other times I'd get sick randomly without knowing of anyone being sick. I'm not saying it isn't a good idea to avoid sick people when you can and there definitely were times when something would be going around and I'd catch it, but I'd say the majority of time when I have gotten sick I wasn't able to trace it to anyone specific and it would happen seemingly at random.</p>
