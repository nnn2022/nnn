        <p>Everyone who I challenge in a normie sub comes back to me saying they had a loved one die. I don't spend much time in normie subs but it's happened 4/4 times now. It's not organic.</p>

        <p>I live in PA, which had a relatively high death rate.  Very few people I've talked to will say that. They know someone who got sick and said it was an extremely miserable flu-like experience, or someone who got sick and hardly noticed, or someone who got sick and it was serious enough to go to the ICU, but they recovered.  Or, they do know someone who died, and almost inevitably, it was an aged relative in a nursing home.  I personally have a friend who died - but - he was 94 freaking years old, and not in great shape before that.  And guess what, his 93 year old wife also got it, and recovered.  Both of them lived in their own home, with assistance from their children.  Sometimes I wonder if the despair of being shut away in a nursing home makes things worse for some.</p>

<p>No shit. Visits are the only thing that keep those people alive.</p>
<p>And yeah that was my point. In real life it doesn't happen but say something in a front page sub and I guarantee the bot will reply about how their relative died and then they won't reply to any of your questions after that. It's happened 4 out of 4 times to me now.</p>

        <p>God damnit that would be a brilliant response. Iâ€™ve had this happen to where I shared a video on how wearing a mask is compliance and safety theater, unsafe bs and a former coworker claimed 3 people they knew had died from it. Didnâ€™t list how old they were or what comorbidities that had but it was very insensitive of me to not think of protecting others by being against masks in public ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>When corona first started, I went to the Michigan sub, hoping to find out what people around me were thinking. Anytime I posted my feeling that lockdown was wrong, that we were being lied to, I would get crazy , threatening responses. There was a lot of sexually charged stuff, kill yourself, hope you die type comments. A corona-skeptical post would get like 50 downvotes. The thing is, I've never met any Michigander irl who acts like that at all. Michigan people are nice, it's a statewide cultural trait. Everybody I talk to irl thinks that something shady is happening.</p>
<p>It looks like these state subs are filled with bots and trolls. They seem pretty ESL too, so probably Russians or something trying so hard to manipulate public opinion. They really want people terrified.</p>

<p>They are. We are going to have the scrape the text data and train a machine learning model to find out what kind ESL and semantic pattern this is. Facebook, Twitter and MuH HaTe SpEeCh agencies are doing this. Fight fire with fire</p>

<p>Yeah. I wear a mask sometimes, sometimes I don't. In the early stages I was one of those people who took many precautions (like who isn't washing thier hands and cleaning door knobs) , while being a skeptic. I have had conversations among the common pedestrian about how this entire COVID-19 thing beyond the infectious disease is a marketing hoax (even to the textbook white liberal, in the same neighborhoods the BLM protests occurred) and most of them, themselves, felt pressured and ostracized by friends and family.  However I personally never  met a true believer face to face.</p>
