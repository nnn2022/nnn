    <strong>I've never been so unhappy until 2020 hit us with a pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>As someone who usually consider themselves an introvert I was making huge progress. Before the pandemic hit I made more friends with my local group from all of us liking Pokémon Go and we all met up to play the popular app game with each other. When I wasn't with them I'd hang out with the girlfriend or see my friends. </p>
<p>I enjoyed taking the girl out for events, conventions, double dates, movies and all that stuff. Then the pandemic came and everything just kind of shut down. Our Pokemon group only meets up in cars with some wearing masks still. None of us give each other a high five, handshake or a hug anymore and we don't hang out in a group anymore to just walk around a park like we used it. </p>
<p>Instead it's now been 7 months and have had to do nothing but go to work and come home. Every now and then I get to see the gf and take her out for dinner but that just emotionally drains me. Seeing half of the restaurant empty because they are forced to have tables blocked off to sit people away from each other, having to talk to the employee's while they have a mask on is always a little bit uncomfortable, you can't sit at a bar and have a conversation with the person sitting next to you cause either the whole bar is shut down or they are two seats away from you making it more awkward to strike up a conversation. </p>
<p>I just haven't handled this very well emotionally. When everything you've done and love just all the sudden gets stopped because if something you can't control it really messes with your head. That at any moment a virus or a pandemic can hit and then your forced to social distance and wear a mask whenever you go out to the city, restaurant, etc. I know I should be lucky I have a gf that wants to still see me even with a pandemic going on. If it wasn't for her I don't think there would be much sanity left in me.</p></p>

        <p>Remember the virus is real but the disaster you are experiencing is man made. The people who have done this to you are playing politics with your life. Don't forget this when it comes time to pick new local leadership. Who your mayor and governor make a difference.</p>

        <p>We must demand everyone involved with this "New Normal" be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law by the department of justice, its a matter of justice and equality, justice is blind and the law applies to everyone equally, what has happened is 100% illegal under Federal law in the United States and absolutely can be prosecuted.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately that’s not true though. They say justice is blind but it’s not. Powerful people can get away with stuff. No one is going to be punished they are going to get books deals and second terms and third houses.</p>
