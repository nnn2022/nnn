    <strong>If the vaccine is suppose to provide immunity, then how can a person get infected with covid if they are supposed to be immune?</strong>
    <p><p>It's almost as if this vaccine is nothing more than a placebo. Like many here who have already had it, we are immune to the virus. Why would we need to waste our time with a drug that doesn't even protect us when our immune system is already doing to job for us?</p></p>

        <p>I don't think it would be that easy. I think the lawyer would have to prove that Pfizer, Moderna, etc. intentionally mislabeled these shots as vaccines when they knew they were really gene therapy products and proving intentions is hard. Even harder would be finding a lawyer who would be willing to take on the biggest pharma companies who likely all have dozens of the best lawyers and near infinite money to spend on fighting lawsuits. These huge corporations have a tendency to offer large settlements and people suing take the money rather than continue fighting in the courts.</p>

        <p>Because no vaccine is 100% effective, even the measles vaccine is only 97% effective. The fact we even got a over 90% effective vaccine in and of itself is amazing, a year ago Fauci was hoping for a 50% effective one. Anyways why is no vaccine 100% effective? Well there are many reasons one reason is some people just have awful immune systems and they don't end up mounting an effective immune response. Another reason is mutations, while no mutation has shown complete immune escape some have shown a decrease in the efficacy of antibodies in particular the South African variant which is the most divergent variant currently out there.</p>

        <p>&rt;No vaccine is 100% effective, a small percentage of people are not protected after vaccination and for others the protection may wane over time. Also, some people are unable to be vaccinated due to certain conditions such as immune suppression. Maintaining immunity in those around these people protects them from disease.</p>

        <p>The problem with this article is that it assumes that our immune systems are entirely inadequate, when this couldn't be more from the truth, and coincides with the WHO changing the definition what herd immunity actually means from:</p>
<p>&rt;Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or a natural immunity developed through previous infection.</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>&rt;‘Herd immunity’, also known as ‘population immunity’, is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.</p>
<p>This is especially pernicious when you have an entire industry and compliant State spreading propaganda and lying about the effectiveness of the "vaccine".</p>

        <p>&rt;High vaccine coverage must be maintained in order to prevent the disease re-entering the population.</p>
<p>This statement is false. Vaccines are not required when those who have gotten a disease and recovered from it. Their immune systems will have made the antibodies and they are now immune, making a vaccine redundant. We also have to keep in mind that the Covid vaccine is not a true vaccine. It does not contain a weakened version of the virus, nor does it confer any antibodies.</p>

        <p>Exactly, an experimental mRNA treatment that does not confer immunity to a virus cant possibly help develop "herd immunity" even under the new definition.  So why does anyone not at immediate risk of death from covid need it?</p>

        <p>Ahh, I see what you mean, though I don't agree with your interpretation meaning "immune systems do nothing." The presumption is that the objective is to avoid catching (and spreading) the disease. Immunity isn't forever, including natural immunity.  It wears off after a while and you become vulnerable again. Therefore, vaccination is necessary to stop the spread of the virus while reducing loss of life.</p>

        <p>That doesn't make any sense. You have no idea what pathogens you're getting, and all that would happen is that you'll temporarily have some antibodies for a particular strain of germ. It's not stronger in some general way, you'd have to go through the same thing all over again for any disease you haven't already had or whenever the immunity has worn off. Stressing your body out by getting needlessly sick will contribute to weakening your immune system generally. You'd also be putting anyone who's immunocompromised around you in danger for no good reason.</p>

<p>That's where you are wrong. By constantly getting exposed to a variety of pathogens, including covid, I am constantly updating my immune system and creating fresh supplies of antibodies. I get plenty of sunlight, I eat healthy and work out and I take daily vitamins to account for any deficiencies I may have due to living in a northern climate. </p>
<p>What does weaken the immune system is eating literal trash, being obese, staying indoors, not getting enough sunlight, ignoring deficiencies and minimizing contact with other people. I never shied away from those infected with covid and now I'm immune, just as I am with just about everything else. </p>
<p>That said, I'm not against vaccines, in general. I have all of my vaccines and boosters and I have no problem with them because they all have decades of actual science backing them up. The covid drug (I'm not calling it a vaccine because it is not a weakened version of the virus and it does not contain any antibodies) has absolutely no long term safety studies done and I do not trust the companies who made them. Especially, since they are immune from any kind of liability for the injuries and deaths they are causing. </p>
<p>&rt;You'd also be putting anyone who's immunocompromised around you in danger for no good reason. </p>
<p>Not my problem. Their safety is their responsibility, not mine. Before you go into an emotional tirade about "wE aRe AlL iN tHiS tOgEtHeR", we aren't and we never will be no matter how badly you whine about it. I've never bought into that collectivist nonsense before and I'm not about to start now.</p>

<p>Just repeating the same thing and surrounding it with <em>valid</em> methods of bolstering your immune system doesn't make it true.</p>
<p>As for the rest, well, blaming others for harm that you willingly inflict upon them is psychopathy. Deflecting it away as "collectivist" is a weak cover to try and divorce yourself from blame, but I think you know that's the case. Elsewise you'd simply mow down pedestrians with your car - because it's <em>their</em> fault, not yours.</p>
<p>What makes the anti-collectivist claim even richer is that at no point did I antagonize anyone here, and I was instantly attacked for not being part of the club. Are you not banding together here, parroting each other, defending one another?</p>
<p>This is some really pathetic stuff.</p>

<p>The <em>context</em> of which was you exposing vulnerable people to infection. If you knowingly expose vulnerable people to infection, <em>you</em> are responsible for that. Your action directly causes harm to someone else, and you're choosing to do so despite that. It's basic ethics.</p>
