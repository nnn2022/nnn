    <strong>So angry and on the verge of mental breakdown because I don't think I'll get to have a future.</strong>
    <p><p>(The following I just wrote is a huge whiney rant. It's full of doom and gloom, and woe is me. I'm sorry if it brings you down but it's how I feel. I just had to get out over a year of pent up emotions. You don't need to console me or put the suicide hotline number down. I wrote it all out and then I was like "This looks like a crybaby diary entry. No one wants to see this. I should delete it" But, I figured there have to be other people feeling a similar way, and perhaps the purpose of this post could be so that others who have thought similar thoughts can feel seen and heard. Like, if you feel this way too, you aren't the only one.)</p>
<p>I'm not a career climber type person. The only thing about a career that appeals to me is how much money you can make with it. Okay, so, for four years of college this is all I had planned for my future: "work to fund travel", "work to fund travel", I've said over and over to people who've asked what I'll do after college. That's all I'm interested in doing. Seeing the world. Living in different places. </p>
<p>Well, now, for the most part, I can't travel. At least not internationally. And you can't go a damn place without wearing the stupid fucking mask anyway. How enjoyable. </p>
<p>So, what's the point anymore? Work to pay your rent and eat food, as you live in your one spot of the world for the rest of your miserable life? And in 5 or so years you can plug into your virtual reality headset and try to feel something? </p>
<p>I don't even have any friends anymore after all this BS. Not because I've been cruel to them or called them names or anything. Simply because I've expressed my opinion that I'm not sick so why wear a mask? </p>
<p>People say, "Oh, we just have to keep resisting. This won't last forever." Well, from what I've seen it's too little too late. We will never go back. I'm not getting the vaccine ever. And I'm at the point of such anger now that I get irate about the masks now too. I did it in the beginning a little, because I was just like, "I need to go buy an apple, not gonna start shit just gonna wear the damn thing and get it done with." But after over a year I'm so hopeless and angry that I'm like "Fuck the masks, I'll walk out of your store then." I'm not proud of my bad attitude, I'm just so broken up and sick about this. </p>
<p>I am just kinda in shock right now. It is an absolute reality I won't have the future I wanted. What is my purpose now? Very, very lost.</p></p>

        <p>My friend, you are not alone.</p>
<p>We have all walked down and faced some very dark things down some very dark paths to leave us here, as the “outcast” per say. But have hope, there is a bright light shining through the sky that just hasn’t reached wherever you are yet. </p>
<p>People are waking up by the millions around the world, the world is about to change up and down very fast within the next year or so but I’m no fortune teller so don’t quote me. All I’m saying, is it WILL get better when you’re least expecting it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

        <p>Dont wear the mask. Get used to being uncomfortable. Pull it down below your nose, if you can't take it off. Take it off for a few seconds to adjust it. Get used to the feeling of not wearing it. </p>
<p>This is the time to "embrace the suck" - life is not always going to be good. <br>
Write down your options on a paper. Consider them.  </p>
<p>Move. Learn a Trade. </p>
<p>But whatever you do and wherever you go, stay out of the cities and of democrat controlled areas. I was warned 15 years ago to stay out of Blue states - 15 years ago! and now it has really made sense.</p>
<p>Now the warning is - make your way and have a plan to live somewhere free. Don't wait around</p>
<p>But it does suck. Try to hook up with resistance groups in your area.</p>
<p>StandupOhio is in Ohio, there are many others. People are slowing organizing. Its not going to be easy.</p>

        <p>This is <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> what they want. A generation of broken, hopeless individuals. Because the more broken you are, the more compliant they think you'll be.</p>
<p>But there are more of us out there than you think. There are places where the cultists are in the tiny minority. Seek out one of those places and go there. Sure, you still might not get to travel any time soon, but when you're around healthy and like-minded people, you can find plenty of things to enjoy.</p>

        <p>Church-going people have been fairing better mental heath-wise. We were made to know, love, and serve God.</p>
<p>There's this hermit priest who teaches mental prayer, the catechism, and also has a theology and current events series you may find very useful.  His name us Fr. David Nix.  This priest is very anti-new normal. You might like his advice. He's a good priest.</p>

        <p>Think of yourself as lucky. It took me until my late 20's to figure out what the world actually is. You're finding out a lot earlier. Life is a struggle, and people are slaves to ideology manufactured to make them better consumers. Even if this didn't happen and you got to enjoy yourself for a few more years it would be a lie. Your purpose can be fighting against this bullshit if you want it to be.</p>

        <p>I feel you. After being lectured by the Walmart manager today about why I need to wear a mask, I am again contemplating leaving Commifornia. I always shopped there fine with the medical exemption excuse, and was let in by the mask nazi at the door today, till this manager said they wouldn't accept it. But, we have the best weather and landscape in the country (I'm 20 min from the beach or mountains), and I have a job and little community of friends who don't buy into the BS (except for the vaccines, almost everyone here is getting them). I know I have it better than a lot of people, which is why the dystopia hits me hard when it actually affects me. My husband is a lot worse off as he's from London and may never get to see his family again. I'm sorry, I saw your rant as an opportunity for my own, hope that's ok! All we can do is keep fighting, I guess!</p>

        <p>I don't mind at all. I like to hear from others what's going on in their lives. </p>
<p>Actually, I always saw myself ending up in California. Like you said, it has the best weather. Not too cold, not too hot. Compared to Wisconsin, sounds amazing. </p>
<p>I'm glad to hear you at least have a little group of friends who "get it". Probably helps you stay somewhat sane.</p>

        <p>I'm from Michigan, so I know how it is, that's why I appreciate San Diego so much. And it's a lot more politically balanced than LA and SF, so if you are crazy enough to come to Cali I'd recommend here or the OC. Hope you are feeling better in the meantime, and good luck!</p>

        <p>Thank you. Yeah, I've heard San Diego and Orange County are relatively chilled out. And I know the red counties further north are especially so, which is closer to where I was considering.</p>

        <p>That's how this manager was too! She was talking down to me the whole time as I struggled to put on my mesh mask (which she didn't seem to mind lol), saying "it's for the good of everyone" blah blah blah. Like, if you really don't want to anger your customers, just say "I'm sorry, it's company policy, I really don't have a choice in enforcing it.", not lecturing them with your brainwashed propaganda.</p>

        <p>Hey i’m right there with you, i feel like you’re very much describing things i’m going through right now. I’m not even in college any more because of everything being online and my college requiring vaccination in the upcoming semester. I also feel hopeless and like it’s pointless to even try to make a future for myself, I feel lost and not sure what direction to go and wonder if there’s even a point in trying, the best thing we can do is keep pushing forward and do our best to not let the bs bring us down because that’s exactly what they want. i wish you the best of luck and hope you find your way</p>

        <p>I feel you... thanks for writing. I try to focus only on what I can do, and not let the mind dwell on what I cannot do. Many of us grew up with a bright outlook and imagined our futures lived to the fullest. We should still try to live them to the fullest even if the image of what is possible has changed drastically.  It's difficult to make that mental switch and not forget about it... but it really is the closest thing to peace we will get I think. </p>
<p>Death is part of life, life is part of death. We dont know what it will feel like when we die... but we know what it feels like to live so might as well embrace it whatever it is. If you are not afraid of death, nothing can actually hurt you because even dieing has a beauty to it..but if u are afraid of life... everything will hurt. </p>
<p>Sending a virtual hug... i might be faceless... but i do care about your struggle, feel it in myself too... and hope we both can have the will to rully recognize just how powerful our will really is :P</p>

        <p>I'm in the exact same boat. Now all my local colleges require the vaccine, out of state = expensive, and I doubt I'll be able to finish that degree or travel. I draw the line at the vaccine. I just don't need or want it. </p>
<p>All I wanted was a nice job and to travel. Not even to cities- mind you- my jam is rural/unexplored/natural areas. I'm 24 and feel like as soon as I tasted 'life' out from under my parents' rule and abuse it was snatched away by new rules and restrictions from the government.</p>

        <p>Right? I've started to feel like I'm going go nuts worrying about 'biologically' running out of time. Like sure I'll still be alive. But will I be as carefree about healthcare? Will I heal as fast? Will I be as agile? No. I've already noticed my healing period lasts longer if I sprain something. It's like the longer we live, the more problems arise in our bodies and we just inevitably die slowly. I'm so sad. Youth should be enjoyed..</p>

        <p>Many of us did. I did for a while. I don't intend to be an asshole and get everyone sick or something. Then the media and gocernment continued to gaslight us about how it was our fault. We are now over a year in.</p>

        <p>Actually... everyone wearing a piece of cloth on their face and staying away from others is an A+ formula for sickening a population.. common sense agrees.. brainwashed brains forget common sense.</p>

        <p>Of course you need to be open to the idea that the scientific enterprise has misinterpreted what "viruses" really are... contagious sickness from viruses is still unproven (shocker I know) </p>
<p>So why do people in the same households fall sick at the same time?
Why people who met at the same event fall sick at the same time?
Why certain geographical population fall sick all together?</p>
<p>We are SOULS traveling the physical plane...connected to our bodies, our environment, and our minds!  Thoughts affect our health (proven placebo effect) the environment effects of health (proven). </p>
<p>The environement includes healthy air, healthy soil, healthy food and drink, moving your body in a kind way which interacts with your environement... </p>
<p>Now do you see why epidemiologists are always saying even THEY dont really understand the spread of viruses?</p>

        <p>"We are SOULS traveling the physical plane..." That is false, we are flesh, bone, organs and more all made of matter generating thoughts due to the electricity in our brains that makes us conscious, the concept of souls is false, when we die there is no afterlife, there is no future after we die, everything just stops forever, I seriously don't understand what you're trying to say here.</p>
