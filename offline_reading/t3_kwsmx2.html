        <p>Not sure I can even think of one. My life has been adrift; I've felt like a cosmonaut drifting away from the space station with a slight rotation while moving laterally away from everything I once knew.</p>

        <p>Saving a fuck ton of money. I refuse to give business to people who push the mask. Which is everyone. Obviously I need groceries, gas, ect. But anything extra just stopped. I refuse to wear a mask and if your store forces it I simply dont shop. Have put away an extra 14k this year. Also bought a motorcycle, cause fuck em. The only stores that dont enforce the mask around me are the motorcycle shop and the gun shop so that is where I spend the money.</p>

        <p>Yes, I've stopped spending money with virtue signaling businesses wherever possible too - no mask mandate firms, no BLM's great firms, etc. </p>
<p>Fuck them and their posturing. Their job is to make money not to be complicit in the erasure of the human race.</p>

        <p>Working from home is good, but it was clearly possible without a pandemic and is negated by the fact we could have let automation drastically shorten our work hours anyway.</p>

        <p>WFH was an adjustment.  I still think the office has its place but I do enjoy being able to run on my lunch break and not having to get up as early.  Still, I worry about the jobs that will get outsourced by this.  I was lucky enough to leverage my situation and leave the shit hole state I was in.</p>
<p>It is nice to see people actually wash their fucking hands from time to time.  I think a lot of people go too far with sanitation but it's good to see people actually wash their hands after using the restroom.  Of course, this is also negated by people acting as if the gloves they wear have antimicrobial properties, and people touching their mask and touching other stuff.</p>
<p>My husband and I discovered that take out margaritas are a thing where we live, that's kind of cool.  Would rather enjoy at a restaurant but it was nice on Christmas Eve when we were painting and needed some food and something to take the edge off.</p>
<p>Everything else is pretty shit.</p>

        <p>Nothing positive for me. But an acquaintance works at the DMV, and they do registration by appointment now, and it is a win for evey one. No long lines to wait in. And my acquaintance can schedule her lunch break.</p>

        <p>Actually, the first lockdown I enjoyed.  Granted, I live in a country that had a short, pretty loose first lockdown. It was a chance to slow down and enjoy my cut working hours, I got to ride my bike lots and spend time with family and catch up on rest.</p>

        <p>Working from home, but I'd like to go into the office sometimes. Not really on a schedule just like a few times a month I'm like, up early and ready to go. But it's an hour drive so I much enjoy the extra sleep.</p>
<p>And I already worked from home 3 days a week before so it's not new to me.</p>
