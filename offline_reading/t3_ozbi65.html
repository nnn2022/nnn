        <p>I hate child sexual abusers with the fire of a million suns. People who do this to kids deserve a hollow point to the skull. But what we need is to up their punishment. They truly need the death penalty IMO. Not to search the phones of people who have nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p>This. </p>
<p>Just like after 9/11 we gave up privacy for safety the NSA decided it was ok to surveillance the innocent under the guise of “but we’re looking for terrorists”. </p>
<p>This is a slippery slope. Nothing to stop them from seeing screenshots or pictures on your phone that may be a “red flag” for something else. Soon they’ll use info on your phone to label you an “extremist” or literally anything they want</p>
<p>The other fear, if they can scan your photos, they can certainly plant what they want there.</p>

        <p>I am a victim of CSA. My adult life has turned into a crusade for justice in that area I would even be willing to have my devices randomly scanned for sensitive abuse material. There's no reason to put said material on someone's device no matter how super secret and encrypted you think you rendered it. The fact is that Apple can decode the images. The key exists and to assume it will never be leaked or used for nefarious purposes is criminally negligent</p>

<p>I saw something on social media recently (Twitter, maybe) that asked what people's one wish would be. That would be mine. For no child to ever have to endure that.</p>
<p>For all the abusers to be vaporized would be a close second.</p>

        <p>And awareness. Child sex abuse can happen in ways that are not forceful. I was adopted by my abuser. Those that abuse by coercion, there's pedophiles want the victim to enjoy it. That want romantic relationships with children. Where the abuse is so much more than physical. Which leads children to grow up as confused adults wondering what they did wrong, not realizing they were being used in more ways than one. They were an object of lust, love and affection but never truly loved as child or as a person. They were meant to feel almost like the messiah by the abuser, only to grow up to realize they were used and worthless in the eyes of the very people that were meant to love them unconditionally. Fuck child sex abusers is an understatement. Still Apple, this is not the way</p>

        <p>There is no reason to store that on our devices.  None. They are planting illegal images on everyone's devices. The ultimate form of control. Scan our images and data some other way, this is criminal. As a victim of CSA the idea of that imagery being on my devices is triggering in ways that's hard to describe.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure you actually understand the technology being used here. No database of “illegal images” is being stored on any phone as part of this tool. It’s using a technology called hashing to identify fingerprints of the known CSAM without actually requiring a direct comparison to the images themselves. The “hashes” are just long strings of characters and can’t be reverse engineered.</p>

        <p>"Apple said its method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, Apple said the system will perform on-device matching against a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by the NCMEC and other child safety organizations. Apple said it will further transform this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users' devices."</p>
<p>Apple is going to store hashes of CSAM on your phone that is supposedly unreadable to compare to your photos before it's uploaded to the cloud. That is insane to me, if that technology is cracked it would be possible to frame anyone with CSAM. How is this ok?</p>
