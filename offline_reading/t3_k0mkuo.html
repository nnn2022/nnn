        <p>It's amazing, the mental gymnastics that goes on.</p>
<p>The flu is stopped by masks etc, but not covid, why hasn't covid already spread to the bulk of the population? </p>
<p>I find it hard, nay impossible to believe that for 80 years, the science somehow missed the fact that we could completely irradicate the flu by having the vulnerable wear dirty bandanas on their faces.</p>

        <p>OR COVID is significantly more contagious than the seasonal flu so the same measures that appear to significantly decrease seasonal flu infections don't have an equal effect on COVID. It's kind of the whole reason we're treating this so much differently than the seasonal flu. Not sure if that's mental gymnastics or just logic.</p>

        <p>Lol...interesting...and it's mental gymnastics. </p>
<p>At the start of this charade, when the masks and 6 foot nonsense started, they were saying how one could catch the flu or common cold being in the same highrise as an infected person and never even see them.</p>
<p>Now, very conveniently that's not the case.</p>
<p>So if one can catch those that easily and covid is more contagious....why TF are we doing masks and 6 feet as that clearly would not be effective. </p>
<p>Additionally, if that were true, covid would have infected way more people than they claim as pretty much EVERYONE gets some version of a cold or flu.</p>
<p>If one is going to argue without looking like a dog chasing it's tail, then one needs some continuity to ones arguments with just a dash of critical thinking.</p>

<p>Not sure where you read this or who said this. Source?</p>
<p>&rt;Additionally, if that were true, covid would have infected way more people than they claim as pretty much EVERYONE gets some version of a cold or flu.</p>
<p>30 - 40 million people a year get the flu. So ~10%. Not everyone. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=While%20the%20impact%20of%20flu,61%2C000%20deaths%20annually%20since%202010.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there have been an estimated 70 million cases in the US so far: https://covid19-projections.com/us. So the same restrictions that have brought the seasonal flu infections down 98% have only brought COVID down to 70 million. I wonder which one is more infectious? Dare I compare compare the death rate of the two?</p>

        <p>Every time I have to have conversations about this it's like the movie groundhog day. </p>
<p>As to the source of the first thing: I don't recall.  The goalposts continue to move, but it was between the first and second time fauci flip flopped on masks.  I'm sure the goalposts now is "we know more now than we did then so...".  Which is complete bullshit as we are still doing the same masks and distancing, with no change.</p>
<p>Don't try to pretend that they do comprehensive flu or common cold testing, they don't.  I have never met a single person in my entire life that has ever had a flu test or a test for a cold.  Flu numbers will always be lower than actual infections because most people don't get tested.</p>
<p>As for covid, you know as well as I do that the covid tests are not reliable.  Add to that that early on and likely even now, people don't get tested even if they have the symptoms. </p>

<p>Ok, so no one actually said that.</p>
<p>&rt;The goalposts continue to move, but it was between the first and second time fauci flip flopped on masks. </p>
<p>Mask shortage was an initial concern. Not so much the effectiveness of them. </p>

<p>Yes, that's how thats how the scientific method works.</p>
<p>&rt;Which is complete bullshit as we are still doing the same masks and distancing, with no change.</p>
<p>Was there not a sharp decrease in the spring once people limited interactions and were socially distant?</p>
<p>&rt; Don't try to pretend that they do comprehensive flu or common cold testing, they don't. I have never met a single person in my entire life that has ever had a flu test or a test for a cold. Flu numbers will always be lower than actual infections because most people don't get tested.</p>
<p>The numbers I'm providing are estimates of the number of infections per year. They aren't lab confirmed tests. Scientists make these estimates based on a number of variables including lab proven tests, deaths etc. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818346/</p>
<p>&rt;As for covid, you know as well as I do that the covid tests are not reliable. Add to that that early on and likely even now, people don't get tested even if they have the symptoms.</p>
<p>You act like all of these variables aren't taken into account in the source estimates I'm providing. You think your little gotcha questions were simply missed by statisticians with decades of experience. Please undestand what you're talking about before running away with these half brained ideas.</p>

        <p>Ockham’s Razor, named for the mediaeval English philosopher William of Ockham (or Occam), states that “entities should not be multiplied without necessity,” or more broadly that simpler explanations are more likely to be correct than complex ones. This is a heuristic and not an infallible principle; sometimes the complex explanation is, of course, correct.</p>

        <p>"Because the way the flu spreads is so similar to the way COVID-19 spreads, wearing a cloth face covering may also help prevent flu spread. In a 2013 study, researchers found that masks led to a reduction in how much flu virus was spread into the airwaves."</p>

        <p>Again then the question remains unanswered, if wearing masks and social distancing is preventing flu spread to such a noticeable degree then why is covid still being treated as if it’s apocalyptic?</p>
<p>‘Because the way the flu spreads is so similar to the way COVID-19 spreads’</p>
<p>Well clearly not otherwise we’d be seeing covid cases lowering in a similar fashion but we aren’t seeing that are we?</p>

        <p>The reason it is not lowering is because of people like you who don't seem to understand that if even 10-20% of people refuse to wear a mask, things will get out of hand. Why don't you understand this? </p>
<p>New Zealand, Japan, Vietnam etc have already opened up because they have 100% compliance in precautions. They are having sports events, etc and everyone STILL wears a mask. They don't politicize it like we do here in the US. Trump killed us when he politicized mask-wearing. </p>
<p>Subs like these are terrifying because they display the ability of groups of people to manipulate others to act in a way that is NOT in their best interest.</p>

<p>Mask for flu and common cold is blowing smoke.  Am I  really supposed to believe that over the last 80 years we could have eradicated both by draping dirty bandanas over our noses and "science" kept that little nugget quiet or didn't know it?</p>

        <p>Or you can just stay home if you are sick like people have been doing.   Forcing healthy people to wear masks around healthy people is ridiculous.

        <p>I am currently ill with some virus. I thought it was strep because my throat was severely swollen and I couldn’t swallow, but the test came back negative. While at the office, I refused to be tested for covid because I already had covid in March and this doesn’t feel like covid. They kept asking if I wanted one and I kept refusing because I knew that it would likely test positive since the amplification cycles are so high, any virus will test positive for covid. But I think I’m going to go back today and ask to get tested specifically for the flu because it’s most likely that and will continue to resist getting a covid test.</p>

        <p>I'm fairly certain that I've already had it, but even if I get an illness that matches 100% of the symptoms, there is no way in hell I'm getting tested. I'll self-isolate if that's what I have to do, but I won't get a goddamn test <em>ever</em>. I can't be ethically comfortable with doing that when the false positive rate means my action in getting tested would almost certainly be used to justify perpetrating further human rights abuses. I refuse to be a party to that.</p>

You are supposed to go to the doctor when you are sick. Full stop.

<p>Maybe you shouldn’t get into your car today because you’re endangering others. In fact, you are more likely to kill people getting behind the wheel of a vehicle than you would from getting sick with a virus.</p>

        <p>More so I mean shouldn’t you KNOW if you have Covid. Isn’t it better to know than to not? Refusing to get tested despite the symptoms is risky. No need to get twisted.</p>

        <p>I’m not getting tested when the lab refuses to tell me the amplification cycles they use. And since there is growing evidence that the amplification cycles used in the US is too high and therefore unusable, the tests are about as reliable as me tossing a coin. Considering the fact that there is also growing evidence that the high amplification cycles are misdiagnosing the flu and other respiratory viruses as covid, me subjecting myself to that test when I am sick with a likely virus is just a bad idea.</p>
<p>Also, I had covid back in March. It was confirmed by an antibody test in April. The symptoms I have aren’t the same as when I had covid so I can say with certainty that I don’t have covid. With covid I had shortness of breath and actual cold symptoms like a cough. This time, all I have is a sore throat and a headache, plus a period of 10 hours where I was throwing up. No respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>Plus, the doctor agreed that it was rare to impossible for me to get covid again, so he supported my decision not to get a covid test.</p>

        <p>The flu has not dropped 98%. That’s misinformation. Sure, flu cases are lower this year, but not even close to 98%. Covid cases are rampant because it’s more contagious than the flu. Hardly anyone has anti bodies for covid-19, so if it were to enter your system, you would probably get sick. Covid cases are also surging because of anti maskers. People are “bored” and want to have giant parties for thanksgiving and Christmas. We saw the amount of cases that came from Halloween, why are we about to let history repeat itself? January is probably going to be our most rampant time with Covid, due to idiots having giant parties and not doing any kind of CDC guidelines. I’m in a family of doctors, and they are all just shocked by the stupidity many people possess during this pandemic. It’s a pandemic, get over it and actually just wear a mask. It’s that easy</p>
<p>Edit: do research. This sub is full of sheep that believe in fake articles and made up statistics</p>

        <p>It is, but not enough to make THAT much of a difference. SAR-CoV-2 has an R0 of 2.5 vs 1.7 for the flu. They are both transmitted by similar means. </p>
<p>I mean, a 98% reduction? Much more likely that flu cases are being misidentified as COVID cases.</p>

        <p>It is very significant. </p>
<p>But still doesn’t account for the fact that current measures are extremely affective for preventing the spread of the flu but have seemingly no effect on COVID. </p>

        <p>You can't not play this game. The risk of contracting an illness is part of life. If you don't want to play the game, the only way you're getting out of it is by putting six bullets in the chamber and putting the gun to your head, not by staying home, wearing a mask or anything else.</p>
<p>Oh, and also the IFR is nowhere near 5%. Based on the WHO's own estimates of total infected, we're looking at around 0.13%. Flu averages 0.1%, so it's a nearly identical risk.</p>

        <p>Just quoting POTUS. I’m certain the mortality rates this year will be completely normal. I haven’t had any family members die so clearly it just doesn’t exist. I mean if it did then more people would be dying and no one is, it’s just a normal year no statistics of extra deaths no extra death certificates issued no body’s stored in temporary cold storage everything’s completely fine I’m certain of it. I mean if more people in red states happen to be dying I’m sure there’s no correlation to willingness to wear masks at all. I mean look at Japan they had people wearing masks all the time and no one is dying there either. It’s all fake I’m certain cuz no one in my families died so that means it’s not real. The most important thing is that bodies aren’t stacking up at ANY rate (whether POTUS says so or the WHO) not at all no one is dying at all so it doesn’t matter.</p>

        <p>The reason is that COVID spread faster than flu.</p>
<p>So if most of the population is social distancing, the flu cases will drop.</p>
<p>But with COVID even if a small part of the population won’t practice social distancing, the cases will rise.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget that when you get the flu, you feel the symptoms immediately. With COVID you start to feel the symptoms after 5-14 days... during those days of not feeling the symptoms, COVID patients will spread COVID, thinking they are healthy.</p>

        <p>Again, usually people are doing 0 distancing and nobody is wearing masks. It's logical that, if those measures are any good at preventing the flu, the cases are going to be way down when compared to case-control. Covid is a lot more infectious, so even those measures aren't enough to prevent infection. No contradiction whatsoever</p>

        <p>Source for no flu deaths in the 2019-2020 flu season? The latest I saw from the CDC was 22k deaths from flu, which falls in line with averages.</p>
<p>Edit: strange, receiving downvotes still with no source to backup the claim of "hasn't been one flu death", congratulations on finding your own circlejerk here guys.</p>

        <p>The study shows that one person probably got infected by an asymptomatic person on an airplane but they also offer other explanations.</p>
<p>So one person on a plane. Hardly reason to force everyone to wear masks that don’t work.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it make you think twice that this is the best they can come up with to convince you that healthy people need to mask up and take tests?</p>
<p>Yeah I need more persuasion than that personally. If asymptomatic spread was really the threat they led you to believe I think there would be much more conclusive studies don’t you?</p>

<p>The WHO admitted asymptomatic spread is extremely rare (which in realistic terms means "ain't happening"), and we know from the only controlled study that cloth masks don't prevent the transmission of SARS CoV2.</p>

        <p>Yes, but where is the comparison of flu in previous years to flu this year? Why would the numbers be plummeting? Doesn't appear to be much change in the annual percentage of flu shot recipients.</p>
<p>The one fact to point out though is that we've never reckoned flu numbers to be only those who test positive for flu. Because up until this year, when folks got sick, doctors didn't break out the test swabs right away. (Hell, most people didn't even see a doctor when they caught a bug.) If you reported flu-like symptoms at a doctor visit, that was good enough for the CDC's records.</p>

        <p>I've heard and read more voices from doctors, nurses, microbiologists and other experts in the field who disagree with the media's fearmongering and government's totalitarianism than from those who do.</p>
<p>So seem to suggest that the majority of people who actually do have the expertise to judge what is going on agree with the media narrative, while in my experience the opposite is true.</p>

<p>What about it?  The government and certain people are expecting people who are very capable of working to lose everything, go bankrupt, and suffer severe psychological distress and stay at home, so why can't the people who actually SHOULD be at home stay there instead and let the rest of us work?</p>

<p>Hospital capacity in the US has never even been vaguely close to being overrun other than places like New York where their bloodthirsty politicians actively were killing people.</p>

        <p>At least in the UK, during lockdown you can work away from home if that is your only option, except from places like bars which are closed. If your business has to sack you because of covid, they can get government funding to pay most of your salary whilst you are not working.</p>
<p>Do you have a source to show that politicians were deliberately killing people? Was it under orders from the illuminati?</p>

<p>Let people work.  It seems awful funny that the big corporations who are so happy to tout their support for lockdowns and all these "mandates" are making insane amounts of money while the small guys are being driven into the ground.</p>
<p>Cuomo, Whitmer, etc killing old people has been well documented over the months and I'm not wasting time on someone willfully ignorant of it.</p>

<p>Still, though, overall Sweden does better than other countries. And this without the innumerable damage caused by lockdowns and other totalitarian measures.</p>

<p>In a world where you can prevent that without any consequences, no.</p>
<p>We are in a world where the attempt at stopping that destroys livelihoods and brings about massive rise in starvation, poverty, suicide, drug addiction and overdose, cancer and other treatable diseases, domestic abuse, depression, stunted childhood development and economic damage that will likely last for decades. In this world, yes, it is right to let some elderly die to protect our young. Every successful society in history recognizes that preserving the future prosperity of the young is more valuable than preserving the lives and comfort of the old.</p>

        <p>And what else will we do for the people who will die after this is done?
Have you EVER had an elderly grandparent die?
Someone in a LTC home? 
If you did, you would understand that by a certain age people become at a higher risk for death from ANY cause!
Did I blame the nursing home when my 96 year old grandma fell and broke some bones and died? No.
If you fell out of bed would it kill you? Probably not.
No one can have an adult conversation about life expectancy and that beyond a certain age things like cancer, stroke, or flu death become “natural causes” because no one is going to live forever.
I’m glad though we are psychologically tourmenting children with fear 🙁, masks, no recess, telling them they are bio weapons to save those at the end of their lives.
I’m happy we are driving young people towards addiction and suicide to protect those who need it.<br>
I am glad we are destroying small businesses (is who don’t need protection) to protect those who need it 
I am happy we have fundamentally changed our entire society to protect those who need it.</p>

<p>We would you destroy countless businesses and jobs and risk the lives of millions more by denying them proper medical treatment in a futile attempt to protect people against a virus, when those likely to die from that virus are already at the end of their lives and would probably have died from other causes anyway?</p>

<p>“Sweden is the only country for which the European CDC currently applies this method for the reporting of deaths.”</p>

<p>"Covid-19 deaths" is meaningless, since the death of anyone who is tested positive with Covid-19 is counted as a "Covid-19" death, including people who had been suffering for years from cancer and/or other conditions, where Covid-19 was at best the straw that broke the camel's back... if it played any influence at all.</p>
<p>Hence, excess mortality gives a much clearer picture, as it excludes all those people who could have died from other reasons if there was no Covid-19, which actually does make up the bulk of Covid-19 deaths.</p>
<p>Even those numbers are an overestimate, however, as it also includes people who have died BECAUSE of the measures, such as people who are denied medical treatment because preference was given to Covid-19 patients, people who died from being attached to ventilators for longer than they should, suicides, etc. </p>
<p>So, to get an even clearer picture, excess mortality should be split up into different causes of death. Only then we get the big picture. I have not seen any such datasets, though, so IMO excess mortality is the best we've got.</p>

<p>No, not like that.</p>
<p>Excess mortality is a term used in epidemiology and public health that refers to the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis above and beyond what we would have expected to see under 'normal' conditions. Basically, it's your absolute mortality rate, compared with that of a typical / average year.</p>
<p>What makes excess mortality rate such an interesting metric, is not only that it allows us to ignore deaths of people who would have died anyway from reasons associated with old age, but also because it allows for more reliable comparisons with other countries. After all, mortality rate depends on multiple factors, including the age distribution of your population, which is different in different countries. When comparing excess mortality rate, that figure takes such differences into account.</p>
<p>The data you referenced involves the weekly number of deaths from any cause. As I understand these numbers, these are absolute figures, which means it fails to meet aforementioned criteria.</p>

        <p>You didn't actually see the whole chart, did you?</p>
<p>" The points show reported deaths (placed at the start of each week in this graph). The turquoise-shaded areas show the predictions of how many deaths would have been expected from mid-February had the COVID-19 pandemic not ocurred. The shading shows the credible intervals around the median prediction, from 5% (dark) to 95% (light) in 10% increments, obtained from 16,000 posterior draws as described in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1112-0#Sec7">Methods</a>.

        <p>OK, fair enough.</p>
<p>They do mention in "methods" that they used time a series of data on deaths and population going back all the way to 2010, which they obtained through Eurostat. So it seems that their "predictions" are based on a legit dataset from a legit datasource. And while their "predictions" only address a very minor time period, the difference between predicted value and actual value for that specific time period does correspond with excess mortality.</p>
<p>However, if you look at the actual content of the graph, I see nothing that contradicts <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;time=earliest..latest&amp;country=AUT~BEL~DNK~FIN~DEU~NLD~NOR~POL~SWE~CHE&amp;region=World">the graph I linked to myself</a>. In both datasets, you see for Sweden a spike that starts around March 25th, then peaks around April 12th and then gradually drops to baseline. And in both datasets, you also see how the difference between expected mortality and actual mortality is minimal for Norway &amp; Finland.</p>
<p>While you could conclude from this that Sweden did significantly worse than Norway and Finland, my dataset provides addresses a much greater time period, starting January 1st, all the way up to October 25th. And if you take this entire period into consideration, in becames anything but obvious that Norway &amp; Finland did better than Sweden...</p>

        <p>If I understand your argument, you’re basically analyzing mortality displacement. Basically, Sweden had all of its deaths upfront, whereas the other countries are now “catching up”.</p>
<p>I downloaded the dataset in your table and looked at the totals for weekly variance to P-score.</p>
<p>Norway- (29.56)
Denmark - 28.68
Finland - 101.94
Sweden - 213.83</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see if those other countries do indeed “catch up” to Sweden’s overall mortality rate variance.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely convinced that even Sweden is buying this strategy anymore.</p>
<p>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/after-resisting-lockdowns-sweden-is-now-imposing-unprecedented-coronavirus-restrictions-as-cases-soar</p>
<p>“Coronavirus-related hospitalisations in Sweden are currently rising faster than in any other European country”</p>
<p>“The limit for public gatherings, until now set to between 50 and 300 people depending on the type of event, will be reduced to eight as of 24 November, an "unprecedented" measure deemed "necessary" to curb the spread of the virus, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told reporters.”</p>
<p>“Last week, the government announced that bars and restaurants would no longer be allowed to serve alcohol after 10pm from 20 November until the end of February.”</p>
