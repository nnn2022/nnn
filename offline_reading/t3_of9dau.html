    <strong>Need inspiration !</strong>
    <p><p>As a result of this maddening scamdemic, I’ve become very discouraged about life. I was always an introvert but now I no longer care to socialize at all, not even with family and friends who are not doomers. </p>
<p>I like being a hermit now, and even dream of how nice it would be to live in a sparsely populated 3rd world nation lol!</p>
<p>My only problem is my daily motivation. That has gone totally out the window. I struggle to make myself exercise, cook, or do basic housekeeping. I just wanna lay on the couch with my cat and meditate or scroll through beautiful scenery photos on Instagram. </p>
<p>Anyone else find themselves in this same boat? And/or can anyone offer me some good inspiration or something on how to infuse myself with positive motivation?</p></p>

        <p>Meditate on the brutal fact that life is short and that you too will die, and then stop frittering away the time, which suddenly reveals itself as very limited. Then exercise and work.</p>

        <p>When you realize like I do that this existence is somewhat of a joke, like some big troll, etc then surely I am here to learn the lessons I need, and hope that I will be back in one way or another.. </p>
<p>Life is really so short.. I have so  much to see and learn and will only experience 0.000000000001% of what this timeline had to offer. It is not the end.</p>

        <p>Yes, for me it is loss of productivity. That drive to work on long term projects and future goals with what I want to learn or investing in projects that will make $$$ in the future.</p>
<p>Kind of a normal thing when your future and freedoms seem to be up in the air..</p>
<p>Also I'm a lot less busy with work than I normally would be, so I would be outside more right now than usual.. that restless feeling is no good as well.</p>
<p>As StormyMoon pointed out a daily walk, or walking every chance you get is a good way to get exercise, about 20 mins you'll go introverted, (Dont distract yourself with an ipod) and think things through and plan.</p>
<p>Good sleep and don't go to crazy on diet. Sugar can do a lot to you, change your mood or worse.</p>

        <p>Me too.</p>
<p>I started an online course and it has been very fascinating.  I'm studying nutrition, which has really opened my eyes.  Since then I've started making minor adjustments (very minor) to my eating habits and already I'm seeing a difference in my overall happiness and mood.</p>
<p>At this time since we are not allowed to look outward into the world, we can use this time to look inward.  The inward world is infinite.  Learn about yourself.  Learn about your body.  Learn as much as you can.  This down time could be turned into an opportunity if we take advantage of it.</p>
