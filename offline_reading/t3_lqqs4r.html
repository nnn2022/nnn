        <p>I’ve taken a hard stance on not wearing a mask. I also live in California where it is pretty unpopular to do so.</p>
<p>To those reading: don’t be afraid! Stand up and try it! If you don’t want this to go on forever, we must stop now.</p>
<p>I’ve faced no harassment or harsh comments. At worst I get a side eye, or I get asked to leave. When I get asked to leave, I simply smile and say, “Sure! No problem!” I don’t want to spend my money at an establishment that reinforces these irrational mask mandates anyways, so it works out.</p>

        <p>well, no one gives a fuck about your opinion. you will probably end up getting the virus and begging the hospital to give you a bed there but you won't get it.</p>

        <p>And no one gives a fuck about your opinion either. </p>
<p>A couple things..
1. Already got COVID in November, wasn’t that bad. My partner got it too but we are both fine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Part of why I don’t wear a mask is because of the sensory issues I have. From ages 7-10, I was raped by a family member. He would cover my mouth every time he violated me. To this day, anything obstructing my neck or my mouth causes me to panic. (wearing a scarf or even a turtle neck is very stressful, and this was before the “””pandemic”””.) </li>
</ol>
<p>Consider that there might be reasons for not wearing a mask that are not blatantly obvious to you.</p>
<p>Why are you so adamant it forcing your way of life on people? Is your way of living the only and absolute truth?</p>

        <p>didn't know about the rape thing sorry but this is a pandemic. even if you don't get effected by it literally hundreds of people you walk past every day does. this isn't about you this is about the whole world.</p>
<p>second thing I'm not forcing my opinion I just said no one gives a fuck. it's like you wanna kill people and be like "oh I just didn't wanna wear a mask what's the problem". yes maybe it's "not real" or some shit but who cares. in the end it really kills people and you don't have to do much to stop that. if your mother died from it because someone didn't wanna wear a fucking mask for 20 minutes would you be happy about that? I just don't get how you guys operate your mind.</p>

        <p>Lol, did you read my comment? I already got COVID. I am fine, most everyone who gets COVID will be fine too.</p>
<p>I don’t live my life for “the whole world”. Even if my mother died from COVID, I still would not advocate for forced mask wearing. 
Don’t give me ~hypotheticals~, I have my reasons and I stand by them. No, I won’t even wear a mask for 20 minutes. </p>
<p>You screaming at me, telling me, “I’m going to get it and die waiting for a hospital bed!” doesn’t demonstrate your compassion. In fact it makes you look vengeful that someone doesn’t live by your world view. </p>
<p>If no one gives a fuck... well... hate to break it to you..
<em>You</em> are someone. You seem like you are giving a couple of fucks that I don’t wear a mask. So... I dunno about that one buddy.</p>
<p>I hope you can learn that maybe there are all types of reasons for not wanting to wear a mask. If you want me to see your side, try asking questions and not being angry. It starts a better conversation.</p>

        <p>I already know what your "reasons" are. you said it in your first comment. also yeah I don't give a fuck about you. I care about all the people who might die or get seriously ill because of your "views" and shit. you are acting like 9 year olds. "oh I can't wear a fucking piece of cloth that covers my mouth for 20 minutes. oh you don't like that, let me call the police on you. oh I might kill someone because of my ignorance, well I don't care".</p>

        <p>Hmmm... do you don’t care about the individual but instead an anonymous group? That doesn’t make much sense to me. Doing things for “the greater good” can be dangerous. Stay in high school to keep learning on that.</p>
<p>Also, you calling me stupid doesn’t make you smart. </p>
<p>I won’t wear a mask, I haven’t worn a mask in quite some time. I have news for you... I haven’t killed anyone! Everything is okay!</p>
<p>I hope one day you are not fear struck. You can’t live your life for others, you must do it for yourself.</p>
<p>I wish you the best ❤️</p>
