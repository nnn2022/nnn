    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 31/x: "If we can take early action against the pandemic, which is very harsh and possibly out of proportion to the citizens at this point in time, then we could quickly bring a pandemic to its knees." -Prime Minister from the 3rd biggest state in Germany.</strong>
    <p><p>During an interview, the Prime Minister from Baden-Württemberg, Winfried Kretschmann, a left-authorian politician who was active in the Communist League of West Germany, dropped a bomb. </p>
<p>&rt;"My thesis is: If we can take early measures against the pandemic, which are very harsh and possibly not proportionate to the citizens at this time, then we could bring a pandemic to its knees quickly." Then one does not have to restrict fundamental rights for months and in waves, with considerable negative consequences for the whole of society. "So we should fundamentally consider whether we don't have to change the regime so that tough interventions in civil liberties become possible in order to get the pandemic under control quickly."</p>
<p>Just to state some facts, in case you don't know about rules and measures in Germany and especially in Baden-Württemberg, nearly everything was closed there. When a few things opened again, you had to get tested. There were even curfews and there are still alcohol bans and assembly bans right now, with in Incidence of 8.1. And the Prime Minster is talking about even tougher interventions in civil liberties! As if the rules and measures before were and are not hard enough.</p>
<p>If you want to print out the Corona regulation on the measures against the spread of the Coronavirus, make sure that you have 46 pages of paper ready. This is the short version. While the state has an Incidence of 8.1. This are "light" measures and rules, as it seems.</p>
