    <strong>This is the point of the vaccine. WO2020060606 Digital currency and mass surveillance</strong>
    <p><p>https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606</p>
<p>“For example, a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, such as viewing advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.</p>
<p>To implement the process, a server provides a task to a user’s device, which is communicatively coupled to the server. A special sensor then indicates body activity of the individual, while a cryptocurrency system verifies whether or not the body activity data satisfies the conditions set by the cryptocurrency system. Ultimately, the system awards cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified."</p>
<p>Think of it in this scenario</p>
<p>Task 1, type 50 pages</p>
<p>Pay: Up to 2.3 units under optimal conditions</p>
<p>The system is tracking you:
You ate a snack, minus 0.2 units</p>
<p>You used the bathroom and showered longer than environmentally friendly, minus 0.5 units</p>
<p>You scratched their leg, minus 0.03 units</p>
<p>Any deviation from the task given to you, reduces your pay.</p>
<p>Now take it even further</p>
<p>You drive instead of taking the bus? Deduction taken from your account instantly</p>
<p>You used the bus instead of cycling? Deduction instantly</p>
<p>You cycle instead of walking? Instant deduction</p>
<p>You litter? Instant deduction</p>
<p>You say anything against the government? Instant deduction</p>
<p>Any deviation from the task your corporate masters give you at your job, reduces your pay, any thing you do that the state doesn't like reduces your savings.</p>
<p>Total control, mass surveillance.</p></p>

        <p>Actually beginning to believe the digital currency  bit. Just saw a piece in the Washington examiner about a institution that attempts to put a number on the real national debt. You are probably familiar with the 28 trillion figure. This institution came up with an unbelievable 120 trillion real debt when factoring in social security and Medicare debt owed to hospitals. There is no paying back that debt. There is not printing that amount of debt. The entire global economy would collapse first. They need a digital currency because this one is dead it’s just floating along because the ruling class knows that if they don’t pretend everything is ok they are the first casualties of what is to come, they will be lynched. If they are accurate I don’t even know where to begin to protect myself from the fallout financially.</p>

        <p>Yeah ol' Uncle Ted was right - Technology marches on, not because anyone needs it, but because the inventors are bored. They'll keep going as long as they can afford to be bored, as long as their energies aren't directed toward the physical necessities of survival.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely crazy, but we can no longer be surprised at this point when most conspiracy theories have become true. 
They applied for this back in June 2019...
Seriously, at this point anyone who still thinks this is a real pandemic is a fucking moron. The evidence is really everywhere if you take the time to look for it rather than mindlessly following the narrative.
Ignorance is a sin.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this for a year now. They are going to track us through payments. The only blockchain technology that can handle all the worlds money is xrp. It’s also one of the most hated on crypto’s. Wonder why...</p>

        <p>Is there a single computer engineer in this entire sub? Or even a biologist that would recognize how you could not design a single sensor array that recognizes such a broad set of arbitrary behaviors in a body, let alone the absurdity of thinking you could make one with all of that functionality and a network connection which fits through the needle in a syringe?</p>
<p>As one of the former who has also worked in a micro-electromechanical systems lab, this conspiracy theory is completely insane, even if you assume that everyone in the world would want nothing more than for this to happen.</p>
<p>And, as someone who has worked at top tech companies, they paid $8000 per patent concept you handed to the lawyers regardless of what it was. Many people just cranked out nonsense patent concepts, since it's really not hard as a technically skilled person supported by teams of top patent lawyers to get random poorly defined ideas past the USPTO. You could make hundreds of thousands a year in bonuses just writing up ridiculous concepts.</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't care if the patent works or is useful, because that's not how patent law is used in software. Patent law in software is just used as Mutually Assured Destruction, where you collect as many as possible so that you can file as many countersuits as possible against anyone who sues you. Then people avoid suing you because you will bury them in legal fees if they do, thus justifying paying $8k/patent (idk what microsoft specifically pays, but everyone pays those patent bonuses) even if the patents are insane.</p>
<p>Posting such clearly absurd theories does not help the cause.</p>
