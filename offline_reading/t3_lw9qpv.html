    <strong>A Japanese variant coming to a country near you</strong>
    <p><p>The elusive Japanese variant coming in the latter half of 2021 has adapted to evade not only the first layer of masks but has also evolved into evading a second or even third layer of masks. Not only this but it’s sprouted little legs so after it’s traveled airborn it can walk several inches. Four masks  and social distancing of 7.5’ are now required. </p>
<p>Lead scientific scientist of pandemics Jericho L. Had this to say “We’ve never seen anything like this before, it’s not even from Japan. This new variant seems to ninja its way through the first few layers of masks, it either slices through at high speeds or simply goes around the masks but seems to stop at about the fourth layer.”</p>
<p>When asked where the variant actually comes from Jericho said it’s classified, we are still unsure if face shields offer enough protection. </p>
<p>Last night Doctor Fauci had this to say “as you’ve probably heard” Fauci blushes at the camera “this Japanese variant is incredibly lethal, most airborn viruses stop after only a few feet of being airborn, but this thing keeps moving” Fauci winks at a journalist who promptly raises his hand “even when on the ground, meaning we now have to increase our social distancing to at least 7.5 feet” many journalists tirelessly tried to ask Dr. Fauci questions but the only answer he gave was “yes I am very photogenic”</p></p>
