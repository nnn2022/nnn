    <strong>Broken &amp; discouraged (rant)</strong>
    <p><p>Dear NNN members,</p>
<p>I am so happy to have found this community many months ago as I discovered like-minded people who are also disagreeing with the madness of this plandemic.</p>
<p>My city has been somewhat lucky with regards to covid as we had lower number of cases than our neighbours (I live in Canada) so while only going through 2 severe lockdowns, the whole did not seem as crazy. Our entire province is a bit over 1 million in population and we have 16 active cases. We have had 2-3 cases per day on most days unless it's another 'wave' again.. People are also getting vaccinated and it seemed like there would be no push for any sort of passport. Even our public health doctor was saying it won't happen. </p>
<p>However, while we are having elections here atm (earlier than usual...) - a liberal candidate announced that they will be exploring an option for covid-passports (they named it something else of course). To attend restaurants, gyms and shops, all for the safety of the people in the province right..! Of course, many ppl are supporting this. My favourite is "You need vaccinations for travel, education and certain jobs so this is normal". We never needed any vaccinations to go to a bar or restaurant, EVER! How people do not see a difference is beyond me.</p>
<p>To make things worse - the people I considered to be even somewhat open to the idea of this NOT being normal - are now pretty much denying any information I provide them. They don't believe that highly educated people or people in power would speak out against this or disagree. This was AFTER I've sent one of them a video of a local doctor here who spoke out against how pandemic has been handled and he was stripped of his title as director of the emergency department. These people are ignoring all of this telling me "the government will do what they want, nothing we can do about it" "I just want to enjoy life and be happy" - be happy in a country where there is straight-up medical segregation going on?? HOW?!?!? HOW?!?! How with clear consciousness is this supposed to work for you?? I am broken and discouraged. Disgusted with the fact that these people SEE what's going on, but they CHOSE to IGNORE IT! That's a choice THEY CONSCIOUSLY Make!!!! Just wondering what it will take to wake people out? I doubt it will happen. Even after they will refuse us groceries and medical care, I highly doubt people will even think for a second. They will just pat themselves on the back and say "good thing I got my 15th booster"</p>
<p>For the record, I am a registered nurse currently studying to be NP. Vaccines so far are not mandated, but I am waiting for that day. I am currently pregnant and have 2 other children. My husband and I are both refusing the jab and moving away somewhere else (Alberta looking good) is looking more and more real these days.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this, I really needed to get it off my chest.</p>
<p>Stay strong everyone! I KNOW we are on the right side of history!</p></p>

        <p>&rt; These people are ignoring all of this telling me "the government will do what they want, nothing we can do about it" <strong>"I just want to enjoy life and be happy"</strong></p>
<p>They are HEAVILY mistaken. If they comply, then there will be more endless goalposts to jump over. The government will NOT give them their lives back.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> it's "this will all end if everyone just got the fucking VACCINE"</p>
<p><strong>Soon</strong> it will be "this will all end if children under 12 can get vaccinated"</p>
<p><strong>THEN</strong> later it will be "this will all end if everyone just got the fucking BOOSTER JAB"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"This will all end if everyone just (insert whatever here)"</p>
<p>Security theatre DOES. NOT. END. It's War on Terror 2.0 (War on Disease). Only way it ends is non-compliance, and then the politicians will quietly move on to the next Crisis, don't expect a "Mission accomplished". Ever wonder why states are barely locking down now? HINT: It's not because they suddenly care, but they know it's politically unpopular.</p>
<p>They would've definitely 100% locked down to the point that you'd yearn for 2020 to come back, IF people did not react badly to CDC's blunder. Most people don't realize how important this moment was. If they had just laid down and accepted it, the politicians would've 100% escalated more restrictions from there.</p>
<p>Thank god there was outrage back in late July to prevent that slippery slope from happening, now they know its political suicide so they're pretending like they would've never locked down. Early on in the year, I remember politicians saying "lockdowns are not ruled out" which means they left that as a potential backdoor. Thankfully the outrage probably made them backtrack that decision.</p>
<p>Never give them an inch, or you're finished.</p>

        <p>Funny enough I also hear that from other people - "it's because they did not vaccinate teenagers" (with regards to Israel spike in cases) and "oh i will not be getting a booster at all, no thanks". I am like if you got 1 and 2, you WILL be complying with getting others! They are kidding themselves when they say otherwise. Just oblivious to their own herd-mentality.</p>

<p>So why? </p>

        <p>And it has been shown that vaccines do not work as well as they initially thought! Israel should be a good representation of this but everyone seems to blame the data and ignore the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Just move to Alberta already.  Half of the people from your province under 50 already has.  Nobody outside of the urban centers ever gave a single fuck about covid, and are not about to start caring now.</p>
