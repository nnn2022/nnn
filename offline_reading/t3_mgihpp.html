        <p>SS:</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci has come out and said that if you have been vaccinated and come in contact with a covid positive person you only should test if you show symptoms. </p>
<p>‚ÄúIn fact, I wouldn‚Äôt say that that‚Äôs something you should do,‚Äù Fauci, President Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser, said on the ‚ÄúCBS This Morning,‚Äù CNN reported. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve been fully vaccinated with two doses of the mRNA or one dose of the J&amp;J [Johnson &amp; Johnson] I would not be considering, unless you develop symptoms that were suggestive, but not if you‚Äôre without symptoms.‚Äù</p>
<p>( https://www.washingtoninformer.com/those-fully-vaccinated-dont-need-covid-19-testing-if-asymptomatic-fauci/ ) </p>
<p>But if you haven‚Äôt been vaccinated you need to get tested. They have been screaming about asymptomatic spread for the past year, so it would only make sense to also test people who have had the vaccine just in case. If I am not showing symptoms I am not sick. Covid isn‚Äôt a silent killer that you don‚Äôt know you have and you just drop dead out of the blue. This only goes to show how flawed the tests are which we have been saying for the past year.</p>
<p>P.s a friend helped me with the meme, hope it comes across well!</p>

        <p>I think this is simpler.  If a lot of people who were vaccinated were tested and came back positive, which it would due to PCR (among other quality control issues) it would raise more questions about the validity of PCR and the efficacy of the vaccine.  In order to avoid that, we just don't have many get tested.</p>

        <p>I guess I could see this, but I would be skeptical. Most 'rona vaccines, especially the plain mRNA vaccines, are non-replicating (except for the J&amp;J adenovirus vaccine). Once that micelle fuses with a cell, only that cell should have the 'rona mRNA in it and produce spike proteins. Then Antigen Presenting Cells should pick up that protein--not the mRNA itself. Thus the protein "spreads" to the immune system (but shouldn't go back out to distal tissue), but the mRNA should stay pretty localized to where it fused.</p>
<p>Given that they do a nasopharynx swab, I don't think the vaccine would cause mRNA levels to show in those mucosal cells. I guess it could if they had some sort of antibody embedded in the micelle to aid in localizing it to the nasopharynx tissue, but I haven't read anything about ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>I'm partial to the typical shifting goalposts and oscillating narrative theory. Speaking conjecture as fact, even after being proven otherwise.</p>

        <p>Nono, sorry, I just mean that people who have been vaccinated will still encounter sars-cov-2 as it circulates, and despite the immune response will still be able to test positive for the rna.</p>

        <p>I thought the whole point of the vaccine was to reduce symptoms... wouldn't vaccinated people be more likely to cause asymptomatic spread versus unvaccinated? üôÉ</p>

        <p>You're about 90 percent less likely to spread the virus if you have the vaccine. That's the answer.</p>

        <p>How so if its in your body or on your person you still will spread it. Even if you have no symptoms its not a shield</p>
