    <strong>How are people this stupid?</strong>
    <p><p>Each and every day I check on my RINO governor’s (DeWine) Facebook page to see the comments on his posts. Fortunately, it seems that more and more negative comments are getting upvoted and posted, but I still see a lot of comments saying “wear a mask” and some Doomer memes.</p>
<p>How are people still believing the mask bs? These doomers keep saying that the reason why we’re still in lockdown is because no one is wearing a mask. Well, if I remember, it is estimated that 98% of Ohioans are compliant. You’re going to tell me that the 2% of the population is reasonable for all of these cases? I live in one of the most dommer-est counties in the state (Cuyahoga). Everyone wears a mask, remote classes 5 days a week, there’s morbidly obese security (wo)men guarding the entrance of grocery stores in Cleveland (major city), etc. Yet I’m pretty sure my counties is among the worst in the number of cases. </p>
<p>Even if masks worked if everyone wore them, wouldn’t that make masks one of the most unreliable strategies to combat this virus? It’s very hard to make every single person in Ohio-or the world-to wear a mask, even if it’s against federal/state law to not be compliant-there’s still going to be people refusing to wear a mask. In almost every single country it’s illegal to commit murder, yet there hasn’t been one country with the homicide rate of 0%.</p>
<p>When will these people wake up? I just want to live normally again. Quality of life has gotten so much worse this year. I don’t want to live like this anymore.</p></p>

        <p>I live in a tiny Canadian town with ZERO cases since this began and we're still locked down. Everyone acts like a schizo in public now too. If you dare question lockdowns then someone will go on a rant about how they know a guy, who knows a guy, who knows a guy with covid. It's insane.</p>

        <p>The crazy part is, it doesn't matter if they know a guy. My boss had covid, my coworker, his wife, my sister, all her kids, my parents, my friend's parents... and they're all perfectly fine and have moved on with their lives. For the vast majority of people it hardly does anything, and yet everyone is freaked out about it.</p>

        <p>It's Stockholm Syndrome, I think, literally. I've noticed that the people in my life who are most pro-lockdown ironically tend to be the same ones that are hurt the most by lockdowns. When the entity that abuses you is the same that you look to, to remove your pain, you get Stockholm Syndrome.</p>
<p>Edit: 
I'm saying this because
&rt; the reason why we’re still in lockdown is because no one is wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Is just the sort of logically absurd thing an abused person would say to excuse their abuser.</p>

        <p>Are the Cleveland security beasts used as a deterrent for would-be maskless bum rushes, or are morbidly obese women everywhere, just an unfortunate byproduct of living in Ohio?</p>
