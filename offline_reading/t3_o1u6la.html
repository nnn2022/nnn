    <strong>Vibe check: We're against experimental, let me use you as a Guinea pig while making huge profits vaccine and not like polio vaccine r-right?</strong>
    <p><p>Thanks to everybody that commented or voted.  My hope was that some of the hysterical brigaders might see this post and realize they are using the anti-vax label incorrectly.  My personal opinion is that vaccines can be safe and effective when properly researched but we are nowhere near that yet with covid.  For the people that think this isn't the place.  I disagree.  There is a narrative being crafted about us and I think the more we craft our own narrative the stronger our community will be.  Thanks again.  Good luck out there.</p></p>

<p>Polio vaccine, a vaccine that stops people getting polio and was given away free by its inventor</p>

        <p>I think that people’s views range, but I hope I can speak for most people regarding this... I (and perhaps many others) are not against life-saving vaccines, but rather disapprove of experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>But then again I’m sure there are others who would disagree, and say they’re against all vaccines, but I think the purpose of this sub isn’t for that. It’s a place that rejects <em>this</em> jab, for various reasons.</p>

        <p>Oh I just meant for some people. Perhaps not always life saving, but I was thinking of specifically the polio vaccine (which was developed in what, 17 years?) since that’s a disease that causes real harm and I’d rather take that vaccine than live with that. </p>
<p>Some vaccines (for some people) probably could save their life down the road, but that’s just my assumption and I’m no doctor. </p>
<p>Perhaps my comment was poorly worded... they’re not always life saving, but could prevent something from happening in the future, which in turn could save someone’s life.</p>

        <p>That’s true. My mistake, I should have been more careful with my wording. I’m certainly no doctor, but I suppose there is a correlation between vaccination for a disease and fewer deaths in the future. </p>
<p>Now, I know that it’s foolish to assume causation from correlation, but it’s happened many times, especially before vaccines were so politicized.</p>
<p>When I wrote that comment, keep in mind I was speaking from my views (that most vaccines are useful, but experimental ones are not).</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree. I knew someone who's parents where completely anti vax and she got a handful of nasty illnesses when she was younger. Im not adverse to normal vaccines allthough I would want to research some before taking them to see if I really needed them. Im of the view that science makes sometimes and a lot of medicines have bad or unknown side effects. Allthough it is rare think it's best not to roll the dice unless the cons out weigh the pros. I used to be against this simply because I did not need it. But now having looked into this vaccine it seems that the adverse effects are much more common and wide ranging than I would have thought</p>

        <p>There is NO scientific evidence of a necessity for a vaccine (or ANY extraordinary measure) for this virus, regardless of how safe or effective or well researched or fully approved or how many years old any vaccine for this virus is or is not.</p>
<p>It's all 100% marketing, and if any vaccine was fully approved, proven safe, proven effective, and had 5 or 10 or 62 years of a track record, and whatever, it'd STILL only be 100% marketing with no scientific necessity.</p>
<p>Anybody consuming any vaccine for this virus is doing so for no better reason (besides coercion, in which case substitute those coercing) than to benefit the current and future revenue of the pharmacutical industry, their many affiliates, and their stakeholders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people are willfully keeping themselves under the illusion (cast by the pharmacutical industry at the cost of very many billions of dollars over many decades) that the human body is a pathetic, weak, wretched, incapable, disgusting thing that can't even support life without 6 to 12 or so synthetic molecules from the pharmaceutical industry, and we sure seem to be headed for a subscription service to supplant our own immune system.</p>
<p>Start learning about actual science.  Begin with learning how to tell the difference between marketing and science.</p>
<p>Learn about the ~two dozen nutrients that the immune system requires and the other ~two dozen+ nutrients that the body otherwise requires.</p>
<p>Start making sure to get good healthy amounts of all of those nutrients.  Doing so requires actual concerted effort by every individual.  There is no game server that just makes it happen or not.  It is NOT a game of chance.</p>
<p>Learn about the many other things that science has found that ~500,000,000+ years of side-by-side evolution in our environment has lead the human body to potentially be able to make beneficial use of, even if not considered required.</p>

        <p>I agree that our immune system is much more capable than we probably realize or led to believe but I also know introducing a live but weakened virus will produce an immune response thus providing immunity to any future encounter with that virus.  That's certainly not a scientific necessity for everyone but I'm glad we figured it out.</p>

<p>Historically, as far as I can remember (don't quote me on this), there's been hundreds of thousands of polio infections, including severe and even debilitating illness, <em>caused by</em> polio vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yes.  The last cases of wild polio were declared gone several months ago.  The only remaining cases are those <em>caused by</em> polio vaccine.</p>
<p>So my point is that more vaccines than is at all obvious seem to be about marketing, rather than health or science.  </p>
<p>I mean; I'm <em>not</em> glad that we figured out how to inject polio into people that are likely to lack proper nutritional status for their immune system to cope with it.</p>
<p>The polio virus is, again, another virus that appears to be no match for the human immune system:</p>
<p>https://www.healthline.com/health/poliomyelitis#symptoms</p>
<p>&rt;What are the symptoms of polio?
&rt;It’s estimated that 95 to 99 percent of people who contract poliovirus are asymptomatic. This is known as subclinical polio. Even without symptoms, people infected with poliovirus can still spread the virus and cause infection in others.</p>
<p>The statistics of the <em>other</em> 1% to 5% that are not asymptomatic are consistent with the statistics observed of people (of all age groups, all around the world including in USA, UK, Germany, etc) having the most severe single or multiple nutritional inadequacies or other challenges (such as impaired uptake harm or rapid elimination harm caused by pharmaceutical industry synthetic molecules prescribed by doctors).</p>
<p>It's interesting that many of the covidiots that come into this sub to defecate in public here cite polio to strike up fear, saying things like "well, we erradicated polio with vaccines!!!!!!!", and even some people that are in this and similar subs to participate on-topic might say things like "it's not like this is polio!  If it was polio, of course we'd be frightened out of our minds"</p>
<p>People <strong><em>want</em></strong> to be marketed to, and <em>so many</em> people are absolutely desperate to not take personal responsibility for themselves</p>
<p>In fact, people have told me that it's cruel to think that people should take personal responsibility for themselves, and that nobody has control over what they put in their body.</p>
<p>This seems to relate to many people wanting "universal healthcare" and UBI.</p>
<p>Apparently a game server RNG governs what goes into our bodies, rendering everything a game of chance.</p>

        <p>Are the children that had debilitating polio illness deliberately injected into them heartbreaking?</p>
<p>As I said: those statistics are consistent with the statistics that science has observed of the very worst nutritional inadequacies.</p>
<p>Science says that we must properly apply the ordinary that is known to science, and then and only then (outside of emergency or critical care) can we consider if am extraordinary measure is necessary.</p>
<p>Marketing says: "Consume <em>product</em>!"</p>
<p>Can you tell the difference?  I get the impression that you cannot.</p>
<p>At best, a vaccine can help with exactly one pathogen.  If the pathogen mutates too much, then the vaccine can no longer even, at best, help with that.</p>
<p>The human immune system is HIGHLY adaptive and is the contemporary result of ~500,000,000 years of evolution in our environment to fight off pathogens, regardless of their novelty.  To my knowledge, there's very few that intrinsically can out maneuver the human immune system.  Rabies is an example of one that apparently is too much of a mis-match for the human immune system, as far as I know.</p>
<p>For others such as polio or SARS-COV-2, the evidence is that the human immune system outmatches those viruses.</p>
<p>In the cases where individuals have problems, it's clearly personal problems of their own.</p>
<p>I promote personal responsibility and people working to dispell their own ignorance, but it is true that the pharmaceutical industry has invested very many billions of dollars over many decades to market that ignorance into people, and market drug dependency problems into almost everybody.</p>
<p>Learn the difference between marketing and science.</p>

        <p>In the 1940s an average of 35,000 people were paralyzed every year from polio.  Throughout the entire 1970s there were only 10 cases.  Did our immune systems all of sudden make a fantastic evolutionary advancement?  Or was it helped along?</p>

        <p>People have had random nutritional inadequacies all along.  What part of that is not clear to you?</p>
<p>Like, how would you have to ask a question posing false dichotomies that that would be the obvious answer already?</p>
<p>Or I might be misunderstanding your question... Interpreting it a different way, maybe the answer is that we'd gotten far enough into the herd immunity gradient.</p>
<p>When you say "cases", you're talking about "identified cases".  There's obviously no possible way to know how many cases were not identified.</p>

        <p>I found some research to suggest that vitamin deficiency IS correlated with polio outbreaks.  Increased sanitation standards also seem to be correlated with fewer outbreaks.  Although I haven't been able to find exact research it's highly probable  that food fortification and increased sanitation played just as an important role in the dramatic decrease in polio cases between the 1940s and 1970s as the vaccine.  I'm still not sure why we wouldn't keep using the inactivated polio vaccine we use in America considering theres no chance for the virus to mutate and infect other people.</p>

        <p>The scientific method is to first test proper application of the known ordinary requirements to determine if that's adequate, or still meaningfully inadequate.</p>
<p>The marketing method is: "Consume product!"</p>
<p>I respect science.  I do not respect marketing.</p>
<p>Science has a <em>whole lot</em> of <em>very</em> detailed understanding of how various nutrients are involved in very many various aspects of the immune system.</p>
<p>At least most (or probably all?) relevant nutrients are involved in multiple facets of the immune system.</p>
<p>In disease processes that arise from a whole lot of different pathogens, such as Ebola, polio, MERS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, SARS, SARS-COV-2, etc, the problems always start with excess cytokine expression.</p>
<p>Generally this is due to dysregulation of certain mechanisms within the immune system.</p>
<p>Mechanisms that we already know require good healthy amounts of various nutrients to be expected to function properly.</p>
<p>Nutrients that we already know that some people don't even intake the established bare minimums of (ie RDA), much less good healthy amounts, and/or they are otherwise nutritionally challenged such as drugs causing poor uptake or rapid elimination, and/or they are nutritionally challenged with other interdependent nutrients that metabolism for the nutrients that these regulatory mechanisms depend on.</p>
<p>The statistics for bad immune system response to polio, and to SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with the statistics for the worst single or multiple nutritional statuses.</p>
<p>The population cross-sections observed to have the worst trouble with covid are exactly the same groups observed to consistently have the worst nutritional statuses.</p>
<p>Are you able to keep all of that in mind at the same time and see that if it looks like a duck, and walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, and swims like a duck, and flies like a duck, and lays eggs like a duck maybe .... What?  Consume product?  Or maybe: it's a duck?</p>
