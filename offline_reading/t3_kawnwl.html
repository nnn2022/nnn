    <strong>I saw a fb post today about confronting someone without a mask that makes me lose faith in society</strong>
    <p><p>Gonna paraphrase in abundance of caution. </p>
<p>A super doomer I know <em>had</em> to go to a store (only been getting delivery/curbside) and sees a woman, no mask, with her kids. He asks her to put a mask on, woman says she has a condition and can’t wear one, get out of my business. </p>
<p>Does not stop doomer. ‘If you have that sort of condition, you shouldn’t be out during a pandemic’. Gets flipped off. ‘You already said f* (but he used full word) by not wearing a mask. But f you too’. </p>
<p>She yells for him to not speak like that in front of kids. So he decided to approach the children and say ‘I hope you’re seeing that your mom is teaching you that you don’t have to follow rules if you don’t feel like it, that you can do whatever regardless of consequences to others’.  At this point she and kids just leave the store in full anger.  </p>
<p>This was real life. And I know of other people who have gotten up in peoples faces demanding masks. First, that violates the ‘social distancing’
Doomers love. Further...why has it become okay to harass people-including their children-in public? What has happened to people? Why is this okay? I can’t see us fully recovering from this. We’ve literally gotten to a place where we have to view other people as sick or evil or something. Society will break that way. </p>
<p>Oh, and another fun tidbit. Earlier this week this same guy posted a thing about wearing masks, someone commented due to trauma from being assaulted and gagged that he can’t wear a mask. This doomer said ‘mask up b*tch. Your trauma doesn’t outweigh our safety’.  Wtf.</p></p>

        <p>I was at Home Depot this week and I had someone come up to me, ask me to put a mask on, and when I said “no” he proceeded to tell me he wished “I would just die from it already.”</p>
<p>People actually think you’re going to drop dead for not wearing a mask. Unbelievable.</p>

        <p>This feeds right into the luciferian elites hands though, they enjoy starting wars and pitting sides against each other. They've started the recent straights vs gays, conservatives vs liberals, blacks vs whites, etc etc. All because they want ORDER out of CHAOS, they create the problem to usher in their solution.</p>

        <p>There's an older (70-80ish) guy on my town's FB who kind of designated himself the mask and social distancing town sheriff.  But he doesn't even come close to your guy.  I would give him all the distance he wants and stay away from that nut.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you have that sort of condition, you shouldn’t be out during a pandemic</p>
<p>So, he "had" to go out, but she shouldn't? Sounds like his problem.</p>
<p>Also, cussing out a woman and small children? Suuuuuuper classy, dude.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't go on Facebook at all anymore. It's a cesspool where people encourage each others' worst instincts.</p>

        <p>This is my experience in the UK too...almost everybody conforms but only one person has ever said anything to me (and I am out and about a lot...purposely as much as possible at the minute!!) and I haven’t witnessed anybody else being confronted. </p>
<p>I am thankful that there is some semblance of rationality!!</p>
