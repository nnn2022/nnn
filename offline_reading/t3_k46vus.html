        <p>This is from the UMN Center for Infectious Diesease Research and Policy. </p>
<p>This is backed by 62 references. 62 previous studies, even before Covid, starting the ineffectiveness of cloth masks.</p>
<p>Science doesn't stop being science because of politics. Covid-19 is still a coronavirus,  like SARS. If masks were ineffective October 2019 pre-covid-19 they are still ineffective post-covid-19.</p>

        <p>Ha! I didnâ€™t even catch that! I found it through just searching for mask effectiveness.</p>
<p>The problem is even if someone reads it, chances are they may still refuse to believe it or at least accept there is valid evidence that masks don't work.  Especially the mask made at home,  kept in a pants pocket.</p>

        <p>" In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask." </p>

<p>From the linked article. Who would have thought, if masks aren't used properly, they're not effective.</p>

        <p>Also from the article:</p>
<p>In sum, cloth masks exhibit very low filter efficiency. Thus, even masks that fit well against the face will not prevent inhalation of small particles by the wearer or emission of small particles from the wearer.</p>
<p>One study of surgical mask fit described above suggests that poor fit can be somewhat offset by good filter collection, but will not approach the level of protection offered by a respirator. The problem is, however, that many surgical masks have very poor filter performance. Surgical masks are not evaluated using worst-case filter tests, so there is no way to know which ones offer better filter efficiency.</p>

        <p>They list it in the article, and in the portionyou quoted: [masks] should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Masks are touted as a replacement to social distancing and increased hand washing. Masks are not a magical cure for Covid as the media promises they are. Forcing people to wear masks will not reduce the transmission rate, either. </p>
<p>Masks should be left up to the individual, not the government to mandate them.</p>

        <p>I honestly can't say I've seen a single time where masks, but not social distancing, has been promoted or condoned scientifically. The article encourages mask use. People wearing masks, especially using them effectively, according to the article itself, does lower transmission rates. That's why for many, many years, they are mandated in surgical care (risk of infection in open wounds, etc). </p>
<p>Maybe I don't get out much (haha), but I also haven't seen the media touting masks as a cure so much as an additional precaution (like distancing and handwashing), so I don't see how that's an issue.</p>
<p>The last response is an opinion but not really supported by this article. If people listened to science, properly wore masks, social distanced, etc, then we would have no mandates, so I'm still blaming the people who can't follow basic health guidelines for this hellscape we're currently in.</p>

        <p>Well actually this might just be easier to start with so we have a similar reference point. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa864/5866094">https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa864/5866094</a></p>
<p>"The Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates. However, this policy causes more healthcare demand and more deaths than early stringent control and depends on continued public will."</p>
<p>Like I said, if people listened, properly distanced, etc. etc., as the Swedes did according to this piece of research, then we would not have so much of an issue.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Sweden definitely does not have the least deaths according to anywhere I can find, per capita and otherwise. Here, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/library/covid19/102320_covidupdate.html">https://www.cdc.gov/library/covid19/102320_covidupdate.html</a> the CDC summarizes some articles going more in depth about it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Due to the sources above and everything else I've seen, I disagree Sweden's scenario disproves anything I've said. In fact, it seems to reinforce my point that those who do not follow social distancing and self-isolation are the cause of the troubles we have in the US.</p>

        <p>The cause of the troubles in the US (and around the world) is from a virus and the personal health decision of individuals. Blaming other people for not social distancing or self-isolating is absurd. If you get sick, it is no one's fault but your own, unless someone maliciously tries to infect you on purpose. If you are concerned about getting sick, it's your responsibility to limit your own social interaction. It's your responsibility to properly wash your hands. It's your responsibility to avoid touching your mouth, nose, eyes, etc. Relying on people you don't know to properly social distance, properly wear masks, properly self-isolate, is peak stupidity and complete laziness. This attempt to shift the blame onto "everyone else" for your own inability to protect yourself is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Sweden 'voluntary distancing' that everyone claims happened is nothing like a lockdown. Go on YouTube and look at videos from Gothenburg or Stockholm in April or May. People are everywhere, the restaurants / bars are full, noone wears masks (not that the rest of the world did then either as they were not recommended).  Rather than looking at useless manipulated statistics, why not use your own brain? If lockdowns and masks did anything, the effect would be clearly visible when compared to places that had no lockdown. There should be some correlation between stringency of measures taken vs the outcome, and there is zero correlation for this. </p>
<p>If you want to know the true story of Sweden, you could go read Sebastian Rushmore's blog, a junior doctor in Stockholm who has worked in a hospital there the entire pandemic, or listen to his interview on the escape from lockdown podcast.  Do not blindly believe studies or articles in the media when the whole world is clearly massively biased against the country - probably exactly because the country disproves everything being said by everyone else. Your claim that lockdowns and masks would somehow end the virus is completely disproven by countries like Sweden and there being no correlation between stringent measures and outcome and like the other commentator said, blaming other people for your personal health outcome is a completely ridiculous stance to take regardless. </p>
<p>What happened is noones 'fault', it's a virus, these things happen, it should be viewed as a natural catastrophe if anything not something that can be controlled.  This is exactly what we are told not to do for things like HIV, shaming and embarrassing people for things beyond their control is not helpful or productive, it is the exact opposite.</p>

<p>If I send my child to school while they have the flu/strep, before taking any antibiotics, it is my fault and against school rules because it will harm other children in the school. This is not shaming or anything like that, nor is it beyond control. If you are sick, you stay home. But people aren't even following this, and that is when it becomes their fault, 100%.</p>
<p>Watching the video you suggested it even mentioned that he constantly kept things clean; if everyone in America did this we would have no issue, however, there is an extremely large part of the population who believes it is the responsibility of everyone else to keep themselves safe, instead of self-isolating and social distancing. This culture difference in and of itself can absolutely skew the data, especially when people do not follow the mandated orders anyway (in America). If people had simply stayed home when they were sick, we would not have an issue.</p>

        <p>The article doesn't, but a nice warm, moist space like that harbors all sorts of bacteria. I haven't seen any numbers, but there are cases, and it's certainly possible to catch things from your mask if not cleaned very regularly.</p>
<p>Also, even college sports have admitted masks reduce oxygen and needn't be worn on athletes (see vt vs pitt issue).</p>

        <p>Typically, those bacteria are much less infectious and pathogenic than covid, and are present already in your biological system (if you are exhaling bacteria which grow on the mask, your body is used to maintaining those bacteria. Brush your teeth!) Covid is a new disease where we do not have antigens already developed, so our bodies are not nearly as equipped. Our environment and bodies are _teeming_ with bacteria, and we constantly deal with the threat of such. However, typically your body is able to destroy the pathogenic bacteria before it does any harm due to seeing it before and recognizing it. Long story short, if you 1-time use a mask, or wash it regularly, it is not harmful. See surgeons wearing them every day for an example.</p>

<p>This has been debunked any number of times.

<p>Not necessarily or inherently; while everyone has nonspecific (innate) immunity, not everyone has or will have the correct antibodies as part of specific (adaptive) immunity simply due to how antibodies work. While there may be some overlap, it's not always as effective and we don't entirely understand how memory cells work. I'm not the most familiar with the mutations on the surface of corona or the infection mechanism itself, but if there are any mutations on the surface that the antibodies do not recognize, then you have to develop that immunity again. Specific scenario, yes, and I can agree that exposure to other coronaviruses limit the problem, but my main point was that the bacteria are not nearly as big of a threat since they 1. are commonly found homeostatically in the body, and 2. are not nearly as infectious. If you have evidence hygienic wearing of masks makes people more prone to bacterial or other viral infections, I would love to learn more.</p>

<p>Very true, which is why there are different levels of recommended masks in addition to social distancing etc. etc.</p>
<p>The original point was that masks do not increase the chance of bacterial infections if worn properly, with proper and typical hygiene. (Just in case this gets too long and we lose track of the original statement!)</p>

<p>I guess we just don't have sufficient data here.  We're exposed to bacteria, viruses, spores, chemicals, etc all the time, inside or out, from the air, food, and drinks.  In limited quantities, most will never cause us harm.  The molds found on bread left in the cupboard don't usually come from our houses, they are there all along and just have sufficient time to grow.  Even then they're usually just more unpleasant than dangerous.</p>
<p>Encountering these rarely causes us to get sick, even if they are actually capable.  We often talk (hype) about our phones being breeding grounds by collecting oils, staying warm, etc.  Masks do much the same, moreso the less they breathe.  (Around me everyone is wearing cloth masks, which was the source of my comment above.  They will trap much more moisture and heat than surgical masks.)</p>
<p>So the question is to what extent.  And keep in mind there is a wide gap between "ideal use" and "use by the general population" which is why even though n95s do have a place, the who and cdc have never recommended their public use prior to this year.  If everyone is wearing the wrong masks the wrong way, there may be no measurable benefit, and a few studies have confirmed this in real-world usage.  The same is true of mask use time limits.  They need to be cleaned often both to be effective and not to harbor bacteria.  Broadly, people don't.  </p>
<p>How much?  What's the actual tradeoff?  As I said, I don't think we have the actual data.  How many more cases of mild to moderate disease will there be?  Especially when confounded by altered behavior patterns, we'll simply never know.  What is the actual personal risk for someone without the best mask hygiene?  Nonzero, but is it significant?  I haven't seen any studies there.</p>

<p>Honestly, isn't this the same scenario though of personal responsibility to not get yourself (and others) sick? There's plenty of evidence that masks do help if used correctly. If people are using masks wrong, it's on the people using them poorly, not using masks.</p>
<p>And I agree about the sufficient data, but I do believe that with proper cleaning etc., there's no way that it will ever outweigh the cost of wearing a mask (not every day for the rest of your life, obviously, but until this blows over, or if you are otherwise sick and are trying to prevent the spread of whatever that is). Like, consider how nasty socks and underwear can get even in a day, but they're clean enough to use after a wash or gotten new.</p>
<p>&rt;How much? What's the actual tradeoff? As I said, I don't think we have the actual data. How many more cases of mild to moderate disease will there be? 
Again, this is under the assumption that people will be very poor in maintenance of their mask hygiene; I'm not sure this data will be worthwhile or measurable to actually study given common sense says don't wear dirty clothes. I may be conflating two arguments, so pardon me if I am (I just took two finals but enjoy your discourse), but it does not make sense to me to be advocating for no masks and the stance that "it's your own fault if you get sick", but using the opposite defense against masks. Again, sorry if that was someone else who was making that, I'm braindead as h*ck right now.</p>

        <p>Covid is objectively not dangerous for the vast majority of human beings. All the data we have clearly shows this. The fact that people like you keep pretending that this disease is more deadly than it actually is makes me want to scream. None of the measures we keep on doing are necessary because the virus simply isn't uniquely deadly. Covid's actaul threat to humans does not even come close merit the extreme lengths we have gone to in order to stop its spread. Yes, older, sick people are more vulnerable to covid, but older, sick people are more vulnerable to any disease. Old people dying of respiratory viruses is not something that just started happiness in 2020. And covid is far from a death sentence for even the most vulnerable. The debate about masks, social distancing, lockdowns, etc. are all pointless when you accept the truth that sars-cov-2 just is not that dangerous for almost everyone.</p>

        <p>When did I say it was deadly? Please stop assuming things about me. I said it was more infectious, which is proven true. </p>
<p>If you are down with killing a good number of people in order to avoid lockdown and social distancing, then that's a moral decision that can't really be debated. But you have to acknowledge the fact that due to the high rate of infection (r value was at nearly 4 iirc before lockdowns), almost everyone will get it, and consequently, a large number of people will die. It may not be a high percentage, but it will be a large number. Is that something you are willing to say we should do? Genuine question. I'm not offended by it or anything like that, and I can respect your opinion on that, but according to the same data you're referencing, many will die.</p>

        <p>Sure it does. The article goes through why masks are not very effective. It doesn't say they are useless, and it says they are probably better than nothing, it says that there is a lot we don't know and the data isn't very good, but the whole point of the articles is to point out the ineffectiveness of masks.
