        <p>Yes polio is the same as the coof.</p>
<p>You're barking up the wrong tree, bud. Most of us don't take issue with actual vaccines. What they're pushing on us is not a vaccine.</p>

<p>If we see it, that means it's not gone and the vaccine didn't work.  Right?</p>

        <p>You have the wrong idea about us... most people In this substance including myself believe in vaccines...</p>
<p>Just not this one or this whole situation...
Perhaps you should look at what we are actually saying and not what people tell you we are saying.</p>

        <p>The issues I have are:</p>
<p>Why force everyone to be vaccinated and not just the vulnerable?
The statistics and science have shown that over 99% of the population survive Covid-19 perfectly fine.
Why? Because their own immune systems naturally produce the antibodies requires to kill the virus.</p>
<p>So for the vast majority of the world a vaccine is unnecessary...
Why can't we just vaccinate the tiny vulnerable population and let everyone else carry on as normal? This way everyone will be producing the required antibodies for protection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the vaccines were safe and effective, then why do the vaccinated population receive no benefits from taking the injection?
They currently still have to wear masks and social distance etc etc they can do nothing differently from the unvaccinated... surely if they worked this would not be the case.</p>
<p>In light of all this - does the whole thing not seem incredibly suspicious?</p>
<p>Now the absolute worst part of the entire thing so far...</p>
<p>Vaccine Passports: - Why?!?!?! </p>
<p>As has already been established in my earlier point, there is no need for the majority of the population to get the vaccine... as we will produce antibodies naturally...
So why would they force us to be injected with a substance if we want to take part in normal society?</p>
<p>Is that not the epitome of Tyranny?
&rt; get injected with this substance or you cannot go here or do that?
&rt; today it is Covid-19 but tomorrow something different, whatever they want
&rt; we will have no freedoms, not even over our own bodies?</p>

        <p>Interesting you bring up the polio vaccine. Did you know that in the vaccine manufacturers haste to give it to the public, proper safety precautions weren’t taken and 40,000 children actually got polio from the vaccine? 200 children developed permanent paralysis and 10 died. The Cutter Incident. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/</p>
<p>I would say most of us here aren’t against vaccines, just questioning one that doesn’t have nearly enough data to be considered safe to inject into ourselves and our children. Every day new data is causing manufacturers to pull or suspend them, so how much confidence can we honestly be expected to have? Immediate side effects are causing these problems, what about the long term ones that have been yet to be discovered? I thought they’ve been insisting that they all had sufficient trials so how can these new issues keep popping up? Too many questions to feel comfortable with it. </p>
<p>There is no amount of money you can throw at these trials to make time go faster to produce enough data on long term side effects. IMO only the most vulnerable people should be taking them, when covid is truly a risk to their lives if they were to catch it.</p>

        <p>Yep vaccines are great. I'll even get the covid one when it's my turn - unless it contains thimerosal which I am allergic to-  but if you don't understand why people wouldn't it might do you well to listen to why instead of writing them off as idiots. I suspect the vast majority of this sub is for/pro normal immunizations.</p>
<p>Edit* even when I get vaccinated I won't use a vaccine passport or anything of the like.</p>
