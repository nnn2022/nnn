        <p>If you are a parent and have any resources at all, get your kids out of CA. Even if you have to send them to live with  relatives.  Teenagers and tweens usually don’t let their parents know they are struggling until it’s too late.  There is an utterly hopeless feeling in CA and I can’t even imaging being a kid that is old enough to understand the news.</p>

        <p>My life has been ruined by the mainstream medical system for not helping me due to a disease that has been hidden and not acknowledged and labeled of as a conspiracy (chronic lyme disease) . I am 18 and my whole life is ruined and I was bedridden for an entire year due to this disease and had to rely on alternative health and other measures, paying out of pocket through an organization called ILADS which exists just due to  the  rejection of the medical system (thanks to mainstream media engineered smear campaign against chronic lyme patients from the CDC and the dismantling of any scientific research, which is a lot , that supports the existence of chronic lyme ). On top of this the pandemic was occurring. I had friends dismissing my messages and straight up BLOCKING ME while I suffered  because I had a disease that is ridiculed or said not to exist and thus my symptoms weren't real according to my friends and they had left me because they didn't want to believe in so called "conspiracies" or did not want to be associated me. Yes, people will ditch you, condemn you, while you suffer because they trust their authority over their own fellow people. They are willing to walk over, ditch , or dismiss their own fellow people because a group of pedophilic rich men in suits told them to dismiss these people, even if it is their own family. Yes that is the sickness in which we live in. Simultanously these so called "people" who consider themselves the normal, rational citizens as defined by that same authority  to seek the evolutionary reward of the group think hold themselves on  a pedestal of moral superiority for caring about society by only caring about things that the government tells them is conventionally accepted to care about , and will not care about things that do not give them that self centered reward response derived from hiveminded social media recognition, yet they simialtneously consider themselves "independent thinkers" who are the ones ridiculing the hiveminded " conspiracy theorist", but in their case they get the upper hand of social recognition and social acceptance for such behaviors , while people like  us have to take the heat of being labeled as mentally ill, right winged, crazy , stupid. </p>
<p>I am now 18, ill, dependant, and have been ditched by everybody, still attempting to finish high school one year later . was once a hopeful, optimistic teenager who was highly intelligent (well above average intelligence, ) into many subjects and very well read for my age, with many dreams and ambitions and they have all gone to shit. The pandemic has made things worse. I am suicidal beyond despair and nobody would care if I died, but 4 to 5 years ago this would have never happened. There is such division occurring in these times between us and them it is insane. I am absolutely baffled by how people just accept the mainstream narrative nowadays, but I am even more baffled at how people are so caught up in the system that they will leave, dismiss and ridicule their fellow peers in worship of it. Yet if I had soemthing that was medically accepted, people would be around my arms, caring about me  , posting on social media and we would all see the beauty in humanity and taking care in another suffering. Goes to show how our morals are actually deeply shaped  by "them" and are not objectively a part of us , inherent in human nature if it can be so easily dismissed when a person's suffering (like mine) is considered unreal because THEY have defined what is real and what isn't. </p>
<p>Nobody loves me and I am so sick of this shit  society. I am ready to die. I do not want to exist for the future. I do not care, those idiots consented to this shit. We could have stood up and turned off the news and rejected the propaganda . But we didn't. How can we blame the elites when we asked (well they) asked for it themselves, chose to value their desire to fit in over their desire to stand up for the truth. Those who choose the side of evil ridiculing us in  favor of social media validation  for a temporary dopamine rush from egocentrically rooted false altruism  now will pay their karma. One day, for rejecting their fellow man in favor of validation by our powers.</p>

        <p>My father killed himself over this "conspiracy" that is chronic lyme, and i know several others whose life was negatively impacted.  Im sure thst there are hypochondriacs out there that have influenced the conspiracy notion, but I strongly believe that this disease is real.  This is an example where consensus in the science community is impeeding progress (if you have studied history you will know the many hurdles we have overcome, such as basic sterile operating procedures that were only revolutionized in the 1860s). The pomposity in modern medicine is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Hang in there and best of luck.</p>

        <p>The world needs him because the future isn’t predetermined - we collectively make it. The world needs people who think for themselves in the face of constant fearmongering, and who see why lockdowns are so wrong. We desperately need EVERYONE who meets those criteria. </p>
<p>If you’ve given up, that’s fine. It is also understandable; shit sucks and there’s good cause for pessimism. But if you’ve given up, you might as well be in favor of lockdowns; the consequences are the exact same (although, as shown by your comment here, they may actually be worse). </p>
<p>The likely consequence of your comment (and similar) is to encourage people to give up, accept the new post-covid hell - that’s what we do when we are convinced that there simply is no hope, no possibility of change. </p>
<p>If you really want to check out, fine. But don’t you dare encourage others to do so. No one needs that “help” from you.</p>

        <p>The reason why I'm angry right now is because I've been constantly being fed false hope and steady diet of platitudes from from everyone (in real life and online ) since this nightmare has started. And I get angry when people feed other people platitudes despite reality that is happening right now that there is no happy ending soon like in the movies because there won't be one.</p>

        <p>There’s a middle ground between “don’t worry, things will be fine” and “you might as well kill yourself.” Both of those extremes are wrong. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, I share your rage and despair. Sometimes you need to just vent, but beyond that - there’s a good way to channel those feelings, and a destructive way. Your comments are destructive, because you advocate giving up. </p>
<p>As for false hope... why the fuck are you hoping for anything? <strong>Fuck hope - you want something, you make it happen.</strong> We collectively get the world we deserve. If we sit back and hope for the best, we <em>deserve</em> the hell that is looming.</p>
<p>As bad and impossible as shit feels right now, history is full of people in far worse situations who <em>fought</em> for themselves and their futures. Many of them failed, but many succeeded. The ones who didn’t fight deserved their fates. </p>
<p>Hope isn’t relevant. You fight, or you give up. </p>
<p>If you choose to fight, then drop the handwringing about false hope. You’re right - saying “everything will work out” is wrong. But so is saying “the future is determined and there is nothing we can do.” </p>
<p>The truth is that the only way things will turn around is if we MAKE them. And if we don’t even try ... then, again, we deserve what we get.</p>

        <p>What the problem is that you assume everyone is able to fight, and not everyone has money or resources or social clout to fight. And unless you have resources like big lobbying groups, the urinalists and branch covidians will call you "nazi" and trump supporter immediately. Because theyre highly indoctrinated in panic and fear like a drug, and the only way for them to stop is that they get their fear taken away cold turkey.</p>

<p>Everyone has the ability to fight to some extent - even if that means just voicing your opinion to friends and family with the goal of changing minds. </p>

<p>Oh no!!! </p>
<p>How laughable that you view your entire future as being threatened, but someone calling you names is a deterrent to speaking out. </p>
<p>Again, context: we live in a rather luxurious time and place. For almost all of history, and even today in many places, fighting for one’s future came at the very real risk of being killed or worse. </p>
<p>Considering what is at stake, if the prospect of being insulted is sufficient to silence you ... you don’t deserve a better future. </p>
<p>No creature alive is entitled to a happy, comfortable life; if you want it you must work for it. We are fortunate in that today many of us are set up for reasonably good lives with relatively little effort, but that is a bonus, not guaranteed. When your future and quality of life is threatened, you fight or deserve to lose them. </p>
<p>&rt; the only way for them to stop is that they get their fear taken away cold turkey.</p>

<p>That’s actually why this is such an important strategy for fighting. People change their minds all the time, and you can’t tell how or when or why it will happen. </p>
<p>You don’t actually know that they are “terminally indoctrinated.” </p>
<p>You (assuming you’re not a mindreader) literally cannot know who is unable to change their mind on this; your condemnation of them as “terminally indoctrinated” is nothing but a weak excuse for you to wring your hands instead of fight. </p>
<p>If you’re not working to change their minds, you might as well think just like them - hell, you’d probably be happier that way, and the outcome will be the same.</p>

<p>The news media has been associating covid19 with Trump for the past 3 to 5 months while pushing Biden as a savior. Any wonder why the TDS has gone off the charts?</p>

<p>My mother - from whom I get my libertarian values - has TDS. It’s infuriating and depressing; from her, it feels like a betrayal. </p>
<p>But that’s no excuse to stop trying to wake her up. </p>
<p>If I stop trying, then I might as well agree with her - and I don’t. </p>
<p>If I stop trying, then I deserve the world she’s helping bring about - and I deserve better than that. </p>
<p>The single best way to destroy your opponent is to convince him that he has no chance; once he accepts that, you’ve won, and in such a demoralizing way that he will never again stand up to oppose you. </p>
<p>I will fight, even if it’s incredibly hard and I feel incredibly insignificant and it seems pointless, because I deserve better than the new normal.</p>

        <p>This nightmare is dragging on because more needs to change than just the lockdowns. The lockdowns are actually a symptom of how debased and degraded our society has become. None of this would be possible without that. If people weren't trying to invent their own sense of morality, if they believed in human dignity and loved one another, if they didn't mindlessly run from pleasure to pleasure seeking that next cheap dopamine hit, none of this would be happening.</p>
<p>The slide into dystopia has been happening since <em>long</em> before 2020. But how many of the people here knew or cared before the lockdowns shook their world? It's raised a lot of questions about our way of life. That's the good that's coming from this--and it's a greater good than the way things would be if everything had continued uninterrupted in 2020. But there are still more people that will only learn the hard way. We have to be patient for them. When enough people decide they've had enough and turn away from the wide and broad way to destruction, this nightmare will evaporate.</p>

<p>You’re not getting called selfish for expressing your anger. </p>
<p>You’re selfish for doing it at completely inappropriate times. When someone is struggling, it is not an invitation for you to come express your anger by essentially telling them to just give up. As I said, read the room. </p>
<p>And if you feel like your expressing your anger whenever and however you please is more important than anything or anyone else, then I trust that you’ll agree that I’m similarly entitled to express my disgust at your selfishness whenever and however I please. </p>
<p>If someone is staring down the barrel of a gun wondering what to do, only a monster tells him “pull the trigger.” That’s effectively what you did; my calling you out has nothing to do with your expression of anger, and everything to do with the fact that you’re acting like a selfish asshole.</p>

<p>Don't let them steal your life. That's what is getting me through this and inspires me. If I kill myself, then the worst people in the world (in my eyes) win and I fucking HATE them.</p>
<p>I know it's tough, we're all pissed. We're all livid, and just know that there are a few of us who aren't afraid of things if push really does come to shove. Your refusal to comply and be part of the sheep not only pisses them off, it reveals how true you are to yourself. For me, I get off on it, it makes me happy that other people get mad when I don't comply to government/mainstream culture bullshit. Don't let the weak ass doomers take you out over BS on social media, because if it was in person you'd have the upper hand. We need people like you and the doomers can fuck themselves sideways, I don't care if they live or die and I mean that with everything in me.

        <p>There will come a time where we will have to stand up and fight to the death against these psychopaths who have perpetuated this hoax. At least stick around for the fight for a new world. I feel the same as I am a woman almost thirty. I finally met the love of my life and changed my entire plan for the future last year and thought, "wow i cant wait to have a family"..... now? Fuck no. I have nothing to look forward to but the thought that I absolutely will not live in their technological slave system they are setting up and I will FIGHT for freedom from it and or die trying.</p>

<p>Every insult we use on them boomerangs on us (and vice-versa, I guess). Which is why my insults, though not widely used, make it clear what side they're on. So I use mask zombie and VirusCultist.</p>

        <p>Another factor is that young people lack the perspective of older people.  This looks like it will surely last until at least March.  That is 5% of this kid’s life.  And yesterday there was an article about a much younger kid who attempted suicide.  March will be about 10% of his life.</p>
