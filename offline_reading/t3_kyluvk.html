    <strong>Be Very Careful About Thinking That This all Goes Away with Biden</strong>
    <p><p>It's naive to think that none of this was about Trump. Yes it certainly was about Trump, but it wasn't <em>all</em> about Trump. </p>
<p>For the few people at the top who are fully cognizant of what they are doing, the goal is a broader grab for power, money, for putting the insolent plebs (as they see us) back in their place and for coming one step closer to a China style technocracy (if not outright putting China on track  to be the global superpower). Yes this was about getting rid of Trump because he was standing in the way of all of  this, but covid is useful for achieving these goals in so many other ways. </p>
<p>Many of the people in the media and in the ivory towers or medicine and epidemiology, many of them, especially those lower down in the pecking order really don't consciously understand what is happening. For them, they understand at least on an emotional level that this is all going to bestow upon them power (massive influence in national decision making), status (doctors but especially nurses are heroes), attention (gotta tune into the news for the daily covid update), money (financing for medicine and academic programs, clicks for media companies) and all while hurting the sort of people that they unconsciously resent (regular people, especially rural working class conservative people who live simple happy lives). So they aren't going to want this to end. </p>
<p>For the regular citizens who support what is going on, covid has afforded them the opportunity to virtue signal for no effort, to escape the drudgery of their work and their lives lives while getting paid to do so. Some of them really are genuinely afraid of the virus and now are so traumatized that they may never stop fearing covid, or contagion in general again (remember that they have been told that it will be years or never before we go back to normal, that covid will be with us forever etc.). Remember also that they are also psychologically locked into this, having invested so much energy and staked their status and reputations on being right. And for those miserable self-loathing people who support lockdowns (and the modern society creates many miserable self-loating people) this is the perfect opportunity to bring every body else down to their level. </p>
<p>On the other hand, what to they have to gain from bringing everything back to normal? A better economy which will likely not benefit the rich and powerful anyway (remember that this has been the biggest wealth transfer from rich to poor in all of history)? The extreme hatred of the people who come to realize that they have been tricked (which would be <strong>massive</strong> considering the amount of face the people who really bought into this will lose)?  A complete collapse in voter approval for the politicians who are threatening to take away the lockdowns that the people so love? Literally the only upside is the possible avoidance of complete economic collapse but I don't buy that most of the people in charge are actually smart enough or think long-term enough to see this. It is already likely enough that this will happen, so if this is something that they didn't want then we shouldn't have entered into lock-downs in the first place. No, I think that the unfortunate truth is that most politicians and leaders and far less competent than people might imagine and are so out of touch with reality that they really don't quite grasp that an economy is made out of people and so there are simply limits to how much you can mess with that. </p>
<p>So what about Cuomo, or the governor of Chicago tweeting to go back to normal? Well consider that a group of restaurant owners recently launched a lawsuit challenging Cuomo's shutdown of businesses. Consider that it is now the end of the fiscal year and the cost of lockdowns is now shown in black and white on the balance sheets. Consider that the ploy to foist mandatory vaccinations on the public is likely to fail, with massive numbers of health care workers refusing the jab and most regular people (even some of the mot hardcore doomers) being skeptical of the rushed vaccine (and the people in charge may now be privy to some of the stats on efficacy and side-effects that the general public does not yet know). Consider that a paper authored by Battacharya and Ioannidis has recently been published showing decisively that lockdowns are at best useless and at worst directly counterproductive for controlling the transmission of a virus. </p>
<p>But is that all enough for them to fully back-track? No, because I think that they are now politically locked in to lockdowns and short of being forced by the supreme court they are not going to be able to reverse course even if they now see the necessity of it. Biden too would take quite a hit to his reputation and piss off his donators after being so emphatic and explicit in his support for even stronger measures. At best, what they can do is put on an even bigger security theater so that they can try to claim that it is because of their action that covid goes away on its own. Again though, I just don't see this happening without a massive public backlash because of just how politically useful covid is to these people. </p>
<p>And if you don't like all of this discussion of the motivations of the people in charge doesn't convince you, consider also this: the severity of lockdowns, mask mandates and other restrictions only increased after the election. Why do this if the plan was only to jut get Trump out and then make Biden look like the savior anyway? Furthermore, most countries outside of the USA (China included) have doubled down on lockdowns even harder and are telling their citizens to expect restrictions to continue for years or more. While I can buy that these other countries had an interest in getting Trump out of office, once the vote was over however, these same countries are not in the same position of making Biden out to be a savior (simply because Biden is not in charge of these countries) so what motivation do you think that they have for doubling down? </p>
<p>Finally, I want to leave you with this. Be careful with believing that this all goes away with Biden because consider what effect that this will have. The people pulling the strings want you to believe this because they want you to feel like you have just been complicit in paying ransom in a hostage negotiation. They want you to feel like you are powerless and that you have implicitly struck a bargain to have your old life back for the cost of putting the establishment firmly in power. They want you to think that now this is all over and so you shouldn't feel compelled to do anything. They really don't want you to fight back, they really don't want you to do anything.</p></p>

        <p>It's not over at all, unfortunately.  The end goal of this is nothing less than the Great Reset.  I'm feeling tired today and that was a long post.  I don't want to oversimplify but will only go into it if ppl wanna discuss.  Full economic reset aimed at a more collectivist take on societies and civilization (communism) that on paper is supposedly going to help us but you know what your average citizen stands to become - a mere instrument of the elites.</p>

        <p>If you think that 2021 or Biden was going to magically make things better then you need to review.</p>
<p>Look, realistic you won’t see max vaccinations until September or so. That means you have to write off this year and say you lost two years of your life total. Biden is the establishment politician. Some people voted him just because he’s better than Trump; which is a terrible idea because when you make people choose between two bad choices it’s about which is the lesser of two evils and not about change.</p>
<p>This crushed small business and forced entire industries into a chokehold. Restaurants, hotels, even clothing stores are affected because they sell unnecessary and non essential things. People aren’t traveling or going out to eat as much and Walmart sells cheap sweat pants for that virus related weight gain. No one takes cruises, or anything tourism related because that is an extra non essential business. </p>
<p>Only the big corporations remain because they have the money to bail themselves out. Force people to work for them because their business failed more because of the virus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile elite get their food from private farms that use minimum pesticides and usually no hormones or additives. It’s more money but elite people can pay small private farms well enough. Go even further and elite tell their kids the truth about the world and teach them about how it works, nutrition, etc.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be surprised it they will push mass vaccinations only due to the school year starting in August/September and they really want to get everyone back in school for that 2021/2022 school year so that they can then stop WFH and get everyone back on their cars and on trains and buses back to jobs they could easily have done from home. It's all about endless consumption!</p>
