        <p>apparently somewhere in my local are has "an outbreak" and theyll told everyone to go get 2 tests weekly, literally no one ive seen or spoken to knows anyone who has had it so where these sudden cases are i do not know and imagine its simply to increase vax rates.</p>

        <p>I have so many friends who don't understand why they are being subjected to all of these restrictions and why they are feeling coerced into vaccinating and masking up. I'm so sad that all of this animosity exists because of a gap in understanding of a really  pretty complex thing. Can't expect everyone to understand it, but if you can read to the end, I hope you learn something new. </p>
<p>The study of Epidemiology exists because humans have gotten wise to the fact that some problems don't just happen to individuals. And they can't be fixed by fixing individuals. Viruses have been around longer than us. They've developed ways to hunt for the weakest ones among us who can get sick from it and not die, particularly by using strong healthy ones to carry them to all reaches of the Earth. </p>
<p>The vulnerable people who end up with symptoms, but survive become virus factories for the next generation of viruses to be spread. But these people are not so mobile.</p>
<p>The ones with no symptoms may not make tons of new viruses because of their immune systems - but are a free train ride to anywhere/anybody else because the person carrying them don't know/care that they're sick and aren't immobilized. The viruses count on people like this in order tosurvive and to find lush new pastures all over the world. </p>
<p>The ones who end up dying are a losing gamble for the virus. They die with the host too. The dead hosts are just collateral damage for virus that doesn't care because it's siblings live on in the dead person's family who are still moving around and will give them the next opportunity to leap into someone or something else.</p>
<p>A virus's purpose in "life" is not to make people sick. It's just to survive. A person getting sick is just a side effect of how the virus uses our body. It needs to make babies. In order to make babies, viruses need humans with weak or naive immune systems that won't be ready or able to kill them. In order to find humans with weak immune systems, viruses need to be able to constantly find new people whose bodies have never seen this virus before (plot twist, viruses are sloppy copiers. They make many copies of their genetic material but don't have the proofreaders that we do because mistakes actually help them. One "mistake" and voila - a virus that our body has never seen before (a new strain of my variant) - and so sad, too bad if it makes you more sick or can now spread to kids). Viruses are not large, and do not have legs to run around on their own and find hosts. But hosts do, and that is how it keeps finding new people. Oldest survival strategy in the book (think tapeworms, pinworms, HFM, malaria, common cold, TB, plague, etc etc etc) that's why scientists can claim to know how to stop it. This is history repeating itself.</p>
<p>Parasites and viruses alike (they use the same trick) love the guy who just doesn't know he has it and goes about his daily business. The host has no reason to attack the parasite with a cure or to isolate. </p>
<p>Sure, you may get it and never see it again, but so many people are thinking the same so that the virus has had the chance to spread to other parts of the world, upgrade to versions that CAN make previously healthy people sick (even kids and young adults), and they're making their way back to your neighborhood (these are the different strains everyone keeps talking about). </p>
<p>The people who are vaccinated - let's just consider them dead ends for the virus - the same strategy is still working for the virus, it will just take more time for the virus to find a vulnerable person. But it needs to find a vulnerable person before the host's body gets smarts and attacks to the point where there aren't enough virus particles to spread (that's when you can still test positive, but don't have enough to spare for the purpose of spreading) Once enough people are vaccinated the likelihood of 2 vulnerable (unvaccinated) people meeting become so small that the chances are the body's immune system will control it before it has a chance to jump ship becomes greater (herd immunity). But it only works if enough people get vaccinated. </p>
<p>If you were able to read this far down the page, I hope you learned something new.</p>

        <p>That is true for most diseases, it is a contributing factor but not THE driver. Usually asymptomatic cases are quite rare in illnesses so despite their danger they don’t make too much of a difference. COVID-19 has 1 in 3 be asymptomatic, that is huge and in this case IS a big driver. It has never been in the past but it has been now.</p>

        <p>Yeah, no. That's not what vaccines do generally. That's in the unlikely event that a vaccinated person does get it - their immune system is already primed to fight it off so they'll have a mild, short case. The vast majority of vaccinated people simply won't get it at all.</p>

        <p>...that's how it's supposed to go.</p>
<p>Yet the manufacturers themselves have said that taking the shot will still make you infectious, you will still catch it, but it will make the symptoms milder for you.</p>
<p>In which case, calling them a "vaccine" is a blatant fucking lie - it's preemptive treatment at best.</p>

        <p>What? No, it reduces the odds of getting it. Also, if you don't suffer from bad symptoms, that's OK, but the vaccins are to reduce spreading to people who might actually suffer from bad symptoms. Why is that so bad?</p>
<p>Litterally vaccinating people could prevent the "New Normal" everyone here is so afraid of—lockdowns, facemasks, curfews.</p>
