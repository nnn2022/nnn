    <p><p>Reason: " ... reports that patients are already asking doctors to provide them with formal proof they have had the jab."</p>

        <p>Who needs formal proof of having the vaccine?</p>
<p>People who got the vaccine and heard on the news they will MAYBE be able to only do certain things in the future if they have a proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>How were vaccinations proved before covid, for example to fly to south africa where you need a yellow fever vaccination first?</p>
<p>With the classic yellow vaccine booklet that has been around for 50+ years.
You can buy these anywhere.</p>
<p>Conclusion and solution: Media should shut up about the passports, politicians should drop the idea completely, and docturs should order bulks of yellow vaccine booklets for the proud covid vaxxers who want to brag on instagram.</p>
<p>Tadaaaaaa! Not even wasting millions of tax payer money with this strategy! Thank me later</p>
