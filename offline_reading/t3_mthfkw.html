    <strong>Where to find "Death from all Causes" data for 2021? All of a sudden they seem harder to come by.</strong>
    <p><p>It was SO easy to find up to date data on TOTAL deaths occurring in the USA last year. Suddenly I am having a hard time being able to compare Jan-April 2020 to Jan-April 2021.</p>
<p>From the articles I am discovering across the Internet is seems that there is a massive surge in not only "unexplained" deaths but also deaths from all causes and there seems to be suppression and statistical manipulation as well as search engine de-prioritization on this topic suddenly.</p>
<p>Even the CDC is reporting a massive spike in deaths between the one month time period listed below but just as I would expect there isn't a single mention linking any of this to vaccines.</p>
<p>During January 26, 2020–February 27, 2021, an estimated 545,600–660,200 more persons than expected died in the United States from all causes.<br>
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7015a4.htm </p>
<p>Something massive is going on here with suppression of information and statistical manipulation, just like with the COVID cases/deaths themselves. Proving deaths are skyrocketing could be the key to stopping the extermination effort currently going on against humanity.</p>
