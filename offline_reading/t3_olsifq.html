    <strong>I just commented this on another post, and my ego convinced me this was worth repeating:</strong>
    <p><p>So, let's "follow the science". </p>
<p>Drug trials are experiments.</p>
<p>Experiments follow the scientific method. </p>
<p>The scientific method requires a control group for an experiment to be legitimate and ethical. </p>
<p>Having not taken the vaxx, I am that control group (oh the irony)</p>
<p>If we all took it, it would just flat out nullify the outcome of the experiment. </p>
<p>Anti (covid-)vaxxers are literally the only ones following actual science.</p></p>

        <p>Speaking of control groups‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Did you know that a control group has NEVER been used in ANY experiment EVER, that supposedly proves that a virus is not only contagious, but that it causes a certain disease? Well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs true.</p>
<p>So much for the scientific method eh?</p>

        <p>Someone has scraped up records on the 400 or so adults in the US who have escaped vaccines altogether. Ran some stats on unvaxxed vs. vaxxed. Surprise, surprise; unvaxxed healthier overall. And I mean a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> healthier. They call the study <a href="https://www.thecontrolgroup.org/gallery">THE CONTROL GROUP</a>.  I especially like their Pilot Survey Data Graphs. Recommended.</p>

        <p>Wow! That is a lot healthier. All vaccines have definitely been a sham. They control the data, therefore the narrative. </p>
<p>Of course, most if the herd will scoff at this because it‚Äôs not from a ‚Äúcredible‚Äù source like the CDC /s ü§£ü§°üåé</p>
<p>Thanks for the link. That‚Äôs good stuff.</p>

        <p>Yes. Vaccine makers have been <strong><em>very</em></strong> careful never to do comparisons between vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts. For very good reason. I suppose it was inevitable that eventually someone would put the two together though, and let the cat outta the bag. </p>
<p>Another data set inclining the same direction comes from all the families that have a vaccine-injured child, then the parents wise up and avoid making the same mistake again on subsequent children. They get to compare similar genetics, similar environment, but vax vs. no-vax. Same results: no-vax is much better. See movies VAXXED and VAXXED II.</p>
<p>And then there's Dr. Paul Thomas, the Oregon pediatrician who ran a "vaccine-friendly practice". He informed parents of vaccine risks vs. benefits, then let the parents decide. Naturally, when informed, many parents opt out. His state medical board got nervous, felt he was putting patients at risk, so the board asked him for comparative stats. He had 10 years of records on thousands of children. So he did it; he put the stats together, submitted the findings to the board, <a href="https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijerph/ijerph-17-08674/article_deploy/ijerph-17-08674-v3.pdf">and published</a> (page 13 is my favorite). Five days later, the board jerked his license. The facts (un-vaxxed much healthier) really made them mad. They probably wished they had never asked for them in the first place! AFIK, Dr. Paul's license has been reinstated, but he's is still working to sort out the knock-on malpractice insurance and hospital permission SNAFUs.</p>

        <p>Interesting point, is it possible more people have thought they had gotten the vaxx but actually got a placebo? And they are tracked by the name and batch#? </p>
<p>I agree we are in the control group by our own choice, but it would be hilarious to me if millions of other got a placebo intentionally?</p>
