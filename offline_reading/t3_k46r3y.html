    <strong>Out of curiosity, are there any medical professionals here?</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen quite a few MDs buck the system on Twitter and whatnot but are there any medical professionals on this sub specifically?</p></p>

        <p>I worked as a Medical laboratory technologist for 2 years after I got my college degree in MLT.</p>
<p>I resigned. It was a shitty job. 
Now I grow certified organic vegetables and pastured poultry. </p>
<p>Yes the way PCR is used today, is a fraud.</p>

        <p>I’m not a medical professional but it wouldn’t matter if I said I was as there’s really no way to prove it. I will say that I have several immediate family members who are nurses and an uncle who is a surgeon. My cousin’s grandparents on their dad’s side are a pediatrician and a nurse. None of them are even slightly worried about COVID and haven’t been at all during this “pandemic”. People don’t have the luxury to know people in the medical field like I do and are forced to “trust” the people they see on the television, which is unfortunate. Personally, if I have to choose between trusting people I know personally and love and some random out of touch experts on TV, I’m picking family every time. If they were scared, I would be worried, but they aren’t.</p>

        <p>That's become a relative term "professional". Do you really trust them at this point?</p>

        <p>I believe the term now is "expert". That is, someone who googled the subject for 20 minutes.</p>

        <p>Not a doctor but my neighbor is and other one is a nurse, neither are concerned about the virus and are also equally concerned for their career to speak out about it. They said a lot of their co-workers feel the same. They are being silenced and its so depressing.</p>

        <p>So... other than BOBO...since “my neighbor is a nurse” and “my cousin’s grandpa is a pediatrician” are not currently certified medical degrees, it looks like the answer to the OP’s question so far is no</p>
