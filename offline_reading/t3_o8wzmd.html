    <strong>"Long COVID" has long been the cornerstone of many pro-lockdown arguments made by people not in the scientific community. Come find out what actual doctors think about it.</strong>
    <p><p>How many arguments have you had that go like this? </p>
<p>"So if the elderly and vulnerable have now been given a vaccine that, by your own admission, severely decreases severe disease, hospitalizations &amp; deaths, then why do you continue to advocate for restrictions?"</p>
<p>"Young people &amp; children haven't had a chance to get it yet. Have you even heard of Long COVID? My friend was an avid jogger and now he can't even get up off his couch."</p>
<p>As a member of the medical community myself, I've long been skeptical of this highly politicized and poorly defined 'illness'. An illness that has no objective findings or markers, a wide spectrum of non-specific complaints, that predominantly affects young otherwise healthy people with underlying psychiatric comorbidities like depression &amp; anxiety, that runs in the same groups as those who collect BS diagnoses like Pokemon cards ('chronic lyme disease', 'fibromyalgia', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome') and whose existence is wholly speculative in nature (and certainly not verified by scientific literature).</p>
<p>While my medical colleagues have disappointed me on many fronts throughout this pandemic (eg by arguing from a place of politics rather than science), I think even this bogus illness was too much for them to get behind.</p>
<p>Have a read of some of the things they're saying.
https://archive.is/GIjxf
https://archive.is/3ERMv</p>
<p>Here's some excerpts for you to enjoy:</p>
<p>"I'm seeing them in psych. Apparently anxiety responsive only to xanax is a common symptom."</p>
<p>"This is gonna be the new chronic Lyme. Have seen a fair bit so far, only some of them believable."</p>
<p>"This feels like the new chronic lyme."</p>
<p>"Is there a randomized control trials that control for having friends, jobs, hobbies, romantic partners, and interests out of work that are meaningful?"</p>
<p>"CFS by yet another name."</p>
<p>"In the ER at least, I've yet to have someone who presents with 'long covid' to have any sort of objective finding... and about half don't even have proof they have covid."</p>
<p>"Is there any consideration of the possible influence of social media (TikTok / Instagram) on these younger patients? Chronic illness influencers, especially ones constantly posting about POTS, have peaked (I hope) during the pandemic... i.e. - Impressionable young people frequently see young women with a vague illness getting famous for acting sick and start thinking they might have the same symptoms?"</p>
<p>Ladies &amp; gents THIS is the reason the lockdowners want to keep you under house arrest.</p></p>

        <p>A whole lot of people think "long covid" is 100% psychological. There's zero evidence of infection or illness in any of the people. There's no inflammation found in them. And some have been treated with placebos and got better within 2 days.</p>

        <p>Well idk every single reference to it ever. They almost all state that symptoms continue without evidence of infection. There are a good 100 videos on rumble of doctors and virologists talking about treating it with placebos or ivermectin or zpak and people getting better. I know nobody wants to trust Rumble videos but that's kinds where every doctor and scientist who isn't named Fauci is banished to. They even talked about the treatment and recovery and people having no sign of infection but symptoms on the JRE emergency episode. We have a serious information cover up going on and it doesn't make sense.</p>

        <p>I have had long covid for about 15 years. I caught it from my kids when they were born. Always tired. Stressed. House is never clean. No time to do anything. Lights always on. 3 dogs. 3..  and a cat.. that's why I decided to take a vacation down at My local hospital. 3 meals a day. Sponge baths. I don't even have to breath on my own if I don't want to. Hit a button and someone is there to wait on me. Better cable than my house. Everything is clean. They said I had 4 negative test in a row. But I told them I think I caught a new super contiguous variant. Gexa plus or something.</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve observed this in people too. I think having a change of smell, taste, and any additional generalised symptom e.g ‘not got my precovid energy back yet’ is enough to be given a long covid label, when in reality there’s nothing severely wrong. </p>
<p>A handful of people who had it bad might be severely affected for many months, but the number is far less than the total number of ‘long covid’ cases. Again - statistical manipulation to justify the coup.</p>

        <p>I don't know what the fuck long covid is but it sounds stupid.</p>
<p>Now contrary to that, I did have covid April last year and I did end up in hospital. Ever since then I have had joint pain in my knees, hips, and lower back. I have never had joint pain before and I don't know what to do about it.</p>
<p>I do believe it is within the realm of possibility that this virus that was created by the CCP with components of HIV and other nasty bits could hang around in the body causing suffering for God knows how long. Maybe their plan was to disable everybody.</p>

        <p>I was the sickest I had ever been in my life. I was lucky that the virus wasn't interested all that much in my lungs. The virus did however have a fascination with my blood and my kidneys. It also attacked my testosterone production.  I would lay on the couch at night with my 104.5 degree fever, afraid to go to sleep because I might not wake up, watching reruns of <em>friends</em> crying my eyes out because "Ross and Rachel were on a break". I would then wake up with literal hypothermia with a temperature of 93 degrees. </p>
<p>My day went on to be filled with random shivering that was so intense I would fall down, aches and pains that didn't make sense, no taste and no ability to smell, I had no appetite and didn't eat for a almost 2 weeks. My urine was coming out thick and brown and my blood was forming clots and was a strange consistency.</p>
<p>When I was in hospital the doctors gave me a choice. They said I could stay in hospital and I would surely die alone as family wasn't allowed to visit or I could go home and die in my bed with my family next to me. I told them I would prefer dying at home and they patched me up the best they could by giving me some medicine for my blood and for my kidneys and they sent me on my way. Once I arrived home I made sure to consume as much liquid as possible even if I knew I was going to vomit. I knew I needed to keep my blood thin and my kidneys functional. </p>
<p>Then day by day I survived and I manage a little better and after a month or so I was "recovered". I had lost a tremendous amount of strength and a lot of muscle mass but we figured those were things I could get back. I did have these strange new aches pains that plagued me but I figured that was due to being so sick and would resolve eventually. </p>
<p>It is over a year later and my knees are in constant pain, my left knee in particular. My hips and my lower back are also always sore but the severity comes and goes. It almost feels like they are very tired, like all of my joints are just exhausted and they want to go to sleep. I know that doesn't make sense but it is how it feels. The pain can be managed by ibuprofen and acetaminophen but I don't want to have to rely on that because what is that going to do to me long term? </p>
<p>My wife couldn't distinguish between pregnancy symptoms and her covid symptoms. My son's who were 1 and 2 years old had covid and had the sniffles but the most traumatic thing that happened to them was Daddy trying to get their boogies from their nose. It was the biggest non-event for them.</p>

        <p>Nah I'm gonna disagree with this. Long covid is Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome. Just type that phrase into Google and you'll see they are both the same. </p>
<p>I had it right after having the flu. The legit flu btw, not a cold. Massively fatigued. Spent most of my of my life in bed asleep for a whole month.</p>
<p>After that I was able to go back to work but used modaphinil to give me at least some energy. It took a few months before I felt relatively normal again. </p>
<p>There are some doctors who don't believe in CFS or PVFS. Because there is no proof. But look at all the vaxxed folk who go to hospital with all sorts of pains, they have a scan and it's clear so they get sent him and continue to suffer.</p>
<p>So just because it can't be detected <em>does not been it doesn't exist.</em>. </p>
<p>I really don't like the dismissive tone in your post when I know how PVFS feels.</p>
<p>I'm totally anti-covid vax but that doesn't mean I think everything about covid is a lie.</p>
<p>Edit : your post is just further proof that too many in the medical field ain't actually very bright.</p>
