    <strong>Post-Mandatory Vaccination Plans</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since the beginning of all of this I've always said I'll refuse the vaccine no matter what.  Why do a need a vaccine for a virus that is statistically proven not to kill me? </p>
<p>Though as we all know, covid vaccines will likely be mandatory to do basic things such as go to work or school, go to a restaurant or store, or do most things in daily life.  I have decided that this is the hill I will die on, I will not get a covid vaccine under any circumstance, the government and media are pushing them way too much, and the fact that neither the vaccine producers or government have any liability for side effects makes me think that these vaccines are not going to end well.  </p>
<p>I've been mentally preparing myself for this since March.  I realize that my decision to refuse the vaccine under any circumstance could likely ruin any chance I have at living a "normal" life.  The founders of my great nation died so that I wouldn't have my life controlled by some all powerful government, and I feel that if I comply with tyrannical laws such as mandatory vaccination that their sacrifices would be for nothing.   </p>
<p>What I am wondering is, what are your plans for either getting around vaccine mandates, or plans to survive on your own.  I personally have considered just living on the road, if you've ever read the book, "Into the Wild," something similar to what Chris McCandless did maybe.  I've always wanted to do something like that anyway, and this may finally be my chance to do it.  All I know is I will not take the vaccine, no matter what the consequences of that decision may be.</p></p>

        <p>Go rural. Real rural. One thing I have noticed living where I do is, mountain folk don't change quickly. In keeping with the idea that there will be others,  form a community that bypasses all that and just continues to live life. Itll be a slower life, without glorious riches, my wi fi will suck, but life will largely continue unchanged. Or go full beast mode and burn the MF down.  Haven't decided yet.</p>

<p>This.  The further away you are from any cities or dense population centers, the less of an effect the scamdemic has had on day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Just don't vote for the same urban socialist bullshit that destroyed your city when you get there.</p>

        <p>I haven't decided whether I'll get the vaccine yet. I'm in Canada, where it was vaguely said that it was not mandatory, but may be required for certain things, like movie theatres. If it's just things like that, I won't do them anymore. I guess if they ban me from shopping malls and grocery stores, I'll have to get curbside pickup like they make the maskless people do. I could probably survive getting curbside pickup of all my necessities, since I work from home. I'll do outdoor exercise instead of ever going back to a gym, if it ever comes to that. I don't think I'll need to go back to a school.</p>

        <p>I don't believe you'll have to go out of the US. Actually, you might need even need to head to traditionally red states. I'm in a blue state and most of the time I see 50% maskless and theres no conflict. 100% when its the little mom&amp;pop stores. Trick is just poking around before buying the house. Go to those little stores and big stores to compare. Talk to the neighbors if you must (as much as I loathe that).</p>

        <p>I absolutely refuse to take any vaccine as well, and if I have to go lone wolf, so be it. Obviously, though, we'll be lucky to make it past our 40's or 50's without <em>some</em> level of community. Unfortunately, I've never been good at socializing or networking, so I don't know where to find others, but I guess we better start organizing online before they take <em>that</em> from us, too. I know the government spooks are tracking every word we type, but oh well. Just don't be too specific with the information. Perhaps we could do things like sign every post we make with our general location (see example below), and others in that location can then message us to exchange contact details and meet up in person.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm working on building my survival skills, etc. Everyone should learn how to get water, food, shelter, and fire without access to the digital and electrical grid. We may well have to return to a primitive, hunter-gatherer existence for a while. Start binge-watching those bushcraft videos while you can, and practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p>&rt;I've been mentally preparing myself for this since March.  I realize  that my decision to refuse the vaccine under any circumstance could  likely ruin any chance I have at living a "normal" life.</p>
<p>A "chance" at the "<strong>new</strong> normal" life. Nothing to miss out on there. </p>
<p>Honestly I'm trying to prepare to die soon, I don't think it's possible to survive long-term without getting injected if they really want that to happen, and I think they really could do this.</p>
<p>But not gonna lie - it's hard, because the survival instinct forces you to cling to life even if it's utter shit.</p>

<p>In the same boat.</p>
<p>I'm not at all suicidal. But don't think I have the guts for it. And that isn't good. Much better to know I have the courage in case a time comes when there's a choice: degrading servitude or death.</p>
<p>...And so occasionally, I will actually visualize suicide to try to move past the fear. Feels like going into meditation, particularly after letting the visualization drop away. Doing it before bed gives me a great night's sleep. I figure the experience of dying will depend <em>a lot</em> on the state of mind at the time, so no better time than now to uncover the inherent powers I was born with which will be of great help when the inevitable happens..</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.</p>
<p>But until then, definitely have a cause worth fighting for :)</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s going to be successfully made mandatory.  The pharmaceutical companies have been using bandwagon propaganda for a long time and it’s especially easy when everyone gets their information from social media.  Bandwagon propaganda is a form of propaganda in which the speaker convinces you that everyone feels this way and it makes you feel alone and hopeless.  The reality is that many, many people are against this vaccination.  And many who aren’t against it, are on the fence.  </p>
<p>Add to that the fact that there are several war crimes indictments against the vaccine manufacturers, WHO, media companies, and multiple governors for genocide regarding the covid pandemic.  </p>
