    <strong>Let's talk COVID questionnaires, temperature checks, etc.</strong>
    <p><p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/ifns3h/stop_yelling_about_your_constitutional_rights/">this</a> thread about a restaurant doing temperature checks on its customers. I also visited the page of the restaurant who posted this, and a few weeks back, they made a post about their guidelines that also said they will be doing visual assessments of customers and looking for symptoms (coughing, sniffles, etc.). Naturally, all the doomer types are praising the business (and others like this) for being "safe" and protecting everyone. </p>
<p>We all agree a business can generally do what it wants, but where is the line here? I'm sorry but restaurant hosts are NOT medical professionals. It doesn't take a degree to read a digital thermometer. But what makes the owner of that business think his/her staff is qualified to do basically do health assessments of people and visually inspect them? That feels invasive to have my health screened by a non-professional and I WOULD walk out of a restaurant that was demanding to know where I've traveled to and reviewing my symptoms. The staff also doesn't likely know the difference between COVID and things like allergies and sinus issues that aren't contagious but may still cause coughing or a headache or fatigue. I don't think you owe that to someone just to go out to eat. </p>
<p>I also just feel weird in general having to share my health information on command with anyone who asks and has deemed themselves qualified to catch COVID cases. Just because you Googled symptoms and watched a few videos of Fauci or Dr. Redfield doesn't mean you fully understand the disease. Even top doctors still don't know everything, but the random skating mom in my club believes she's qualified to demand we have our temperatures taken before going on the ice? An ice rink manager thinks they have the right to ask me to report my health to them and where I've traveled to? And then THEY can use the answer to determine if I'm a risk to others or if a headache should keep me from entering the rink? And I have to report to them immediately if I say yes to any of the CVOVID questions? That's not even beginning to mention that some people can and will lie to go skating or play hockey, and you'll likely never catch that. </p>
<p>The only place I can understand doing stuff like this is at a healthcare facility. Doctor's office, dentist's office, the actual hospital, I will happily let them take my temperature and ask the questions needed because they treat actual sick people. But I feel incredibly uncomfortable with some of these other businesses who have now decided to play doctor when they have no basis for doing so. And there's no way they will keep everything private with all the pressure for everyone to participate in contact tracing. If I have symptoms, I will take care of myself and stay home. I don't think a hostess or a minimum wage teenage employee needs to be in charge of my health. It just feels so controlling.</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m with you. I did mention that in my post but the people who use these questionnaires have to be kidding themselves if they ever thought that everyone would always be 100% honest on the forms. :)</p>

        <p>I find these things invasive regardless of who does them. I've always disliked the medical industry since early childhood, I feel as if many practices (especially when forced or coerced, which is far too common) border on molestation, and I've never really understood how people are so comfortable allowing a stranger or aquaintance do things they wouldn't even let their own spouse do. I understand why this isn't an option for many people, but I've always had both a passion for biology and a pragmatic interest in medicine largely because I don't want some other asshole examining me or knowing my medical history. The only thing I really worry about is lacking a second pair of hands; I can't very well treat my own illnesses/injuries if I'm paralyzed or unconscious, and I'm not sure my husband is really up for anything more serious than bringing me a band-aid. Aside from that, I sure as shit ain't going anywhere that checks my temperature or asks for contact information. The only thing I'll maybe tolerate is a cursory temperature check at my husband's workplace so long as they won't be doing any further tests.</p>

        <p>I'd not do business with people like that if I can avoid.</p>
<p>I have two issues with the temp checks: the temp guns have terrible accuracy, and places are instructed to flag you at like 99.4F. I'm sorry but I easily hit that by walking fast and can hit 100F with no illness if I'm hot, digesting a large meal, or even hung over.</p>
<p>I typically either walk past them if they aren't paying attention, or I don't wipe any sweat off my brow if I'm hot because the water drops their reading to like 94F (funny they don't care that's hypothermia range lol)</p>
<p>Listen, if I have a real fever and I somehow didn't know, I'll gladly go home, I should be resting anyway and not exposing people to any other bug going around... BUT, I'm not going to be treated like a leper for 99ish temp and have 200 people I walked by be traced and harassed and scared.</p>

        <p>I went to the dentist the other day and failed the temperature check. I had just gotten done working out and parked kind of far from the dental office. I live in AZ and this particular day was 115. It was so awkward going to the temp fail area, waiting for them to retest me while they decontaminated the area I sat in. I ended up passing after a couple mins and being fine, but still.</p>

<p>I have been saying this all along.  </p>
<p>This is the new "being searched shouldn't bother you if you have nothing to hide".</p>
<p>Not the point.  Not even close to the point, not in the same hemisphere, galaxy, <em>universe</em> as the point.  </p>
<p>I don't begrudge your right to make a living, but I know that you don't get paid enough to have either the medical smarts nor the discretion to call judgment on anyone's health in a public place.</p>
<p>You can't make a citizen's arrest.  Why should you be able to make a citizen's diagnosis?</p>

        <p>I haven't actually seen temp checks in public places here in NY yet.  I had to get my temp taken in Costco before I took my mask off to have my passport picture taken but that's it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if a store or restaurant started probing any further than temperature I'd just walk out.  It's none of their damn business.  And with fall allergies right around the corner, you can't just brand everybody with a cough with a scarlet letter (though I'm sure they will anyway...)</p>

        <p>My ice rink has a questionnaire that has to be done before every session (hockey, figure skating) you attend. A couple of restaurants in my area are taking customersâ€™ temperatures, and Iâ€™ve read about a couple who make customers answer screening questions when they come and/or when making a reservation. (Although thankfully that doesnâ€™t seem to be a huge trend for restaurants. The ones Iâ€™ve seen that ask customers about symptoms arenâ€™t near where I live, thank God.) Iâ€™ve also been asked screening questions at the eye doctor and dentist.</p>
<p>Maybe itâ€™s one of those things that varies by area. Iâ€™ve seen local hair salons that have questionnaires, although mine just has temperature checks.</p>
