    <strong>"You Look Like A Fool"</strong>
    <p><p>So, today was a grocery day for me and my family. Myself, my 18 month old son, and my younger 10 year old brother, took a trip to Walmart and Aldi, for all the essentials we may need in case we get a legit bad snow storm this weekend.</p>
<p>We live in Michigan, so usually in preparation for bad weather I get all the shopping done so I don't have to venture out during the worst of the weather.</p>
<p>Anyway, so two things:</p>
<p>1.) During our trip to Walmart, I witnessed my first double maskers. A middle-aged father, his younger teen daughter, and preteen daughter. I felt really bad for the kids, it just broke my heart to see them being forced into that behavior. The dad was probably pretty alarmed when he passed by me, maskless of course, but he didn't say a word.</p>
<p>No employees ever do when I go there either, and they could stop me right at the door if they wanted to but they don't ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Which I am thankful for.</p>
<p>2.) I had my first run in with someone who opposed my lack of wearing a mask! It sucks that it was at Aldi, of all places, because I love Aldi so much. </p>
<p>I had just walked into the store and an older white woman sees me and my family, becomes slack jawed, and says, "You need to wear a mask"</p>
<p>Me: "No, we don't"</p>
<p>Old Karen: "Yes, you do"</p>
<p>Me: "No we don't"</p>
<p>Old Karen: "Yes, you do for the sake of other people"</p>
<p>Me: "I'm not worried about other people"</p>
<p>Old Karen: "I'm going to go tell a manager"</p>
<p>Me: "Go ahead, you look like a fool"</p>
<p>She scoffed and scuttled away to the front of the store. I kept my composure and kept shopping, knowing that if I had been approached by an employee that I would calmly leave the store and not cause a fuss. It's certainly not worth it, especially with my family with me. </p>
<p>But, kind of to my surprise, no employee came to hunt us down. We enjoyed our shopping trip without any other mishaps. Got to the check out and had pleasant small talk with the cashier, who was very polite and kind to us. </p>
<p>I was happily satisfied with the outcome, although I am well aware that it could happen anytime and anywhere again and turn out much worse. I kind of had a feeling that Aldi employees wouldn't do anything though, because Aldi's policies are so accommodating for their customers that it's almost not fair. When I worked for Aldi, I liked my job, but also had a hard time because I got myself into trouble several times when faced with rude customers. </p>
<p>Anywho, I just felt like sharing my experience with you guys. Not really anything exciting but I love this sub and love sharing with ya'll. Thanks for reading!</p></p>
