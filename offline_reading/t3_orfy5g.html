    <strong>How do you know what to believe?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not anti-vax but being a hypochondriac since childhood  I am vaccine hesitant. I don't trust the vaccine, afraid I'll be that one rare chance of death of death or suffer long term effects. But I'm equally afraid of the virus and death from it. I'm absolutely terrified and feel like I'm standing in the street in oncoming traffic trying to figure out which direction to go with this decision. But every direction leading to the chance of death.</p>
<p>I watched the clip-art video about how the vaccination can be dangerous. I've read the studies, seen the articles and groups about coverups. I want to believe covid is just the flu, or cold and PCR tests are BS.</p>
<p>But then I've also heard of personal deaths. Saw my sister, brother-in-law and talked to a friend who all had it (not serious thank god). I've poured over the covidpositive subreddit and read people's sickday journals. I looked through the soulslosttocovid tag on Twitter and read all the very real deaths and disabled survivals.</p>
<p>...Just how do you know what to believe? If it's just the flu or cold, why so many that got double lung transplants? I remember getting the flu in 2017-2018 the deadliest year in modern day they said. Despite all the deaths you didn't see constant double lung transplants or intubation. Mostly just deaths. If it's fearmongering where are these fatalities coming from?</p>
<p>If it's not a hoax, on the same side where are the vaccine deaths from? How does one make this decision of life and death from both sides forced on them?</p></p>

        <p>In times such as these, I think it’s completely rational to believe your own eyes and ears and daily experiences, talk to lots of people in YOUR real life (not randos on FB and Twitter), get an idea of what covid looks like on the ground in YOUR community, among people YOUR age/health status. Take into account people’s natural biases  (and your own) when assessing the quality of their information. Use your natural powers of deduction to figure it out and trust your own judgement. At the end of the day, YOU are the only one responsible for your health, so you should put a lot of effort into decisions about it and accept whatever consequences come. </p>
<p>I think local information gathering is under-rated, and one of the main goals of lockdowns is to prevent it from happening. It prevents local information from flowing. It gives corporate news and social media the opportunity to craft the narrative in a bubble, without people saying, “hey, that is not AT ALL what is happening in my community, what’s the disconnect? Maybe I should investigate...” So, get out there in your own community and start asking and observing! Maybe you’ll come to the conclusion that the vaccine is the better route, maybe not, but at least it will be your own judgement based on the most relevant data to you. It’s not all the data available, and you shouldn’t ignore what is reported in the wider world, but they are all just data points that help you paint the clearest picture possible.</p>

        <p>Great advice, I will attempt to do so, thank you.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though I didn't leave the house for a year since March 2020, I DID have to go to the hospital twice, (hypochondriac). When asked which hospital I wanted to go to, I told the paramedic 'whichever one was less busy as I didn't want to catch Covid'.</p>
<p>... First paramedic trip 1, told me "Covid is the biggest hoax on the planet right now." THIS was a paramedic and I couldn't believe my ears. I even thought about reporting him when I got home since he's dealing with lives... I didn't, but I thought about it.</p>
<p>Second hospital trip a few months later, another parmedic didn't say hoax but he told me Covid was nothing to worry about. These were the paramedics. HOWEVER the hospital nurses on the other hand, one told me she had it and her mother almost died and was recovering from it. Others said they had it and got over it. The rest said vaccinated as this trip was the start of the vaccination coming out.</p>
<p>So for medical specialists, it was .. mixed with the few I spoke to? Both trips to the hospital I wore a mask (just the paper kind) and somehow didn't catch anything though..</p>
<p>Of course, this was all BEFORE Delta.</p>
<p>But yeah, thanks for the answer.</p>

        <p>If you survived to this point as a hypochondriac, a vaccine is probably not for you. The nocebo effect is real, look it up. Hypochondriacs are more likely to develop all kinds of psychosomatic issues after vaccination even if the vaccine is harmless.</p>
<p>Keep protecting yourself from infection as best as you can manage. The pandemic will be over soon.</p>

        <p>This guy posts survivors and deaths. This thread has people who ended up with transplanted double lungs. Hence my confusion on it just being fearmongering. Surely they wouldn't transplant for nothing?</p>

        <p>If I ever feel sick I take extra vitamins and use direct current. Direct current is highly effective at killing germs both viral and bacterial, apply it to your wrists and it will target the lungs via your blood. I was able to manage a serious infection for years thanks to regular use of direct current, many others have stories like mine and the device is easy to create. </p>
<p>I don't have any fear of infections because I have the acute treatment available. If I was still concerned I would find a source for Ivermectin.</p>

        <p>The double lung transplants scream "BULLSHIT" to me. So, there just happened to be someone that died that was a donor with perfect match lungs &amp; staff just coincidentally standing by.... Yeah... OK, delivered by Santa Clause?</p>
<p>I believe &amp; some medical professionals have said (some admitting) that the intubations were not needed &amp; are generally killing people. The stories of people "begging for vaccines" just before they are intubated, or saying "Covid isn't real" just before intubated... Ummm.. If they are conscious &amp; talking they don't need to be intubated!!!!! That's the last option of 'well, they're as close to dead as they get without a burial' option. </p>
<p>Let's just keep in mind- Medical "error" is the THIRD LEADING cause of death in U$A. (By "error", let's be honest- malpractice)</p>

        <p>But their families talk about it and such. For the double lung transplants in the Twitter thread I mean. Are you saying the families were paid, or that they got a transplant for nothing? I've heard the thoughts about intubation.  Probably a way to shut people up, not sure. Don't want to make a judgement on it myself yet.</p>
