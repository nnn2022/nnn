    <strong>A one party system in the US</strong>
    <p><p>Anybody else find it a bit disconcerting that there is now a one party system in the US? The Democrats now have house majority. The justice system. They have sided with the most powerful entities in the world including big tech, big pharma and the media giants. </p>
<p>The left has total control including a little over half of the minds of the US people. The veil can only get larger as they continue to sensor anything and everything against their narrative. The Republican Party is done for. </p>
<p>CNN is calling for FOX to be taken off the air. There is now really no opposition at all. </p>
<p>The main stream narrative that Democracy is being threatened is indeed true. But not from the right. Was Trump actually trying to keep all of this from happening? </p>
<p>There is 75 million people ready to stand up. I hope we don’t see violence. Hopefully a new party stands up.</p>
<p>This sub is on its way out btw. Along with any other free thinking sub.</p></p>

        <p>We are well on our way. Leftists control The White House, The House, and the Senate (from Jan 20). They control Mainstream Media and Big Tech who are more than happy to oppress discussion and cancel people. They label their opponents as fascists, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists, and supremacists, setting the stage to legitimatize a political and social media purge.  The population is scared and demoralized from COVID dystopia. This is ideal territory to establish a one-party state.</p>
<p>I do wonder though, with Trump out of the picture, if the citizenry will be more focused on the malfeasance of the left instead of the right. Trump is like a reverse cult icon that united a lot of Democrats. Hopefully, they splinter at some point, and then we'll see if they go after their own. Usually, that is what happens.</p>

        <p>I don't believe they have total control of the people as by and large people overwhelmingly voted for Trump, he won by a landslide. Then we had the vote manipulation that gave the appearance of a win to SleepJoe.</p>

        <p>I don't know if Trump is 100% a plant, if he <em>was</em> a plant and kinda changed his mind, or if he's just some doofus that happened to be rich and somehow won the election so they said "meh he's a doofus so whatever let's let it run its course" and then it scared them that he, while dim, said things that made a part of the population feel empowered against the narrative... Even though he never actually had the power to stop them, only the people do.. ya know ?</p>
<p>So I don't know. Maybe from day one he was planted to <em>look</em> like he wanted to stop it, maybe he truly does but can't...or somewhere between..There's a reason they've been so outspoken and actually hateful toward him from day one though (and I say this as someone that has spent four years rolling my eyes and cringing about him).</p>
<p>But yeah, one party system is now a go.. they've not only got the government on board but the actual powers that be, the people who could absolutely overtake them by sheer force with numbers, are now also on board for some propaganda filled, brainwashed fueled reason.. they want to watch the world burn or they think if they publicly agree it won't harm them or something. I dunno.</p>
<p>But yeah, the country is fucked.. probably the world.. I'm pretty much checking out aside from a watchful eye to prepare for protecting myself and my family as need be.</p>

        <p>I would normally say that we should keep politics off this sub, but they are playing a role into the “New Normal”.  </p>
<p>What the OP said is completely true in respect to the lockdown supporters being Democrat and that we should be concerned that they have complete control.</p>
<p>Our only saving grace is the SCOTUS which I would think would lean towards ruling against the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>They are playing a role, that is undeniable, but we can't make covid skepticism a partisan issue. There are people on the left who are naturally skeptical of the vaccine but don't want to be labeled as right wing and anti science. The focus should be on staying on brand unless the brand becomes co-opted.</p>

        <p>In 2016 the republicans had the house, senate, and whitehouse. They were just as in bed with corporations (of their own choosing) as Dems are now. There's no difference between the two parties in this country. At their heart they are fundamentally the same. They may have a few different wedge issues (i.e. gun control, abortion, etc) but at the end of the day they ALL serve corporate masters and don't give a fuck about the people of this country. They care about big business and nothing else. If that wasn't the case they'd amend the constitution to ban corporate personhood. I do believe the republican party is done in it's current incarnation. The fiscal irresponsibility of the last 4 years is the antithesis of standard GOP policy. It was reckless and anything but fiscally conservative. The appointment of judges and pushes on immigration reform are consistent with normal GOP policy. Maintain their stance on partisan issues but continue to not be as fiscally conservative as the GOP of the past. So I think that's more along the lines of what a new party will represent since trump's base is so dedicated and happy with his performance.</p>

        <p>It's not exclusively democratic media that dishonest. It's the media as a whole. That's the product of 5 companies owning just about all media in this country. Of course trump was never at war. Him going to war against anything would mean he cared about anything else besides himself. He is no different than any other person who ran for office. It was strictly for self interests and what he could get out of it. That's the same as Cruz, Schumer, Graham, Pelosi or whoever else. There needs to be term limits and a return to serving the greater good. People literally are born and raised to be politicians and that's wrong. Pelosi is a prime example of that. She essentially finished school and immediately went into politics. That's why almost all these people are garbage. Granted I do believe some people get it into with the best of intentions but it's only a matter of time before the corruption sets in and self dealing and serving takes over.</p>

        <p>Since Dems and Repubs in the system are birds of the same feather a civil war is not possible in this country. The ruling class cares about business and the economy period. They will do nothing to kill the long-term aspects of that. As part of the power structure the military and police will protect and serve those needs. Amongst citizens there could be a civil war. Members of the military or police forces could defect but before a huge nationwide uprising with lasting implications could happen it would be out down in the name of the corporate overlords that really run this country. I agree the system needs to go just don't see how that happens without a divorce of big business and politics.</p>

        <p>But the BLM terrorists rioting for 9 months in 2020, terrorizing small businesses, patrons, law enforcement, and federal officers to force political change weren’t trying to “destroy our democracy”, or you mean our constitutional republic? You know we’re not a true democracy, right? By BLM riot/protest logic, the rally at the Capitol was mostly peaceful. It wasn’t even fiery. 97% of the rally wasn’t a riot, they were hijacked.</p>
