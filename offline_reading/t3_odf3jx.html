    <strong>Local businesses near me are taking down mask signs</strong>
    <p><p>Well that's it really. I just wanted to mention it as a bit of good news. For example the pizza place I go to doesn't even care about the masks even though they have a sign up saying you have too. but the last time I was there, yesterday, they had all their mask signs removed as well. It was really nice to see it down. It doesn't bother me to not follow the signs when I know damn well half the staff doesn't wear one either and because I don't much care if people ostracize me for it. But I know plenty of people see those signs are worry about public backlash if they don't follow the signs and begrudgingly put one on. </p>
<p>For example I've been used as well an example for people to take their mask off. There was this one warry family that I heard talking to decide against the mask when they saw me without it on one time. </p>
<p>So it's nice to see these signs come down which will in turn lead to more people taking their masks off and living life like a normal person again.</p></p>
