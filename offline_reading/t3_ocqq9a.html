You cannot have a spontaneous abortion because of the vaccine after 20 weeks if you took the vaccine in their third trimester. Also a Woman that is in her third trimester cannot have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks if she is STILL PREGNANT in her third trimester. So the statistics is actually 104\/127 about 82&#37;.</a></p>

        <p>Neither. Its people who unquestioningly accept inaccurate claims because those claims happen to fit their ideology.  This particular claim has been thoroughly analyzed and debunked on this sub alone at least three times this week.</p>

        <p>The study size is 3958.  The paper is only preliminary because the study is ongoing and something like 3000 women who got vaccinated in the first and second trimesters are still pregnant.  Just read the paper instead of relying solely on single chart from the paper.</p>

        <p>The statistic is in the footnote of the linked document. It says 94 of 104 pregnancies spontaneously aborted before the 13th week. Presumably the other 723 pregnant women took the vaccine after their 13th week and had much better outcomes.</p>
<p>But still, 92% fatal for first trimester pregnancies seems like a pretty serious adverse reaction. One not likely confused with anxiety or hysteria.</p>

        <p>It is obvious you didn’t read the paper because you think the study is over and the relevant study size was 800 pregnancies.  Read the paper and then you’ll see why the claim being made is incorrect.</p>

        <p>This is <em>one</em> possible interpretation of a poorly written paper by people who aren't savvy in statistics. Further review, communication with the authors, and a look at their raw data would be required. I have many questions..</p>
<p>Even <em>if</em> we assume this interpretation, its representativeness is highly questionable. Almost all of the test subjects were nurses. There might be a hidden factor here we are unaware of among workers in this highly unique profession. From a pool of some 30K people available to the authors, their final numbers were based on 800 subjects--why such a small sample size?, what criteria were used? If the criteria were chosen poorly, the sample of 800 might be extremely biased (in <em>either</em> way: it could be that <em>no</em> spontaneous abortions occured whatsoever in the remaining 29K subjects...). Etc., etc.</p>
<p>Investigation is certainly warranted, jumping to conclusions isn't (yet).</p>

        <p>Here's someone who is very well versed in statistics and academic works' read. </p>
<p>Completed pregnancy means you were pregnant and now you aren't maybe you had a miscarriage, maybe you had a stillbirth maybe you had a baby. Of the 800-something who were in that specific database, 112 or whatever had the pregnancy end in miscarriage - consistent with the natural rate. There were no selection criteria other than not lost to follow up in that survey.</p>

        <p>The crux for me is with the '127' number and when exactly during the pregnancy the vaccine was taken. Does '700 were vaccinated in the third trimester' imply that 127 were vaccinated during the first or second trimester? Is the the 112 deaths even in that pool? Basically what I'd love to see is a venn diagram of all of these things. Ideally from the authors themselves, clarifying what they had in mind. Because as it's written right now (even considering the tabular data) it's ambigious.</p>
<p>They also mention that some 2700 pregnangies of women who got vaccinated during the 1st and 2nd trimester aren't completed yet. Would really love to see those results, too. (Would've preferred if they waited with their report until they had all results at hand..)</p>

        <p>The key term is spontaneous abortion, which by definition occur in the first 20 weeks while the third trimester starts at 29 weeks through 40 weeks. Further, second trimester is 13 through 28 weeks, after which 90% can survive outside the womb. However, again... 8 weeks of second trimester aren't included. Therefore, the overall risk to infants throughout the entire pregnancy is like FAR higher than 82%</p>

        <p>Their are 3958 participants, not 800.  The study is still ongoing and this paper is just preliminary.  3131 women were still pregnant when this preliminary paper was released.  Its quite obvious to me you didn’t understand the paper on multiple levels.  Read it several times, slowly, and hopefully it will make sense.</p>

        <p>The paper was not poorly written - it was published in the most prestigious medical journal in the country.  That should clue you in that it is much more likely that the paper was written fine but poorly read.</p>

        <p>You're using the wrong numbers here. The study consisted of ~3.9k pregnant people, 800 of which had a completed pregnancy, meaning one ending in birth or spontaneous abortion. Since the study is less than 9 months old most pregnancies haven't been completed yet. In other words, ~3.1k people are still pregnant and haven't had a spontaneous abortion, so the real rate is 100/~3000 (subtracting people who were vaxxed in the 3rd trimester), which is about the baseline rate.</p>
<p>Please read through the study if you're going to post stuff like this, it's embarrassing</p>

        <p>This table is being interpreted incorrectly. Though, it is a tough paper to decipher (it took me a while myself lol), so I can see how you could get confused. I will try to explain Table 4 below. It is important to notice where the † is. In table 4, notice how the † is on the entire right column NOT the denominator in the first row of data. The 827 is referring to the first data set (pregnancy loss), the 700 is referring to the second data set (neonatal problems). These are different individuals which is why you cannot subtract 700 from 827 (see below) to get 127.<br>
First, I think it's important to understand table 3 which shows the total of individuals who were pregnant and received the vaccine is 3958. Of those 3958, individuals were vaccinated in the first, second and third trimester (1132, 1714, 1019, respectively (table 3).<br>
For the first part, pregnancy loss:<br>
These 827 are defined as individuals who 1. actually completed the pregnancy SO FAR (they ended the study before the rest of the 1000+ individuals completed it) and 2. were vaccinated in the first and beginning part of the second trimester. How do I know this? They gave the dates! 12/2020 and 02/2021 dates imply that vaccines were administered in the first couple months of pregnancy. You can do the math if you want lol. They also talk about it in the discussion section: "Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort (p. 2279)." This 827 number is going to eventually grow because more and more women will give birth/spontaneous abortion/still birth. 104 women had spontaneous abortions out of 827, but there are still 1000+ pregnancies that still need to be completed, so this ratio will grow as they insinuated in the that quote above. Hence, why the name of the paper has "preliminary findings" in the title lol.<br>
Now, the 700 number is referring to the next set of numbers-- neonatal problems. These 700 individual are individuals that 1. had a complete pregnancy (similar to the 827 above) and 2. were vaccinated in the third trimester. They do this to show that later term vaccination does not correlate with poor neonate outcomes. 700 single babies + 12 sets of twins = 724 total babies. They wanted to show that 700 individuals were vaccinated in the third trimester to show that vaccination closer to birth didn't correspond with neonatal problems.<br>
Hope this helped! :)</p>

        <p>Answers like this show you didn’t know what you were reading. </p>
<p>Do you know the source of the data? 
What is the total number of participants?
Do you think this paper is final, or just preliminary? <br>
How many were still pregnant at time of releasing this paper?<br>
Is any follow up planned?  If so, at what intervals?<br>
Do you think it is possible that eventually all pregnancies in the study will complete?  If so, I wonder how the data in chart 4 will change?</p>
<p>The smug stupidity of people on this site is appalling.  People will just read a single chart from a scientific paper and then delude themselves into thinking they know what the (unread) paper is about and anoint themselves experts and are even willing to argue with others in their smug stupidity.  </p>
