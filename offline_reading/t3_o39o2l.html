    <strong>For the greater good</strong>
    <p><p>My brother thinks anything that has to do with a conspiracy is ludicrous he wont even aknowledge it or discuss it. I am the exact opposite and see a conspiracy in everything. He is fully vaxxed. I am absolutely never getting it. The other day he asked me if i got vaxxed yet and i told him obviously not and it wasnt ever going to happen. He responds with this gem..."Bro its not like i got it cause im worried about getting CORONA, i did it for the greater good"
I about shit my pants. These people are so brainwashed its disgusting, that is the response you would hear from someone in a cult.</p></p>

        <p>Your brother is a lost individual amongst many, and is following media, government, doctors advice blindly like a sheep, when most of these people have been bought off by the elites, or big pharmaceutical manufacturers. He will not see any reason now and think for himself. He, just like most of the sheep worry about the unvaccinated, when they really shouldn't if they have so much faith in the vaccine, because surely it should be protecting them? Just like the people who experience symptoms no matter how severe and then insist that they are happy to have taken the vaccine.</p>
<p>Support him however you can, but hope that he wakes up sometime.</p>
