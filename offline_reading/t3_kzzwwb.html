    <strong>Most people blame Covid problems on their government, and blame lockdown problems on Covid.</strong>
    <p><p>Think about how people discuss these issues. It's very common to see "Look how many cases we have, our governor isn't doing enough to stop the spread". And then when businesses close, or someone get depressed and commits suicide, or food costs more, you hear, "This pandemic sucks, I can't wait for it to be over". </p>
<p>This is weird because people essentially accept mandates and lockdowns as an unchangeable fact of life. But they think the very concept of people being infected by a contagious virus is an issue exacerbated by their government/anyone that isn't them.</p>
<p>Some might refer to this as "being brainwashed".</p></p>

        <p>Cognitive dissonance. They know government is their problem but theyre also conditioned to believe government is the only solution.</p>

        <p>The logic should be exactly the opposite. Covid spread and deaths are the fault of the virus, whereas lockdown problems are the fault of governments. The two phenomena are only very loosely related to each other.</p>
<p>The idea that governments somehow control the pandemic, and especially with the ineffective tools of blanket measures, is preposterous.</p>

        <p>Definitely brainwashing. The UK and the US did this perfectly: making everyone believe they wanted to let herd immunity solve the problem, getting the opposition to support lockdowns, then implementing  on and off lockdowns, scaring people into thinking that cases are on the rise. People panic, accuse the government of not doing enough, the opposition supports even stricter lockdowns, government turns the screw a little more, but never too much, you have to leave them wanting more.</p>
<p>It's the same with the vaccines. Announce very prominently how many doses you ordered, compare that to other countries. People think "why is that country getting more than us?", they start to think there's a high demand, panic and start saying "the government isn't doing enough". Opposition agrees and governments can start pushing more vaccine propaganda and fallacies.</p>
<p>So governments are blamed for not being effective enough at "controlling" the situation but not for creating the problem itself. The source of the problem is a mix between the invisible, undefeatable enemy virus, the Chinese and people like us who don't or don't want to comply with mandates</p>
