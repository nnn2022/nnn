    <strong>This is absolutely insane, but bear with me for a second.</strong>
    <p><p>It is now clear that they're going to shove the vaccine down everyone's throat, no matter the cost. </p>
<p>It is also clear that the vast majority who needed protection from this virus have been already vaccinated long ago (let's assume here vaccines work as advertised, and their own IFR is the one to trust - so, less than the flu for anyone younger than 60 with no conditions).</p>
<p>So, WHY are they pushing the vaccine this aggressively? </p>
<p>Based on their own pre-march 2021 rethoric, "we need to protect the vulnerable". Well, mission accomplished? "we need to protect the hospital system". Ok, that's safe too, no way 30 year olds and 40 year olds are going to clog the hospital system due to this, given YOUR OWN IFR and hospitalization rates for those age groups.</p>
<p>So why push the vaccines so aggressively on people inside that age range?</p>
<p>Their own rethoric is internally inconsistent. So, time to take out the tinfoil hat.</p>
<p>Say this is a plan to roll out ID2020, universal global ID, the mark of the beast, call it what you like. One would expect then the "vaccine" to be something like saline solution - completely harmless. You give it to millions of people, zero side effects, everyone runs to the vaccine centers to get one because they've been promised freedom after that (no matter how many times the government already lied regarding that, lol) and the job is done.</p>
<p>All world population is now completely dependent on having the mark of the beast in order to be able to do anything, and you're in control of the activation status of that mark. You don't like someone? Mark deactivated, you're now infected/unvaccinated/whatever and your bank account is frozen, you can't travel, you can't buy groceries.</p>
<p>So <em>why make it actually harmful</em>? Because that shit is <em>clearly</em> harmful, at least statistically, and they're doing their best to just cover it up as much as they can. And it's not 80 years old with 3 conditions dying from it - it's <em>young people</em>. If we had something resembling independent press in the west it would be on all front pages - like covid deaths have been for the last 16 months or so. </p>
<p>So, <em>something</em> is in it. What is it?</p>
<p>Say this is a depopulation/sterilization scheme, and this whole covid sharade has been just a incredibly expensive ad campaign for their vaccine or whatever it is. They can't realize that this is basically selecting for people that have a brain, don't yield or are uneffected by peer pressure and don't trust the government.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> would they ever want to keep these guys around and get rid of the obedient, dumb slaves?</p>
<p>Given that society has been going down the idiocracy path for a while now, is this an actual attempt to save the world as we know it? By getting rid of all the sheep? I mean, any kind of complex society that has sheep as the majority of the population is bound to end up the way we are now. Might this be their attempt at "fixing" humanity, by culling all the nonthinking useless individuals that the natural selection we stifled for hundreds of years now allowed into the gene pool?</p>
<p>This would sort of explain why they're focusing on africa and south america so heavily - where <em>way worse</em> and <em>curable</em> disease are around. Why worry about covid when freaking <em>malaria</em> is rampant? They've removed 3 heads of state and replaced them with puppets just to push the lockdown narrative... in places like Tanzania. People <em>starve</em> there, and you're locking them up for a 99.x% survivable disease. </p>
<p>I hope this doesn't make any sense, and I'm dead wrong. For as long as I can, I will refuse their injection. Godspeed.</p></p>

        <p>That’s what I wonder too. Like is the end game to get rid of all the lower iq people on earth? If so then maybe I’m for it LOL so cynical I know. But seriously why would they want to get rid of the obedient slaves. And if they did announce their plan, whenever everyone dies from it, then the smart people that refused to get it...wouldn’t they be pissed??</p>
