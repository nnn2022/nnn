        <p>This is fucking maddening.</p>
<p>The shutdowns were to preserve hospital capacity.  We know now that was never a real concern.</p>

        <p>“It appears people are running out of money. Lines at the drive-thru have become shorter. Last month, we thought we would equal last year’s sales this month, but that will not happen, and sales are coming down. The food service industry will take a big hit unless things open up very soon, and I am not optimistic.”</p>
<p>That's the point, the government doesn't want to open up, they want the economy to collapse so they can bring in the The Great Reset and New World Order.</p>

        <p>You are no more than cattle to those who rule the world. They want you to stay inside forever.  You're easier to watch and control that way.  If you are afraid of each other, then you can't organize and realize that you deserve rights, and that the world is not completley scary.  They don't want you to show your face- it might help them think you are human.</p>

        <p>When the first "shutdown" happened, I heard a lot about "this business is my livelihood!" blah blah blah... </p>
<p>If it was actually their livelihood, they wouldn't have listened to the bullshit mandates and they would have stayed open. </p>
<p>When the lockdowns happened in China, I hit the books hard and by the time the lockdowns arrived in the US I was already very confident this whole thing was bogus. </p>
<p>I stayed up all night researching for like 2 straight weeks, digging through biochemistry textbooks and research papers. By that point it was early April, and Dr. Andrew Kaufman did that first presentation.</p>
<p>If my livelihood was at stake, you better believe I would have been hitting the books harder than I ever have in my life.</p>
<p>I will NOT be supporting any businesses that took the money and I hope more will do the same. http://ppprecipients.com/</p>
<p>edit: On top of this, I deal almost exlusively in cash. Any business that has refused my cash(THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC &amp; PRIVATE https://i.imgur.com/ozbrGQu.jpg) during this bullshit will never see me again either.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link.  So is your reasoning that companies who took the loans are culpable for supporting the shutdown, when they could have stayed open instead?</p>

        <p>You think they are going to share that money with their employees, who are the ones actually suffering through all of this? No they won't. That's my reasoning.</p>
<p>edit: Also, none of these business owners who received the loans were at the anti-lockdown protests going on since March. We were wondering where the hell they were, now we know.... they took the money and feel obligated to shut up and follow orders. - Maybe they were <strong>told</strong> what they can/can't do? I don't know for sure... time will tell though.</p>

        <p>Without the loan, I wouldn't have had enough money to pay them all to work during that whole time and they'd have wound up on the unemployment rolls. Idk if you noticed but foot traffic was a little slow this year. There weren't enough customers to keep them busy so I paid them to do training.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it's in your best interest as an employer to keep good employees around because finding new people to replace them fucking sucks.</p>

<p>Also, you can fuck right off with this bullshit. I have a business that gives over a dozen people the opportunity to make a living for themselves, and I've been doing everything in my power to make sure that opportunity still exists for them throughout this bullshit and after it's over. What the fuck have you done that's so fucking great for society?</p>
