        <p>Dear brigading Doomers:</p>
<p>I know you’re all warm hearted heroes who want to save every hamburger eating grandma and transfer that death to all of the non-mask wearing 20-somethings who just don’t want cystic acne flare ups and massive government overreach, but have you considered that grandma and grandpa that you’re trying to save might be voting for Trump?  Yes, they may also not believe in UBI, think that you should move out of your mom’s basement and perhaps get some sunshine. </p>
<p>So you might want to think about some of this when you reach for that mask. Wink wink.</p>

        <p>&rt; warm hearted heroes who want to save every hamburger eating grandma</p>
<p>Do you not actually have any older relatives whom you'd rather have <em>not</em> die? Also, is there something wrong with a grandmother eating something as mundane a <em>hamburger?</em> I always struggle to wrap my head around this weird judgmentalism and lack of empathy.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is simply not a big deal. It's a mild annoyance. It demonstrably reduces disease transmission, and some countries (e.g. Japan) already had it as an ordinary part of their culture for a person to wear a mask if they're sick, just to make it less likely for disease to spread. It's no wonder the pandemic was contained so much better over there than here; the attitude in the US and elsewhere that wearing a mask is somehow a cruelly dehumanizing, intolerable indignity is nothing short of senseless and bizarre.</p>
<p>Lastly, I don't know how many levels of projection you're on, but liberals are generally fans of having people not die/suffer in general, not just the people they like. Hell, Missouri recently passed a Medicaid expansion measure due to the more densely populated blue areas voting in favor of it, even though it'd be the rural red areas (which voted against it) that'd actually benefit from it.</p>

<p>Maybe for you. In which case you should certainly feel free to wear a mask if you'd like to do so.  But that's not the case for everyone.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ikynfs/coronavirus_mega_thread/g3r02gc/">The benefits of universal mask mandates are also dubious at best, while their costs are substantial.</a> Look at Sweden's experience with the virus. They never locked down, never forced "non-essential" businesses to close (pubs, restaurants, salons, and shops remained open), never closed schools for children under the age of 16, and never imposed any kind of mask mandate (and their voluntary usage of masks has been <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f8G5W1t.png">essentially non-existent</a>). And their per capita deaths are lower than in the US, and their per capita deaths among younger people are dramatically lower (only 1.25% of Swedish "COVID-19 deaths" were individuals under the age of 50 versus around 5% in the US -- 89% of Swedish deaths were aged 70 or older).

        <p>When those sources are meta-studies that look at lots of other studies, it's more than "a couple sources."</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>"Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>World Health Organization 2019 Publication: <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf">"Non-pharmaceutical public health measures for mitigating the risk and impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza"</a></p>
<p>"<strong>OVERALL RESULT OF EVIDENCE ON FACE MASKS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ten RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and there was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</li>
</ol>
<p>From that same publication:</p>
<p>"<strong>Reusable cloth face masks are not recommended.</strong> Medical face masks are generally not reusable, and an adequate supply would be essential if the use of face masks was recommended."</p>
<p>&rt;Saying that Sweden didn’t use masks and has fewer cases than the US and that this is good evidence that masks aren’t effective is clearly not valid logic. That conclusion does not follow logically. </p>
<p>Well, it's certainly at least <em>some</em> evidence that mask mandates / widespread mask usage provide, at best, only modest benefits.  If mask mandates were providing a truly substantial benefit, the evidence in their favor by now should be obvious and overwhelming. It's neither. </p>
<p>&rt;Also u/capt_roger_murdock doesn’t really address or refute the whole “masks not being a big deal” thing w any concrete claims or evidence even though they quote it for some reason.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, the guy I was responding to didn't support <em>his</em> claim that they're <em>not</em> a big deal. And more fundamentally, value is subjective. <em>He</em> might not find wearing a mask / being forced by the government to cover his face in public to be a "big deal." But I do. To me, it's a <em>huge</em> deal actually. Masks / mask mandates are obviously also a big deal to a lot of people on this sub and in the wider world as evidenced by all the controversy surrounding the issue. And again, "a universally-masked world is a more dehumanized, paranoid, and fearful one in which normal (and essential to human wellness) human socialization is inhibited."

        <p>&rt; you should certainly feel free to wear a mask if you'd like to do so. But that's not the case for everyone.</p>
<p>No one worth any salt has been claiming that anyone with a health condition that makes it <em>legitimately</em> problematic to wear a mask needs to wear one, but anyone with that much respiratory difficulty even without COVID-19 would be so at risk of dying to it that they'd be exhausting every available resource to avoid being in public altogether. Businesses <em>do</em> (as they are required by law) make reasonable accommodations for such people (e.g. doing their shopping for them), which means any person who can't wear a mask could still comply with mask requirements.</p>
<p>&rt; The benefits of universal mask mandates are also dubious at best, while their costs are substantial. </p>
<p>I've actually gone through the effort of following your links, even though the links are to your own posts which also contain links to even more of your own posts. I can understand, though, since typing up the same points over and over again would get annoying. I'll try to go point-by-point as best I can. And I really hope this conversation can be productive enough to make this effort worth it; I've been burned countless times by getting casual dismissals or simple insurmountable stubbornness even after I've spent a lot of time crafting detailed a response.</p>
<p>&rt; WHO 2019 publication</p>
<p>Was focused on the flu, not coronavirus, and still recommended facemasks despite weak evidence. I'm admittedly curious why their evidence for face mask usage was so weak, but I'm not going to go through each and every study they looked at.</p>
<p>&rt; it's not clear that slowing the spread is a particularly desirable goal.</p>
<p>There have been multiple instances, including here in the US, of hospitals hitting capacity when the virus spreads rapidly enough. When a hospital can't see new patients, then not only would anyone with COVID-19 who'd need hospital support to survive die (if they can't get to another hospital that <em>hasn't</em> yet hit capacity), but anyone who needed hospital support for any <em>other</em> reason would also die, or at least see complications.</p>
<p>&rt; Even if mask mandates were shown to be preventing some non-trivial number of deaths from COVID-19, it's possible that such a benefit is more than offset by masks' negative impacts on other aspects of human health.</p>
<p>The claim that the impact of face masks could be worse than a pandemic that's already killed nearly 200,000 people in the US alone (not to mention those who survived but were dealt other health complications, e.g. increased stroke risk, lung tissue scarring, and more) is extremely dubious at best. Now, facemasks wouldn't have saved all those people, as they merely help prevent the spread of disease instead of halting it altogether, but even if it only prevented 10% of those deaths, that'd still be nearly 20,000 people, and that's only of those who have died <em>so far</em>. There are still a lot of people who could die to this disease, and it's worth doing what we can to protect them.</p>
<p>&rt; that still wouldn't mean that mask mandates are worth their tremendous costs in terms of liberty and quality of life. Forcing someone to cover their face in public is, in my view, a significant infringement of their liberty.</p>
<p>That's, self-admittedly, an opinion. Opinions don't get to overrule other people's health. My cousin lives with and cares for her mother, and while her mother stays home all the time, my cousin still has necessary errands to run. If she gets sick because some guy just didn't want to wear a mask nearby, then she'd bring it home to her mother, and her mother is very much at risk of dying to it. It's much more reasonable and humane to simply make people wear masks in public than it'd be to put the onus on my cousin have to keep distant from her own mother in her own home.</p>
<p>&rt; AIER link</p>
<p>It's long, so I'll just discuss its five main points, even though they're about lockdowns and not facemasks per se. The first point is "does the lockdown even save lives" which is hard to get absolute data on until after the pandemic is over, but if a disease spreads between people, then isolating people prevents/slows the spread of the disease. There's literally no other way it could work. The second point is "how many lives are worth suffering the lockdown for" which isn't really possible to answer. The pandemic is new, and although scientists are actively researching the virus to the best of their ability, we won't be able to accurately approximate how many lives were saved by which lockdown measures until we have the benefit of hindsight. Besides, you can't really <em>quantify</em> the quality-of-life diminished by various lockdown measures, since some people mind them more than others. Still, even if a disease only killed 1% of the people who got it, that'd still kill well over 3 million people in the US alone if everyone got it. The government should be empowered to do what it can to stop half a holocaust.</p>
<p>The third is more-or-less "is the lockdown worse than death" which is so ridiculous I'm not going to address it more than that. The fourth is "is it financially worth it", which is just tough. Like, try rephrasing it as "how many/who are are you willing to sacrifice to protect the economy" and answering that. Economic hardship is certainly no joke, but it's at least an issue we can employ other measures to mitigate and eventually recover from. You can't, however, fix corpses.</p>
<p>The fifth point is "should the government be allowed to enforce this" to which the answer is 'yes'.</p>
<p>&rt; Sweden</p>
<p>You bring Sweden up a lot, comparing it to the US. I was about to make a counterpoint, comparing how Sweden's death rates are significantly higher than its neighbors, but you already have a link addressing that.</p>
<p>&rt; Sweden’s High Covid Death Rates Among the Nordics: “Dry Tinder” and Other Important Factors</p>
<p>The point demonstrated here, with a lot of research and data to back it up, is that even if Sweden locked down at the same time its neighbors did, it wouldn't have helped much, as the majority of infections had already occurred by the time its neighbors locked down. Additionally, Sweden was uniquely positioned to have a lot of deaths relative to its neighbors, as its densely-populated Capital is much more densely-populated than its neighbors' Capitals, it had a more vulnerable population, and so on.</p>
<p>However, what this data can't show is whether lockdowns or masks are effective or not at saving lives. It shows that the time the other countries locked down would've been largely too late for Sweden, but if Sweden <em>had</em> locked down prior to most of its infections, what would the situation be then?</p>
<p>Additionally, correlation is not causation. Sweden still has a lower death rate than the US (I'm going to trust that your numbers are accurate), but Sweden is a very different part of the world from the US. Its population density in Stockholm, which is one of the reasons your link cites as a reason for the country's high death rate, is 11,802 people per square mile. According to the 2010 US Census (a decade old, but still), Stockholm would only be the <strong>79th</strong> densest US city. There are <strong>55</strong> US cities within plus or minus 10% of Stockholm's population density. US's population density is nearly 50% higher than Sweden's population density. Sweden has a different culture, a different climate; there are simply too many factors to simply point at Sweden and declare that lockdowns or masks aren't effective. Otherwise, I could just as easily point to Denmark or Norway, which <em>did</em> undergo lockdowns and had <strong>significantly</strong> lower death rates compared to the US, and make the same claim that lockdowns <em>are</em> effective. In fact, I could bring up a ton of countries compared to the singular Sweden. The one counterexample doesn't negate the trend.</p>
<p>Focusing back to masks, though. You seem to personally intensely dislike wearing a mask, and you've gone through plenty of research to find supporting information to try to make the case that masks and other measures to slow the pandemic are unhelpful, unnecessary, or even harmful. However, your research doesn't sufficiently prove that claim, so basic physics and common sense still win out. Coronavirus spreads via water droplets. Masks, even basic cloth ones, absorb a lot of water droplets or reflect them back over your face (<em>man</em> was it weird the first time I felt my breath flow over my <em>eyeballs</em>). Therefore, if you're sick, wearing a mask means the water droplets from you that could infect other people don't travel nearly as far. Masks also provide mild protection from inhaling those kinds of water droplets from other people, but masks get the most use on people who are sick. Since the virus spreads before you show symptoms, you can't tell whether or not you're 'sick' at any given moment. Therefore, the logical thing to do is have everyone wear a mask when in public.</p>
<p>No one's suggesting that wearing a mask is comfortable. No one's claiming that locking down is fun; I really miss sitting down in a restaurant. However, a pandemic is a community issue. Claiming that wearing a mask is just too bothersome for you doesn't change the fact that it's selfish and irresponsible to not wear one in public during these circumstances.</p>

        <p>&rt;No one worth any salt has been claiming that anyone with a health condition that makes it legitimately problematic to wear a mask needs to wear one…</p>
<p>Well, I guess that’s nice that you’re willing to grant that concession, but it doesn’t really address my fundamental problems with mask mandates.  Anyone who isn’t wearing a mask is doing so presumably because <em>they</em> “legitimately” believe that the costs of wearing a mask outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>&rt;Was focused on the flu, not coronavirus, and still recommended facemasks despite weak evidence. I'm admittedly curious why their evidence for face mask usage was so weak, but I'm not going to go through each and every study they looked at.</p>
<p>Not sure why we should expect that to matter. Flu transmission is also primarily via droplets so you’d certainly expect masks to work against flu if they were going to work against anything.  And the evidence might have been “so weak” because the benefit is so weak. Re: COVID-19 specifically, we’ve now had lots of places adopt mask mandates at different times, some of them having been in place for months now, and we also have lots of other places with no mandates and very limited usage.  If mask mandates were providing a truly substantial benefit, the evidence in their favor by now should be obvious, overwhelming, and simple to demonstrate.  </p>
<p>&rt;There have been multiple instances, including here in the US, of hospitals hitting capacity when the virus spreads rapidly enough. When a hospital can't see new patients, then not only would anyone with COVID-19 who'd need hospital support to survive die (if they can't get to another hospital that hasn't yet hit capacity), but anyone who needed hospital support for any other reason would also die, or at least see complications.</p>
<p>The concern about not overwhelming hospitals probably did make some sense back in March and April. Encourage people to stay home and "socially distance" for a few weeks to try to delay and flatten the peak a bit, and buy some time for health care system to ramp up capacity? Cancel large potential "super spreader" events? Fine. Great. But we're now almost six months past that. What the hell are we doing <em>now</em> with these restrictions? We've got states that essentially opened back up <em>months</em> ago. We've got states that never really locked down. Most states are obviously at least through most of their curves. Some appear to be effectively done. Are there any of those temporary field hospitals that were constructed months ago that haven't been taken down at this point as a result of lack of need? And again, "slowing the spread" at this point (assuming we're actually doing that to any meaningful degree) is also a cost because it drags this nightmare out further, delays the arrival of herd immunity, and increases the time the truly vulnerable and irrationally fearful need to remain paranoid and locked down.  </p>
<p>&rt;Now, facemasks wouldn't have saved all those people, as they merely help prevent the spread of disease instead of halting it altogether, but even if it only prevented 10% of those deaths, that'd still be nearly 20,000 people, and that's only of those who have died so far. There are still a lot of people who could die to this disease, and it's worth doing what we can to protect them.</p>
<p>Whether face mask mandates are, in fact, doing anything to protect them and whether their benefits outweigh their costs such that they are actually “worth doing” – that’s the entire question.  If we assume no countervailing negative effect on life expectancy from mask mandates (which I don’t think is reasonable), and we use your 20,000 number for  “saved lives," and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/hnwzgw/years_of_life_lost_estimates_cannot_always_be/">we <em>very</em> generously</a> assume 10 life years saved per life, that translates to an increased life expectancy of 5.3 hours per person in the US. Even if I agreed with those assumptions (which I don’t), I’d still say the juice is <em>clearly</em> not worth the squeeze. Hell, I personally would gladly sacrifice 5,300 hours of life to have avoided the nonsense of the past six months.</p>
<p>&rt;My cousin lives with and cares for her mother, and while her mother stays home all the time, my cousin still has necessary errands to run. If she gets sick because some guy just didn't want to wear a mask nearby, then she'd bring it home to her mother, and her mother is very much at risk of dying to it. It's much more reasonable and humane to simply make people wear masks in public than it'd be to put the onus on my cousin have to keep distant from her own mother in her own home.</p>
<p>I disagree. Your cousin is certainly free to get everything delivered and minimize trips outside the home to the absolute bare minimum (if any) and take whatever heroic precautions she feels are necessary to protect herself if and when she does leave the home (e.g., wear a properly-fitted N95 mask or a full Hazmat suit). She should also be free to patronize only establishments that require people to walk around with pieces of cloth over their mouths if that’s something that’s important to her. But she doesn’t have the right, at least in my view, to use government coercion to impose that requirement on others.</p>
<p>&rt;The first point is "does the lockdown even save lives" which is hard to get absolute data on until after the pandemic is over, but if a disease spreads between people, then isolating people prevents/slows the spread of the disease. There's literally no other way it could work. </p>
<p>“It seems like it <em>should</em> work.” I guess. It’s just that empirically it doesn’t seem to. And again, any lives it does “save” via a reduced COVID-19 death toll are almost certainly dwarfed by countervailing <em>negative</em> effects on life expectancy resulting from “increased poverty, joblessness, stress, anxiety, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/irlw8u/ted_talk_by_johann_hiri_on_the_social_connection/">substance abuse</a>, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments for other conditions, etc.”</p>
<p>&rt;Besides, you can't really quantify the quality-of-life diminished by various lockdown measures, since some people mind them more than others. </p>
<p>Well, you <em>can</em>. You’d just need accurate data on people’s preferences.  But the subjective nature of people’s preferences is part of the beauty of my approach.  The people who <em>don’t</em> really mind “staying the fuck home,” not eating in restaurants for months, wearing masks / being surrounded by only other masked faces, etc. can take those precautions while the people who have a different preference / risk-benefit assessment can go about their lives more or less as normal while building the herd immunity needed to protect the former group. That’s what I call a win-win.</p>
<p>&rt;Still, even if a disease only killed 1% of the people who got it, that'd still kill well over 3 million people in the US alone if everyone got it. </p>
<p>Sounds like the classic 1% fallacy. “Bro, you should totally invest in my startup. If I capture <em>just 1%</em> of the $30.5 billion t-shirt market, that’s... well I don’t know exactly how much it is, but it’s gotta be a fuck-ton of money.” This disease isn’t nearly that lethal and not anywhere close to everyone will get it. But if it <em>were</em> that lethal and actually capable of killing 1% of the population and doing so across all age demographics and health profiles, most people would be <em>voluntarily</em> altering their behavior much more than they have been.  </p>
<p>&rt;The government should be empowered to do what it can to stop half a holocaust.</p>
<p>Dude. Come on. All-cause mortality in the US every year is about 2.8 million. But that’s not “half a holocaust.” It’s called us not being immortal beings.  Eventually we all die. People are especially likely to die when they’re very old and very sickly.  The disease burden of this super-scary "global pandemic" will be substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of heart disease, substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of cancer, and substantially smaller than the annual disease burden of accidental injuries. On the grand scale of things that cause death and human suffering, COVID-19 is a relative nothingburger. Nothing about this "novel" but entirely precedented virus justifies the totalitarian and dystopian nightmare we've endured for the past six months.</p>
<p>&rt;The third is more-or-less "is the lockdown worse than death" which is so ridiculous I'm not going to address it more than that.</p>
<p>It’s not ridiculous at all. Death is inevitable. Life isn’t.</p>
<p>"There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>
<p>&rt;The fourth is "is it financially worth it", which is just tough. Like, try rephrasing it as "how many/who are are you willing to sacrifice to protect the economy" and answering that. Economic hardship is certainly no joke, but it's at least an issue we can employ other measures to mitigate and eventually recover from. You can't, however, fix corpses.</p>
<p>Opportunity cost is unfortunately very real. Resources are finite. If we, in effect, spend trillions of dollars (by destroying our economy) to combat a virus that is, relatively speaking, a quite modest public health threat, that's trillions in resources that we now don't have available to address cancer, heart disease, suicide, or for that matter, the next pandemic, which might be a truly deadly one!</p>

        <p>PART 2:</p>

<p>Your answer perhaps. My answer is FUCK NO.</p>

It shows that the time the other countries locked down would've been largely too late for Sweden, but if Sweden had locked down prior to most of its infections, what would the situation be then?</p>
<p>From my perspective, it’s blindingly obvious that the costs of a Swedish lockdown would have greatly exceeded its benefits – <em>even if we assume that a lockdown could have magically prevented every single one of Sweden’s COVID-19 infections</em>.</p>
<p>&rt;I could just as easily point to Denmark or Norway, which did undergo lockdowns and had significantly lower death rates compared to the US, and make the same claim that lockdowns are effective.

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqiztr/the_data_i_have_assembled_here_indicates_that_for/">The point is that there is NO clear trend</a>.   EDIT: Also, I'd note that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f8G5W1t.png">mask usage was almost non-existent in Denmark</a>, and I believe that's actually true of the other Nordic countries as well.</p>

<p>I disagree. I don’t want to contribute to a more paranoid, fearful, and dehumanized environment. I have a family. I get plenty of meaningful social interaction at home and when getting together with my friends. I see plenty of smiles.  But not everyone is so lucky. For some people, those little interactions in the public space are far more significant, and I don’t want to deny them that.</p>

        <p>&rt; the costs of wearing a mask outweigh the benefits</p>
<p>You keep bringing this up, and I just don't understand. How on Earth could wearing a mask be a big deal? I ran an errand with my girlfriend earlier, and after reading around on this sub, when I put on my mask as I stepped out of the car, I put on a big display as a joke. "Oh no! My humanity is leaking out! I'm being... <em>dehumanized!</em> My personality is gone! I'm nothing but a sheep! The <em>horror!</em>" My girlfriend and I laughed, and we went in and took care of the errand with no trouble at all. The mask is mildly annoying, but that's it. Some posts I've seen talk about masks as if they're some kind magical personality-deleting slave device, and I just can't take any of it seriously.</p>
<p>&rt; If mask mandates were providing a truly substantial benefit, the evidence in their favor by now should be obvious, overwhelming, and simple to demonstrate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei_Lyu/publication/342219293_Community_Use_Of_Face_Masks_And_COVID-19_Evidence_From_A_Natural_Experiment_Of_State_Mandates_In_The_US_Study_examines_impact_on_COVID-19_growth_rates_associated_with_state_government_mandates_requiri/links/5f4c228fa6fdcc14c5ef21a6/Community-Use-Of-Face-Masks-And-COVID-19-Evidence-From-A-Natural-Experiment-Of-State-Mandates-In-The-US-Study-examines-impact-on-COVID-19-growth-rates-associated-with-state-government-mandates-requiri.pdf">I mean, people have crunched the numbers.</a>  "The study provides evidence that US states mandating the use of face masks in public had a greater decline in daily COVID-19 growth rates after issuing these mandates compared with states that did not issue mandates."</p>
<p>&rt; The concern about not overwhelming hospitals probably did make some sense back in March and April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/14/texas-hospitals-coronavirus/">Texas was hitting hospital capacity in mid-July.</a> From what I can find, the US has had a bit under 6.5 million people test positive for COVID-19 so far. Even if the number of people who've caught it and recovered/became immune without ever getting tested is ten times that, there's still plenty of vulnerable people, easily enough to overwhelm hospital systems if enough of them get sick at the same time.</p>
<p>&rt; "slowing the spread" at this point... drags this nightmare out further, delays the arrival of herd immunity</p>
<p>Herd immunity isn't some quick solution that we could obtain if only we would drop all of these social distancing measures and whatnot. There is a <strong>mountain</strong> of corpses between where we are now and enough of the population getting infected for herd immunity to be a thing. We're quickly approaching 200,000 deaths, and only a small minority of people have caught the virus so far. For herd immunity, we'd need a strong majority of people to get infected. To say nothing of the time it would take to infect that many individuals without overwhelming hospital systems, how many people would you feel comfortable having die to reach that point? Another 200,000? More??</p>
<p>&rt; I personally would gladly sacrifice 5,300 hours of life to have avoided the nonsense of the past six months.</p>
<p>You'd sacrifice over half a year of your life over wearing a mask? Over social distancing and canceled events? What on Earth is your priority system? It sounds like chopping off your fingers so that you don't have to deal with trimming your nails.</p>
<p>&rt; “It seems like it <em>should</em> work.” I guess.</p>
<p>Considering there aren't magical disease fairies that spread diseases through walls, yes.</p>
<p>&rt; The people who don’t really mind “staying the fuck home,”... can take those precautions while the people who have a different preference... can go about their lives more or less as normal while building the herd immunity needed to protect the former group. That’s what I call a win-win.</p>
<p>Dude, if I could hit a button that would pick up everyone who wants to flout pandemic mitigation measures, and put 'em all on an isolated island so they can overwhelm their own healthcare systems and gain immunity the hard way while the rest of us social distance for however long it takes, I would. Populations aren't isolated, though, and people being casual about the pandemic are making things harder for those trying to avoid it. You could make the argument that people wanting to avoid getting sick are making things harder for people in your camp who want to return to normalcy, but that's why we get to vote on our governmental leadership, I guess. I choose to be on the side of having fewer people die and dealing with the trivial inconveniences that entails.</p>
<p>&rt; Eventually we all die... The disease burden of this super-scary "global pandemic" will be substantially smaller than... heart disease... cancer... accidental injuries.</p>
<p>People aren't immortal, but we try to prevent what deaths are preventable. If I were to shoot someone in the head, the response isn't "oh, they were going to die anyway." It doesn't matter if they were a child or at death's door; there are reasons we don't have different murder charges based on age of the victim. Sure, if a bunch of people had to die, I would rather it be those who had already lived full lives, but again, preventing deaths in the first place is the point.</p>
<p>&rt; Nothing about this... virus justifies the totalitarian and dystopian nightmare we've endured for the past six months.</p>
<p>I think a key difference in our viewpoints is how difficult it is to comply with the social distancing and whatnot. On what planet is it a 'totalitarian and dystopian nightmare' to wear a Goddamn mask? To have to wait a while before you next get to attend a concert? To have to take restaurant meals home instead of dining in? You post as if efforts to try to slow the pandemic are taking an unbearable toll on you, and I just don't understand how.</p>
<p>&rt; If we, in effect, spend trillions of dollars... to combat a virus... that's trillions in resources that we now don't have available to address cancer, heart disease, suicide, or for that matter, the next pandemic, which might be a truly deadly one!</p>
<p>I see this reasoning used a lot by ISPs whenever they try to spread bullshit to stop a local government from installing its own internet. "They're spending government dollars on that, but what about improving roads?" It's not either/or. We didn't have plans to spend trillions of dollars fighting heart disease, but then had to scrap those plans to fight the pandemic instead. I don't know the intricacies of research funding grants to know how much the pandemic affected such groups, but neither do you.</p>
<p>&rt; I’d say that basic human rights should win out over unsupported speculation.</p>
<p>What 'basic human rights' are violated by requiring masks? You know you're also required to wear clothes, right?</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>&rt;You keep bringing this up, and I just don't understand. How on Earth could wearing a mask be a big deal?</p>
<p>To be honest, I just don’t understand how anyone could think these mask mandates <em>aren’t</em> a big deal.  Faces are important.  Like really important. There’s a reason <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2020/08/17/why-your-brain-is-hard-wired-to-see-the-man-in-the-moon-and-faces-in-everyday-objects/#10bf1e0067f5">we are literally hard-wired to see faces in everything</a>.  If you don’t “get it,” I’m almost at a loss as to how to explain it to you. But I’ll give you three examples from my own experience from recent months that stand out.  </p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, during the peak doom days of April, I went with my wife to visit her grandparents at their house. Per their request, we met outdoors in their backyard, stayed at least six feet apart, and everyone wore masks.  It was perhaps the saddest and least fulfilling social interaction that I’ve ever had. (And if you’d known me during my high school years, you’d realize that’s really saying something.) I’m pretty sure the grandfather didn’t hear a single word that either my wife or I said. (To be fair, he probably only catches about 60% under ideal conditions, which these definitely were not.)  We only stayed for maybe 20 minutes whereas we’d usually stay for an hour or two because well, it sucked, for everyone involved.  </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I went down to a park as a favor to a friend to reserve a picnic table for a baby shower she was hosting for one of her coworkers.  One of the attendees showed up to claim the table and introduced herself. She was wearing a face mask. Normally, I really enjoy meeting new people (especially in cases where it’s a friend of a friend) and generally find it relatively easy to make conversation in these situations. And this person’s voice, and what she said, were both very pleasant and friendly.  She invited me to stay and have a drink and some food, and normally I would have. But I didn’t, because the mask made me want to nope out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Third story: I had to get my AC fixed a while back, and the service tech came to the house wearing a mask.  Now I’m not saying I become best friends with every repair guy that comes to my house, but normally this scenario is, for me, a fairly pleasant or at least neutral one -- exchange a few pleasantries, maybe crack a few dumb jokes, that kind of thing. But on this occasion, the mask made the whole encounter at least a bit <em>un</em>pleasant.  Frankly, I found it a bit unsettling to have a complete stranger in my home whose face I’d never seen, and whose face and expressions I couldn’t see. I don’t want to overstate things here. I wasn’t <em>afraid</em>. I didn’t think he was a serial killer. But it <em>was</em>, like I said, a bit unsettling because I couldn’t get a read on the person:  “who the fuck is this faceless dude in my home?” And it did make me wonder how much more unsettling I might have found it if I were a woman who lived alone.  </p>
<p>&rt;The mask is mildly annoying, but that's it. Some posts I've seen talk about masks as if they're some kind magical personality-deleting slave device, and I just can't take any of it seriously.</p>
<p>You find it only “mildly annoying.’ And that’s fine. Other people obviously feel very differently. I don’t really understand your viewpoint, but I’ll still try to take it seriously and respect your right to hold it. I’d never try to tell you that you <em>can’t</em> wear a mask in public, or require masks to be worn by guests in your own home or business, even though I’d honestly <em>prefer</em> you not wear one around me, and if you did impose such a requirement, I’d decline to visit your home or patronize your business.  </p>
<p>&rt;I mean, people have crunched the numbers. "The study provides evidence that US states mandating the use of face masks in public had a greater decline in daily COVID-19 growth rates after issuing these mandates compared with states that did not issue mandates."</p>
<p>Sorry, but I don’t find a slight reduction in the growth rate of “cases” to be terribly impressive in terms of my desire to see obvious “substantial benefit.” Show me significant reductions in total mortality.  And <em>then</em> show me no significant countervailing negative impacts on mental health (something which obviously can lead to premature death). And <em>then</em> convince me the loss of freedom and quality of life was worth any remaining benefit. You’re simply not going to be able to do that. The numbers just don’t work.</p>
<p>&rt;Texas was hitting hospital capacity in mid-July.</p>
<p>Well, mid-July was literally the peak of Texas’ curve. And hospitals usually operate near capacity. And there’s various levels of “hitting capacity” in terms of what that <em>really</em> means. Here’s an article from Jan. 2018: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/15/flu-hospital-pandemics/">“A severe flu season is stretching hospitals thin. That is a very bad omen.”</a></p>
<p>Opening paragraph:</p>
<p>“A tsunami of sick people has swamped hospitals in many parts of the country in recent weeks as a severe flu season has taken hold. In Rhode Island, hospitals diverted ambulances for a period because they were overcome with patients. In San Diego, a hospital erected a tent outside its emergency room to manage an influx of people with flu symptoms.”</p>
<p>Of course, nobody really gave a shit back then because it wasn’t something that was trendy to fret about at that time. (Plus, it was just the regular ol’ seasonal flu which isn’t very sexy.)</p>
<p>&rt;Herd immunity isn't some quick solution that we could obtain if only we would drop all of these social distancing measures and whatnot. There is a mountain of corpses between where we are now and enough of the population getting infected for herd immunity to be a thing. We're quickly approaching 200,000 deaths, and only a small minority of people have caught the virus so far. For herd immunity, we'd need a strong majority of people to get infected. </p>
<p>No, I don’t see <em>any</em> evidence for that. Quite the opposite in fact.  Borrowing from a comment from /u/JustHereToNotBeFined:</p>
<p>“Multiple studies have places the herd immunity threshold at around 10-30%, so it is entirely possible that they are already there.</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762v1</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893v1</p>

<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154294v1</p>
<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08142.pdf</p>
<p>It's been a recurring pattern with many regions: they rocket up to around 20% prevalence and then it fizzles out, most probably having hit its natural ceiling. The effects are being seen in the recent hotspots of Texas, Florida and Arizona now - steady decline.”</p>
<p>Look at pretty much any country's curve you want where they've reached say 500 deaths / 1M and you'll see a very similar shape (and that daily deaths have either already fallen to near zero or are quickly headed in that direction) -- <em>and that's true regardless of the measures taken</em>. For example, compare the daily deaths / 1M curves of Spain (638 deaths / 1M), Belgium (856 deaths / 1M), UK (613 deaths / 1M), Italy (589 deaths / 1M), and Sweden (578 deaths 1/ 1M):</p>

<p>The US is sufficiently large and geographically diverse that its different regions have had their own curves, explained in great detail in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvFhIFzaac">this video</a> which, if you haven’t watched yet, I can’t recommend highly enough.</p>

        <p>(PART 2)</p>
<p>&rt;You'd sacrifice over half a year of your life over wearing a mask? Over social distancing and canceled events? What on Earth is your priority system? It sounds like chopping off your fingers so that you don't have to deal with trimming your nails.</p>
<p>Over a mask mandate alone (assuming it’s lifted soon and that it was only in place for say a total of four months)? No, probably not quite that high. But the whole circus of the past six months, lockdowns and all? Yeah, absolutely. No hesitation.  It’s not that I place zero value on the past six months (although I’d discount that time pretty fucking heavily), but in order to avoid both it and the long-term fallout from this clusterfuck that’s coming? Definitely.  </p>
<p>&rt;Dude, if I could hit a button that would pick up everyone who wants to flout pandemic mitigation measures, and put 'em all on an isolated island so they can overwhelm their own healthcare systems and gain immunity the hard way while the rest of us social distance for however long it takes, I would. </p>
<p>You can put <em>yourself</em> on the equivalent of an isolated island by staying home.</p>
<p>&rt; Populations aren't isolated, though, and people being casual about the pandemic are making things harder for those trying to avoid it.</p>
<p>No, if anything, they make it easier for those people by moving us through the curve faster and shortening the time they need to remain in isolation.  Remember "the curve"? I know <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/i0q7rx/flatten_the_curve_was_the_rallying_cry_back_in/">the whole "flatten the curve" thing has been memory-holed</a>, but epidemics follow a curve.  At first, the infection spreads relatively slowly (although there are lots of susceptible people to infect, there are few infected to act as spreaders). But the infection rate then speeds up very rapidly as the number of spreaders increases almost exponentially. But <em>then</em> (within a few weeks or months) the rate of spread starts slowing down as the virus begins to run out of susceptible people to infect, and especially as it runs out of <em>highly-connected</em> susceptible people to infect, such individuals being the ones most likely to act as significant spreaders (and also the ones most likely to be among the first infected).</p>
<p>&rt;People aren't immortal, but we try to prevent what deaths are preventable. </p>
<p>Indeed. But again, the problem is that our bizarre hyper-focus on one relatively modest cause of death is almost certainly going to cause far more preventable death from other causes.  </p>
<p>&rt;I think a key difference in our viewpoints is how difficult it is to comply with the social distancing and whatnot. On what planet is it a 'totalitarian and dystopian nightmare' to wear a Goddamn mask? To have to wait a while before you next get to attend a concert? To have to take restaurant meals home instead of dining in? You post as if efforts to try to slow the pandemic are taking an unbearable toll on you, and I just don't understand how.</p>
<p>Again, I’m frankly baffled as to how anyone could look around and <em>not</em> see how destructive and dystopian this failed experiment has been. Although <a href="https://twitter.com/jhnhellstrom/status/1298162409698402304">this pair of contrasting photos</a>, one from an elementary school in the UK and one from a school in Sweden, kind of sums it up for me.  In the US, how much of a dystopian nightmare this has been and continues to be varies greatly by state. In some places, life is already pretty much back to normal, and was never super not normal for very long.  In others, people went months without being able to go to the gym to workout, or out to go see a movie, or to dinner or a bar with friends, or bowling, or to a sports game, or to a wedding, or a funeral, <em>or to their job or small business which may no longer exist and may never be coming back</em>, or really to go anywhere at all other than a grocery store or Wal-Mart full of faceless people following ridiculous one-way arrow stickers.  Their kids have just started “Zoom school” where they sit alone in front of a screen all day, or (and I’m not sure which is worse) they’ve started masked, plexiglass-divided, anti-human, anti-life, joyless, “social-distanced,” recess-and-school-sports-are-canceled, eat-alone-at-your-desk-bubble “school.”</p>
<p>&rt;It's not either/or. We didn't have plans to spend trillions of dollars fighting heart disease, but then had to scrap those plans to fight the pandemic instead. </p>
<p><em>Of course</em> it’s either/or. That’s the very nature of opportunity cost. The people who have had their jobs, small businesses, savings, and financial security destroyed by lockdowns probably had lots of plans to spend the money that no longer exists on lots of things to improve their lives / the lives of their children in any number of different ways. But those resources, that wealth, has been destroyed.  And if you’re fixated on the “we” of government spending, the US is projected to have a record-breaking $3.7 trillion deficit for 2020. I remember just a few years ago when a $1 trillion dollar deficit was staggering. Eventually the piper is going to need to be paid.</p>
<p>&rt;What 'basic human rights' are violated by requiring masks? </p>
<p>Your right to bodily autonomy.  Your right to freedom of expression.  Do you not consider countries that require that women cover their face in public to be violating basic human rights?</p>
<p>&rt; You know you're also required to wear clothes, right?</p>
<p>In many but not all establishments, sure.</p>

        <p>Dude you a nut lmao. Respiratory disease deaths are not preventable and have never been considered preventable. And if we cared about preventing them we would do so for the easily preventable 1 million tuberculous deaths each year. Also, you seem to already have a girlfriend? Do you think it would be hard for people to find girlfriends in this day and age especially with the masks?</p>

<p>&rt; Our measurements indicate that 2 or 3 layers of highly permeable fabric, such as T-shirt cloth, may block droplets with an efficacy similar to that of medical masks, while still maintaining comparable breathability. Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32329337/</p>
<p>&rt; Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles. </p>
<p>A weaker one, but it's not about the coronavirus, so yeah. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24229526/</p>
<p>&rt; Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.</p>

It doesn’t seem terribly surprising that if you spritz a piece of fabric with a squirt bottle that the fabric will prevent a lot of the droplets from passing through. That doesn’t exactly strike me as being Nobel Prize-caliber research. But that’s a pretty far cry from proving that mask mandates in stores and other public spaces (and the real behavioral changes that produces) will actually have a significant positive impact on an epidemic’s progression.</p>

        <p>One could turn this around accuse you of lacking empathy. Your belief that extremely old and sick people having a small chance of dying is so horrible that everyone has to put up with the discomfort of breathing through a mask for the next year is senseless and bizarre.</p>

        <p>That's in no way equivalent, though? Wearing a mask is a trivial inconvenience. If wearing one helps save lives, then it's pretty selfish not to.</p>
<p>Like, sure, one could argue that it's an inconvenience to not get to drive anywhere after drinking until you sober up, but we decided as a society that it's not worth the risk.</p>

        <p>For me, sheep = blindly following a single source without critical thought.</p>
<p>I wear a mask based on critical analysis of multiple different scientific findings from different researchers and institutions such as:</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v1">Howard et al. 2020</a> which cites many other studies it is drawing on;</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/">MacIntyre et al. 2009</a> ("adherent mask users had a significant reduction in the risk for clinical infection [of breath-borne respiratory viruses]");</p>
<p>-<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25886">Han and Zhou 2020</a> ("wearing mask in general population is an effective way to control COVID‐19, and should be recommended");</p>
<p>-<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1752-7163/ab8a55">Pleil et al. 2020</a> ("Wearing some form of exhaled barrier out in public during pathogen outbreaks is an altruistic act serving not only as a form of enhanced cough or sneeze etiquette, but also to reduce the aerosols emitted from normal breathing or when talking");</p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2">Leung et al. 2020</a> ("Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols");</p>
<p>-<a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/55/6/2001260">Esposito et al. 2020</a> ("we strongly advocate universal use of face masks as a means of source control in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic"), and many more studies.</p>
<p>What about reading these studies with a critical eye and taking their advice into mind rather than using a single governmental body for advice makes one a sheep? Or how do y'all define "sheep"? Open to rational arguments.</p>
<p>(Or just bring on the downvotes baby!)</p>
<p>Edit- if you’re gonna downvote, plz refute my arguments. Following the hive mind and downvoting without logical critique seems awfully sheep-like to me.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could actually provide logical arguments to support your position (as one person has done)! Wouldn’t that be something, you’d really show that your position is not just based on vague emotional claims!</p>
<p>Honestly it must be nice to be so blindly confident in ones views you feel like you can just sling random insults rather than providing a counterargument. Truly an amazing feat, such a great contribution to this country.</p>

        <p>I’m not afraid of a mild cold, you’re straw-manning my arguments which is a logical fallacy and not valid.</p>
<p>Covid has killed almost 200,000 Americans and almost a million worldwide (in terms of the US that’s more than twice that of the flu last year, let alone the common cold and this also a probable underestimate as covid reporting is voluntary and many countries are not set up to accurately or fully report deaths).</p>
<p>I sincerely don’t understand how you can compare that to a mild cold. Even the symptoms and potential for long term effects are quite different from a cold.</p>
<p>Also just because I’m responding with research and care doesn’t mean I’m “afraid.”</p>
<p>Sincere question, can’t you see how flawed / unproductive / inaccurate (essentially false in comparing COVID to common cold) that statement is?</p>

        <p>Everyone that I know who has had it compared it to a bad sinus infection. I have had my wedding, baby shower, went on 2 vacations, the casino multiple times, church every Sunday, and shopping multiple times a week since all of this started and I am still alive and healthy. </p>
<p>I will wear the stupid mask just to keep the sheeps blood pressure down and so that I can go out in public since I am in a mask mandated state. I refuse to wear a mask outside though.  </p>
<p>It has not killed 200,000 people. More like 10,000. Do you wear a mask during flu season? I doubt it.</p>

        <p>The problem is there are an equal or greater number of actual peer-reviewed studies (some of what you’ve listed aren’t peer-reviewed studies and are simply opinion of one or two people in the “well it can’t hurt” category) indicating masks are useless and potentially harmful.  </p>
<p>Given the recent debacle of that “study” which has since been debunked by researchers at Johns Hopkins, which alleged that Sturgis led to half a million cases and millions of dollars, I think its important to consider everything from credible sources and make decisions based on that. </p>
<p>I get that people want to “do something” to show they are compliant and “taking it seriously” but there’s not the solid science behind mask-wearing that you seem to think there is.</p>

        <p>Anything I posted that is not a peer-reviewed scientific study (2/6 are not) is written by scientific experts <strong>and</strong> cites peer-reviewed studies. The quotations I provided explain how their evidence mostly goes beyond the “well it can’t hurt” category, though the precautionary principle is still valid.</p>
<p>&rt; Not the solid science behind mask-wearing that you seem to think there is.</p>
<p>There is scientific debate and contradictory findings on any and every matter. Of course there aren’t dozens of totally conclusive scientific studies on a matter that’s less than a year old. </p>
<p>But peer-reviewed scientific studies going back much farther than this year provide further evidence that masks have been effective at reducing transmission of breathborne viral respiratory infections like COVID which are the absolute best thing we have to go off to supplement current research.</p>
<p>Yes, science is complicated and mixed, and ofc some studies like the one you mentioned are flawed (though that one doesn’t have to do with masks which are the topic at hand, and even critics of that study acknowledge it does provide strong evidence for linking Sturgis to increased cases) but if we are limited in time for current research, looking back at decades of previous research further confirms my claims. Hence the 2009 study I cited which also cites other earlier peer-reviewed studies.</p>

        <p>Nope.  Go back twenty years.  Masks are demonstrably ineffective at preventing transmission—either way—of nano particles such as this virus.     </p>
<p>And not all your citations lead to a peer-reviewed study.  It’s important to see what the science community—not just a publisher—deems credible.     </p>
<p>I’ve seen more credible peer/reviewed studies as well as opinion of think tanks like  the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy indicating masks don’t help, especially homemade cloth masks.   The flip flops in a remarkably short time by Fauci and the CDC on the mask issue also lends some skepticism here.  Please don’t respond with “Fauci was only trying to save masks for doctors”.   He never said that.  He actually was laughing and relating that it was “overreaction” to wear a mask. He knew at that time he made that statement how widespread Corona  was and knew or should have known what all the studies indicated about mask use and was probably relying (correctly) on those when he gave that interview. Also.  See Fauci not wearing a mask and not social distancing at a baseball game two weeks ago.  Not shaming him:  pointing out that if he truly believed masks were effective,  why would he risk not wearing one seating an inch away from another person?   </p>
<p>We’ll have to agree to disagree.  I wear a surgical mask because it’s required.  I also am a Biden supporter.  Just making the point that labelling everyone as  “Trumpers” or “antimaskers” (I’m not saying you did either) because they’ve done some thoughtful research on masks and have a different understanding of what the scientific community has demonstrated, is not a great way for everyone to move forward as we turn the corner with, happily,  lower mortality rates then were  first announced.</p>

        <p>My issue with masks is not so much the mask itself (besides the mild unnerving part of not being able to see facial expressions) - but its more the ridiculous, hateful, screeching rants from like 95% of the internet, and random customers, people everywhere. “MASK THE FUCK UP, PUSSY!” type of things. </p>
<p>I literally can’t even. It makes me want to not wear a mask out of spite for their child like temper tantrums. </p>
<p>I understand that there is screeching on the other side of the debate, as well...I guess I just don’t really hear it or see it in my area.</p>

        <p>Wait so, just to understand what you're saying 
You're upset that people are wanting you to wear a mask (because y'know, lots of people are at risk or know someone who is) and you want to not wear the mask "out of spite"?</p>
<p>And they're being childlike?</p>
<p>What?</p>

        <p>Right so, Most people driving are going to be safe the entire trip and we've put numerous safety measures into cats to prevent deaths (airbags and seatbelts). 
Also don't we want to minimize risks for humans? Like I just don't understand people saying "well driving is dangerous too!" (Note the lack of mocking there with TyPiNg LiKe ThIs, I'm not gonna stoop to your level) cars would be less comfortable without seatbelts, and there's people who's airbags go off when they're not required. Sure it sucks that that happens, but it's saving lives.</p>
<p>Masks do work. It's been proven a million times over. Google "do masks work to prevent the spread of covid" and I'm sure you could find numerous tests and the sort proving it. And also you actually made a good point for me there with saying that you could do everything right in a car and still get hit by someone not following the rules. Kinda like how there's a good portion of people wearing masks, and yet people can still be infected because the masks don't get rid of all risk but they certainly lessen the risk. Or they get infected by people who aren't following the rules and insist on not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>

        <p>This. We need a big turn out. How can we just sit around allowing them to put us under authoritarian rule? Turn up.</p>
<p>Also, why are you waiting until tomorrow to take off your mask? Just do it now. Everyday is mask free day. Your planned event wont work as much as I want it to. You have to be brave and take of your mask. Do it now, do it today, don't wait for some point in the future when you'll feel more comfortable because that day will never come.</p>

        <p>Except the masks don't protect us from smoke at all.  Woodsmoke particulates are around 1 micrometer or less.  Cloth masks (which most people are wearing) can't do shit for anything smaller than 3 micrometers (if they indeed do anything at all).</p>

        <p>Don't wait, just take off the mask already. This thing needs to spread. The world is overpopulated as is, and the more people that die off, the better off we'll be. I encourage large groups of people to form together and make protests (maskless of course).</p>
<p>I know it's a bit hypocritical, but I'm going to keep wearing my mask. I'm fully prepared to die for our cause, but I'm not ready to risk it yet. Too many people are adhering to the science and we still need to do our job at slandering masks and such.</p>

        <p>Some of the heaviest-hit areas with ongoing significant deaths use harsh lockdowns and mandatory masking. On the opposite side, many of the less hit places do not. Masking is just security theatre to appease dumb fearful people, especially since they're not even mandating "powerful" masks.</p>

        <p>It’s cute when people who clearly haven’t reviewed the scientific evidence call those who have “retarded.” </p>
<p>Yes, sweetie, you’re very smart for parroting what you read on the news - and oh boy, it confirms your very strong feelings that masks sure <em>seem</em> like they must work. </p>
<p>If you’d ever like to review the evidence and use that special skill of thinking critically, just ask - we’ll point you to literally decades of peer reviewed research from reputable publications and institutions. Until a few months ago, the overwhelming global consensus was that, at best, masks are not proven effective (surprisingly, even in a surgical setting). </p>
<p>Technically, that’s still the case ... the media just conveniently likes to ignore that in favor of the “oops, actually the studies and reviews that showed over and over and over that masks are not effective are actually wrong now that someone is pushing masks, please forget those” studies of 2020.</p>

        <p>Are people under the impression that these studies are hidden away? We find them with some pretty basic googling - you can too, if you care to do so. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip5fu0/scientific_evidence_and_crosscountry_variability/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Here’s a good starting point - a post compiling a bunch of studies with links to original docs and descriptions.</a></p>
<p>As a side note: </p>
<p>I’d never questioned the use of surgical masks in operating rooms - makes sense that those are obviously a really good idea, right? Lots of doctors and surgeons agree, and love masks in ORs... yet when you actually study masks in ORs, the evidence doesn’t support the common-sense belief that they provide a benefit to either the patient or wearer. </p>
<p>Take a gander at the studies on masks in OR (I think I have some additional ones if you’d like)... over and over, masks are shown to be useless. And over and over, they are nonetheless recommended ... but because they make people feel safer, not because there’s any evidence that they do anything to stop transmission of bacteria or viruses. </p>
<p>If surgeons look at the ample evidence against masks and decide they still feel better wearing them just because, I don’t have much hope that the general population will choose evidence over feelings.</p>

        <p>Those are not my opinions, those are the opinions of medical professionals about the effectiveness of masks specifically in reference to covid-19.  </p>
<p>Nice try with the "You're the uninformed one here" bullshit.  Meanwhile you vaguely cite 'older' research.  I'm all for the sentiments of this sub there shouldn't be a new normal and wearing a mask sucks.  That isn't an excuse to be willfully and pridefully ignorant.  </p>
<p>And your old research is better than the citation I provided?! Isn't that like Newton telling Einstien he's wrong about relativity?</p>

        <p>Instead of writing this, you could have done a search (even in this very sub!) and found much of that “vague” research I cited. I’m not doing your work for you: if you want to be informed, you can do it yourself. </p>

<p>I’ve simply read the available research and accepted that the overwhelming consensus is that masks don’t work - even today, plenty of actual experts state that this is the case (and then are forced to put disclaimers on their work that despite everything they properly researched and concluded, you should totally still wear masks anyway ... that should tell you a lot about the influence of politics in science today).</p>

<p>&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. </p>
<p>Another: </p>
<p>World Health Organization 2019 Publication: <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf">"Non-pharmaceutical public health measures for mitigating the risk and impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza"</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>OVERALL RESULT OF EVIDENCE ON FACE MASKS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;1. Ten RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and there was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. </p>
<p>From that same publication:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Reusable cloth face masks are not recommended.</strong> Medical face masks are generally not reusable, and an adequate supply would be essential if the use of face masks was recommended.</p>
<p>Although frankly, at least from my perspective, whether or not masks "work" is mostly irrelevant to the question of whether or not government mask mandates are justified.  Expanded thoughts on the "mask debate" <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ikynfs/coronavirus_mega_thread/g3r02gc/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, great comment from user Busch-Diesel <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ikynfs/coronavirus_mega_thread/g3qmac1/">here</a> that I would highly recommend reading.</p>

        <p>Here's some evidence for the worthlessness of the mask.</p>
<p>If the mask stopped the spread of covid to a significant degree then you would expect places where they did not use masks to have radically higher covid deathcounts than those that did.</p>
<p>But that is not the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/">Here are the numbers</a></p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>UK is 625 per million</p>
<p>Sweden is 573</p>
<p>Also consider South Dakota (in the us state stats)</p>
<p>There is other good evidence too but you can easily scan this sub for that.</p>

<p>If that wasn't clear enough they even wrote a letter to the publisher saying as much.  You can't misunderstand that unless you're trying to.  </p>

        <p>From the original article: </p>
<h1>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.</h1>
<p>&rt; The calculus <strong>may</strong> be different, however, in health care settings. </p>
<p>&rt; <strong>What is less clear is whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients.</strong> </p>
<p>&rt; There are two scenarios in which there <strong>may</strong> be <strong>possible</strong> benefits.</p>
<p>&rt; More compelling is the <strong>possibility</strong> that wearing a mask <strong>may reduce</strong> the likelihood of transmission from asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic health care workers with Covid-19 to other providers and patients. </p>
<p>On the authors’ anecdotal evidence of employees developing symptoms at work: 
&rt; These cases have led to large numbers of our patients and staff members being exposed to the virus and a handful of <strong>potentially</strong> linked infections in health care workers. </p>
<p>&rt; Masking all providers <strong>might</strong> limit transmission from these sources by stopping asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic health care workers from spreading virus-laden oral and nasal droplets.</p>
<p>&rt; The extent of marginal benefit of universal masking over and above these foundational measures is debatable.</p>
<p>And in delightful conclusion: </p>
<p>&rt; One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a <strong>marginally beneficial mask</strong>, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, </p>
<h1>but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis.</h1>
<p>&rt; Expanded masking protocols’ <strong>greatest contribution may be to reduce the transmission of anxiety</strong>, over and above <strong>whatever role they may play</strong> in reducing transmission of Covid-19. </p>
<p>&rt; <strong>The potential value of universal masking in giving health care workers the confidence to absorb and implement the more foundational infection-prevention practices described above may be its greatest contribution.</strong></p>
<p>This is conjecture that heavily acknowledges that masks have little health benefit. This is not compelling evidence that masks are effective.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it’s just not about widespread masking outside of a medical setting.</p>

        <p>Nice try with the strawman but I brought up the PNAS article.  Not this one.  Someone else brought this one up - supposedly indicating that masks don't work.  The problem is that it doesn't say that anywhere in the article.  Instead, there is a single line (which appears to be tangential and unsourced) to support your position that 'masks don't work'.   Then you attempt to minimize the clear benefit the authors point out by highlighting words like possible, might, and may.  That's a logical fallacy though.  Your argument takes the form:  maybe X, therefore NOT X.  Maybe masks help, therefore, masks don't help.  </p>
<p>What about  the letter those same authors wrote to the editor in June clarifying that: </p>
<p>&rt;A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact...This finding is also borne out by recent research associating mask wearing with less transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in closed settings. </p>
<p>Just humor me and read the PNAS article I originally posted.  If you don't want to read the whole thing, just read page 3.</p>

<p>&rt;We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong> It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not.</p>

        <p>This really shouldn't be downvoted as it nicely illustrates the flawed logic behind the "if masks work, why do we need other restrictions?" argument.  (And I say that as someone who thinks that mask mandates and lockdowns <em>don't</em> "work" and wouldn't be justified even if they did.)</p>

        <p>Ok, that seems like a pretty fair counterpoint. Although I guess doomers in most places could point to some absurd restrictions that have been eased at least somewhat and claim it’s the masks that made it ok.

        <p>Because this isn't pregnancy where you're either pregnant or not, it's like baldness, its a matter of degrees.  Masks don't either work or not work - it's not binary.  An n95 mask means it keeps out 95% of the particles of a specific size.  That means 5% will get through - no matter what.  Does that mean n95 masks don't work?</p>
