    <strong>Do y'all think it's possible that they may release a variant that's actually deadly in the coming months?</strong>
    <p><p>This is gonna be a quick short post, my opinion as of right now is that every single variant we've seen on the news, Alpha, B.1.77, Delta, Lambda, Tau, Epsilon, Chode are absolutely fake with the intent of driving fear.</p>
<p>However, I do think it is possible in the fall they may actually release a variant that will be deadly and will either cause serious illness in both vaxxed/unvaxxed OR just unvaxxed.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this is that if you haven't been vaccinated yet, it's very clear that you have no intention to do so as you either don't trust the vaccine or you don't trust the government (or both lol). People that are unwilling to take the vaccine are probably in the same boat as me thinking that all these variants are a huge load of shit.</p>
<p>However, TPTB know that we think this way and are letting our guard down so they may capitalize on our skepticism by actually releasing something that will seriously affect us in the coming months.</p>
<p>Y'all think that could be possible?</p></p>

        <p>Possible? Sure. But its just an unfounded conspiracy theory. Don't live your life scared. That's what they want. They either will or they want, there isn't anything you can do to prevent a bioterror attack.</p>

        <p>Its hard to imagine that they will release a virus that is ACTUALLY very deadly because of how hard it would be to control the situation if something goes wrong and the virus mutates in unexpected ways. They would be risking a lot given that vaccination rates already show that majority of people buy into the mainstream narrative. It seems like a massive risk that they dont really have to take. Its not like they are on their last legs in terms of control. Outside of the US look at most developed countries, large majorities of people already are following the narrative. Canada/austrailia/uk and most of europe are thoroughly under control already. We have upwards of 80% of people getting vaccinated there. China/russia seem to be in on it as well so I doubt they will do it to spark a war. The reality is that if large swaths of people start dying, in general the government will lose the faith of the people to be able to control the situation and all hell would break loose, with tonnes of rioting and general unrest where they loose their grip on the opinions of the masses. Although possible, I think mostly what were looking at is a way to spur babyboomers from sinking the economy when they all retire in large droves in the coming years by shortening the amount of years they continue to take pensions/aid/healthcare.</p>

        <p>If they were to do that they'd target the unvaccinated in attempt to get rid of us "rebels" that aren't into playing Daddy Government with them. So essentially this all would have been a test to actually, truly vaccinate those that'll follow them like sheep against the release of whatever kills those of us that aren't. </p>
<p>But I don't think it'll go down that way anyhow. I'm not sure how it's going to go down but it'll be much less loud, probably.</p>

        <p>Yes. It's possible the virus mutates to become very deadly... it's possible they release a much more deadly virus... it's possible they don't release any other viruses... and it's possible the current virus mutates to become less deadly.</p>

<p>It's also possible the virus becomes super deadly to the vaccinated, but not the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Zero chance.</p>
<p>They would never risk releasing a globe-spanning pathogen because they too can get infected. The pathogen will inevitably mutate beyond their control. Crichton, King, Mandell and Koontz have shown through their books that respiratory infections - natural or otherwise - are almost impossible to stop. </p>
<p>What will kill people are ADE, liver failure, cytokine storms and possibly interaction of vaxx components with EM frequencies. I've just finished reading a paper about ethylene oxide and how it reacts with certain wavelengths on the EM spectrum. Honestly, "Killer 5G and sub-6G" doesn't sound far-fetched anymore.</p>
