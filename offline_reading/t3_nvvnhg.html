    <strong>Quick graphics- permanent feel</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else feel like at the start of the lockdowns last year that everywhere had mask mandate info, social distancing, and other general covid graphics very quickly and some a seemingly more permanent feel?</p>
<p>It may take a short amount of time to actually make them perhaps but I feel like most companies wouldn’t have their shit together in that short amount of time to actually assemble the graphics that quickly. 
Example: the metro bus has an image of people wearing masks on the outside of it. I know I’ve seen either buses, or light rails or whatever with years old graphics on em like say Super Bowl just as an example. That shit would be on there for years. </p>
<p>Idk</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I actually tried to research large orders of plexiglass barriers, production dates, etc. but internet searches just aren't the same anymore. I couldn't find what I was looking for. I know it was planned before Event 201. No way was that just a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Me too! Its bizarre. &amp; side note, I went to a few stores yesterday and every cashier was literally straining their neck to the side of the plexiglass to chat. I don’t think most cashiers even appreciate the plexiglass. </p>
<p>If they were that worried at this point they would just stay home &amp; collect unemployment</p>

        <p>Haha yeah! Only thing good about this mess was the social distancing on the bus</p>
<p>Like dude why are you sitting next to me theres plenty of other seats </p>
<p>Houston has these park and ride buses in the suburbs that stop at like three stops before downtown and the very last row has five seats all together covered in fabric vs hard plastic and it’s perfect now because if nobody else is coming on the bus I’ll take my mask off and nap til I’m at the last stop since the park and ride doesn’t take many stops!</p>

        <p>Well, usually you have to look for advertisers. If you see an old, say superbowl ad, its likely that the metro hasnt found a replacement yet. Getting it off would cost money, so they leave it on until they find another customer.</p>
<p>With this situation however, governments funded widespread campaigns (and the governments themselves got heavy grants from Worldbank &amp; IMF to implement these things). So, that explains a lot of stuff. For example here in germany, taxi drivers were given money to implement those plexi-glas barriers, thats why many taxis got em quick.</p>
<p>Big Companies were part of pandemic prepardness events. Thats why they could adapt on short notice, especially the 1.200 global players who are part of the WEF. With the lockdown a lot of companies had to stop their usual produce and were more than happy to take on new products.</p>

        <p>I have been traveling in rural areas since the pandemic, just to hike &amp; explore and whatnot…and it weirds me out how, in the middle of nowhere, you will see these nee, expensive looking mask/social distance advertisements. Sometimes stickers, other times billboards, or even those big electronic traffic sign things</p>
