        <p>None of those things you quoted are new information. We know that travel restrictions were an effort to curtail spread and that “what we are trying to do is pause temporarily and give China enough time time to prevent it from becoming global”. What is nefarious here?</p>
<p>We also know that Fauci didn’t recommend masks in February 2020, he said so on TV. He then revised his assessment later that month based on new information. He has been recommending masks consistently since March 2020. What is nefarious here?</p>
<p>This is all normal, Fauci was trying his best to learn about the virus and prevent spread based on the information he had.</p>

        <p>It’s so wild that that is your approximation of the meaning of these revelations. He says once the virus has spread to a certain degree, which he intimates is inevitable, at that point draconian state restrictions on freedom of movement etc. no longer have any plausible efficacy—yet he went along with the entire charade of lockdown culture for over a year. He’s a snake, a liar, a phony, a criminal.</p>

        <p>Again, all of this stuff about Fauci’s mask recommendations has been well known since March of last year. No revelations came from these emails.</p>
<p>“Countless acts of murder through his ineptitude by publicly stating they were pointless”</p>
<p>He stated his best knowledge at the time, then updated the public as soon as possible with new information. I would hope that all public health officials do the same. There were no lies or deception.</p>
<p>By the way, the new information was that covid was primarily spread through water droplets in the air, which could be stopped by masks. Prior to this, Fauci and others were under the impression that covid spread through contact with surfaces that had the virus left on it.</p>
<p>“Why did they bother to continue with [travel restrictions]”</p>
<ol>
<li>It is impossible to keep physical distance in an airplane</li>
<li>Air travel speeds the spread, and as Fauci said “travel restrictions are a temporizing activity”</li>
<li>Each individual country made the decision to enforce travel restrictions, that was not Fauci’s call even in the US (it was Trump’s)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a few questions for you:
- why did health officials from other countries give similar recommendations as Fauci? Was it a global conspiracy?
- why have 600k+ Americans died from covid? Or do you believe the numbers to be a lie?</p>

        <p>His best knowledge at the time was decades of science lol...That does not suddenly change for a virus that is no different in it's transmissibility then any other cold or flu virus. There was no scientific basis for this change in science and still isn't. </p>
<p>AS for your water droplet nonsense, it's not referring to the big balls of snot people cough up, it's a vapor, the same size vapor that comes out of a kettle of steam, go ahead place you mask over it. Then, there's the evaporation of said liquid, at which point the viral load is dispersed into micron size particles that pass through a mask uninhibited. </p>
<p>Then there's the asymptomatic transmission, another point of bullshit. Again the original claim that this does not exist based on decades of science yet again, then suddenly COVID achieves the impossible, but here we are yet again, that this has been disproven.</p>
<p>He clearly states that ONCE it reaches a Global Pandemic situation, travel restriction are useless, so your ridiculous argument still doesn't stand. They attempted to curb it, it failed, so therefore it is now pointless to persist with it.</p>
<p>- How about why did many medical professionals also denounce Fauci's recommendations. Was this a Global conspiracy, that also required censorship to silence them? However, to answer your question, it's simple, people are incompetant butt licking  idiots and will do exactly what they are told or what they think will give them the funding and pat on the back they want.  </p>
<p>- People die, everyday lmao! How about the fact they they openly admit that only about 5% of those who died, exclusively died from COVID, the remaining 95% had an average of 4 comorbities. If they tested every person for the flu / cold who died in previous years, the same way they tested for COVID, and had the same policies tat they invented for this pandemic, almost every single person would have had the Flu / cold listed on their death certs, Of course you would have to know something about PCR testing to understand this.</p>
<p>Answer this question - WHY is every person / community who has rejected the Pandemic doing fine, why aren't they all dead? Again of course you would have to have a basic understanding of statistical probabilities to know how absurd this whole sham is. </p>

        <p>Nope, we aren’t actively at war with China. This is why they were unable to charge those dudes who handed nuclear secrets over to the soviets with treason, because we weren’t officially at war. Super super hard to charge someone with treason in the US.</p>

        <p>That's a trap.</p>
<p>The reason this situation poped up it's because they don't want to let the "pandemic" slip without people believing it that it was dangerous.</p>
<p>That info that the virus was "supposedly" "lab leaked/bioweapon" it's to reinforce the "danger" of the "supposed" virus in the minds of the people:</p>
<p>- to reinforce the belief of the people that the virus was dangerous by implying it was "lab leaked/bioweapon"</p>
<p>- this in turn imply the need for a vaccine</p>
<p>- this in turn imply the need for a vax passport (aleady in motion "brought to you" <strong>by Bill G again - check it</strong> <a href="https://www.GoodHealthPass.org/news/"><strong>https://www.GoodHealthPass.org/news/</strong></a> ).</p>
<p>So there are other moves right here - the news about "bioweapon" fauci link being just a psyop with the intent to reinforce the belief in the virus (like mentioned above).</p>

        <p>From the few I've read, he's said 1) masks don't work and only should be worn by those actively sick, 2) asymptomatic transmission isn't a thing and only people with symptoms can transmit the virus, and 3) he kinda sorta suspected or knew this was an engineered virus and didn't come from bats.</p>
<p>This coupled with the fact that the Wuhan lab was and STILL IS  funded by US money on HIS recommendation, makes me think there's a lot more I haven't yet read, and that there's a lot more still to come out</p>

        <p>...did you read the quote that you just sent me? Fauci is saying only 0.1% of the genome has unusual features, so it would require a very skeptical and detail-oriented individual to have any modicum of evidence that it's been engineered.</p>

        <p>He still acknowledges it has been engineered. Have you even read the emails? He acknowledges masks don’t work and should only be worn by those currently sick, asymptomatic transmission is a myth, and that he knew or suspected the virus was at least partially engineered. </p>
<p>He knew these things and continued to give bs “recommendations” that lead to the lockdown, loss of freedoms, destruction of small businesses, etc. He knew details that he never shared with the public and allowed China to control the confidentiality from the start.</p>

<p>February 21, 2020 he was alerted that the chinese govt was sterilizing its paper mony from Hubei Province and that the virus was possibly released from a lab in Wuhan. Also that it was believed to be complexed with another organism, such as yeast or fungus, to make it more sticky. </p>
<p>He didn’t “backtrack” he knew about this information well before the lockdown was instituted and he actively discredited and went against each of these theories he was presented with.</p>

<p>He has said this from the beginning.... nothing changed.</p>

<p>You claimed that he said it was engineered. Notice YOU backtracking now?</p>
<p>&rt;February 4, 2020 he says most transmissions occur from someone who is symptomatic, not asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Data back then showed that it was. Later data showed the opposite hence the change from "sick people" should wear maskes to "everybody becuase anybody might be sick and not know it".</p>

<p>No he didn't. He said that a very small part looked like it might be unusual. That's not saying that it was engineered.</p>
<p>And also never said that masks don't work. If he said that then he wouldn't have told sick people to wear them. He literally has been publicly saying since the beginning that masks are not to protect you, but to protect others from you if you are a carrier.</p>

        <p>He said a very small part looked to be potentially engineered. Doesn’t matter how much was engineered if it was in any capacity. And his exact wording to Sylvia in the email was “The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.” He goes on to recommend she do not wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Here let me quote your old post:</p>
<p>&rt;He still acknowledges it has been engineered. Have you even read the emails?</p>
<p>You have moved the goalposts from "acknowledges" to "he said potential". You lied in your first post but refuse to address that now.</p>
<p>&rt;Now tell me how it makes sense to mandate something for every person after acknowledging that A. Masks are not effective and B. That they should only be worn by infected persons?</p>
<p>Sure. Becuase a few months later data came out that convinced him that asymptomatic spread was worse than he believed earlier and that WHILE MASKS DONT PROTECT THE WEARER, if the asymptomatic person is wearing one they that could limit the spread.</p>
<p>This isn't rocket science. This is what Fauci has openly said for over a year now....</p>

        <p>This is the whole rorschach thing again. When I read that email I see a team reporting on their efforts to identify the source of the virus. I understand it as their method isn't fit to eliminate the possibility that it was engineered, that there can still be room for it but it's too early to tell.  </p>
<p>This, to me, is the opposite of damning, if anything it shows that they took the allegations seriously.  </p>
<p>This is important to remember when debating this, there can be wildly different conclusions when reading the same source and it's a real problem today.</p>

        <p>I feel like there's a shit ton of people who bought the St. Fauci/Lockdown/Mask up/Experimental Vaccine, lost a year of their lives or more, lost their jobs, lost a LOT... because they trusted him and believed every bullshit line that came out of his mouth, believed every government mandate from local levels to fed, probably even enjoyed the perceived power and moral superiority of being 'A True Believer".</p>
<p>And now they find out it was all lies.  I don't think they can wrap their heads around it and aren't ready to accept they were duped.  It's like people that fall for the Nigerian Prince scammers and don't want anyone to know it happened, or cling to the hope it's true right up until their bank account goes hard into the red... and may still insist it's legit.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it... it's almost like a religion that's cratered when the all hallowed prophet, who scammed people out of their money, land, possessions, and their lives, is proven to be a fraud.</p>

        <p>It's very much 'cult-like' in how they will aggressively defend the leadership figures that have duped them for so long.  I used to wonder how Salem witch trials could happen, or how people could turn on their friends and worse, their family and report them to the Nazis, but here we are.  We were on the cusp of that happening again... all because a lot of people were looking for a cult to fill a void in their lives and they found it in the Branch Covidians.</p>

Gotta cling to the lie - it's easier than taking time to be deeply introspective.</p>

        <p>&rt;  he kinda sorta suspected or knew</p>
<p>He was <em>told</em> outright,  by a colleague.  He then forwarded it to someone in the NIH and never followed up.  He knew.  He took steps to avoid being implicated.  Peter Daszak knew,  he took steps to cover it up.</p>
<p>They both agreed that they should continue to work separately to help create a false narrative that lab leak wasn't possible.</p>
<p>From my view,  he didn't "kinda sorta" anything.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they found in late march last year that no bats were even sold at the wet market, but accross the street was the top bat coronavirus research center on the planet. It was painfully obvious it was a lab leak either intentional or not, and Fauci was praised for lying about it by Dr Yi Bat lady.</p>
