    <strong>The Criminalisation of Normal Behaviors: Eating in Public</strong>
    <p><p>I've worked two jobs all throughout this pandemic and often I have to grab food on the go in order to keep up with my schedule. And I'm always treated like some criminal for eating whatever my lunch is on a bus or train. </p>
<p>As usual today I'm on my way to work and I quickly stopped to pick up something to eat. I then proceeded to my bus and the bus driver held his hand out (like he was blocking me from entering the bus)to tell me to put up my mask and that there's no eating on the bus masks up, ect ect. </p>
<p>I acted like I listened to him and then as soon as I got to my seat I just continued eating and minding my own business. I could tell he wanted to make an issue of it because he kept saying over the speaker, "No eating on the bus." "Masks up."</p>
<p>But I kept on because there wasn't shit he could do anyway. I paid my fare. I'm socially distanced and I'm sitting quietly. I don't even think anyone else on the bus gave a shit or even noticed because they were all in their cellphones or had headphones on. We were on the freeway as well(this was an express bus) so he couldn't do that stupid bullshit where they stop the bus to chastise the passenger that isn't following the mask rules.</p>
<p>So after awhile he stopped, probably because he had to actually focus on DOING HIS JOB which was ensuring the safety of the passengers to their destination and pay attention to what's happening on the road and not what his passengers are doing  and I (and everyone else presumably) enjoyed a peaceful ride to my destination. </p>
<p>I don't want to antagonize anyone but I'm not going to be ordered about by some public servant (or any random person)who sits on his ass eight hours a day to earn a living on the public's dime.</p>
<p>This has happened in Ubers/Lyfts as well although usually when I'm taking one of those it's in the morning because I'm running late so I'm usually just sipping on coffee or tea. I've gotten a few "safety violations" that I just completely ignore because you're a driver just STFU and drive whatever the vehicle is. </p>
<p>With people commuting such far distances, ( especially when restaurants were closed) I don't get why people don't
understand that sometimes people don't have any other time or place to eat but on the bus/train/taxi. They just want to feel self important and I LITERALLY don't have time for that. </p>
<p>I know people are going to say drive yourself but due to the incredibly jacked up taxes and insurance rates: the average working class person in NYC can't afford to own a car and I'm still paying the the MTA whether I use it or not. I'm seriously looking to buy a car within the next two years tho. Especially if these dumb mask mandates continue.</p></p>
