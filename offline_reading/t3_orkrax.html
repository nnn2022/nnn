    <strong>Quote: "Totalitarianism demands the continuous alteration of the past" - Orwell, 1946</strong>
    <p><p>In other words: live worry-free with short memory~~ (ain't got no need to remember what politicians said or media reported in early 2020)</p>
<p>I find his essays are a gold mine as in a time capsule from the past, how little changed.</p>
<p>&rt; [...] A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures. This kind of thing happens everywhere, but is clearly likelier to lead to outright falsification in societies where only one opinion is permissible at any given moment. <strong>Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past</strong>, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth. The friends of totalitarianism in this country usually tend to argue that since absolute truth is not attainable, a big lie is no worse than a little lie. It is pointed out that all historical records are biased and inaccurate, or on the other hand, that modern physics has proven that what seems to us the real world is an illusion, so that to believe in the evidence of one's senses is simply vulgar philistinism.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>A totalitarian society</strong> which succeeded in perpetuating itself would probably <strong>set up a schizophrenic system of thought</strong>, in which the laws of <strong>common sense held good in everyday life</strong> and in certain exact sciences, <strong>but could be disregarded by the politician</strong>, the historian, and the sociologist. Already there are countless people who would think it scandalous to falsify a scientific textbook, but would see nothing wrong in falsifying an historical fact. [...]</p>

<p>In case you wondered, Nineteen Eighty-Four was in the works when this was published.</p></p>
