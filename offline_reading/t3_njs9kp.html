    <strong>If this is a plandemic, it's pure genius to inject the script into pop culture in advance.</strong>
    <p><p>In the movie Contagion exactly same happened as now. Vaccine was the cure, WHO was the hero, and internet conspiracy theorists and nonsense medicine were the antagonists. Virus origins was zoonotic multi-species jump.</p>
<p>What happened now in real world, isn't odd or unlikely at all, since it has been though-of before. People have internalized the key concepts and were expecting them prepared for it. And those that suspect it all planned, are just loonies who have seen one too many movie.</p>
<p>So many officials are working little bit too hard solely for the vaccine solution, while barring other existing, safe, treatments, that it all starts to smell a bit like a conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Predictive programing is exactly what it is. Hollywood being a branch of the elite establishment means they play a vital role when it comes to influencing public perception. As we usually associate entertainment with escapism, our minds are primed for emotional investment in the story that the creators are instructed to fill with propaganda. The slew of apocalyptic and dystopian entertainment of the last several decades has been a major contributor to the public response and media reporting. </p>
<p>These movies and shows present us with a severely heightened version of how these scenarios could play out. However, the trick of the trade is to infer that the portrayal doesn’t eliminate the potential for devastation that we, the viewer are not privy to. Leaving portions of the reality and portions of the fiction up to speculation makes the intended message all the more malleable. Notice how they rarely give us insight into the full scope of the ground zero days (aside from <em>Contagion</em> which you mentioned).</p>
<p>Hollywood especially has driven the narrative that critical thought and analysis = deranged conspiracy theory. Any mention of this term to describe an individual is spoken by the actors with utter contempt and ridicule. They think they’re so clever with their not so subtle implications that the herd mentality saves all.</p>
<p>Dystopian fiction is moulded by the present, never forget this. There’s no clairvoyance required, just lateral observations that lead to logical predictions.</p>

        <p>Will Smith already warned us for current vaccines in "I am legend". The problem being that after all this covid propaganda, mediated mass manipulation and governmental control, it has become impossible to  separate fact from fiction, as fiction partly becomes factual. At this stage, we're all pushed toward paranoia.</p>

        <p>What was even more genius is how they downplayed it in the beginning, which made the people who don't trust the government actually think it was serious and they were hiding the severity. Having all those "leaked" videos from China while downplaying it everywhere else. Telling people to go party in Chinatown. It was reverse psychology, and I hate to admit it, it worked on me........at first.</p>

        <p>A couple of relevant links, for anyone who thinks this stuff is "conspiracy theory:</p>
<p><strong>Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert - Parker Crutchfield</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/</a></p>
<p><strong>National Security Study Memorandum NSSM 200</strong> (Henry Kissinger 1975, declassified in 1989) related to World Population Plan of Action (covert education of public on benefits of not having children, temporary sterility injections, etc.)</p>
<p><a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf">https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a></p>
<p>I'm sure even Parker Crutchfield doesn't believe the views he advocates (who would?!) but his role is to arm politicians with the intellectual and moral justification for what Big Pharma (and depopulationists) want to accomplish.</p>
<p>I find these links particularly useful in conversation because it's hard for someone to call you a "conspiracy theorist" when you can point to our governments own documentation advocating for such things.</p>
