        <p>i can get the "killing" but how in the fuck can they say the vaccine saves anyone? </p>
<p>you know, since most (99.xx%) are fine without it.</p>

        <p>The methodology is in the paper. Essentially they pulled the NNTV (number needed to vaccinate) from another large Israeli study that calculated the number of vaccines required to prevent a case, and to prevent a death.</p>
<p>The NNTV to prevent a case was measured to be in the range of 200-700 and a death between 9000-50000, most likely 16000.</p>
<p>If you take that 16000 figure and use it to look at the impact of the approximately 150M people fully vaccinated in the US, we see that we saved about 9400 lives. </p>
<p>That alone is incredible. Being that we were losing that many people every two days for a while, that should be evidence that we had reached herd immunity in the US before vaccination even began. That, or possibly we'd become better at shielding vulnerable people, or were running out of vulnerable people. </p>
<p>Ignoring that point though, they then look at adverse reaction reports, and find approximately 4 deaths/100000 vaccinations and another 16 serious side effects.</p>
<p>Adverse reaction reports are of course self-reported, so determining the actual association is tricky, and frankly political. There are likely to be some deaths and reactions there that vaccination was not causal for, but there are also certainly deaths and reactions that aren't accounted for in these self-reports.</p>
<p>Their findings would mean that approximately 6200 lives were lost to save those 9400 lives, which lines up with their 2:3 figure. The part that I did not see them mention is that so many of those 6200 lives are from people not in Covid risk categories, so the actual years of lives lost are likely much higher as a result of vaccination than they would be with zero vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>Now, extrapolating that to make a zero-vaccine argument is a mistake as well. All along, the smartest way to handle this likely would have been to get vaccines to the vulnerable populations that are at substantial risk from Covid, and not encourage healthy people to get a vaccine that provides very little benefit and is potentially a net negative.</p>

        <p>Because studies like this don't get published if they tell the truth, and the scientists involved are expelled from being able to do further research. Clearly it's nonsensical to put a number on lives saved by vaccines since in most (nearly all) cases the innate immune system is far more effective than drugs at fighting viruses.</p>

        <p>Being impartial, I'd imagine the serious symptoms some get from sars-cov-2 do benefit from the vaccine, and so live where they normally wouldn't have. (That 0.02% isn't a zero)</p>
<p>Then on the other extreme there's those that die from the vaccine.</p>
<p>These numbers when accurate and analysed together must come to the 2/3 the headline mentions.</p>
<p>-- My comment's centred on the question, and not the accuracy of the posts paper.</p>

        <p>I pose this question as a "conversation springboard" not because I think one opinion is right and the other opinion is wrong. </p>
<p>A doctor has 5 patients. They all need an organ transplant or they will die. Two need new kidneys. Two need a new lung. One needs a heart. The doctor is confident. If he can source the organs immediately, all 5 will live. A patient arrives with a minor ailment. The blood type matches, their organs are perfect matches.</p>
<p>Is it ethical for the doctor to kill this one patient, harvest their organs so the other 5 may live?</p>
<p>Most people say "no"</p>
<p>but why do they say no?</p>

        <p>Let us remember that those who die with Covid are often old and/or have few comorbidities. Those that die of the jab are young, healthy and are at negligible risk from the virus. If you look at life-years saved, jab will be in huge negative territory.</p>

        <p>The COVID median death age is something like 81. I'm inclined to think that the median age of people who die of the jab is something like 65-70. Younger than the typical COVID death, but still well above the median age for a person. COVID is more extreme than most, but pretty much all causes of death disproportionately affect older people.</p>

        <p>Not really, this assumed a net life saved count to be positive. The vaccines being forced onto younger people who gets life threatening side effects and death from the jab but would have survived Covid anyways is more like plain mass murder, many young lives killed and none saved.</p>

        <p>Honestly this just seems like BS, I know at the moment 30+ people that are vaccinated and have not even heard of one of them having a side effect aside from a sore arm. I’m not getting vaxxed because I am not at risk of covid and why risking having a deadly reaction to the vaccine but I’m just not seeing the death and destruction that people say this vaccine is having. I’m not hoping on harm for anyone but does anyone else here have experience with friends or family having detrimental side effects or death? Thanks for anyone’s answers, cheers</p>

        <p>I don't know anyone who died but I personally know one woman who had 104 degree fever, lymph node pain, severe body pain, for about 4 days after shot 2. She still doesn't feel quite right after 3 months. She's 31 and relatively healthy (not obese, no comorbidities). Another friend (40F) still has swollen, painful lymph glands 3 months after the second shot. And a coworker (42M) had covid last fall and it was pretty rough and laid him up for 3-4 days but he came out of it fine. He got the second shot and he said his side effects were worse than covid, and it fucked him up for almost a week.</p>

        <p>The death rate of covid in th US is 1.8%. The deathrate of the vaccine is 0.0017%. ppl get the vaccine to A. decrease chances of death by 1000x and B. so it doesnt spread even more or mutate so we dont have to keep having lockdown/distancing policies in place.</p>
<p>You guys are against a new normal which i dont want either. Which is why im vaxxed. But by not doing anything to prevent the spread of it (like getting vaxxed or following guidelines) it just prolongs these restrictions. Seems like you guys actually want this to be a new normal.</p>

        <p>Everybody has the right not to take the vaccine. Yet over half the US has. Lets imagine a circumstance where everyone was like you and no one got the vaccine because they have the right to choose not to. The virus would spread and mutate uninterrupted by vaccines, restrictions would be more strict, there would be a lot more deaths, and you people would still spout some bs like "Ah dont have ta listen to the govt these are ma rights! Ah can do whatever ah want!" *dies from covid*</p>
