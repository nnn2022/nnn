    <strong>Starting the propaganda against unvaxxed</strong>
    <p><p>One reason I am not rejoining society yet, or going to groups, is I don't want blamed when the vaxx shit hits the fan. I am going to stores still but around here thats with masks still. You do you but I have messed up lungs.  Personally however, I think it's a bad idea to hang out with anyone. I would go hang out with unvaxxed people now who see through this crap but there aren't any. This is a time where my lack of close local friends/and or family has become a place of incredible pain. I am glad I have my husband.</p>
<p>Remember how many people warned the plan is for a new variant to be blamed as people drop dead from the vaxx? I believe they could be dying from regular flus and colds because their immune systems are toast as well as from the vaxx itself. I don't want fingers pointed at me. I don't have local friends so this is all formal groups. </p>
<p>One group they did not ban the unvaxxed but just wrote today the board decided that the unvaxxed are to wear masks in the building or at meetings in person. Talk about like having to single yourself out. I know some may make decision to lie, but I made mistake of telling two people I am not getting it, and it's too risky. One I was trying to warn because of side effects but they are fully indoctrinated. Do you think I want 30 people knowing of my unvaxxed status?</p>
<p>If someone gets sick and they find out my unvaxxed status, I don't want outed and blamed as a scapegoat. That worries me how now the unvaxxed are singled out. I mean people who got the vaxx can still spread it right? So I am so confused. I can see this coming you know. They are basically calling us germ factories even when we have no symptoms. </p>
<p>Society is going to be at each other's throat even more.</p>

        <p>When the shit hits the fan, there will be mass congnitive bias. They will never blame the people that pushed it, they will blame someone else. </p>
<p>If you're fit and not in a risk group. Wait and watch. Shit show is coming.</p>

        <p>I think it largely depends on where you live. 
Some governments are very capable of ruining your shit.</p>
<p>History repeats itself every 80 years and it's in its 20 year "crisis" cycle. 2008-2028. 
Just hold tight, lay low and grab the popcorn. 
It'll get better and in the future, generations will be saying WTF.</p>

        <p>I probably am near the end run anyhow, older disabled, lived far longer than they thought I would. I hope things get better for the young. It's a hellbound Fourth Turning, probably will be another war coming soon too. Some Christians believe it is the end. I think history is cyclical, but we are definitely in a major turn downward.</p>

        <p>Sorry but you’re gonna have to have bigger balls than that if this world is to change for better. Don’t mean to be harsh but you have to be the change you want to see in others. I’ve been singled out and ostracized by family and friends for months, I don’t wear masks and I do as I please, law enforcement trouble or not. And now some family has come round and we’re stronger because of it. This isn’t to pay myself on the back, but just to say, change won’t start until you start it. Be brave, be bold, and don’t be afraid of these losers they’re pathetic and cower at the first challenge.</p>
