    <strong>Doctor and vaccine discussion: I still don't want it.</strong>
    <p><p>Doctor went from, "I understand whatever choice you make given your complicated health history" to promoting the vaccine. "You are high risk and if you got Covid you very well could die of it." In my case I am high risk. I told him point blank that I think I would die of the vaccine [I have had anaphylatic shock multiple times], and my immune system needs to keep me alive from another problem. He talked to me about mRNA saying it is harmless and goes away. I told him I went and saw people talking about side effects online and they were all bad. He told me I need to be more careful of "misinformation" and "conspiracy" online. I told him I had gone to look at scientific websites and others and one pharm company called it an "operating system". He also kept telling me we would have Benadryl and epipens available to you, but I know the real game on allergic reactions, former bouts of anaphylatic shock and severe asthma are one reason my lungs are so screwed. </p>
<p>I know he got the vacc so didn't go too far. I can't switch doctors, it's complicated. I like the guy and understand he probably has had patients die of Covid [believe him] and probably did recently given this discussion. I do think Covid is real in my case and people have died of it. I think it is being used. All the pressure I am getting to get the vaccine is kind of freaking me out, and it's not just him but other circles. Close friends who even have gotten the vaccine, say they understand with my severe intense health problems why I am saying no. I burst out into tears later that day, going outside into one small store wondering if I caught it from all the stress. I can't enjoy anything anymore. </p>
<p>I feel like I am signing up for death if I get the vaccine, but I am going to die of catching Covid eventually here because my luck will run out, and I AM high risk [very bad lungs etc]. I can't believe my life has been destroyed this way. Staying alive just from the normal problems is running a gauntlet. I feel like I live in hell NOW.</p>
<p>This all sucks. I feel like I am going to have a nervous breakdown. Liberal friends are understanding of health but think anything questioning the narrative is "conspiracy".</p></p>

        <p>Also remember although big pharma's Scientists have discredited its use , there are multiple doctors that have backed hydroxychloriquine WITH Zinc and also ivermectin, they have seen their patients recover, and thats alot more believable then injecting someone with a chemical and putting them in a trial to see if they catch covid, this is literally all they have to go by, versus the patients who are recovering as soon as 12 hours with the use of hydroxychloriquine WITH Zinc in this case with the patients recovering, correlation definitely means the medicine was the cause of the recovery, unlike the people who may or may not have caught it in a randomized trial its hard to say the vaccine was effective, especially given the virus is not spreading nearly as bad as they are making it seem, the trial was a bunch of bologna, nonetheless dnt lose hope i've read plenty of comments of people saying they have family with cancer and other illnesses that have survived covid, i wish you the best!!!</p>

        <p>mRNA 'goes away' LOL.  I dont know your medical problems, but Covid, like flus etc, seems to kill some people over others for no obvious reason. I've seen a few people who had lung damage or other issues be exposed and be very much ok. So many people with all the comorbidities get it and still survive and even are asymptomatic, there has to be other factors at play. From what I have seen there really is not an overall risk much greater than the flus that we have been living with for years, and now that it has been circulating for a year there should be enough immunity built up in society that you will somewhat protected by that (if you havent unknowingly been exposed already).</p>

        <p>I know a 40 year old man who has cystic fibrosis, he should have been dead from that years ago. He got COVID, had mild cold type symptoms for a week, and got over it and is back to living his life. I wouldn't worry too much about it.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear it. I figure it's a gamble either way. Doctor probably did have some people die impacting his view. I figure my chances are so bad with vaccine, the day I get it, we are looking at a 50 50 chance of death from what I believe my allergies will do anyhow.</p>

        <p>I'm not. Spiritually I have issues with an "operating system" being applied to my body too. The nanoparticles alone could take residence and do bad shit to me. I have suffered enough medically, I refuse to sign up for more.  I know 7 people who got Covid and survived without the hospital. Even if my ancedotal experiences has 1 out of 8 die or almost die, who catch Covid [the numbers I know] that's better odds then the vaccine.</p>

        <p>It's your call to make. Personally I wouldn't get that shit at all and take my chances, it's pretty much literal poison in my eyes and I believe the evidence speaks for itself. Mind you that there are already effective treatments available should you contract covid. Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, and Monoclonal Antibodies have all been shown to rapidly and effectively treat this disease to make it a non-death sentence to high risk individuals.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you do contract covid though and it does kill you, hey at least you won't be having to deal with this dystopian hell on earth anymore 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>I see it as poison too. I am upset my doctor took it himself and didn't investigate things. I have Planequil [prescribed for another disorder] and will look at getting some Ivermectin and zinc. I hope I could get some antibodies too. It's true, if Covid did kill me, I would be done with this dystopia and horrible world. I have fought to stay here for sake of my husband. This world sucks. I had a hard life before all this happened, not the worse on earth, I have a good apt and running car---been far poorer than this, but yeah, this life sucks and I don't see things getting better. Being disabled in dystopia blows chunks, and being old as things go to hell, double more.</p>

        <p>Any time you see any health advice that includes the phrase "flush the toxins out" you can disregard it.</p>
<p>Not that eating healthy doesn't help, it most certainly does, but there is nothing you can eat or drink that will 'flush the toxins' from your body.</p>
