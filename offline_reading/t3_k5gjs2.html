        <p>Look up Agenda 2030.  Also for those following in their Bible not being able to buy or sell without a mark and depopulation is right there for all to read.   There will be 3.5 years of peace or unity and then all hell breaks loose</p>

        <p>Sounds plausable.</p>
<p>One thing I will say is to bring about The Great Reset they need complete chaos and have our way of life and foundations completely demolished. This year was just a test run and a start of the process of collapsing many countries. They need something bigger to finish the job.</p>

        <p>When listening to <a href="https://odysee.com/@ComputingForever:9/dolores-cahill-speech-at-irish-freedom-rally:9">professor Cahill's speech during the Dublin Freedom rally</a>, my attention was drawn to the following statements :</p>
<p>&rt;You know, they are calling it a Dark Winter. And if I were you, I would stock in food... because the plan is to have a bomb in Rotterdam that will cut the food supply. Their plan is to cut electricity and the Internet and the ATM machines... and to put in martial law; that's to say you can't actually leave your house and cut off the electricity. But once you know the plan, it's not so scary.</p>
<p>I can't say I agree that being cut off from food, electricity AND the Internet isn't scary... but anyway..</p>
<p>Shortly after that, she said this :</p>
<p>&rt;The other pandemics they have coming, is around the plague... which is botulism... and wypestis... and maybe ebola</p>

        <p>Sustainability.</p>
<p>The global population is beyond what the planet can sustain on a long term basis.</p>
<p>Also, as more and more jobs are automated, they need less and less of us to do the acual work for them.</p>
<p>So they want to get rid of "unnecessary" people, as to be able to enslave the planet for centuries without completely draining its resources!</p>

        <p>Well, considering we’ve lived in a “peaceful time” for quite some time is nice...but also alarming, as humans naturally feel the desire to conquer and have power over others.</p>
<p>There are powerful groups of individuals right now how who have admitted to plotting out a plan to reshape governments all over the world. Kind of interesting. </p>
<p>If you look at this situation given prior knowledge of history, you can say it looks there’s a legitimate reason for a ‘red scare’, and too many things point to similar propaganda techniques used by the nazis (from the media). </p>
<p>If no one watched the media, it would be a normal world.</p>

        <p>So you always have to unpack these ideas a bit, right?</p>
<p>Ok .. lets say it goes how that says.  Riots. Revolution. "Liberty".  </p>
<p>"We win"</p>
<p>Ok .. at that point there would be a big fucking reckoning of what had just happened and why a weak virus had been misrepresented. Things would not be pretty. Lots of anger.</p>
<p>So in that climate, the Elites would suddenly disappear and a much deadlier virus would come out and basically kill 1 in 3 people?</p>
<p>And there would probably be lots of people talking about just what the fuck was going on.  And "Hey have you noticed that we havent heard from any of the rich people for a while?"</p>
<p>I would think that would be a <em>very</em> unfriendly population to rule over afterwards. Right?  "Well <em>hello</em> again you naughty people.  See? We told you something like that was going to happen."</p>
<p>What about the "New World Army"?  Would it's soldiers also have been able to bring all their friends and families underground as well? Or would they have lost half of their loved ones as well?</p>
<p>It's just hard to imagine it when you start zooming in.</p>
