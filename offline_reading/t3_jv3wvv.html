    <strong>Whitmer looks to shut down Michigan again</strong>
    <p><p>Source is here: <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/15/gov-whitmer-expected-announce-new-covid-19-restrictions-sunday/6304308002/">https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/15/gov-whitmer-expected-announce-new-covid-19-restrictions-sunday/6304308002/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How much is Whitmer going to be able to enforce this, given the battle she lost with the courts?  Will small businesses, restaurants, firms, schools, gyms, in particular private schools, find ways to get around this; will they be able and willing to make gatherings work without being hammered for it?  I had thought that tons of Michiganders have the same independent spirit found in the South, Texas and Florida and aren't the type to be easily cowed and swayed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is how the MI reddit is reacting: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/juv17x/michigan_to_close_high_schools_colleges_bars_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/juv17x/michigan_to_close_high_schools_colleges_bars_for/</a>  They responding by protesting that Whitmer needs to go further and force all schools closed, complained that gyms need to be closed, insisted it was GOP rejection of mask mandates and encouraged anonymous reporting of offices staying open.  Is this the mainstream MI view or just that of a loud, vocal Karen minority in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint and other regions?</p></p>

        <p>I’m from Grand Rapids. I don’t think I’ve met anyone outside of online who actually likes her or supports any of this shit... Mostly cause the people who go out are like us and don’t give a fuck and just want to live our lives. Which tbh is kind of nice I can speak freely about stuff without worrying about some jackass whining about Covid.</p>
<p>The Michigan subreddit is a terrible representation of actual Michigan. GR has its weenies as does Detroit. But they’re the typical basement dwellers who’ve been hiding the entire time and just bitch on Reddit. </p>
<p>Whitler found the loophole of having the health dept able to make mandates for restaurants and stuff and that’s how she’s controlling this now... Honestly it’s kind of scary that she’s going this fuckin far to hold onto power. Anyone who’s this desperate to hold onto power even when she’s had it revoked is dangerous.</p>

        <p>Do you think the resident of MI will be able to band together to support their businesses, including supporting them through social donations instead of conventional patronage if needed, or rise up in large enough numbers as needed, as is being done in St Louis, so as to render the laws toothless?  As it is they're already weaker than before; gyms and individual training are allowed, more businesses are open and so on.  Could they be able to come up with <em>something</em> so that she doesn't turn it into an African dictatorship on a whim and because she can't get over high school and/or junior high?</p>

        <p>For the most part the communities have been good about supporting business through takeout and the likes. It seems they’re still allowed to do outdoor dining as well so a lot of places are setting up heat lamps and those igloos. But a lot of people at genuinely are pissed about it this time. </p>
<p>I feel if she oversteps again and tries the “We’re gonna extend it another week” type crap she did before then people will tell her to fuck off</p>

        <p>Thanks, that's what I've figured.  MI in spite of its incels, wannabe anarchists and Karens who live online, and who've helped ensure Detroit remains unliveable, also has its communities of what could be called Northern Southerners, those who live in the Northern half of the country but have the mindset of a rural Texan, Georgian or Alabaman.  And thinking you can push them around and just make them do what they're dictated to indefinitely would eventually have the same effect as doing it in those states.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court literally ruled against her and made all her orders invalid. The only people still complying are doing so out of ignorance and fear. The AG literally went on record saying she would no longer be prosecuting any Covid-related crimes. The health department does not have greater authority than the AG. Period.</p>
