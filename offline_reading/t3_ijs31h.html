        <p>So, decades of studies said masks weren't helpful to the general public, and a couple of biased circumstantial studies undermined all that.</p>
<p>We were fed lies and cognitive dissonance and told to listen to what they say now, but not what they said in the past consistently, and that the weak evidence is strong evidence.</p>
<p>BUT wearing masks makes people FEEL safe. If that's the case then people need to buy my magic anti-demon rock. Otherwise, I will not be enabling people's medieval superstitions.</p>

        <p>The thing that 'swayed' the CDC was, supposedly, that story about the two fucking hairdressers who didn't give anyone their disease... of the people who consented to be tested. </p>
<p>Seriously. That's why we're in masks: a fucking anecdote. Apparently, though, Japan and South Korea both VASTLY having greater flu deaths and pneumonia doesn't matter for some reason.</p>

        <p>Lol. Did you not catch the Korean Starbucks anecdote on Fox? I had someone try and present that as conclusive evidence that masks work the other day - they could not conceive of any other explanation for the findings.</p>

        <p>My friend who is a doctor always trots that anecdote out anytime someone questions masks. I've always wondered about the methodology of that "study." Did they test everyone? Can we do a control with customers unmasked and the hairdressers masked and then one with no one wearing masks. How many people wouldnt have gotten it anyway?</p>

        <p>This is what pisses me off so much. Every single year we've probably had 5 million deaths from transmissible diseases. [Pneumonia] (https://ourworldindata.org/pneumonia) alone kills 800k kids a year. KIDS. If the solution to saving a million kids per year was to put a piece of cloth in front of your mouth and those fucking "experts" did not know or did not tell us then they should be dragged in front a court for crimes against humanity or be defunded entirely.       This is like Fauci having the cure for cancer sitting in his basement for decades but refusing to share it with us because he thought time hasn't come yet.</p>

        <p>No shit lady.  We’ve known for decades that masks don’t do a damn thing to stop viral spread.  Look at graphs of cases from all over the world and there is nothing in them that suggests mask mandates do anything.  Mask mandates are based on nothing but superstition.</p>

        <p>just for precision's sake:</p>
<p>face- /surgical masks don't do anything to stop the spread of virus based infections.</p>
<p>certain expensive full face masks might work like a P3 full face mask.</p>
<p>and for n95 masks, i don't know the data, but we know, that  face- /surgical masks, that the criminal mandates are pushing don't work at all:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/">Figure 2</a>). </p>
<p>i feel, that precision on what type of mask is important, as it helps to point out the insanity and unscientific bullshit, that the freedom robbing mandates are.</p>

        <p>Thanks for adding to my point.  Yes there are masks that can stop the spread when used correctly in a controlled environment.  The type of mask and the way they are used because of mandates is another story.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yes there are masks that can stop the spread when used correctly in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>i didn't want to state that, that is why i wrote "might", rather than does.<br>
i wonder if there are some p3 mask use vs no mask studies out there for viruses.<br>
i try to throw all assumptions, that might come up away and look only at what i can actually prove, if possible.<br>
the same way, that we both might assume, that a p3 mask prevents virus based infection spread, so will lots of people assume, that surgical masks prevent infections, because it sounds plausible on some level, but they don't of course.<br>
and we need to get away from all of the "everyone knows" type of stuff and get people away from it too, because that is one of our biggest enemies.  </p>
<p>just imagine a beautiful world, where WHO, CDC and government propaganda doesn't work, because people don't assume anything they say or write as truths :)<br>
we gotta get the people there, to not live in fear and blind trust of authority, because the research, reflection and realizations come easy, once the propaganda stops working and we can get them away from it.</p>

<p>I know we have decades of prior studies showing that general masking of the population is unhelpful. What changed all of a sudden? How did we throw away all those studies and suddenly every healthy person now has to wear masks.</p>

        <p>A big reason mask mandates have spread like fire since June is because of an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435.short">influential argument based on the precautionary principle</a>: basically the authors admitted that the evidence for masks is shitty, but they said "better safe than sorry" and let's mandate them since there's nothing to lose and everything to gain even from some possibly modest efficacy (all shitty assumptions, as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2020.1797997">others have argued</a>).</p>
