    <strong>Falsely accusing someone of having a "loathsome disease" is slander</strong>
    <p><p><strong>slander</strong></p>
<p>n. oral defamation, in which someone tells one or more persons an untruth about another which untruth will harm the reputation of the person defamed. Slander is a civil wrong (tort) and can be the basis for a lawsuit. Damages (payoff for worth) for slander may be limited to actual (special) damages unless there is malicious intent, since such damages are usually difficult to specify and harder to prove. </p>
<p>Some statements such as an untrue accusation of having committed a crime, <strong>having a loathsome disease</strong>, or being unable to perform one's occupation are treated as slander per se since the harm and malice are obvious, and therefore usually result in general and even punitive damage recovery by the person harmed. </p>
<p>Words spoken over the air on television or radio are treated as libel (written defamation) and not slander on the theory that broadcasting reaches a large audience as much if not more than printed publications. (See: defamation, fair comment)</p>

        <p>That makes perfect sense especially as there is usually no proof that said person has a loathsome disease. Unfortunately the agenda is sick until proven healthy which in context is essentially guilty until proven innocent. I see it as slander unless there is real proof.</p>

        <p>Saying an unvaccinated person is spreading Covid without a medical diagnosis is like saying all gay people are spreading AIDS as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Being gripped by hysteria and media fear is no excuse for either.</p>
<p>If they try to use the "We're in a pandemic" line. Remind them we are still in an HIV pandemic according to the WHO themselves since the 1980's and they are bigots for judging someone else's "lifestyle choice".</p>

        <p>Great comparisons. Not only do they explain simpler, they throw the SJW garbage back at them.</p>
<p>The people who got the jab, got it to lessen the symptoms when they get covid. So I don't understand why they cant stay in their lane. I don't agree with their decision but I don't feel the need to go on the offense and start slandering them.</p>

        <p>Attorney Robert Barnes was saying that ADA does cover people who might not be disabled but people perceive them to be. He gave the example of people who travel to places where there's malaria but, you're right, it would cover people assumed to have HIV/AIDS. And it would cover anyone considered to be a covid super-spreader, disease-ridden, and all the other nasty epithets I've been hearing, when all they are is unvaccinated.</p>
