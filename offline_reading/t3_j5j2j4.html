    <strong>I need help. My province is set to introduce new rules concerning schools</strong>
    <p><p>Masks are going to be mandatory for grade 4 and up in schoolyards. </p>
<p>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-government-to-make-announcement-on-schools-sports-1.5750335</p>
<p>I’m not sure what I can do. I’m thinking of writing to the school, school board and my MP. But I have never done that before and I’m not sure what to include so that they don’t outright dismiss me as a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>I’m no expert, but my understanding is that the effectiveness of masks has not been conclusively proved. There are studies on both sides? Is this true? Can someone please provide references?</p>
<p>Am I wrong to think that children would be better off enjoying some fresh air rather than wearing a mask outside? Mind you, they are still allowed to not wear a mask once inside the classroom (although that could change too). So, is it healthier to breath recirculated air with no mask?</p>
<p>I’m already concerned about a weakened immune system due to lockdowns (lack of contacts with others) and over disinfection that’s going on. I’m concerned that children do not have the discipline to wear masks properly, not play with them and take put them on or take them off correctly, or keeping them clean all day. I’m not so much concerned about the virus as the risk to children is minimal. But I am concerned about them getting other pathogens in the masks (inside the mask when handling it) and then putting the masks on their faces. </p>
<p>Also, the rule in the province is children under 12 don’t have to wear a mask when indoors (for example in the mall or grocery store). So, I also don’t understand why there are different age criteria for schools (4th grade an up). And prior to this, it was 5th grade an up in school’s indoor common areas (but not inside a class).</p>
<p>I’m posting here, not to get sympathy and agreement, but to receive constructive criticism of my views. Is my thinking faulty? Is there anything I’m missing? If I write a letter with these points, what will the answer be? I want to make sure I know what the other side is thinking so that I can address the counterpoints, if I can.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>We are considering pulling them out of school. I know that’s not an option for everyone, but we work from home. That will have its own challenges. Not to mention they will be isolated even more with no interactions with other children. It’s a lose-lose situation. I’ve been sitting quiet on the sidelines thinking “it’s just one more week, just one more month. They’re going to realize this is not sustainable, they’re looking for a way to save face, ... “ But they just keep digging in their heels. 
I’m so fucking exhausted. And the scary part is, I think that’s what they want. Everyone to just give up and go along with the new normal. 
I need some good news ... soon</p>

        <p>You’ve got this Mom/Dad.  Don’t worry too much about them needing school for their immune system.  As long as they are going outside, being exposed to grass and dirt and animals their immune system isn’t sleeping if you keep them home.  Do what your gut tells you is right.  Your gut always knows. Trust in yourself.  🙌</p>

        <p>Exactly ... how idiotic is that? Of course, if you point that out, they’ll probably make those mandatory as well. 
Unfortunately, I think for every parent that is concerned about forced masking in the playground, there are 1,000 parents advocating for masking in the classroom.</p>

        <p>My one “NNN thinking”friend simply kept his kid out of school because he felt so strongly about his kid being free and not wearing a mask at 5 years old (Alberta).  That’s your option.  If you want to participate in government run non-private schools, you have to comply with their rules.  Once the vaccine comes it will be the same thing with that.  You won’t have to vaccinate your child, but if you want your child to attend a public school you will have to vaccinate.   People who don’t agree with government rules or government curriculums have been home schooling for decades.  They are very organized and they meet up for physical activities and socialization.   Quebec is in a steep upwards trajectory of infection right now.  Hopefully they can maintain healthcare for all the non covid related things that people need interventions for.  In Calgary all the cardiac specialists are quarantined so you are screwed if you need immediate surgery right now because covid got into the cardiac ward at the main cardiac surgery hospital. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with keeping your kids home an extra 2 weeks to see what happens with the schools.</p>
