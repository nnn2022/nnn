        <p>Denialism is more than just another manifestation of the humdrum intricacies of our deceptions and self-deceptions. It represents the transformation of the everyday practice of denial into a whole new way of seeing the world and – most important – a collective accomplishment. Denial hides from the truth, DENIALISM BUILDS A NEW AND BETTER TRUTH…</p>

        <p>The biological human need for safety tbh. It is way easier for a person to accept that some people in the population are "just dumb" than to admit that you have personally been lied to, controlled, and literally bullied by an entire government force that if you came face to face with, you wouldn't stand a chance alone. Your mind will always create a conquerable foe to avert feeling out of control.</p>

        <p>Because there are stupid people with good intentions that make sweeping claims like the only possible way you die after getting a covid vaccine is to be hit by a bus. </p>
<p>Some people believe the ends justify the means. They think "I believe this vaccine is good and it will be more good the more people i get to take it so even though lying is bad if i just do a little bad with a lie then i can cause a lot of good by convincing more people to get this good vaccine." </p>
<p>And then when it turns out that the vaccine has some awful side effect for some small amount of the population they say well id rather be alive to have that side effect to make themselves feel better by pretending that everyone would have died otherwise. </p>
<p>I mean we have seen the same shit with religions in the past. I have to do a little bad in order to spread the word of christ and save everyones eternal soul for their own good. </p>
<p>The ends never justify the means if you cant justify what you are doing without doing bad then you just dont justify it. If you have to lie to justify something its not worth it, if you have to kill to justify something its not worth it. If you ever have to do something wrong to justify something you think is right then it isnt worth it. </p>
<p>Ive thought about creating my own paramilitary/navy/pirate army to patrol the oceans for illegal fishing and complete destruction of the environment and just basically wage war on illegal Chinese fishing vessels and those Japanese fishermen that slaughter dolphins because they eat fish or something. I would love to go on a crusade on behalf of nature and kill the disgusting humans that keep fucking shit up for all of us but i cant quite justify it. </p>
<p>As much as i believe my agenda is a righteous one i just cant justify it and its probably for the best as i dont want to lead people to their deaths i dont need that responsibility but at the same time i feel like we all have a responsibility to maintain the ability of this planet to support life and so many are ignoring that responsibility that i almost want a pro nature terrorist organization to give world leaders the kick in their ass (and or head) that they need to finally get their shit together.</p>
