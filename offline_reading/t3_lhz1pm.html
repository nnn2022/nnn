    <strong>I work in an elementary school... and it's so sad</strong>
    <p><p>Like i said, I'm currently working in an elementary school and in college to be a teacher. I go to the school 3 times a week to get hours and work with kids, etc. I was lucky to even get placed at an elementary school due to COVID lockdowns in schools. </p>
<p>Today when I was there they had to have recess inside with masks on because of weather. One student had his mask down so he could talk to his friend and play like kids SHOULD. Immediately almost every student acted like he was personally killing them. They were screaming at him to fix his mask &amp; one girl looked like she was going to cry. These are 4th graders. None of them should fear for their lives when someone doesn't have a mask on. The school systems themselves continue to instill fear in these kids. </p>
<p>It absolutely broke my heart that these kids are forced to live in fear like this. They can't even hang out with others in school or have any real play. Even outside they have to have their masks on and stay 6 feet away from each other.</p>
<p>These kids can't even be kids anymore.</p></p>

        <p>The thing about kids is that they have no sense of numbers. When they hear that like 500 people have died they don’t think about that spread across a country they think of it in the size of their world. 500 people to them is like everyone they have ever met. And it freaks them out.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck. It reminds me of the "funny joke" I used to make back in April. Something like "The year is 2040. The children are currently in history class. As they examine their interactive digital textbooks, one child looks at the pictures and exclaims "why are all these people in such large crowds? Why aren't the drones coming to disperse them?""  </p>
<p>It's basically come true.</p>

        <p>I used to teach 3rd grade and what you've described goes to show just how bad we are messing with kids. Typical behavior for kids this age would be to goof off, pull each other's masks off, pull it off their face and quickly pull it back up when the teacher turns to face them...you know, not take this very seriously. This just shows how paralyzed with fear they are. I worry this generation of kids will have serious anxieties as a result of this...</p>

        <p>Last Saturday I went to an outdoor nighttime event at the zoo, lot's of families there, masked up of course. I overheard a mom and dad praising their daughter, she must have been about nine years old, they were like "You're doing a great job! No need to worry honey, you've got your mask on and people are social distancing." I'm guessing at that point the kid had freaked out and told her parents that she was scared to be out.</p>
<p>About four months or so my good friend who has been pretty much in isolation for almost a year now with her family, finally decided to bring her kids out for her husband's birthday. We met in a touristy area, they'd ordered onion rings and I noticed that the eight year old daughter wasn't eating any rings, I asked why and her mom said her daughter was afraid of removing her mask in public because she was terrified of covid so she wasn't going to remove her mask to eat.</p>

        <p>My special needs kid is going back to school two days a week soon. I was so happy but then got an email saying we need to make sure he’s basically 100% independent going to the bathroom, can open all lunch products, tie shoes because the teachers will literally not touch him. He’s five!!! What five year old can do everything with no help?I’m honestly debating pulling him from school because this is all going to be so traumatic for him, but then again a year of no school or therapies has done a serious number on him already 😔</p>

        <p>Sadly we did an outdoor play date yesterday with a classmate whose mom is high-anxiety. We came home and my 8-yr-old was acting weird.  Then she broke down SOBBING at bedtime saying she missed her best friends from back home.  I realized what she really misses is NORMALCY.  The insane levels of anxiety and tension  exhibited by this other family negatively impacted her mental health after only 3 hours of exposure.  So I made the decision that we unfortunately won’t be doing play dates with them again unless they have a change of perspective and work on their mental health issues.</p>

        <p>I think you are on the right track,  noticing important things, and taking appropriate action. I don't understand how most parents around us seem oblivious to the stress they are causing their kids with how they are reacting to all of this. Our kids are younger so we can probably shield them from more of this than if we had older kids or teens. But it seems like most parents, even of young children, just leak their anxieties all over their children without a thought as to the impact that it will have on them.</p>
<p>If you saw the movie "Life is Beautiful" with Roberto Benigni, that's kind of what we are trying to do. The movie is about a father and son who end up in a concentration camp together, and the father's efforts to pretend that it is all in elaborate game in order to protect his son from the horrors. the father was trying to help his son survive unscathed not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, too.</p>
<p>The world outside may have lost its damn mind, but we are trying our best to protect our kids from the insanity and to preserve innocent, carefree, normal childhoods for them as much as we can.</p>
<p>We luckily found a group to meet up with for regular playdates. Some of the parents seemed fairly nervous at the start, but I think our more grounded attitudes have helped bring them back down to earth. We never make our kids wear masks while playing.</p>

        <p>This is the equivalent of forcing children to stay inside, not play with others, and wear masks in order to never catch the flu...or chicken pox...or measles</p>
<p>Their immune systems will actually be much better off if they do catch it, get over it (99.8% chance they do) and adapt to the pathogens, making them stronger adults.</p>

        <p>This is so fucking sad and infuriating. Child abuse pure and simple. Children are naturally supposed to be able to trust adults for protection and guidance. They lack the critical thinking skills. Yet the adults are basically making them all paranoid schizos, afraid of normal and healthy social contact with others.</p>
<p>For fucks sake. The mental healths effects will be felt for generations to come. How the fuck is anybody in this world ok with this?</p>

        <p>The situation is really bad but honestly not new. I remember how many teachers we had who said crap like a astroid would destroy the planet while we're kids etc.</p>

        <p>My daughter's elementary school doesn't require masks. I noticed when she went back to school from being out since March 2020 a huge positive shift in her personality.  Hanging out with friends on playground, eating lunch in cafeteria,  all normal stuff. We had Christmas concert, they did a talent show, have afternoon clubs and activities.  </p>
<p>It's very sad the impact of restrictions, fear, and isolation has on kids and everyone.  I think it is more important than the 0.02% of people died of covid in US.</p>
