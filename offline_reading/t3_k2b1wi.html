    <strong>Exposing some ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù Re: The Covid Scam</strong>
    <p><p>The ‚Äúscientists‚Äù tell us that the over 65s are most at risk for dying  of Covid. My (very wise) Grandfather told me that folks start dying at  50 and if you live to 60 you‚Äôll probably live a long time. <strong>A</strong> scientist at Johns Hopkins tells us that the death rate for folks 55 ‚Äì 84 hasn‚Äôt changed much at all since February.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins published this study on Sunday which posits that Covid  is nowhere near the disaster we‚Äôre being told it is. I would summarize  it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it  yourself because it‚Äôs mind-blowing. <a href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ‚Ä¶ for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it‚Äôs available via<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. But one quote is most significant:<br>
 ‚ÄúSurprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and  after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts  expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups.  However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the  percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same. ‚Äù</p>
