    <strong>Anyone else from Wisconsin?</strong>
    <p><p>Personally, I think Wisconsin is the worst state to be in during this shit. The people up here are nuts. Go to r/Wisconsin (also the mods there are fucking wack. One of them banned me because I said I have a bit of southern pride, I received a message saying that it was basically my fault union soldiers died in the civil war. Not lying.) and you'll see what I'm talking about. Just about everyone here is pro-mask and pro-vaccine. Thankfully I'm out in the country where people don't give a shit, but as soon as you go into a city the propaganda is fucking everywhere. I couldn't imagine what Madison is like. So i'm just wondering if anyone else here is from Wisconsin?</p></p>

        <p>Northeast Wisconsin here, born and raised. If you are in one of the blue counties then that's why you think that. Up here in the north, no one cares about this crap. Only place I have been that really cares is Menard's, even Walmart won't say anything if you go maskless. I would much rather be here than Michigan or Illinois. </p>
<p>My wife and I are currently at a resort in Wisconsin Dells and mask compliance is very low, staff here aren't even trying to enforce the resorts official rules. </p>
<p>Not sure about vaccine opinions, seems mixed among the people I know personally.</p>

        <p>The Dells are so dependent on tourism that if they developed a reputation for being mask-Nazis, Iâ€™m sure people would stay away, although the place is so much different than it was many years ago with so many of the smaller hotels being gobbled up by Mt. Olympus.</p>

        <p>Room we stayed in was five miles from the resort, damp and humid, AC didn't work, view out the window was of a flooded ditch and a metal pole building, headboard of the bed was literally just a headboard painting on the wall, TV was smaller than a computer monitor, peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, bathroom mirror had a sticker on it that had information on it obviously left over from the hotel the building used to belong to, the building had a portion locked off that had windows painted black, through the gaps you could see it used to be the old lobby and kiddie water park area of the former hotel. Place had a "meth motel" feel to it. </p>
<p>The waterpark area of Mt. Olympus was frigid, like they relied on human body heat to warm the pool, and it was massively overcrowded. We were there one day and didn't do anything. Fortunately the rest of our stay in the Dells was in a jacuzzi room at the Kalahari, so much better there and not much more expensive considering the dramatic improvement in accommodations.</p>

        <p>Also, The Wilderness was bought by Wyndham and you can already tell they are putting their stamp on it. Hasn't really wrecked the experience but I'm afraid they will completely change the charm of this place in a few years time.</p>

        <p>I'm in the Northwoods, the main city in the Northwoods. (I assume you know which one that is haha) it's mixed here. I see both, but I see more people like us. I mainly shop at Walmart now because you're right, they don't give two shits haha. One time I walked in and the lady asked if I had a mask, and before I could say anything someone jumped in for me and got on the lady's ass. I'm not really condoning what he did, but man I was glad to see like minded people. Also nice! My wife and I want to go to the dells for our anniversary next month. I'm thinking about buying those $7 Mt Olympus tickets.</p>

        <p>Have you ever been to Mount Olympus before? I highly would not recommend it. Maybe I'd do the theme park for 7 bucks, but I wouldn't get a room there or get a pass for the waterpark. We did that a couple years ago and it was a big mistake. The Wilderness and Kalahari are our go-to waterpark resorts. Mount Olympus is less than ideal because most of their rooms are way off site and you have to drive a few miles just to get back to the main resort. Stay elsewhere and get day passes if you want to go to their theme park. Their theme park can get really busy in summer time but if you go during the school year you might be okay.</p>
