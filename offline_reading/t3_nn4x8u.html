    <strong>Hey everyone just have a little question here since this sub is full of an array of different people and different backgrounds.</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôm genuinely curious, have any of you gone no contact or minimal contact with friends or family members who have gotten the vaccine or those who are pushing the vaccine on you?</p></p>

        <p>I split with my best friend over covid. She said that I "lacked empathy" and that she couldn't be around me.  It's weird though because at that time I was putting in several hours every week with a non-profit helping the homeless.</p>
<p>But the Covid fanatics, they went full totalitarian over this.  They want to tell you, nay demand, that you put chemicals into your body.  They demand masks which are somehow meant to protect 3rd parties that neither of us are coming into contact with.  All the arguments for lockdowns and distancing are just insane too.  And now they are pushing vaccine-segregation, even my workplace is implementing a database of who is and isn't vaccinated and saying that if you're vaccinated then you have permission to ditch the masks.</p>
<p>The real fascists WANT covid.  The mass hysteria was a boon to them.</p>

        <p>None of my friends got it, but every single co worker received it, and my wife got it. They always make snarky little comments and shit when the topic arises. I just laugh and politely decline any offers for a vaccine (work in the medical field)</p>
<p>My wife bugs me about it daily, sometimes it turns into an argument, but she knows I‚Äôm firm in my beliefs so she doesn‚Äôt typically push too far.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt show shade at anyone who wanted to get the vaccine, and I expect the same respect for NOT wanting it. If someone doesnt show me the same respect I hit em with the cold shoulder.</p>

        <p>I don't care if people get it or not, I am honestly not sure how many of my friends have gotten it and none of them push me to get it but if they did I probably would cut off contact.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm still friendly with those that have taken it. But, I honestly don‚Äôt respect them anymore. I still treat them with respect, of course. And hopefully, I can learn to respect them again. I‚Äôm praying on it and wholeheartedly believe we should love EVERYONE, even our enemies (not that they‚Äôre my enemies; they‚Äôre not).</p>

        <p>I only know a couple of people that have gotten the vaccine. I try to avoid the topic around them, but I don't avoid them or treat them differently at all. I hope our scepticism turns out to be unnecessary, but I'm not willing to bet my well-being on it. Or my family's.</p>
