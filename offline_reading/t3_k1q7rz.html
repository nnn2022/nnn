    <strong>Rant? Why is it always anarkiddies that want to enforce lockdown rules the hardest?</strong>
    <p><p>I hate talking politics and I’m not trying to dunk on leftists by any means but to me it feels as if the people getting the nastiest about enforcing mask rules are anarkiddies and other specific leftist that talk about ‘tolerance”. I don’t understand how people who constantly talk about defunding/abolishing police, ACAB, BLM and other anti-authority ideas get the nastiest when someone doesn’t wear a mask or when someone goes against their narrative. What happened to those anti-authoritarian views?</p>
<p>The other day I was being harassed in a store about not wearing a mask. While masks are mandatory where I live, you can get an exemption (I have a proper doctors note). I don’t like generalising, but this employee looked like your typical punk/anarkiddie. This employee was staring me down and then asked me about my mask to which I replied “I have a doctors note”. This employee then proceeds to aggressively talk about how he “hadn’t heard of such a thing” (implying im lying) and that he “hadn’t heard that one before”. He then says to me “ok ill let you in this store but just once” in a snarky way. I then tell him that I’m happy to show him my doctors note to which he refused to see and then starts rudely asking me about my condition. I bought something from the store too (I plan to return this as I don’t feel comfortable supporting businesses that will treat me like shit on the basis of my invisible disability). </p>
<p>Later I check the stores social media pages to see if anyone else has had a bad experience, and I notice that this shop has these posts up on instagram about BLM and how they ‘stand up for  minorities and other marginalised people that can’t represent themselves” as well as support for the LGBT community and other minorities.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how these stores make posts to ‘represent’ minority groups yet see no problems treating me poorly and being skeptical of me based on my disability? I don’t wanna throw buzzwords around, but isn’t it ableist to imply im lying because I have an invisible disability? What happened to standing up for people? Or is it because disabilities aren’t trendy enough at the moment?</p></p>

        <p>i don’t get why people always associate abolishing the police with the left wing. Yeah, the people behind it are mostly left wing, but abolishing police is generally a pretty right wing thing by function</p>

        <p>my point isn’t that they’re left wing for wanting police abolition, it’s that i don’t understand how they can be so anti authoritarian but want harsh mandates at the same time.</p>
