    <p><p>the story of collective concious/ global concious/ universal concousness </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if the planets overall mood and vibration is happiness then the planets collective conciousness lives in the light and darkness is overid. the governments no longer reign supreme and the people collectivly win. we no longer have to live in fear and we become our own governers. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>when the people stop listening we set ourselves free and no more tyrannical systems will be in place. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we can overthrow any system set in place in the people live in thier own realities. when we switch of the televison, when we turn of the social media, the phones and live in the present moments, in reality, in the actual world we  can no longer be controlled and manipulatued by the deep state and we can live our lives as we want too. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if this confuses you then it is very difficult to explain but my best example of this is if you look directly at the covid pandemic. it was fake, a hoax, or simply blown out of proportion. if phone didnt exist, if we didnt watch the televison we wouldnt of even known this pandemic existed. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>you see, how can a pandemic be so deadly we have to remind ourselves daily of its existence by watching the televison. if it was as genuinly bad as they say, wouldnt we instincly know? that is one of our primal functions! our third eye! we have instincts that let us decipher what is going on. we can sense trouble, we can sense. the sixth sense. what they dont teach you in schoo but is so previlant in our lives its ridiclous we havent already realised this and used it to our advantage. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for me, i simply erased the thought covid is real i simply erased it being a dangerous virus from my mind, i removed that conditioning, i removed that brainwashing from my system and it allowed me to live in a happy and blissful world that is covid free. as it always has been.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so my hypothesis, take of the mask, go and breathe fresh air, go and talk to some new people. indulge in covid related topics and spread the word that this shit is fake and simply a tool of distraction being used by elites to manipualte and control us.... the general population. the 99%. tell a friend to tell a friend. 2 = 4 4 = 8 8 = 16 = 16 = 32 etc etc. until we all realise what has really happened. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we live in a capitalist matrix, everyday we are manipulated and coerced by adverts and other things alike to believe that happines comes from 3 dimensional items. we have been mislead into beliving we can "buy" happiness when in actuality it comes from within us, it comes from freedom. it comes from socialising and mixing, it comes from watching a child chase after a dog. it comes from going to your families house for christmas dinner. gatherings. just think about what life was like a year ago. lets go back to that and forget the government are trying to fuck us over. if we dont listen they cant do anything. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if the communities all support each other, the police forces are powerless. its 99% vs 1%. we cannot be stopped, some may be punished along the way but that is a reasonable price to pay for human salvation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we are one planet, one collective race, one collective conciousness. lets all spread love, happiness and positivty to the best of our abilites. we no longer need to spread fear, we no longer need to spread covid hysteria to our family member. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my ideal world would be veganism across the planet, no longer do we slay animals, no longer do we kill these beings to satisfy our hunger. but this is my own personal decision and im not very well informed of ethics but i like to believe the world would be a much happier place if we didnt slay down these creaturs for our own satisfaction. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i follow animal liberartion front, greenpeace and cnd. these are the powers we need in play. we should strip all powers from the dark, evil families currenlty in control. </p>
<p>i will attach an imgur link below to help you understand this topic of real, elite, dark satanic culture families. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>p.s, if society does want to continue in a materialistc and money driven state. can we please emphaise the importance of helping realise it does not define thier lives, it is not a nesecity. too many peope suffer from depression because they do not feel good enough, they dont feel like they own enough "stuff". materialistc shit isnt the answer to happiness or living a succesful life. it is a mentality and state of mind only achieved through love, light and care. socialising and understanding. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>another thing to add as i sit here in the park, we all have our own talents, our own intrests that we inherit through our genetics and dna. we should all be looking inside of ourselves to find our true, innner and higher self. not our society conditioned egotistical self. lets all find whoo we truly are, what we truly love and share it with the world. lets all share what we can do with each other. we dont have to put on a metphorical mask when we go outside to hide our true identity, lets be open, honest and upbeat about who we are. why would you want to do it any other way? </p>
<p>one last thing to add, if you want to know where all our problems are coming from, its the elite 1%.</p>
<p>greedy, elite, demonic 1%</p>
<p>the light will destroy them, we are growing everyday. </p>
<p>dont get lost in the source, the war is real and prevelant. its the people vs the system/the matrix </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>something amazing is coming yall</p>
<p>just have faith &lt;3</p></p>
