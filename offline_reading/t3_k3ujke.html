    <strong>I have "Long Covid" because I'm tired and have "mild, irregular breathlessness and chest tightness"...although I never had a COVID-19 test and I'm a life long asthmatic.</strong>
    <p><p>No, not me.   </p>
<p>This headline story in the Guardian of a young person who has never had a positive covid test and whose symptoms are absurdly common and consistent with her chronic condition that predates covid (asthma)...but worry intensely young people because you too could be felled by LONG COVID.   </p>
<p>Or, you know, maybe just ashma. Or ashma and perimenopause. Or ashma and hypothyroidism. Or ashma and chronic fatigue syndrome. Or ashma and sleep apnea. Or any number of other common explanations.  </p>
<p>But no, must be LONG COVID!</p>

        <p>&rt;The next morning I started coughing and didn’t  stop. It was pre-lockdown and, taking pity on me (I live alone in  London), a friend in the countryside offered to be nurse. En route, in  Paddington Station, I longed to curl up like a cat beside the warmth of  the Upper Crust stall. One morning, my friend told me she’d poked her  head round the door throughout the night to check I hadn’t coughed my  aorta up into the bed.</p>
<p>So you put all the people on the train and elsewhere at risk because you wanted attention from your friend.</p>
<p>&rt;But it didn’t feel like chest infections I’d known. There was a crushing  feeling in my chest for weeks, as if my ribs were a pair of bellows  being squeezed. Adding to the fun, I’m asthmatic. On two occasions,  things felt hairy and I called 111.</p>
<p>You have asthma and don't have an inhaler...? I have very mild asthma and had two asthma attacks in my life. I am never more than 8 meters from my inhaler.</p>
<p>&rt;I’d walk the dog in the morning then fall asleep on the sofa until 3pm.</p>
<p>Yep, I get that as well. It's called a lazy day.</p>

<p>I don't need to doubt her self reports of her experiences...what I doubt is her self-diagnosis with no laboratory evidence of the ostensible cause let alone an attempt at a differential diagnosis between it and the literally dozens of mundane causes that would account for an asthmatic's fatigue (of which anxiety and depression are certainly included).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That said, the "long covid" narratives generally have the feel of munchausen syndrome at a time when being a victim of a politicized foe certainly enhances a person's prestige and epistemic credibility.</p>

        <p>I managed to not get sick even from the campus plague all semester, then came home and my child sister gave me the sniffles.</p>
<p>It's obviously covid and I should rush to the neighborhood CityMD, stand in line for 4 hours to get a test (demanding to get a rapid test as well), then virtue signal about staying safe online.</p>
<p>Yes, the lines ARE 4 HOURS LONG due to 'white' hypochondriac pothead liberals with nothing to do with their lives.</p>

        <p>Thats the problem with testing literally everyone which too this day makes zero sense. If you lose your sense of taste/smell and have a mild cough, just stay home. You don't have to get a test</p>

<p>Lockdowns and lockdownism cause depression, anxiety, and dramatic reduction in physical activity.  </p>
<p>Depression, anxiety and reduction in physical activity are well established causes of fatigue, brain fog, and, in the case of anxiety, breathing constriction.</p>

        <p>I have anemia (iron deficiency). If I've ever not been tired, I don't remember it. Every year, something knocks me out for at least a week. Over the past year, maybe two, climbing long flights of stairs has become hard, and if I walk around or stand for long periods of time, I'm easily winded and my breath gets short.</p>
<p>I tested negative for COVID-19 twice in two weeks.</p>

        <p>My boss insists he had covid and that his son had covid despite both having tested negative twice.  He takes for granted the accuracy of tests showing rising cases around the country, but in his and his son's case stated "Yeah we both tested negative, but I know we had it. The tests aren't always accurate."  He sees no irony or contradiction in these views.</p>

        <p>This article may be fake as fuck but here's some perspective.</p>
<p>I knew that this was a psy-op for the most part from day 1, and didn't know anyone who had corona except through second-hand or third-hand rumors. But recently a very good friend of mine said that he experienced severe corona symptoms in march, and has had fatigue and other mild flu-like symptoms since after the severe covid got better. He's otherwise a healthy guy in his early 20's and not prone to getting severely sick, and I don't know all the symptoms but he said it's definitely not the flu. He's not an attention-seeker or exaggerator of any kind. </p>
<p>So now I do think there is something going around which CAN cause symptoms for months afterwards. Therefore this article may not be a complete lie.</p>

        <p>Well, has your friend had a dramatic reduction in the amount of physical activity and social contact he has had since March? Fatigue attributed to "long covid" is also strongly associated with exactly the impacts of lockdowns.   </p>
<p>It's also consistent with post-viral syndrome which can be caused by both flu and common colds...so there are indeed viruses that can cause symptoms for months afterwards that have been going around both before and after COVID-19...it's just that no one pays attention to flu induced post-viral syndrome.</p>

        <p>You can go to my posts and see, long covid it's a real thing. You will find reports in every country/language if you don't believe that particular testimony. Go to Twitter and search "long covid" or go to Facebook and join any "long covid support group". Thousands of patients sharing the same story over and over. It's terrible.</p>
<p>I've been almost bedridden for 8 months. Please, support our struggle. I'm not saying this is a common/normal thing, but if some of us (previously young and healthy) now have long term problems, we'll need help. I want to go back to normal as much as everyone in this sub.</p>

        <p>I'm not suggesting that "long covid" doesn't exist - post-viral syndrome is a well established phenomena consistent with "long covid" accounts that can occur with any respiratory virus, its just that no one pays attention to "long flu" and "long cold" - but it's also clearly the case that the media is promoting narratives of people attributing to "long covid" without good evidence what could be attributed to any number of other causes. This gives a false impression that this is a common/normal thing.</p>

        <p>Get over yourself, you either all have Münchausen syndrome, an anxiety disorder or post viral syndrome from another illness. There is no such thing as “long covid”. Is there anything you lazy idiots won’t do to collect a government check? </p>
<p>None of you need help, you need to be exposed for the frauds you are like the person in the article. Her passing off asthma as covid is just disgusting attention seeking. Give the help to people who deserve it, like the cancer patients you seem determined to kill. </p>
<p>Maybe consider putting down the burgers and eat some salad, it could also be obesity causing your “long covid”</p>
