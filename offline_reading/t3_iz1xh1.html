        <p>This is very much intentional. I know people will disagree with me on this, and believe this is all a colossal accident, but...they knew what they were doing, they knew that this could potentially devalue the US dollar, and crash the economy beyond repair. </p>
<p>And yes, the folks you described won't care, even if they also have economic ruin of their own. I know people believe that these types getting their lives ruined would help them "wake up" but...I think they'll just cry, and shift the blame to whoever they deem at fault. Never their own.</p>

        <p>Trump will bear the blunt of all of this mark my words. Even if he loses this upcoming election (which will be a train wreck of its own) people will blame him for shutdowns that he never wanted in the first place.</p>
