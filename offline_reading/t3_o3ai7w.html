    <strong>My last post.</strong>
    <p><p>I love this subreddit. I may not agree with everything posted here - but i admire all of the questions people raise here. Thats extremely healthy. </p>
<p>I suspect many people here are politically conservative, but regardless, please know that many independent and left thinkers also are here because they can sniff bullshit like what has been unprecedentedly brought upon us since early last year. </p>
<p>These vaccines should have been halted in early Jan. We broke through unprecedented protocols of our healthcare benchmarks for what reason i‚Äôll never know. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people will take the vaccine and never question the repurcussions. I truly pray, that there are no long term consequences for anyone who has taken this vaccination. </p>
<p>Sorry if this is personal.  Im not anti-vaxx or anti science. But i know how much money circulates around human nature to make good men/women lose their principles.  When people tell you to ‚ÄúTrust Science‚Äù - ask them if thats pre Bayh-Dole or post Bayh-Dole science. It matters.  Money has polluted even our greatest attempt and discipline to understand our world. I once was told by government officials that Manhattan was healthy to return to soon after 9/11. Sometimes theyre wrong.  Think for yourself. </p>
<p>The adults that have taken the vaccine will know or should have known the risks. </p>
<p>The kids, should not be vaccinated. They cant speak for themselves. Period. Its criminal. </p>
<p>Wish you all a healthy and happy life.</p></p>

        <p>In all of history it is filled with scientists and doctors having to work around tyranny.</p>
<p>The church and priests would kill any scientist giving evidence of planets, stars and or nature that didn't follow the Bible, so many scientists had to alter their data to be half correct and ensure it didn't piss off the church.</p>
<p>Doctors for 800 years were censored and killed for going against Galen's teachings - despite the fact he was wrong, and easily disproved. Idolisation - effectively "Trust the Science" folk continued the lie.</p>
<p>Science is the OPPOSITE of consensus!</p>
<p>Anytime anyone uses the "there's a consensus amongst scientists" they have lost the argument.</p>
<p>Throughout history most consensuses amongst scientists were faked to avoid the ire of very malevolent leaders/people.</p>
<p>I don't trust science because science isn't about trust.</p>
<p>Nobody made these claims about airplanes, ships, or any technology.</p>
<p>There's also up front data and explanations.</p>
<p>I.e. when a plane crashed near their first uses, the government wasn't there saying "Oh, it's a coincidence. Planes never crash. Trust the science!".</p>
<p>No, they said "yeah, rotors failed, this led to lack of thrust, and as we can see in this equation this led to a decline of X every Y and that's why they crashed at this profile" etc.</p>
<p>Do we get that today? No. Everything is 100.00.</p>
<p>Don't question. Don't think. Just put your trust in people claiming consensuses we know to be impossible.</p>
<p>NOTHING is 100.00%.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Especially medicine and biology.</p>

        <p>The shitty thing is, some people know the repercussions but are forced to take it anyways. One of my friends was pretty much forced to take it as he‚Äôs going into military stuff and he didn‚Äôt want to ruin his future.... that‚Äôs kind of shitty if you ask me....</p>

        <p>If you're still a "left thinker" or associate yourself with that, then there's no hope with you.</p>
<p>Like saying you're an "independent nazi thinker."</p>
<p>Your thinking is wrong, period. </p>
<p>The right is not excluded in their ignorance, but at least they have a remnant of principles left in them. Not some humanitarian virtue signal to promote some smug sense of moral superiority the left think they have.</p>
