    <strong>Uplifting Story Today</strong>
    <p><p>On vacation with the family. We went out to eat. We got to talking with the lady in the gift shop. She asked if we got vaccinated. I said hell no. This little old lady smiled and gave me a high five!  She told me you know what’s coming right. I said yes. She said she talked to lots of people and they could see what’s happening. She said she didn’t think it would happen in her lifetime. We talked for like thirty minutes. Made my vacation. We are not alone no matter what the media or government says. We won’t fight this alone.</p></p>

        <p>I absolutely love it when this happens, this happened to me on vacation too! Same thing I was in a restaurant and the woman ringing me up started chatting and we realized we are both on the same side! And it's funny how you can tell, you have to feel it out a little bit and avoid being specific in your answers and people will usually give themselves away. Glad you got to have that interaction!</p>

        <p>Lot of people can see it, I just hope everyone says this even vocally out aloud. Just so they know this isn’t fringe or conspiracy or anti vaxxers . You know when they label that on anyone conveniently to discredit them. People need to speak in one voice and tell them to get offfffff their livessss</p>
