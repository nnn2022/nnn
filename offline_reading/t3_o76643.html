    <strong>The Covid Authoritarians Are Facing A Big Dilemma Here.</strong>
    <p><p>As we all know that, apparently vaccinated people don't have to wear masks anymore. Alright. But how the F would anyone know who's vaccinated and who's not? I can be unvaccinated and walk in anywhere without a mask and then be like, "I'm vaccinated! I don't need to wear mask." And be let in everywhere. It just doesn't make any sense. </p>
<p>Also, this just shows you that government knew all this will happen. The sheep will complain to them that they feel "threatened" by the unvaccinated people for a "disease" which has a 99.7% survival rate. And they will keep bitching and eventually, government will make the vaccine passports mandatory. It already is in some places around the world.</p>
<p>This all never made any sense. It was bs. It was never about a virus, rather, it was all about control. And don't forget that the economy now is completely destroyed and there will be a huge inflation that'll be coming. It's only about time.</p>
<p>Also, with many theories regarding the "Dark winter" this means that something big is going down soon. They can shut back everything down just like that, and apparently, some cyber attack will take place as said by many of the frequent writers here. The doomers who think we're  some "conspiracy theorists" you wanna know something? Every theory since this plandemic has been correct that was predicted by us. But you? Y'all will only listen to them "experts" which will be the cause of your doom.</p>
<p>Be calm, stay mentally stoic and just enjoy whatever you can right now. As time proceeds and we head into the winter, things seem to only get worse. Something big is coming.</p></p>

        <p>It's interesting to think about a grid collapse, even in the context of Cyber Polygon because so much of their control depends on these technologies. I hope it doesn't happen, but I am also prepared for it. </p>
<p>I hope the push for covid passports falls apart. A lot of places don't have the infrastructure to support them, and find it too onerous to support. International travel has already collapsed because mandatory negative tests are STILL being enforced in a lot of countries in order to fly. As long as that's going on, travel is out for me.</p>

        <p>By Dec 2021, this is when the full effect of the mortgage forgiveness (ending June 30,2021) will be fully realized. </p>
<p>Expect to be under authoritarian control, with a completely destroyed economy but all the power in rich corporations. </p>
<p>THIS is why they're keeping us locked under our own fear. The economy fucked completely and if people become brave, the elite will be scared.</p>

<p>You have any links to how this will take place? You see My main concern is, how will the government take all these privately owned properties away just like that? Like it's difficult to comprehend.</p>

        <p>So then the government will come in and take the homes in the name of "debt forgiveness" program? Like for example say the people who can still pay their mortgages or bought on cash, what about them?</p>

        <p>Commercial mortgage backed securities are the victim of what they did in 2008. Cascading effect of mortgages defaulting on business and property. Job loss, homelessness etc. </p>
<p>The stock market is screaming at an all time high but is propped up by margin that large banks don't have.  </p>
<p>The Overnight Reverse Repo Rate hit an all-time high of approximately 817B dollars. Unheard of levels of collateral being lent out to the banks by the Fed only to whitewash their balance sheets. </p>
<p>I'm telling you dude, the crash is very fucking close. And it's going to be worse than 2008. </p>
<p>The FED is stuck between forcing the money printing to continue (see the new Biden Infrastructure bill announced today) so that margins can be satisfied. If they print too long, hyperinflation starts just like Weimar Germany. </p>
<p>If they stop the constant printing, margin debt is at record levels and debts will not be paid. Causing a massive cascading effect on the money supply, resulting in major climbs in interest rates. Which leads to further defaulting due to people having large mortgages at low rates. </p>
<p>This comment is going to age well. I'm not wrong.</p>
