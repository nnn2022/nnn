    <strong>I don't know what I hate more: the complacency and indifference of the average NPC or the over-zealousness and extreme bootlicking of the doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>It's very disheartening to me that most people just seem to not give a single shit about having to wear a mask and wouldn't even blink twice if they were told they'd have to wear them for the rest of their miserable fucking lives. They see nothing wrong with having to wear a mask whilst walking around in a restaurant and then taking it off the moment they sit down. They literally don't think anything of it. Around town I've seen people walking outside with their face-diapers dangling from their ears or just resting on their chins; they often claim they "forgot" and that they "don't even notice it's there". I suppose it's one step better than walking around with it clamped over their fucking mouth but for fuck's sake do they not have any shame or self-awareness?</p>
<p>They follow all the rules and get jabbed without question. At most they'll grumble or sigh in exasperation at having their lives majorly inconvenianced but that's about it. They'll scoff and shake their heads at us for "overreacting" and being "conspiracy theorists", like that's a fucking dirty word or something. As long as they have their Netflix, Kardashians and social media they're fucking happy and content to rot their brains and let society go fuck itself. The truth doesn't matter to them; they have no concept of what's going on in the rest of the World.</p>
<p>On the extreme end of the scale you have the doomers, who are all-in on the scamdemic and have adopted The Science as their new religion. These are people that had no lives prior to Covid and spent much of their time locked inside, hiding behind a mask of online anonymity and suckling at their parents' teats for money. Life hasn't changed for them except now they're heroes and they can virtue-signal like fuck about it for Reddit karma and internet adulation. Misery loves company and these sad fucks absolutely love it that everyone else is as lonely and miserable as they are now. If they had it their way they'd have us in lockdown forever.</p>
<p>These are the gurning wankers populating NNNBan and Covidiots. They profess to care about others but they've done fuck all to prove it beyond wearing a mask and getting an experimental jab that they expect everyone else to line up for. They mock freedom because they're enslaved by their own anxieties, mental illnesses and low self esteem. Most of them probably love wearing a mask because it hides just how fuck-ugly they are but trust me they're far uglier on the inside. If this ever does blow over they will pretend they never supported the lockdowns; I encourage you all to give daily reminders to these cringing sycophants that they stood on the wrong side of history until they delete their fucking accounts.</p></p>

        <p>They’ve never had to struggle or fight through tough situations. What has shocked me is the willingness to comply - I remember as a teenager doing History and specifically between WW1 and WW2, no one in my peer group could understand how ordinary Germans just let it happen.
Then the shamdemic came along and 80% of UK just goes with it, no questions asked!!! Shameful</p>

        <p>It's not just them that would suffer though. Their support for way too long lockdowns, restrictions, masks, etc also affects the rest of us, physically due to much less 'Passive" exercise through our work, and no access to gyms and rec centres to offset this, as well as weight gain, mental stress, etc.</p>
<p>I"m doing fine, but even I am suffering inflammations, stressed muscles, etc that I never had pre 2021, as my normal activities have been stunted. Yes I walk, yes I cycle, but I'm still missing that 5-8 hours a day from activity at my regular job</p>

        <p>My opinion is the doomers are the problem, the NPC’s are fine. </p>
<p>If we win, and it is a win, there will be changes we’ll have Nuremberg 2.0. And this will likely extend to the doomers, not just the elite. </p>
<p>Once this happens the NPC’s will be back on our side, as they side with whatever way the current is going. They’ll be saying “yeah! Fauci is bad. I always knew he was bad. The numbug (“do you mean Nuremberg?”) court thing say he bad. They lie about mask so I don’t like mask. I now know I never liked mask.”</p>

        <p>And put together, it is a multiplier that is destroying our rights, freedoms and dignities and country's economy.</p>
<p>How are these people 'affording' to live to keep this up? Is everyone that rich in Canada and the USA that they can mitigate 1.5 years of not working, destroyed or severely diminished businesses and livelihoods to play along?</p>
