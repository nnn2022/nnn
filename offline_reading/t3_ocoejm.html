        <p>The point is you can wear whatever you want to deflect mosquitoes, from body armour to a repellent. It's your choice. Don't force us, the normal human beings and lecture us with false sense of superiority acquired from MSM on how we are "science deniers" or "super spreaders" when masks don't do shit for an airborne disease.</p>

        <p>But you would be smelling individual gas particles, much different than virus carrying water droplets. And besides, wearing a cloth mask and being considerate of other people is not violating any of your precious freedoms and people who say otherwise are simply being selfish and are openly okay with spreading diseases to other people. It should also be mentioned that surgical masks don't protect you from receiving the virus, it protects those around you by absorbing the water droplets you emit to keep others safe, it doesn't protect you at all.</p>

        <p>Depending on where you live it is completely within the law to have those freedoms suspended in the name of public safety, since all people have the rights to safety and security. By not wearing a mask you violate my rights to staying safe so the obvious choice is to prioritize people's rights to safety over your right to choose what you wear. And if you choose not to then fine, be subject the penalties of laws and bylaws in place for those like you who are selfish cunts who don't care about other people's safety.</p>

        <p>Did you really read what he said? It absorbs the water droplets you emit, kind of like a sponge, to keep others safe. That is why everyone wants you guys to wear masks. It is not because they want you to live, it is because they want to live. You are putting others in danger by not wearing one. But oh well, you guys only have conspiracies to work with.</p>

        <p>So, to explain:</p>
<p>First of all, nobody is calling COVID-19 the deadliest virus in history. It is not particularly deadly as far as epidemics go. However, it is *extremely* communicable, far more than any similar virus.</p>
<p>Thus, even though it only has a morbidity rate of roughly 1-2%, it has a higher number of fatalities than other epidemics because it reaches more people. By slowing its spread from person to person, we can insure that it is less likely to reach the small number of people for whom it would be deadly (those with certain comorbidities, those above 65, etc).</p>
<p>The use of masks in public spaces can help prevent the spread of COVID by reducing the number of airborne water particles that carry the virus. While they don't actually stop the spread of the virus through aerosolized particles, if they are used by enough people they can help.</p>
<p>The reason cloth or surgical masks is so encouraged, rather than these heavy-duty respirators, that would doubtlessly be more effective, is because almost everyone has access to masks, so as a public policy it has the potential to do the greatest amount of good. Whereas if it was suggested that people avoid using them because they're not as effective as other air filters, the number of people wearing them would inevitably decrease.</p>

        <p>19/20 people who died with covid did not die of covid, and 19/20 people who died with covid were over 70. </p>
<p>Also the mortality rate is so much lower than 1% its a joke that you think its above... the infection fatality rate is iterally 0.018% if youre under 65.</p>
<p>As far as masks stopping water droplets... youre correct! There is a host of reasons why masking is negative too, not the least of which is covering your face with a moist bacteria filled filter all day can contribute to health problems... like in your case where you habe chronic lack of oxygen to your brain. </p>
<p>And as you said they dont prevent airborne spread and you are aware there is no documented cases of casual spread of the virus aka walking past people outdoors right?</p>

        <p>FWIW, I‚Äôm totally against sensationalizing this virus and believe in large part it‚Äôs a psy-op to used by gov‚Äôts to seize control and force compliance. Yet I agree with your points and I don‚Äôt think downvoting your well reasoned points to oblivion is helpful to our cause here on this subreddit. The censorship is crazy in the world right now and it effectively forces people into ‚Äúthought‚Äù bubbles and echo chambers wherein they cannot have a reasonable conversation with someone who doesn‚Äôt share their point of view without losing their marbles. The insults and strawman arguments really go both ways (as evidenced by the replies to your post) and people REACT instead of RESPOND. Like I said, hurts our cause here on this subreddit. Not everyone here is insane, you know...just really fed up with this whole situation. </p>
<p>Anyway, I agree with your points about the virus‚Äô communicability, but I still think the threat is way, way overblown and isnt really about a middling virus to begin with. But... Where are you getting the 1-2% and does it differentiate between dying FROM covid vs dying WITH covid? Does it count all those asymptomatic cases? Survival rates from my sources suggest something like 99.6% survival rate.</p>

        <p>Of course- as always, the finer the mesh the better. I use N95s as well, but only because I'm lucky enough that my union was able to get ahold of some. They're very expensive these days. I think the cloth (if it is multi-layered) can still be effective in that it prevents larger droplets and sort of helps redirect the air toward the face rather than directly forward.</p>

        <p>N95's are cheap and easily obtainable. Go to the paint section at Walmart, you can get a three pack of n95's for $5. People just don't like to wear them, because it renders their "you need to wear your mask to keep me safe" argument moot.</p>

        <p>Though I disagree with you in principle, it's very refreshing to read such a patient and detailed comment, rather than being called names.  I understand that there is most definitely a greater supply of cloth/surgical masks, but it does seem just a bit unlikely to me that they truly do anything if the viral particles are small enough in diameter to pass through the mask.  I'll bring out the old reliable metaphor: It's like trying to keep mosquitoes out of your yard with a chain-link fence.  It may keep 1% of them out, but it has such a minimal impact that it is not worth it when you take everything into account.  I think about the pollution they cause by being thrown on the ground, the bacteria that has been found to grow within them, and the poor kids who have to breathe with a mask on their face and realize it is not worth it.</p>

        <p>I have responded to these questions elsewhere. In short, some protection worn by many people is better than extreme protection worn by very few. And nobody can just stop you from eating together and flying- funny that you quote the constitution and then ask why you're allowed to live freely. However, as this sub is quick to point out, some countries and cities have done what they can to stop large public gatherings and other easy vectors.</p>

        <p>I hear you, but I think why I disagree, and probably several others, is that you‚Äôre repeating what you heard in some article or some news show. (I would imagine, not trying to project or act like I know everything.)</p>
<p>For me, I have to value real world experiences. Let me explain. You say it‚Äôs <em>extremely</em> communicable, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve seen. I work around the virus 5 days a week, sometimes I‚Äôm lazy with the mask, sometimes not. I even accidentally walked into a quarantine area once where a recently deceased ‚Äúvictim‚Äù of COVID was removed only moments before. I have been so immersed in this virus it‚Äôs ridiculous. And I haven‚Äôt had an issue. I know, they say I‚Äôm ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù as a convenient excuse for never getting sick. But I live with 6 people. They have never gotten sick. I know a relative that got it, survived, told me it was more mild than the seasonal flu. And she lives with 3 people, they never got the virus.  I can keep going and argue every little thing. But I wanted to address one of your points in depth to show you, calmly, why I disagree with you.</p>
<p>Sorry, I‚Äôm just not believing the narrative you are regurgitating.</p>

        <p>I mean, you're correct in the sense I am reporting what I've read in articles. I'm not a scientist and so I have to trust what the microbiologists, virologists, and epidemiologists say. </p>
<p>As I stated above, it's extremely communicable but doesn't necessarily have a major impact on a young or middle-aged otherwise healthy person. And, you're right, there's a good chance you already got it, and maybe all those other people did. I think you can do an antibody test to see if you're curious. So, if that's all there was to it, I'd simply say that your personal experience is incomplete but an understandable basis if that's all the information you have. After all, if you told me there was a land called Finland, but I'd never been there, never heard of anyone from there, and never met anyone who knew anyone from there, I might be forgiven for doubting its existence.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that many people have gotten it, and some have gotten very sick, and some have died. Like trying to doubt the existence of Finland in the age of satellite photography and the internet, you'd have to narrow your scope of information to literally only the people in your family to continue this line of reasoning. </p>
<p>I'm not asking you to believe the narrative you think I'm "regurgitating." I'm asking you to do your own, actual research using established and trustworthy sources. The data bears out.</p>

        <p>What an insightful response! Here I am used to nothing but hate in response. I truly understood your argument about Finland. A rare moment I was given pause, what a great point I agree with and at times have had moments where I wonder this same thing. Especially when everyone says this place is only an echo chamber. I have reconciled such concerns, but just the same, I respect a well organized argument. </p>
<p>Establish a base line for me, do you trust the media without question? Additionally, do you trust vaccine manufacturers without thought? </p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to make clear I read the news articles all day, so me being ignorant to the situation is not a factor.</p>

        <p>Haha, it is refreshing to have genuine dialogue on Reddit, isn't it?</p>
<p>To answer your questions, I don't trust the media without question in the sense that I don't just read headlines and assume they're unbiased. In the interest of honesty, I should say I'm more inclined to believe a journalist than an authority figure. I also pay little-to-no attention to news media that emphasizes panic, like TV news sources (CNN etc) and many newspapers. </p>
<p>I also don't trust vaccine manufactures without thought. In fact, I trust the pharmaceutical industry very little. I do generally trust independent research hospitals, even when they are commissioned by the FDA or CDC, as that is part of a regulatory restraint on the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Point taken about news articles. I suppose I did make it sound like I assumed you were uninformed.</p>

        <p>Most certainly refreshing! You made me think, I enjoy that. </p>
<p>So let‚Äôs do this, with your lack of blind trust for the media and pharmaceutical companies established. How can you trust anything BUT your own experiences? I can see a picture of Finland and understand it‚Äôs real. But this mess is different. As far as I understand the test to find the virus is unreliable according to the man that invented it, the mask to protect against it is scientifically useless according to even the small print on the package itself, the vaccine won‚Äôt fully protect against it according to the CDC, and if you have side effects it‚Äôs your problem. </p>
<p>I‚Äôll be honest, some days I‚Äôm floating without understanding what the hell is going on. I would LOVE a genuine source to calm down my doubts. But every time I turn around another media bias is proven. Look at the Washington post, for example, linked constantly on Reddit and spreading fear about COVID, but owned by Jeff bezos. A man with a clear incentive to lock us down and wait for your Amazon orders. How often has the media contradicted itself additionally? Do you even want me to continue and pull links? I will for the sake of checking sources but at this point if you‚Äôre commenting here, you must have heard all these same arguments 10x over. And honestly, babbling like an anti-Vaxer doesn‚Äôt do this sub any favors. </p>
<p>So, on a platform where people rarely ever say this, I will. I am 100% open minded if you have a source of information to change my mind, because as of now you have garnered my respect through calm debate.</p>

        <p>&rt;How can you trust anything BUT your own experiences?</p>
<p>A genuinely good question, with lots of reasons to be skeptical right after it. I'll explain my own situation and that might help clarify where I'm coming from. I'm married and my spouse is, while young, someone with exactly the comorbidities that could be deadly or dangerous to have with COVID. We also have close friends with similar situations, including someone who just had their kidney replaced. We don't have the luxury of "everyone should get infected and just get it over with so we can go back to work."</p>
<p>To begin, I want to recap the basic facts you doubtlessly know about the virus</p>
<p>- It's not especially deadly as far as viruses go</p>
<p>- It is obscenely communicable, thus potentially killing far more than any other common illness because it can so easily reach people who are compromised</p>
<p>- Because of the way it can infect so many people simultaneously it can clog up hospitals to the point that more people die of unrelated things because they go untreated.</p>
<p>- It spreads largely through contact with mucous membranes and aerosols, which means that breathing the same uncirculated air as somebody who is infected, even if masked, will eventually lead to exposure and probably transmission.</p>
<p>For me, the fact that the test has skeptics, the masks have mixed success in clinical trials, and the vaccine isn't 100% effective, doesn't have any further implications. All it means is that the test has skeptics, the masks are not a cure-all, and the vaccine isn't overwhelmingly perfect. It's not a reason to argue not to do any of them. I still do whatever mitigations I can in order to protect my family and friends, recognizing that it's not usually a deadly disease but that it spreads like wildfire to the people it can kill and that I'm responsible to do my part to keep from becoming a vector.</p>
<p>In other words, just because the pandemic situation doesn't fit the story that some people (both vehemently anti-vax and vehemently pro-vax) have told themselves doesn't mean that it's somehow a) not a threat at all, b) fake, c) a cash grab, and so on.</p>
<p>You're plenty within your rights to be skeptical of billionaires and the like, and, like you, I have absolutely no doubts in my mind of two things</p>
<ol>
<li>some people and companies will take advantage of this disaster and attempt to wring money out of it</li>
<li>that even the most well-meaning public officials have to balance policy with enforcement and popularity, and won't necessarily make the best decisions for everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>But that doesn't change the fact that I don't need to try to buck the "new normal" or "not be a sheep" or anything. I'm not working from some hidden information not accessible to anybody, or have any special sources. I'm just using the most basic, most trustworthy scientific info I have, not even journalism or government policy, to make decisions that I think will make my home and community a safer place.</p>
