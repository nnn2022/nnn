        <p>Freedom=health. You ever see a wild lion compared to a captive lion? One is massive, muscles defined and full of courage. A captive lion? Smaller and much more passive.</p>
<p>Same goes for humans. Look at us now, mostly fat, passive and depressed. The true key to health is living free.</p>

        <p>Probably to a degree but it's mostly that captive lions are guaranteed meals whereas wild ones have to hunt and scavenge plus there's more risk of injury in the wild which takes a price on the immune system</p>

        <p>They are the ones that have been and STILL are pushing this hysteria. They keep changing the Covid plan, from encouraging/extending lockdowns, mask wearing now even after you’ve been vaccinated, and my favorite. The ridiculous push for vaccine passports/proof of vaccination. Going as far as to encourage companies to not hire an employee that hasn’t been vaccinated. Travel restrictions, etc. Brief background here, I’m an infectious disease RN and this has been blown WAY out of proportion. I have worked with hundreds of Covid pts and it’s unbelievable and absolutely ridiculous how the liberal media has wrongly and unreasonably turned a mole hill into the biggest mountain ever.</p>

        <p>How many people do you know that have been close to death because of COVID? Or young people who are struggling with long COVID months after they have been sick - developing arthritis, or being constantly out of breath? I know quite a few, and also a few that have died. Despite all of the measures taken to contain it. Now look at the excess mortality graph in NY when it all began, and imagine what would happen if nobody lifted a finger to contain it.</p>
<p>I guess nurses don't have to have a good education or a critical thinking skill.</p>
<p>&rt; mask wearing now even after you’ve been vaccinated, and my favorite</p>
<p>Really shows that you don't understand the situation at all. This is about being able to enforce a rule without too much overhead. If you allow vaccinated people to not wear masks in a common area when mixed with unvaccinated people, how do you ensure that there are no anti-mask retards taking off their masks without having vaccination? Check everyone's vaccination IDs all the time? That's a fuckton of effort. Simpler to tell everyone to wear masks, and if one doesn't, yell at him and kick him out.</p>

        <p>Bold of you to ASSume! No community college for me, however on behalf of numerous fellow nurses and nurse practitioners I know that at some point did go to a community college, your comment was incredibly rude and unnecessary. I’m going to ASSume now as well that you lean left on the political spectrum? The reason I’ve assumed this, is bc strangely enough it’s the “compassionate, bleeding hearts, oh so tolerant and accepting of everyone” leftists I ever seem to get the nastiest and most hateful responses from. The irony is the craziest part of it though. It’s as if you guys are opposite of everything you claim to stand for? Maybe why you go so hard with the virtue signaling? I mean, you gotta try and be convincing somehow.</p>

        <p>I am 100% being honest, based on my personal front line daily experience with it. I have no personal agenda to “sell you on” or reason to be dishonest with you. I’ve noticed a good portion of people on this sub are anti vaccine or hesitant to it (which is totally ok) however I’m not necessarily anti-vax, though admittedly a bit hesitant to the current “rough draft” being pushed. I’m going to say something that would trigger tf out of the woke leftists. Something said previously by many, but was quick to get extreme backlash. Covid-19 is very similar to the flu in more ways than what’s being reported. The flu can also be deadly, however Covid is NOT and has proven to not be nearly as deadly or life threatening for most people as what’s been reported.
Now if the bubonic plague or say Ebola were to break into a pandemic, or even at an epidemic level, then I expect everyone including myself to be genuinely concerned.</p>

        <p>COVID is a at a pandemic level because it's not as deadly as Ebola. Ebola kills you too fast for you to be able to go anywhere and spread it, so it wouldn't have the same spreading power that COVID does. The media is over blowing its deadliness, but it really isn't all that similar to the flu. But then again, what did I expect. How about you go bring the patients their snacks while the doctors actually work on the problem?</p>

        <p>I think the way that society is more gravitating to secularism is causing this insane fear of death. People who believe in religion are more likely to put their faith into god and live their lifes, "knowing" that if they die that day it was just god's plan and that he works in mysterious ways or whatever. Also believing in an afterlife where you get to see all your descendants or anyone you loved who passed has to be incredibly comforting.</p>
<p>My larger point is that it should be fairly logical to understand how living to 35 in a free, hedonistic even, way is far better than living to 80 as a terrified slave who has no freedom. There are certainly things worse than death. I think religious people have a built in capability of understanding that better than atheists.</p>

        <p>Coping with me own mortality has been a really difficult thing to deal with, it's the root of my anxiety.</p>
<p>However I have semi recently began to pray and contemplate God and my existence.</p>
<p>I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I believe in God, and this gives me comfort.</p>
<p>Death is not the end, it can't be. How can this universe and the world around us in all of its infinite wonder and complexity exist without a divine creator, the concept of the universe blinking into existence from nothing seems more insane to me than the idea of a creator.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it doesn't make sense to me that we are all born just to die and that is it nothing else, there has to be something else after our souls pass on from this plane of existence.</p>
<p>I certainly have no interest in dying anytime soon, I have so much to live for and I have been blessed with everything I could have ever wanted, but I find comfort and peace in Christ.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight, love life, love freedom, and enjoy everyday and don't waste your potential, don't let the current political climate and media insanity lower your morale, everything is temporary and this too shall pass.</p>
<p>God bless us all</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm an outlier, but being non-religious is what's fueled my frustration during this year of lockdown specifically because I don't believe that I'll see my loved ones when I die and I feel like I'm running out of time to be with them. </p>

        <p>I agree. I'm agnostic, but my own beliefs surrounding life, death, and the universe comfort  <em>me</em>. I'm totally fine with dying. </p>
<p>And I'd much rather live to 35 in this life completely free and hedonistic too, because that's when the human body is still young and capable of enjoying life to the fullest. My body will inevitably break down after a while and be unable to sustain and repair itself.

        <p>Yeah, I'll still take secularism over religion. I mean it's practically the same thing as what's going on. Brainwashing, mass hysteria, demonizing your fellow human for living their life, (sinning) forcing people to live a restricted life based on lies to make them behave a certain way, more about control than concern. Don't forget about rules for thee and not for me. I could go on. I'm not trying to sound like some edgelord, I just can't understand how some people don't see the parallels. Is fearing death worst than fearing hell?</p>

        <p>Could it possibly be that God hates sin because He’s jealous for your own good, knows that it’s wrong, but we want the control and somehow think our way is better than God’s?
God promises everlasting life through faith in Christ Jesus into what He did on the cross for your sins. 
Lived a perfect life, took the price that we should pay, paid that debt in full so that we might have life through Him.
It’s a free gift, no good deeds can pay for it, we’re not morally sound to the slightest, it’s only by His grace you can be saved, and offered free and open anytime.</p>

        <p>&rt;My larger point is that it should be fairly logical to understand how living to 35 in a free, hedonistic even, way is far better than living to 80 as a terrified slave who has no freedom. </p>
<p>Very understandable. Believing in religion increases a person's happiness overall anyways. </p>
<p>But why do so many people think the pandemic lockdown is going to last for a very long time? I would be okay with going through a lockdown for a year if it meant my family and I had a lower risk of dying. A year is much different than 80 years. This doesn't even touch the point that many people have adapted to life in the pandemic and have found some way to be happy in their new normal. I do believe it is a minority opinion to compare lockdown to slavery, but I digress.</p>
<p>Anyways, think about the people who valued freedom over health and died from the virus as a result. Would they still be fine with their decision after they died? Or do you think they would have changed their mind to live another 50+ years after only 1 year in lockdown? Rationally, anyone would trade 1 year to be able to live another 50 years.</p>

        <p>Before the vaccine, the only way to be safe was to have others social distance and wear a mask. This is because masks don't protect the wearer, they protect people around the wearer.</p>
<p>Now with vaccines being widely available, I give it only a month or so until these binding requirements of masks and social distancing are lifted.</p>
<p>That was why I framed my statement as "1 year in lockdown", as in the period before the vaccine started rolling out to the general population of all ages.</p>

        <p>I would be confused because that would mean the vaccines didn't work like how the studies and data said they do. If the government kept the restrictions in place when the data says the vaccines do work, then that would be poor leadership by not listening to data.</p>
<p>My state (Michigan) already created a formal plan to reopen based on vaccinations, so I think this scenario will be unlikely.</p>

        <p>Framing it as “freedom over health” is disingenuous and trying to paint a thousand shades of gray with black and white.</p>
<p>I value freedom and I value health. I also value my ability to make reasonable and informed decisions as to what is worth giving and taking for both.</p>
<p>That being said, I personally subscribe to the whole “I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees” thing.</p>
<p>I will decide for myself if I need to seclude myself from society or wear a piece of cloth on my face for science. The minute the government tells me that they are going to control what I wear and what I will and will not inject into my own body? Fuck you. Bring it on over and we’ll see who gets what.</p>

        <p>I'm sure the government will realize that they can't force people to get the vaccine, because it would lead to violent protests which they wouldn't want. That's why I think that once everyone who wants a vaccine gets it, lockdown restrictions will be over.</p>
<p>Also, how does wearing a mask inhibit your freedom? If you are a healthy young person then you should have no side effects from wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Also please try to be civil, I've done nothing against you. I'm just a third-party trying to mediate conflict.</p>

<p>The globalists already have people in ‘mental prisons’ though, so restricting physical freedoms won’t be that hard at all.</p>

        <p>You can be behind bars and still realize ‘hey I’m behind bars’. It’s not what I know or don’t know, it’s simply asking the questions.</p>
<p>If I turn on the news, I can pretty much know that they’ll show me stuff to make me upset. When I’m on the internet I can expect to see shit I don’t agree with so I’ll interact with it.</p>
<p>They want to force people ‘off the grid’...we can’t communicate as effectively off the grid, it divides us even more. </p>
<p>To misinterpret this as ‘you’re behind bars and I’m not’ is dumb, We are ALL in the mind prison. But it’s not a real prison, we can still get out anytime. Technology isn’t inextricably linked to ‘the man’. Technology is a tool they use against us but one that we can also use against them. Technology isn’t evil, technology is the answer. </p>
<p>To say that I ‘think I’m better’ or superior in anyway is so unbelievably false. We are all equals. No human being is ‘above’ another. That’s like a non issue. </p>
<p>Spoiler: you’re doing exactly the opposite of anything constructive. You disagree with something? Call it crazy. Dismiss it. You literally, in the most back handed way, tried to imply that YOU are, in fact, the superior one.</p>
<p>Sir, we are all equals here.</p>

        <p>I wonder about this too. I sometimes even wonder if this whole thing might be some huge "moment of truth" sifting process, some social/psychological experiment to gauge the no-bullshit, do-or-die values and convictions of the masses. Like narrowing down the rebellious tendencies, seeing how many will just shut up and take it as long as they have their DoorDash and Amazon and Netflix and video games, seeing how many will be willing to sacrifice these creature comforts for freedom, etc.</p>

        <p>It's funny that mostly Americans yell about freedom, while living in one of the least free countries in the developed world (https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores?sort=desc&amp;order=Total%20Score%20and%20Status for example). Why don't the freedom lovers move to a better country, like Chile, or Finland?</p>

        <p>If I were only allowed to live 3/4 of my life in order to live it 24/7 I'd take that chance over living 100% of my life only 75% of the time.</p>
<p>I blame my upbringing for these avoidant behaviors yet the only failure it's brought me is in the financial sector. Honestly if you want to work for more than your essentials then you're prioritizing gain over growth. Buying a boat might make you happy but building one with your kids in the time saved would create memories. The only impact covid has had on my life (aside from ongoing medical issues tangentially related) is that I could no longer mindlessly consume. Everyone I knew continued their life unabated and I'm the only one who caught it.</p>
<p>If you're upset you can't idle around strangers anymore I can understand the frustration but this is one of the most heavily monitored times of human history and the government can go suck a prolapse if they think they can get any information to create a standard deviation off me.</p>
<p>Go out to ball games if you want. Just wear some sort of mask until it's as rare as heart cancer, you can still see facial expressions in people's eyes.</p>
<p>I've dropped to a lower o2 level after smoking than constant monitoring through wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Honestly the virus isn't bad as long as you drink the recommended amount of daily water intake. Worst that happened to me was snapping a muscle in my head because my body wanted more o2 and I breathed too deep through my nose.</p>
<p>Stay safe, stay free, try not to kill anyone.</p>

        <p>You all are cracking me up. This is ridiculous. You need to spend some time in prison if you call TEMPORARY quarantine for the sake of the greater good imprisonment. Most places are beginning to open up because educated people actually took the vaccine and did the RIGHT thing. So, why are you people still complaining at this point? I swear… y’all are a bunch of entitled babies. I know calling names is going to just raise up the heat, but I’ve been reading these threads for weeks. And as someone who actually works in medical science, reading these threads is like reading the tabloids. Completely false, but very entertaining. Tonight, I just couldn’t stop myself from jumping in. I just hope no fool contracted COVID and died because of the misinformation on this thread. Because then I may actually feel bad for finding it entertaining. … imprisoned. HAH! I think you have been quarantined in our lovely country for too long. You don’t know how gooooood you have it!</p>

<p>The reason is a mandate is because it's temporary. That's the reason it's not a law.</p>

its a primordial fear. its resonates with just about anyone.  </p>
<p>you don't believe your government would use a primordial fear to control you?<br>
the german government did just that. and even admitted to it (theres documents about it if you cared to look it up).<br>
they were deliberately telling people only of the worst case scenarios and about suffocation specifically. for the exact same reason.<br>
people fear this. afraid people are easier to control.</p>

        <p>This is a false dichotomy - those are not the only two options. </p>
<p>Also, no one believes in freedom. You believe in freedoms. You accept that no one should be free to do whatever they want, there has to be guidelines. </p>
<p>I get the feeling the things you would consider "imprisonment" are mandatory things like wearing masks, lockdowns and vaccinations. Sorry, but you live in a society with other people, and certain things need to be done for the betterment of society as a whole. </p>

        <p>Name a freedom I think that should NEVER be taken away? What's the purpose of this exercise?</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is a good one. But that's kinda my point, there are still limitations. You don't have the freedom to yell "I have a bomb!" in an airport. </p>
<p>All freedoms should be allowed by default, then you apply the necessary limitations, based on why they're needed.</p>

        <p>Well there’s your problem, the lockdown here in the uk banned <em>all</em> protests (even BLM, even a small one with masks + social distancing). </p>
<p>They also just cancelled the elections. </p>

        <p>I don't have enough information to decide whether those bans are necessary or not. But that's not the point, the point is that "removing basic human rights" doesn't appear to be what's happening here, and again it's all dependant on the reasons for it. If you can't protest (I assume meaning street protests with large crowds) then it's wise for that to be banned if it'll end up spreading the virus further.</p>
<p>I'm a big advocate for human rights, I just understand the nuances associated with them.</p>

        <p>It's selfish to not want to die from a contagious disease and agreeing with the temporary restrictions put in place to protect high risk people like me?</p>
<p>I feel bad for the protestors but unfortunately I do agree with the arrests due to violation of pandemic guidelines. They indirectly risked lives by doing so, which disqualifies the 'peaceful' condition of the right to protest. Don't be walking smallpox blankets. It has consequences.</p>

<p>That is incredibly lucky of them, but the cdc guidelines are there for a reason and we should abide because they're experts in the study of epidemiology as well as diseases. Sucks that idiots made the government enforce them by force but people don't listen. Like a bunch of entitled children.</p>

        <p>Yeah! I have asthma! I can't risk going outside unless I absolutely have to! Thanks to you dolts! Your insistence on putting personal convenience over the lives of others has made it too dangerous for high risk people like me to go outside at all!</p>
<p>That is not what I said and you know that. Nice try. But just in case you're that much of a smoothbrain I'll spell it out for you more clearly.</p>
<p>CDC proved that clustering together increases risk of disease spreading.</p>
<p>Yes you can gather anyway and not get sick, because it isn't a 100% guarantee. However the risk percentage IS high enough that sane and rational people wouldn't roll those dice. They wouldn't gamble lives for their own sake. Since people wouldn't listen of their own accord the gov't had to step in and make them cut this shit out. Ya know. Do their job of protecting the health and lives of their citizens.</p>

        <p>Serious question, how do you eat if it’s too dangerous to walk alone to a post box without seriously risking your life and also too serious a risk to your life to have anyone collect your vote from your house?</p>
<p>Also proxy votes exist for people who can’t go to vote in person, please god tell me how that would spread anything to you?!</p>
<p>Again, your argument doesn’t make sense there isn’t a 100% guarantee you won’t die driving a car but yet they’re not banned. You’ve provided no evidence protests spread covid yet you support (and I can’t stress this enough) the blatant violation of basic human rights. </p>
<p>Isn’t the purpose of government to protect the rights of its citizens? </p>
<p>Now you haven’t admitted you don’t support human rights, can you do that or is that too hard for you?</p>

<p>As for the protest statistics, you’ve already admitted protests didn’t spread covid but here in the UK since January, we’ve had illegal protests from anti lockdown, Extinction Rebellion, Kill the bill (an movement against Conservative party bill limiting rights), Sarah Everard (a women’s March against a police officer who murdered a woman), and socialist May Day protests. Despite this, the cases are continuing to fall and no cases. </p>
<p>Raw case data: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases</p>

<p>You clearly don’t understand how case rates work, the <em>case rate</em> has decreased since January. Obviously the cumulative cases increased, it’s literally impossible for that graph to go down and unless covid was completely eliminated it has to rise. What matters is the rate at which it does, if protests did cause a spike in cases, this would be reflected on the daily new cases graph I supplied from the official government website. </p>

        <p>Needed to refresh myself on what proxy voting was exactly before I could answer. Make sure I had my facts. The short answer is if they make sure to use fraud prevention measures and don't run afoul of secret voting then it could work. Could. It has one more pitfall than mail in or in person. I can see how a gov't might not have the extra resources to spend on that in the moment until things get under control again. The no elections bit does sound like a temporary measure after all.</p>
<p>Cumulative counts all variables possible when it comes to cases. I trust that over other data categories as it minimizes the chance that crucial variables were left out to push an agenda. If cases in the UK had dropped then at minimum then the cumulative graph should show a plateau.</p>
<p>Looking at the daily my problem is, cases are STILL happening. The guidelines are helping but it's falling pretty shallower than it should be. Meaning the disease is STILL spreading. Mass group protests are a viable reason as to why that descent in the graph is so shallow. </p>
<p>Now if the protests are done per cdc guidelines then should be okay. If not, I can't begrudge the gov't for forcibly dispersing a plague mob.</p>
<p>Now. I am DONE with this conversation. Good day.</p>

        <p>What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Obesity, drinking and smoking have far more complex solutions - people get fat because humans need food, and we over-indulge because of desire and sometimes as a coping mechanism. Drinking and smoking are again ways of coping with hardship and sometimes mental health issues. </p>
<p>What's the point here?</p>

        <p>Taking responsibility for ones health is a great solution for the many problems, though. It’s barely been discussed from a media standpoint. Instead we see news stories about people lining up for a vaccine, then lining up for a free donut. (Not that my expectations of mainstream media is high) But it’s not just the last year that proves that, decades of obesity-related illness have been making the American medical system go ‘round. They like us afraid, unwell and subservient.</p>

        <p>No one who has ever been dead can say that fighting for freedom is better than life, eh?  </p>
<p>Some people who have chronic illness still find reason to live, and some decide they want to kill themselves.  I think it's a bit wrong to criminalize this, but in most of the US it's still illegal, and a point again, where freedom is debated.</p>
<p>Even being chronically ill doesn't mean you stop valuing your freedom. So your comment is pointless.  Yes, some people might be willing to give up their freedom to stay safe, or if they believe that will keep them safe, but plenty are still willing to die or risk injury because they value that freedom.  </p>
<p>If living like a housepet for the rest of your life makes you happy, go for it.  Plenty of us are fine taking the risks of being a wild animal, even if we won't be as protected and it might be horrible at the end.  It's forcing your values onto others that's so disagreeable.</p>

        <p>Well, it is a fight for freedom. If the powers that be can coerce or force you into living the type of lifestyle they deem acceptable, they can and will do a hell of a lot worse to you in the future than just "make you wear a mask or not go clubbing for a year." You won't see that until they come for a freedom that you value, and by that point, it will be too late. You will not be able to say no.</p>
<p>You are missing the point completely as to what is going on right now. If you would like to hear reasoning as to why the New Normal is absolutely terrible, or why one must protest even the most minor coercion of public health measures, I can answer any questions you might have. You might find that you don't necessarily disagree with me on a lot of things.</p>
<p>If you would rather continue to engage in grade-school name calling, you can do that as well. Nothing you say could hurt my feelings, but it will speak volumes about you.</p>
<p>This American from a "flyover state" - that you evidently view poorly - has heard it all. Stupid, uneducated, rednecked, inbred, incestuous, small penis'ed, weak, scared, Q-Anon sheep, MAGA terrorist, and any variation of those have all been done before. Let's hear what ya got.</p>

        <p>Post 1/2 - pretty long, be warned!</p>
<p>Well, those are good questions. I'd like to preface this with saying that I love science. Science is responsible for almost all of the good things we have in our lives. </p>
<p>But "Science" as we have in 2021 pop culture is not objective. It is extremely biased as a result of the current nature of academia and research. As someone who has a good bit of experience with this from working in academia, I can tell ya - certain organizations/individuals hold insane power over what gets published, regardless of the quality of the research itself. </p>
<p>A lot of junk gets published and even passes peer review, and a lot of quality work never will see the light of day due to the establishment not accepting it. </p>
<p>(As a disclaimer, I'm not a virologist, MD, epidemiologist, or anything like that. I worked in a "soft science" field. You're not gonna see me discuss whether or not vaccines/masks/various treatments work, because I'm not qualified to talk on the science behind those things. However, I am experienced enough to be able to determine whether research was conducted using legitimate methods, whether there was bias/conflict of interest, etc. Pretty much anyone can do that with a little bit of training.) </p>
<p>Given the fact that most researchers rely on corporate funding to do their jobs, and the fact that those corporations have a vested financial interest in ensuring that research casts them in a favorable light, one mustn't take "Science" at face value. </p>
<p>You must analyze the methodology of research, look for conflicts of interest among the researchers/institutions that conduct/facilitate it, and determine whether or not the research itself is credible. And that's when looking at something published in a scientific journal. Oftentimes, people who claim to "trust the Science" are claiming that we should trust a biased media source's take on said research rather than look at the raw data for answers. </p>
<p>If you just "trust the Science," you outsource the job of checking credibility to someone else, who may or may not have your best interest in mind. They have the potential to abuse that extra knowledge that you either don't have or don't make use of. </p>
<p>Science is skepticism. What separates science from religious belief is the lack of blind faith. We should not "trust Science." That is a terrible idea. We should constantly be asking questions - how solid is the research? What are the conflicts of interest? If this science is applied, what are the ethical concerns? </p>
<p>Religion would ask none of those things. Religion demands blind faith from uneducated masses - think of how the priests of old would be the only ones able to read the Latin Bible to their English-speaking congregants, ensuring that if you wanted to have a connection with God, you had to go to church and do what they said. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you couldn't read the Bible for yourself and question what it said. It creates a system ripe for abuse. If you have to go through an intermediary to see the truth, you are being exploited. </p>
<p>And that is what we have today with Science as a religion. The average person has zero ability to read scientific research and interpret it on their own. I would wager that the vast majority of the folks saying "trust the Science" could not tell me the difference between blind and double blind studies without googling the terms. </p>
<p>Now, we have the priests of Science that are the sole holders of knowledge. They can and do abuse that power. And that is scary. So much of the population has bought into the idea that not only is establishment-approved research infallible, but the messengers of the establishment are as well. </p>
<p>These followers of Science act similar to religious fanatics. Doing things like obsessively sanitizing surfaces (after a large body of research has pretty well shown that fomites don't effectively spread SARS-CoV-2) or wearing a double mask on a solo hike in the woods (where there is an infinitesimally small chance of coming in contact with the disease) is insane behavior indicative of severe mental illness. Yet these behaviors are shockingly commonplace, and encouraged in the media as well. </p>
<p>And all of that troubles me. Science has been bastardized and turned into the very thing it was supposed to counter - blind faith. If you have much experience with science, it will trouble you too when you take a step back and really look at it. We are going down a dark path there. </p>
<p>The turning point, as you asked, was when Dr. Fauci lied to the American public on national television, and put the health of every citizen at risk because he didn't feel that we could be trusted. </p>
<p>The quote from Dr. Fauci in March 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic: </p>
<p>"Right now, in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks. There's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is." </p>
<p>Later on in July 2020, he said this in reference to his earlier quote: </p>
<p>"Back then, the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them (referring to healthcare workers) because it was felt that there was a shortage of masks." </p>
<p>This means that at the time of his first announcement, he knew goddamn well that masks worked to stop the spread of SARS-COV-2, and that they kept people from getting sick. </p>
<p>This wasn't a case of "emergent information" leading to a revision, no, he lied to us intentionally because he personally thought that keeping enough masks for healthcare workers was more important than protecting individuals. </p>
<p>He didn't come out and tell the truth and say, "look, masks work. But please, for the love of God, don't stockpile them. Wait for our healthcare workers to get a supply first." He lied to us intentionally about their efficacy in order to keep us from using them. </p>
<p>Every maskless grandma who got sick and died in the month of March 2020 (before he issued his April advice that masks should be worn by the general population) is blood on his hands. </p>
<p>He lied to the American public, and likely cost people their lives. Let's say masks work - in that case, had those vulnerable people worn masks, they likely would not have caught the SARS-COV-2 virus and perished from COVID-19. </p>
<p>Why is this bad? It means that he determines whether or not you should suffer for the greater good, not you. He is playing Russian Roulette, but with the gun pressed against your temple, not his. </p>
<p>Perhaps he has seen preliminary research from the manufacturers indicating that the vaccines have an awful side effect down the road - let's just say for argument's sake that side effect is permanent infertility in 1/100 people who get the shot. </p>
<p>Do you honestly believe that he would admit it now? Nobody that hasn't already been vaccinated would get a shot after news like that broke. Anyone who has been vaccinated likely won't be back for boosters against future variants. </p>
<p>That would be the end of herd immunity from vaccines. The COVID death count would keep on rising, and it would be on his hands. Newer, deadlier, and more contagious variants will run rampant now. </p>
<p>However, if he just shuts up about that side effect, and never warns anyone, vaccination efforts will continue as planned. COVID will be relegated to history, and he will be praised as a hero. </p>
<p>All's well that ends well, right? Well yea, except for the 1% of Americans who were just robbed of the ability to choose whether or not to participate in something that many consider to be the meaning of life. </p>
<p>Those who were previously healthy and took the vaccine were made into unwilling martyrs - 80 year old grandma with severe dementia got to live in a semi-vegetative state in a nursing home for another 3 months because she won't be dying of COVID, but now her 20 year old granddaughter will be living a hollow life for the next 70 years unable to experience the joys of raising children of her own. </p>
<p>And that is where this all ties into freedom. </p>
<p>I'm all for following health measures. Even if COVID is just a cold, why the hell would I want to get a cold if I could easily avoid it? I feel that most of us would willingly take reasonable measures to prevent the spread of a disease, especially if COVID is as bad as those in power say it is. </p>
<p>But that's the thing - it should be a matter of choosing to do those things. It should not be forced or coerced. </p>
<p>Once you take away autonomy, you are just asking for horrible, evil things to happen. </p>
<p>Going back to my earlier hypothetical vaccine example - for someone like myself who views having and raising my own children as quite frankly the most important thing I will do in my life, and who has almost zero risk from COVID (given that I am young, in excellent health, and have already had it and recovered) I would never choose to get a vaccine that could render me sterile, even if it were such a small chance. </p>
<p>But what happens if the government says that I must be vaccinated to ensure herd immunity, whether or not I am comfortable with the risks that come from receiving that treatment? </p>
<p>What happens if I am unable to enter a grocery store to buy food to eat unless I can prove vaccination? Do I really have a choice there, either? Just because it's not the government forcing you to do something at gunpoint doesn't mean that it's not still coercion and wrong. </p>
<p>In those cases, if I am like most people, I will be receiving a medical treatment against my will, and without informed consent (they likely won't be honest enough to tell us all the risks that come from the treatment.)</p>

        <p>Post 2/2</p>
<p>If you have any knowledge of science, you will know that one of the absolute most unethical things you can do is give people treatments (especially ones that are still in experimental trials like the COVID vaccines) without receiving informed consent. </p>
<p>In normal times, that would have been grounds for revocation of all credentials, civil and criminal liability, and a plethora of other negative consequences. Now, it's completely acceptable, if not encouraged. </p>
<p>Usually, when you bring up how masks and vaccines shouldn't be forced or coerced, someone will bring up seatbelts, and how nobody protests them being an infringement of rights, so therefore we should view pandemic measures the same. </p>
<p>There are two reasons why that argument falls flat - the fact that vaccine makers are completely shielded from any and all liability as a result of their products harming people, and the fact that you can take a seatbelt off and not drive should you choose to not use one. You cannot un-take a vaccination. </p>
<p>If a seatbelt is defective and harms me, I will have grounds to sue the pants off the maker, and I will win. If an experimental vaccine harms me? Tough luck. </p>
<p>I'm not going to get into the criminal histories of the companies making the vaccines - but if you want to spend the next week of your life reading them, you won't probably ever be using another one of their products again without some serious questioning. </p>
<p>So we essentially have completely unaccountable highly-prolific criminal enterprises that now have the ability to force every last person to purchase and consume their poison or face serious personal repercussions. </p>
<p>How the hell is that freedom? </p>
<p>How is it freedom that the government can arbitrarily shutter and destroy small businesses to the benefit of large corporations that are not subject to pandemic lockdown measures? </p>
<p>How is it freedom that we cannot choose for ourselves the level of risk we are comfortable with? </p>
<p>Let me say this - if COVID were like an airborne version of rabies with a 100% death rate from your brain essentially melting, you would not have to force me to stay at home or wear a mask. I would not leave my house until it was eradicated. I am not anti-science or "Mr. Macho Man Disease Can't Hurt Me" at all. I simply view that the level of risk you take is a personal matter. </p>
<p>If 80 year old obese grandma with four preexisting conditions is (rightfully) afraid of contracting COVID, then she can stay at home like I would in the above scenario. If I were faced with a terrible death from contracting a disease, I would do everything to avoid it. </p>
<p>But why should a healthy teenager or young adult's life be put on an indefinite pause, when all credible statistics point towards the fact that COVID objectively proves next to no risk for them? </p>
<p>Why must they give up some of the most pivotal years of their development, when they never agreed to do so? </p>
<p>That is not freedom. </p>
<p>Grandma should be free to isolate and get vaccinated and quadruple mask. It makes sense for someone like that to take every measure to stay safe. Also, we should come together as a community to help ensure that people like that have access to resources that they cannot safely get to during a pandemic. </p>
<p>But young people such as myself should also be free to live our lives and experience the events that will shape the rest of our lives, as they have for every prior generation. </p>
<p>Freedom is your right to live your life in the way you see fit. Be it taking every COVID prevention measure or none, that is freedom. </p>
<p>If you want me to enumerate specifically the freedoms that we lost, however, I can do that as well: </p>
<p>The right to assembly - obviously gone with lockdown measures limiting when and where you can assemble, as well as the reasons for doing so, and how many people can join you. </p>
<p>The right to association - see above </p>
<p>The right to protest - see above </p>
<p>The right to free speech - there has been a major crackdown on "misinformation," which is a very nebulous and arbitrary term. Anyone who questions the New Normal or authority can and will eventually be silenced for spreading "misinformation." </p>
<p>The right to religion - see above parts about assembly and speech. Religious ceremonies have been greatly limited in many places, or banned outright. </p>
<p>The right to bodily autonomy - by forcing or coercing vaccinations and mask use, our right to determine what we do with our bodies has been stolen from us. </p>
<p>The right to informed consent - see above. You cannot give informed consent if you are not presented with all information on the risks of a procedure, or if you are being coerced or forced to undergo it. </p>
<p>The right to petition - we are unable to redress grievances over pandemic measures, as they largely have not been enacted by elected officials. Instead, unelected bureaucrats such as Dr. Fauci and unaccountable corporations have been the driving forces behind the limitations on our rights. </p>
<p>The right to travel - lockdown measures and quarantines have made it impossible to travel freely. </p>
<p>State/local rights - smaller, rural states that have little spread of COVID and low risk of the disease overwhelming hospital infrastructure have been forced to take measures similar to super-dense cities like New York, when there is no reason to do so. The residents of these areas do not have the same risks as a city-dweller, and there is no reason to enact the same measures in both places. </p>
<p>The right to due process - due to the theory of "asymptomatic spread," everyone is considered guilty until proven innocent. The default state of man is now "disease vector," not human being with rights. </p>
<p>Depending on where you live, you can be subject to different penalties just for going about your life like you used to, even if you are not infected with COVID, because of the idea that you possibly could be and just don't know it. </p>
<p>Instead of quarantining the sick and those proven to be infected, everyone is being deprived of their rights and freedoms without trial. This is a terrible precedent, and opens the door for a lot of bad stuff. </p>
<p>If you think that any of this stuff is temporary or "just until COVID is over," I got bad news. Just like the Patriot Act and the massive assault on our rights and freedoms it brought with it, COVID-era measures that siphon away even more of our autonomy will not only never go away, they will be increased over time. </p>
<p>20 years after 9/11, and we are still taking off our shoes and getting groped before getting on a plane. The NSA is still reading every post we make and every message we send, listening to every call we make, watching everything we look at online, and cataloguing it all. </p>
<p>20 years from now, we will still be living like we were in a pandemic unless we put our feet down right now and do something about it. </p>
<p>I hope that I was able to make some points that you might understand, and hopefully agree with. At the very least, even if you don't agree with what I have to say, hopefully you can see that there are legitimate reasons to be opposed to what is happening right now. </p>
<p>Thank you for asking questions, and for taking the time to read my post.</p>

        <p>In your science to religion theory, I completely agree with tainted testing and research being an issue. But where does that end? My spouse is a microbiologist. They have had a crazy decrease in flu positives (2 since the pandemic started at a 125 bed hospital that also services 2 hospitals without labs and several medical facilities in that area) and obviously a plethora of positive Covid-19 tests. I trust my spouse wholeheartedly but can I trust the analyzers? Do I trust the programmers that set up those analyzers? </p>
<p>That then opens up an entire line of questioning that you touched on. Do I trust anything from the medical field? If the training received during education is flawed to the core I can’t trust any medical professional for anything. </p>
<p>The “checks and balances” are supposed to balance that out. But if both sides are backed by corporate interests a real theory can never be developed. If a standing bit of knowledge is challenged by a new line of scientific reasoning but both suffer from a conflict of interest that taints the results nothing can be trusted. This idea would resonate throughout time. Not just today, but hundreds of years ago as well. And not just in the field of medicine. Tesla vs Edison comes to mind as a not so distant past example.</p>
<p>As far as Fauci goes, he made or was forced to make a serious mistake. Absolutely could have cost lives. But other political figures did far more damage to American lives. You bring up masks as Fauci’s downfall and the turning point but after this terrible error was made, he attempted to rectify this mistake for months with little help from the administration. By little help I mean actively spoke out against or refused to participate in mask wearing. </p>
<p>Because of the speed in which this vaccine was created and distributed, I am sure that the future will hold many surprises yet to be foreseen. I know you are just stating the infertility as just one of the possible side effects but many people don’t feel the need to procreate. 500,000 vasectomies are preformed annually in the United States. If the fear is cancer, millions of humans continue to smoke. Diabetes? 1.5 million new cases a year and people just don’t care. I won’t trust those numbers are 100% true, but we both know the figures are astounding.  </p>
<p>The argument about the “what if’s” is only setting us up for more questions. What if there are zero side effects but no one take the vaccine for 10 years waiting for the science to prove it’s safe? What would the death toll be then? One would assume herd immunity would be reached, but what if covid-19 mutates into a 90% death rate? Highly improbable, but what if? What if we all had the chance to be vaccinated but some chose not to and 90% of those people died. And then what if those that made a choice continued to spread the disease because they refused a vaccine? </p>
<p>I actually agree fully that only those who want the vaccine should get it. But I also think that those who make the choice not to get it must take responsibility for that choice. As you can be young and healthy and recover fully from covid not everyone is or can. If they made a choice to attempt to protect themselves and someone else chooses to endanger them how is that fair? The seat belt analogy isn’t really viable here as seatbelts physically only effect the wearer or non wearer. I think a better analogy would be condoms. They are designed to protect both parties and have a failure rate and design flaws. If party A demands a condom be used and party B agrees but partially through party B removes the protection device party A is now in a potentially dangerous situation. I would say the party B would be at fault as they chose to remove the protective device. Party B took the freedom of choice away from party A. This choice could cause death. This choice could cause life long impacts. This choice could cause children. Does party B have more rights? Shouldn’t party A have the right to safety?</p>
<p>The idea of vaccination to gain entry is not exactly new. The public school system has required it for years. (They also require polio vaccine............ which is completely asinine. Hasn’t been a case of polio in the US since 1993......) The military requires it. There is still a choice though. A child can be homeschooled or a soldier can pick a different career path. They don’t have their right infringed upon do they? No, they are offered a choice. Just like the covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>So freedoms. The tough one. As a person that has come to the realization that I have never been fully free maybe this is easier for me to grasp than others. Of course I have so many freedoms and truly I have a better life than so many before me or currently. So I am not just stating I am a slave to the system (unless this is actually all just a simulation), just that I am not legally allowed to do whatever I want whenever I want to. I don’t expect that because I think my fellow humans also deserve a level of freedom so that in itself voids any potential I have to ever be fully free. </p>
<p>So many laws are there to prevent freedoms as a way to make sure everyone has some level of freedom. It would be illegal for me to discriminate on my hiring practices based on religion. Makes sense. I shouldn’t have the right to stop people from bettering themselves just because they have a belief different than mine. </p>
<p>I can see where you are coming from on every point you make and some I even agree on. I want this to turn around and I want people to be able to enjoy life to the fullest. I think you may be taking it to far with the freedoms that have temporarily been infringed upon but I understand how it’s scary when everything seems to be turned upside down. I have witnessed protests from many different viewpoints that weren’t stopped outright. I know it’s more difficult to practice religion but it can still be done. International travel I am completely uneducated in, but I live next to an interstate and I see many out of state vehicles traveling. Even before vaccines were being issued. Life has taken a turn. But adaptation is what made humans top of the food-chain. This virus is just another chance for us to overcome an obstacle. We need to work together though. </p>
<p>So I gather you want big changes. What do you think is the best path forward? What kind of changes do you want to see locally? I have been thinking about making a run for city council. There are some policies here I would like to change</p>

        <p>Well the lockdown here in the UK removed the right to protest (yes even with a face covering, yes, even BLM), cancelled the 2020 elections (didn’t even do it over postal vote, just cancelled them), and have made it illegal to leave without an approved reason ... so would you say these restrictions are worth complaining about? I would. </p>
<p>I’m very sick of people insisting it’s “just masks and clubbing”, it’s really not.</p>

        <p>Not at all. I’ve been incredibly ill twice in my life for months, the second time for more than a year. Lost my job, my fiancé, my apartment... everything... and let me tell you what kept me going, the hope of gaining my freedoms back. You’re not free if you’re truly ill. But what is the point in being healthy if you’re not free?</p>

        <p>Because it's funny that people who have never been sick actually think they'd rather be sick. They'll change their tune the moment they have cancer or something trust me.</p>
