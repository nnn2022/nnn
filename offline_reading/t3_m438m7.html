        <p>This is so fucked up. The Chinese people are fully responsible for this bullshit by not standing up to this dystopian tyranny.</p>
<p>Same goes for us in other parts of the world for letting governments force us to wear stupid masks and grounding us in our homes. We are weak and responsible for this.</p>

        <p>Actually, It’s Australia’s fault. I see this is an article by an Australian publication. </p>
<p>Australia has facilitated bringing millions of Chinese students to Melbourne university over the years, and teaching them to develop this surveillance technology that is currently being used.</p>

        <p>China is just the beta release. This is coming globally. Add digital currency to the mix and you have complete control of the population. </p>
<p>Vaccination passport and mandatory digital id is one of the key enablers. Hence the exaggeration of all things covid</p>

        <p>The problem is that they now have the biggest navy, the most economic growth, most capacity to build 5G stuff, etc etc etc., while USA tries to get more transgender pregnant soldiers onto their rusting ships. </p>
<p>I am an evolutionist at heart, and I believe that there is a natural selection for systems of government as well. And so far China keeps winning.</p>
<p>I am sure in the next few years some people in USA will start questioning if USA deserves independence, or that rather that USA should be intergrated with China as a Special Administrative Region, like Hong Kong.</p>
<p>When you think about, all domininat information about USA is that USA is inherently bad. China is a factory of the world, whilre USA is a factory of systemic racism, inequality, injustice &amp; climate change &amp; COVID. How long people will keep believeing in America under such bad press? How long  do we have until someone like AOC gets elected under slogan of 'dismantling America'?</p>
<p>It's a similar process to the fall of Soviet Union. When soviet people lost faith in their communist system, they looked at USA as a good example of everything. It did not last long, but it lasted a good few years.</p>

        <p>&rt;China is building a digital dictatorship to exert control over its 1.4 billion citizens. For some, "social credit" will bring privileges — for others, punishment.</p>
<p>&rt; A vast network of 200 million CCTV cameras across China ensures there's no dark corner in which to hide. </p>
<p>&rt; The Communist Party calls it "social credit" and says it will be fully operational by 2020.</p>
<p>&rt; Within years, an official Party outline claims, it will "allow the trustworthy to roam freely under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step".</p>
<p>&rt; The system will be enforced by the latest in high-tech surveillance systems as China pushes to become the world leader in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>&rt; Surveillance cameras will be equipped with facial recognition, body scanning and geo-tracking to cast a constant gaze over every citizen.</p>
<p>&rt; Smartphone apps will also be used to collect data and monitor online behaviour on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>&rt; Then, big data from more traditional sources like government records, including educational and medical, state security assessments and financial records, will be fed into individual scores.</p>
<p>&rt; Several companies are working with the state to nationalise the system, co-ordinate and configure the technology, and finalise the algorithms that will determine the national citizen score.</p>
<p>&rt; It's probably the largest social engineering project ever attempted, a way to control and coerce more than a billion people. </p>
<p>&rt; If successful, it will be the world's first digital dictatorship.</p>
<p>&rt; But social credit will be affected by more than just internet browsing and shopping decisions.</p>
<p>&rt; Who your friends and family are will affect your score. If your best friend or your dad says something negative about the government, you'll lose points too.</p>
<p>&rt; Who you date and ultimately partner with will also affect social credit.</p>
<p>&rt; China has long been a surveillance state, so the citizenry is accustomed to the government taking a determining role in personal affairs.</p>
<p>&rt; For many in China, privacy doesn't have the same premium as it does in the West.</p>
<p>&rt; The Chinese place a higher value on community good versus individual rights, so most feel that, if social credit will bring a safer, more secure, more stable society, then bring it on.</p>
<p>&rt; But most don't seem to comprehend the all-encompassing control social credit is likely to have, and there's been no public debate about implementing the system inside China.</p>
<p>&rt; In private, there's been some disquiet in the educated middle classes about the citizen score being the only criterion for character assessment.</p>
<p>&rt; But that's not going to stop the rollout.</p>
<p>&rt; The Party is using the system to win back some of the control it lost when China opened up to the world in the 1980s and rapid development followed.</p>
<p>&rt; It's a way to silence dissent and ensure the Party's absolute dominance.</p>
