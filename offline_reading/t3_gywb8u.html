    <strong>How are your relationships changing amid this divide between the furious, snitching. self-righteous shut-ins and us?</strong>
    <p><p>Is the divide that clear in your peer group? Are there any fence-sitters? Any people you have completely fallen out with amid all this?</p>
<p>I still don't even know really who I'll continue to be close friends with after this.</p></p>

        <p>This is the thing I'm feeling worst about at the moment actually. A few close friends are strong in their beliefs and truly do not understand mine. They think being skeptical is very politically incorrect. But they can't see the forest for the trees. They see themselves as "doing their part" but can't see how deep the damage of lockdown is and will continue to be. I'm so shocked at intelligent people with whom I've never realy disagreed with before have bought in so hard without question?!!
I will and have definitely lost friends. Social distancing has done a great job. It should maybe be called social isolating.</p>

        <p>&rt; I'm so shocked at intelligent people with whom I've never realy disagreed with before have bought in so hard without question?!! I will and have definitely lost friends.</p>
<p>I fell the same way. There are a few friends (and to me, they are still my friends even if they are mad at me) that have attacked me via text after I answered their questions truthfully.</p>
<p>I work in a hospital, I'm a frontline employee manager. So I was inundated with panicked texts and calls during the first few weeks. At that time I was pro-lockdown myself, not knowing what to expect.</p>
<p>Ironically, it took about 2 weeks for my opinions to shift, since I was seeing first hand what was happening on the ground.</p>
<p>As things progressed, some continued to contact me. As I provided the truth of the situation, that we were running at 20%-25% bed capacity and were furloughing (and eliminating) positions because the "surge" never arrived, some of my friends flat out called me a liar. I understand having a bias toward "good news," but why people seem to outright <em>refuse</em> to see any, even if it's provably true, is really confusing to me.</p>
<p>As of <em>right this moment,</em> if you were wondering, I'm preparing for our morning report, there has been a grand total of: 6 COVID patients seen in our hospital, total, and 0 deaths. Our county has over 1000 confirmed cases as well.</p>

        <p>I’m depressed at how I feel like I’m an outsider in my generation (in my early 30s) because I’ve been questioning the lockdown since March. The virtue signaling that has come out of coronavirus and the protests is appalling and narcissistic. People posting 20 Instagram stories in a row to prove they were at the protests and even posting screenshots of their donations. People are so self-centered and so ignorant to the economic and mental health affects of the lockdown. A lot of people I know are already pretty privileged for people in their late 20s/30s and complain about boomers being privileged when really they are no better than the boomers they criticize. Now people are posting memes that glorify 2020, like “it’s our year!” and “we’re gonna get ten chapters in a history book!” Yep, cause it’s totally someone’s year if their business went under. I’m an extrovert by nature but have found myself retreating a bit.</p>

        <p>Yup! 35 year old in Brooklyn here and definitely an outsider. My friend keeps being “shocked” that I’m “one of those people”. Like, because I was only wearing a mask in stores that required one, now it’s because I don’t go to protests. I keep my opinions to myself and don’t stop my friends from doing what they believe is right. I have one friend I can call and openly talk to. </p>
<p>And the mental health aspect is REAL. Wow. I don’t even want to get into it, but I was the target of someone’s violence when they were having a psychotic break this weekend. I handle stress very well and even I have had to spend a lot of time laying in the dark trying to slow down my heart rate.</p>

        <p>It’s a whole long story, but basically they’re very into whatever riots/protests/strikes are trending. I don’t believe they are passionate about the issues but just love to cause chaos. They believe what they are doing to be extremely virtuous and get upset when others aren’t applauding them. They were also selling drugs to “fund the revolution”, got arrested for doing something violent and premeditated, and thought they were being followed/surveilled and were going to “be disappeared” if they left the apartment. Then they basically tried to start a coup against me to take “control” of the apartment (I’m the only leaseholder, have been here over a decade, and own/provide literally everything while they’ve been here a year), but the other four roommates wouldn’t go along with it. </p>
<p>For three days in a row he had fits where they would yell at us (but mostly me) for about an hour while telling everyone  “shut the fuck up, I’m in charge now!”. The last one finally turned to him crying.</p>

        <p>Wow. So sounds like the mental health issues were already there to begin with. Although perhaps everything going on in the world exacerbated it. Not sure I would want to live with someone like that though. Stay safe!</p>

        <p>I connect with what you’re saying. I see a lot of my acquaintances have become unbelievably hypocritical; they are very pro-lockdown, yet don’t connect that the lockdowns hurt the lower economic brackets the most. Then they protest to show how woke they are. And yet they are so privileged to have white collar work-from-home, ordering takeout, larger homes/apartments, etc, while complaining/commiserating that’s ‘it sucks but we’re all in this together!!!’. </p>

        <p>I have kids and most parents in my town still refuse playdates and such things. Doesn't matter if it's at a house, at the playground, whatever. They won't budge.</p>
<p>Now, this part is anecdotal, but I do find it amusing. <em>All</em> of the parents I know that are willing to see me and my kids are doctors at the local hospitals. Ya know, the types of people who "should be" the most vulnerable and exposed when it comes to the virus.

        <p>There's a few friends/family that it's getting to the point where we will no longer speak. Or at least we will try to not speak about the lock downs and whats going on in the news. They are making it difficult though I'm trying to ask them something mundane like " read any good books lately?" Then they steer it into how me wanting bookstores to open is selfish and dangerous. If they wanna be sheep thats fine but don't expect me to be a part of the flock thats walking off a cliff.</p>

        <p>My biggest fallouts were online - I was involved with two groups, one a blog with regular commenters, the other a chat/ support group.</p>
<p>The blogger, despite being a smart skeptic type went full on doomer and shut down comments when people disagreed with him or pointed out flaws in his theory. We had no backup plan so the group died pretty much overnight. Many of us were years long commenters and had grown to know each other. Comments had never been shut down before.</p>
<p>The chat group immediately- as in march- turned about half shrill karen (one of the worst was a male karen) so I just left the group and won't be returning. What's funny/ sad is this group hadn't really argued or hugely disagreed about anything in the ~year I participated.</p>

I believe that some sort of social engineering is happening because people have become so radicalized overnight. I think social media has a lot to do with it. Also, a male Karen is called a Chad lol.</p>

        <p>I deactivated my instagram last night because I just couldn't take it anymore.  Someone I knew was sharing NY Times articles stating that we'll be doing this until Summer 2021, and others kept saying how "we're in a pandemic blah blah blah". I've had just about enough of some of my own peers who I've known for years now. </p>
<p>I even lost respect for my own classmates at my university, as they don't even think we'll be back next winter/spring, and would be willing to pay $10K for online education. </p>
<p>This "new normal" feels like hell. Life has never felt so disgusting.</p>

        <p>I don't have Twitter, but shut down my Facebook and Instagram accounts. Everyone is fighting with everyone and pointing fingers and publicly shaming others for not agreeing with them (whatever their stance is, it's so multi-directional and contradictory- I got tired of it). I'm <em>fairly</em> new to reddit and enjoyed many of the pages until recently, now even reddit is starting to follow suit after other social media networks.</p>

And how come they know literally no one with a serious case (no one hospitalized) even though we live in a major metro? They’ve all said if the cases don’t spike then clearly we could’ve been out the whole time and she missed junior prom for nothing which she’s bummed about. </p>
<p>We kept her from going out in early March for a bit til we knew a little more but after that we’ve let her see friends etc.</p>

        <p>It's as though, since lockdown skepticism has come to be associated with Trump and "red state voters", lefties cannot bear the thought of being associated with "those people". They're taking this to the point where they're allowing themselves to be publicly humiliated and their children traumatized rather than risk saying a white guy from Georgia was right about something. So, my friends and family--at least, the Democratic ones living in or near large metro areas--are still buying this bullshit. Even the ones who also support the marches and protests going on, as if that makes any damn sense.</p>

<p>Of course, I wouldn't be shocked if there isn't a lot of "Lockdown for thee, but not for me!" going on, too. "YOU shouldn't leave your house! I, on the other hand, being clean and smart and virtuous, can drive out to see friends in The Hamptons. I'll even half assedly wear a mask."</p>

        <p>I have no social media presence (unless you count Reddit) and <em>rarely</em> discuss politics beyond immediate family (not counting Reddit). However, I would be very surprised if there were any major conflicts with anyone I know.</p>

        <p>I don't talk to them anymore and have no desire to.  I have no respect left for them (and I doubt they have any for me) and if you don't respect someone, I don't see how you can be friends with them.</p>

        <p>Once I realize that someone buys the hysteria (like my in-laws, who have literally become shut-ins and are shocked I go on walks outdoors), I lose any respect I had for them. It's unpleasant seeing loved ones (or, not-so-loved, in the case of said in-laws) as gullible, cowardly, and not that bright. It's a shitty feeling to process.</p>

        <p>I don't talk to many of my friends these days. :( There are a couple of girls who disagree with my opinions on this, but it hasn't stopped them from engaging with me when we talk about other topics. A few people have unfriended me or don't interact with me anymore. I know a lot of pro-lockdown people, unfortunately, and I miss the active social life I had before all this started. Even when life restarts, we'll have a bunch of rules at our favorite places and I'm sure some people will still be too afraid to be out. It's going to be hard for a while. </p>
<p>Things aren't too bad in my family. My mom and stepdad feel this is overblown as well. I went to see my grandparents who are in their 80s this weekend, and it was at THEIR invitation. My grandfather knows they're in the at-risk group, but he also referred to the virus as "this nonsense." My gram said she and my grandfather talked about my visit all week before I came and were looking forward to it.</p>

        <p>It got worse when they went "if you don't sacrifice your soul to BLM, do not interact". Pretty much everyone was quiet about their rights being taken away until that happened.</p>

        <p>I've lost a lot of my friends.  Which isn't  as horrible as it sounds since I'm still relatively new in town so it's not as if they were life long friends.   They all are full lockdown supporters and I'm obviously not.  I also think that there can still be fun and leisure during a pandemic and it seems that was just too much for them.  You either need to be at home or out protesting but if you dare go out to grab a beer and watch some live music then you're just selfish and a possible murderer.   It doesn't even matter if you were at a protest before you grabbed that beer.</p>
