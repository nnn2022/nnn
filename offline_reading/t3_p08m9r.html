    <strong>I drink and smoke</strong>
    <p><p>I do bad shit to my body every day... but I can say confidently that only the most insecure idiotic, wack job of a puppet will take the jab.  I know what I do is wrong for my health. I wish I could stop.  Alcohol and smoking are my addictions. They started as I was a teen.  My whole family did it.  I've stopped and started again...never hard drugs.  What I can't understand is why people who would never touch a cigarette would let that carcinogen test in their nose, or a experimental vax in their veins.  Let it be known, I've had all my other vaccinations. Government's sheer obsession with the vax is horrifying at the least.  Fuck me...I rather room with Jack Nicholson' s joker than your ass.</p>
<p>Edit: plus you wish us dead.  I don't wish anyone dead except child rapist.  The joker was fine with just fucking up our face.  Look in the mirror. I don't wish you dead.  I could never kill someone unless they were about to kill me.  Pray to God he will forgive your hate.</p>
<p>Edit: I know I'm preaching to the choir but maybe one person reposts elsewhere. Because I'm banned everywhere which is proof of tyranny in itself. </p>
<p>I just has a troll, say I admitted in this post I have herpes. I made a comment in public freak out about asshats getting in a man's face at a store for not wearing a mask. The loser then researches my other posts to make commentary on me. For God's sake they are sick. Down-voted the crap outta me.</p></p>

        <p>I don't drink, but I smoke like a chimney and I'm asthmatic. I made the choice, I pay my hospital bills and really that is all that should matter. I don't ask other people to "protect" my non-existent health. Its assumed I caught the shit when it first started, I ended up in the hospital for 2 days for breathing treatments and supplemental oxygen which is about the norm for me. Felt like crap for around a week and have been back to how I normally am since.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to find the podcast or medical paper, but I heard a few days ago that nicotine might be very good to prevent the spike protein from covid-19 in latching onto our cells. There was a recent study done showing why smokers weren't as affected as non-smokers to covid-19. If I find the article or podcast I'll let you know (I think it was Bret and Heather on their Darkhorse Podcast on Odyssey).</p>

        <p>No the podcast I watched (I think it either was with Whitney Webb or Bret Weinstein) only talked about Ivermectin, Nicotine, and Melatonin. </p>
<p>I've only heard of Niacin being good for the stomach or intestines, but not sure if it's good against SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19).</p>

        <p>Dmitry Katz Phd has a covid Niacin protocol. https://twitter.com/nia3in/status/1411332149236715521?s=21  He mentioned smoking as being protective at some point in his copious tweets. I have been busy and haven‚Äôt really gone down this rabbit hole fully.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I've not caught the COVID, I think. I don't really even take precautions either. I sometimes think that if it was to get into me the Nicotine and booze would kill it.</p>

        <p>I neither drink nor smoke, but I see what's you're saying. We all know what drinking and smoking can do to you. However, we don't know what all the vaccine can do to you. New effects are still being found out about.</p>
