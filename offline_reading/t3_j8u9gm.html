    <strong>Friends Become Adversaries</strong>
    <p><p>I find it more and more difficult to maintain my relationships with old friends. I am concerned with big picture ideas and problems (for the purpose of this post I will use the example of the non virus, lockdowns, etc.) they are concerned with foolishness and passing trends, media, etc.</p>
<p>I am consumed with the need to spread the truth about the lies, manipulation, propaganda and the purpose behind it all, by every time I do I am rejected by those I used to think I had so much in common with.  They sometimes change the subject without acknowledging anything was said, or argue back with hurtful responses claiming paranoia or the like, or say I have no sources because they are not connected to their web of lies and the beasts that control them. </p>
<p>It’s not as if they are totally disconnected with the things I view as truly important in life. They are just on the polar opposite side, discussing the lies and their dead set beliefs while I’m around, while truth is thrown to the wayside and ridiculed. My choice becomes to be surrounded by lies and stay silent, speak the truth and battle, or speak about nonsense while seeing the true state of the earth.</p>
<p>The fire in me to spread the truth does not go away if I keep my mouth shut, it gets stronger, until I let it out and then it is replaced by silent emotions resulting from the backlash or lack of concern I receive. </p>
<p>I feel part of the purpose of all of this is to discourage us who are truth finders, make us seem crazy and unstable so we can be discarded one way or another. I for one will never give up or back down. For that I am glad to have found a place here with likeminded people who are also able to think critically, discern between true and false sources, and see with open eyes. The question becomes what I do with these relics of my old self, my friends who are slowly becoming adversaries. What do I have in common with them now? Nothing. I no longer live in the world they do.</p></p>

        <p>there's still things you have in common, we all do - in a few days, years or decades we all will be dead, we all breath the same air etc.
but, it's not your fault that your friends are brainwashed. stop wasting your time trying to open their eyes, I know exactly how you feel - like if you'd be trying to explain to a blind person how does the colors looks like, not an easy task.
we don't have much time left, better spend your time putting some evidence together, 1-2 A4 pages, print many copies, hand some to your friends (so you don't have to repeat yourself all the time) and then let them live their fairytale about how the government is trying to save us all, they're lost if they haven't figured out what's going on by now.
rest of the copies drop in your neighbors mailboxes or something, try to spread the truth to wider circle, not just your friends.</p>
<p>try to have yourself as your best friend, that's the best advice I can give you right now. sometimes it's better to walk alone, keep on going</p>

        <p>There are two types of people here.</p>
<ol>
<li>One that didn't have a chance to see the reality.</li>
<li>Those that are set in their minds.</li>
</ol>
<p>If its the second, you still have a chance. Don't go attacking their beliefs, because it doesn't work. And you have to give it time. Because accepting something contrary is akin to turning their world upside down.</p>
<p>If your friend is truly close, you might have a chance.</p>

        <p>Every now and then we have a post here or on LDS about what made people wake up. Sometimes the smallest offhand remark makes people think. Arguments are likely the worst way.</p>
