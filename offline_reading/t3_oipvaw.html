    <strong>Does the fact that one has to argue whether the virus is real or dangerous already show that it is not that big of a deal as it was hyped to be?</strong>
    <p><p>This question about has been on my mind for quite some time. It seems that two biggest letdowns of 2020 were Covid and Cyberpunk 2077. </p>
<p>We keep hearing about “covid deniers” or how “covid is underplayed” by certain groups of people, those anti-vaxx, anti-science stgine age mongrels. The doomer and covid cultist crowd have been vocal about amplifying the dangers of covid, then long covid, and now variants while subjective experiences of an inceeasing number of people seem to clash with that narrative. </p>
<p>Personal disclaimer: No one I personally know nor anyone in my second circle of acquaintances had any complications due to covid, let alone die. It has been almost 18 months and the virus has circulated through all of us with symptoms ranging from cough and elevated temperature, a bit of headache, to no symptoms at all. Perhaps that’s a subjective and anecdotal experience, however to me it opens this question about the reason why so many “deny” or “underplay” covid.  </p>
<p>Yet, almost 18 months into this ordeal with the global pandemic, there is still space to argue whether the virus is real (not my position though) or whether it is that big of a danger that we are led to believe it is. One would think, if 18 months of a “global pandemic where people are dropping like flies” is not enough to convince people in the dangers of a respiratory virus, then perhaps it is not that dangerous nor lethal after all? We were led to believe that people would be dropping dead on the streets and that long covid is worse than any other condition (can’t smell your hazelnut latte for three weeks? What a tragedy).</p>
<p>Why don’t we ever hear about flu deniers, cancer deniers, AIDS or ebola denial? Nobody in their right mind would be able to deny the existence of a disease/virus so visible, present and dangerous after all. </p>
<p>The very fact that the doomer crowd has to keep arguing about the existence of the virus and fight to prove it at all, even after all this time, indicates that it simply never was a big deal nor anything that we should have uprooted our lives and destroyed societies for.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a software developer and analyzing data is an important part of what I do.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the relative threat of a disease, you have to pick input data, that is comparable with other diseases or the absence of disease.</p>
<p>A new test-method that you only apply to one particular disease is of no value to compare how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>For the method that I would use, I don't even need to know how many people are affected. Only at what age the affected usually die.</p>
<p>This I would compare to overall live-expectancy and voila, we have a very simple to obtain and calculate value to determine how dangerous the disease is.</p>
<p>We simply substract the average age of covid victims from the average life expectancy and we have a "death acceleration time", that we then can use to weigh the impact of our measures against.</p>
<p>I think it doesn't matter whether there millions or even billions affected, if the live-expectancy is no different.</p>

        <p>We trusted the Chinese scientists that gave Christian Drosten the genetic code, <em>“without virus material”,</em> to build the bogus “Covid” PCR test protocol but we don’t trust Chinese scientists that stated there’s no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.” ^1, ^2, ^3</p>
<h2>Christian Drosten created the “Covid” PCR test:</h2>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1, ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet”</strong> ^2, ^1</p>
<p>&rt;”Christian <strong>Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said: ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS.</strong> Where fatalities were previously reported, <strong>now mild cases and people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics.</strong> This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the <strong>local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Dr. Pieter Borger said, ”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper was already finished.”</strong> He said these facts “should have been on television long ago. I explained it on LinkedIn, but you get banned if you do.” <strong>Regarding PCR he said, “You are not detecting a virus.”</strong> ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich</strong>who is central to a growing group of lawyers, scientists, politicians, and even secret pharmaceutical whistleblowers, said in an interview, ”We believe that in order to make this house of cards collapse, we have to attack the PCR test. <strong>The fact is, there are no asymptomatic infections.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;This seemingly radical claim was bolstered by a paper out of Wuhan of all places, published by Nature.com, which found no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.</p>
<p>&rt;”The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a history of COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, and identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases with a detection rate of 0.303 (95 % CI 0.270–0.339)/10,000. … A total of 1174 close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative for the COVID-19. … Of the 34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19, 107 tested positive again, giving a repositive rate of 0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%.) <strong>Virus cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and repositive cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive cases detected in this study.”</strong> ^1, ^3</p>

<p>Im still baffled how easy it was to convince the world, using a technology thats fundamentaly not capable of discovering disease, pushed by doctors known for overstating risks of diseases... Like... As Bhakdi said: Where are my students?</p>

        <p>Not German, I’m in the Rockefeller “Empire State” and grew up hearing a bit about their rackets from older family members. Have read lots over the years. </p>
<p>Now Nazi collaborator, IBM, which is controlled by the Rockefeller Syndicate, is pushing Excelsior Pass in NY. </p>
<p>Dr. Bhakdi is great. If only more would listen to him. Since the start of Covid, I’ve been sharing Bhakdi’s videos with people. </p>
<p>So before Covid I was aware of Pharma/Rockefeller racketeering and of some of the HIV/AIDS debate involving Kary Mullis, Peter Duesberg, Etienne de Harven, Robert Strecker and the corruption of Robert Gallo. 
So that’s helped me seek the truth during these times.</p>
<p>Bhakdi sums it well here:</p>
<p>&rt;“I think that the pandemic is a fake. It was based on a PCR test that was highly fallible, dangerously inaccurate, giving false positive data, that was unfortunately taken as the main diagnostic criterium.”</p>
<p>&rt;-Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi

        <p>Ha thanks. I hear ya. I’m not looking forward to what might happen in this Rockefeller State. Hope we get pushback against Excelsior Pass.</p>
<p>I’ve got to say, I’ve been informed by a few other resident German folks in addition to Dr. Bhakdi regarding Covid. Reiner Fuellmich, Torsten Engelbrecht, Claus Köhnlein, and Stefan Lanka. Going back much further: Peter Duesberg. Of course, some of these professionals are labeled by Pharma, and its cronies, as being a “denialist” for being troublesome to the racketeering overlords.</p>

        <p>Well, you see.... there is one thing what you need to rethink... why is there no vaccine against cancer or HIV? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because people would still get it, even after the "vaccine" and we would realise, that they don't actually know how to make any vaccines and is based only in the belief in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since people are vaccinated against it, they stop getting it (or stop believing in it) and would ruin the massive business behind cancer and HIV.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, the pharma is an evil organisation, you shouldn't trust any word what they say.</p>

        <p>That's what I was thinking. If it would really be as deadly there just would not be the whole discussion about everything. Everybody would have somebody in their first or at least second circle that died or be seriously affected by the virus. Everybody would just stay at home without orders and get the vaccine without needing to be forced or bribed to do so.</p>

        <p>What are the chances? I would have understood if the poster above decided to go with one person, but four?! After 18 months I do not know anyone nor anyone in my friends’ circle knows or has heard of anyone with heavy covid symptoms, let alone death. </p>
<p>18 months, no hospitalizations, no deaths, just a disease that reminds of common cold. So I hope you understand my skepticism and why I perceive all of this nonsense pretty much like a smokescreen. But that’s just my anecdotal experience.</p>

        <p>3 of my aunts died from it. at least 10 immediate family members of them have to still quarantined. my older sister contracted it a couple months ago. The hospital she works at has to expand the covid ward bigger everyday. Oxygen is scarce and many hospitals have to reject patients due to lack of beds or oxygen. She saw 5 patients died in the same hour in one room once. It's no longer an argument or hyped issue for me personally, especially with two geriatrics parents.</p>
