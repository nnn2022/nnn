    <strong>This One Goes Out To The Shills/Brigadiers/ProLockdowners. You Caused This.</strong>
    <p><p>https://twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1357489459273605120?s=19</p>
<p>This is what you wanted.</p>
<p>Police being given a green light all across the world to beat and abuse kids, adults, and the elderly for breathing in public. </p>
<p>To all the morons that bombard this sub with hatred, judgements, and overall general nastiness, YOU caused this.</p>
<p>We just wanted to be left alone. We dont care if you wear masks. We dont tell you what the hell to do with your own bodies because we recognize that WE HAVE NO SAY IN HOW YOU CHOOSE TO APPROACH YOUR HEALTH. </p>
<p>If we dont wear masks, but YOU do, why the f<em>ck do you care?? If anything, YOU'RE safer than US if COVID is so damn dangerous, or do your masks NOT prevent incoming germs (</em>gasp* maybe masks dont work??) I'm not even gonna talk about how the CDC's numbers show COVID is nothing to lockdown over, but I just want you to know, dear reader, that this is end result of the fucking lockdown shills urging to control what everyone else does with their bodies. It leads to this.</p>
<p>To my dear doomer, take it all in. All the innocents that are being beaten in the streets for daring to breath uninhibitedly, or to commit the HORROR of supporting their families in the midst of a pandemic/economic MELTDOWN, all those millions of lives that have been lost and destroyed?</p>
<p>It's not because of COVID.</p>
<p>It's because of you. Your disgusting desire for controlling the individuals around you. Your putrid FEAR.</p>
<p>WAKE UP, SHILL. YOU DID THIS. NOT US.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I will say this. One cannot be anti police brutality, and pro lockdown, at the same time. We cannot have lockdowns without having police making innocents bleed in the streets.</p></p>

        <p>“This would’ve been over in x months if literally every person complied!”</p>
<p>No, this would’ve been over had you not collectively rolled over and showed your bellies, complete with the word “VIRTUE” crudely self-stamped on them, to an uncaring and corrupt government.</p>
<p>How many more times do you need to be told by your saintly and priestly arbiters of Truth and Science that these measures are here to stay? Not once did they say that its because they have not achieved the statistical impossibility of 100% compliance. Not ONCE.</p>
<p>The great mask debate is a classic, distracting divide and conquer tactic and not only did you fall for the divide, but you sided with the conquerors against your own kin thinking they want to protect you. Its not only cowardly, but its also downright naive.</p>
<p>This all stops when you grow a pair, stop placing religious faith in those who sought lucrative and powerful careers with very obvious connections and conflicts of interests, think for yourselves and put your feet down. What can The Powers That Should Not Be do when we all get on the same page?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Until then, we are on track to be swept into (under for those of us who resist it) a morally and spiritually sterile corporate technocracy intended to pilfer even more rights, power and money to a bunch of cunts not satisfied with what they have already stolen.</p>
<p>You’re not only <em>not</em> saving grandma (or intentionally sabotaged healthcare services), you’re also sentencing her descendants to serfdom.</p>

<p>Wanna point out the religious aspect of this whole situation. You're super right, the only way one can be pro lockdown is if they have a cult-like faith in the government's benevolence. I say cult because the faith requires the IGNORANCE of evidence that your faith is destructive to those around you. </p>

        <p>Unquestioning faith in The Science is a shortcut to proving intelligence and now morality to the herd, whether its in their physical community or on the global social media stage, something apparently a lot of people are desperate to do.</p>
<p>Even when The Science falls apart under basic scrutiny they will aggressively fight in its defence because it provides social value and a sense of self-worth for zero effort and at no <em>obvious</em> immediate cost.</p>
<p>All it took was permanently surrendering theirs and everybody else’s futures, no big deal. As long as they get to avoid the disapproval of the big, scary mob and convince themselves that they are good and smart at the same time, its all dandy.</p>

        <p>That's all it's about; control.</p>
<p>Imagine you're a doomer. You're following the rules, you're wearing your mask, and yeah it sucks, but hey! The TV and the internet says you're doing the right thing and helping your community by complying with mask mandates and public bed times. </p>
<p>What's this? Your neighbor isn't wearing a mask AND is having guests over? Well that's just not fair, so you call the police and tell them about your neighbor. 45 minutes later, your neighbors are being dragged out of their house in handcuffs, their kids being taken by child protective services.</p>
<p>It feels good, you feel validated. Someone did something you don't like and instead of ignoring it, you just point your finger and <em>snap</em> that violently offensive, rule breaking neighbor is gone. You just made someone disappear without lifting a finger, and if you're in NY, you just got paid for it!!</p>
<p>This is what we're dealing with. Orwellian indeed.</p>

        <p>Look I generally hold back but here we go.  Ya I have a consulting company that was doing pretty good before the covid hysteria hit.  My wife and I had been together for four years before she encouraged me to start it, look up old clients, and get it going.  It got going and going good.  But we decided to put all of that profit into an investment account, save it, buy some land, and buy our dream home, and we were well on our way.  We both took retail jobs and have worked our way up.  I have a VERY flexible schedule and she is making good bank in Pharmacy tech training.  2020 was supposed to be OUR year for making up for lost time, traveling some, going to the beach, taking a trip a month up to the big city to party and let her have some fun in her early 20's.  All this bullshit STOLE that year from her.  I've had the fun.  I've done all the clubbing, getting drunk, doing stupid shit, she has not because she stuck with me through the hard times when she could have left for a better situation at any moment (she's so hot my inner idiot nearly has a stroke every time I look at her and she's way younger than me).  So ya I'm fucking PISSED at the over reaction and the childish bullshit because it stole a year out of the life of the woman I love.  Personally I'm cool sitting at home, doing my consulting, and fucking around on the net.  But she said it was making me boring and fat and now I have a job on the side that keeps me engaged, fit, and interesting.  BUT again.. this bullshit stole experiences from her that she has never had and if the boomers get their way she won't until I'm dead and we can't share them.  </p>
<p>Fuck this shit.  </p>
<p>Okay back to being goofy and dispassionate.  Thanks for letting me vent.</p>

        <p>The very same people who screamed "Police brutality" are now saying, "Well, they should have stayed indoors and the police wouldn't have had to beat them."</p>

        <p>&rt; or do your masks NOT prevent incoming germs</p>
<p>This is unironically what they believe, actually. They genuinely think that the mask can block the virus in only one direction. That is where the "it protects other people" talking point came from. They think that wearing a mask blocks the virus if you breathe out, but if someone else breathes near you the virus can get in, which is why it is <em>super duper important</em> that everyone comply and wear 20 masks.</p>

        <p>Nope. This is what Police forces have always done. Usually it was based on racial profiling so the majority wouldn't care. So it's not because of Doomers. It's because your grandma who used her right to vote to give more power to the Police. It's because of your grandpa who went to war and has seen that a gun is the only thing that can protect his life and his family, and he went back and voted with the politician that offered the higher pension plan, damn those gun rights.</p>

        <p>They would not be doing this if it weren't for the suppression of this violence by the media, or the doomers cheering them on. </p>
<p>The fact that more than half the population supports police brutality on anti lockdowners absolutely gives the PDs an extra morale boost to beat the living shit out of anyone daring to show their face in public.</p>
<p>It's also the fault of those who voted for Biden, you are correct. I'm mainly focusing on the SJWs that throw the social justice out the window as soon as someone doesnt wear a mask or breaks lockdown.</p>
