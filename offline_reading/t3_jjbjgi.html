        <p>What does anyone expect when you have tech companies and scientific journals censoring completely legitimate scientists and others.  If they are censoring the Danish mask study, disinviting Professor Levitt to conferences, censoring discussions of HCQ by actual doctors, who knows what else might be covered up.  Why won’t anyone but Fox New and OANN have Alex Berenson on?  He strikes me as an engaging guest.  Paranoia about what is true and what is not is completely justified.</p>
<p>And how is this “conspiracy theory” not true?</p>
<p>&rt; Among the most widely believed Covid conspiracies is that the death rate of the virus, which according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker has so far killed nearly 1.1 million people worldwide, has been “deliberately and greatly exaggerated”. </p>
<p>With motorcycle accidents, alcohol poisoning, shooting deaths and people from in hospice being counted, how are they not exaggerated.  And then you have the fact that the media has manipulated people into believing that the deaths are much higher than even the reported numbers.</p>

        <p>Actually there <em>is</em> evidence that cv was created deliberately, there have been studies done that the majority of people think it has killed far <em>more</em> people than reported, and the word “hoax” is thrown in to make people who question these edicts sound like Holocaust deniers.</p>

        <p>I normally refuse to engage in conspiracy theories. To me they are a waste of time especially since likely it doesn't affect anything with me knowing. However, no conspiracy theory being true would surprise me in the slightest. Including if the world is run by paedophiles or reptilians.</p>
