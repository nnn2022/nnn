        <p>That's where they get you. Even if they struggle to implement a mandate for the rest of the population, if you want to send your children to government-run schools, you need to follow government mandates. Even, apparently, remotely, because "Elementary and secondary students who are remote are not exempt." This is a gateway. They haven't yet figured out a way to mandate coronavirus vaccine, but they will work on it.</p>

        <p>And the morons in r/Boston keep repeating the same garbage: the shot isn’t mandatory. You don’t have to send your kids to school. </p>
<p><em>What???</em> Both sides know damn well that the shot is de facto mandatory for all children, who have parents that work. But God forbid pointing this out, or else you’re automatically a horrible anti-vaxer that wants to kill children. </p>
<p>I’m not anti-vax. I am for individual choice and personal liberty. I support mandatory vaccines like polio and smallpox because they WORK and because of that fact, are legitimately for the promotion of public health. The flu vaccine is less than 50% effective and often causes more issues than it solves. I still get it usually, but it’s not that important to me to get. What really is the concern here is the government deciding to take your medical care into their hands. That’s what the protest is about, not anti-vax like the morons in r/Boston keep saying.</p>

        <p>I attended the protest yesterday and of course I couldn’t help myself after and had to go onto r/Boston and twitter. I wouldn’t say I’m antivax, but I’m definitely vaccine skeptical and even more than that, I’m against government overreach.</p>
<p>The opponents and critics of those who attended yesterday’s protest are unable to even attempt to fairly represent and understand the views of people like myself. They assume that everyone against the mandate is uneducated and low IQ conspiracy theories. The increased mockery of anti-vaxxers and anyone who comes close to them sure makes a lot of sense now, huh?</p>
<p>I don’t know what has happened to “liberals” and “the left,” because I have a feeling that in the days of say the Bush Administration this would be an issue they would oppose. Instead, they’re the cheerleaders of the pharmaceutical industry and proponents of government overreach, as well as the destruction of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice.</p>

        <p>Yes, these people are in favor of rape, which is what the forcible invasion of the body by a foreign object is, the ultimate violation of bodily autonomy. "My body my choice" only applies to abortion and to non-traditional sexual relations it seems. Considering they obviously have no problem violating the bodily autonomy of children (i.e. state-sponsored child rape), I think the right to abortion and to refuse sex would be stripped away too if maintaining it didn't serve to humiliate and negate traditional values. That might actually happen in the long-term future if Christians and conservatives disappear altogether as a threat to wokeness, but I honestly think the whole ideological edifice of the intersectional social justice movement will have long collapsed by then.</p>

        <p>You'd think they would at least send the parents who decline to comply with these public school mandates a voucher. After all, anti-vaxxers pay taxes too, and are being denied services they supposedly are paying taxes to get. In the interest of fairness it would be the least that could be done. Of course these people don't really believe in fairness or equality; they only use these concepts as weapons to gain power for themselves and their cronies.</p>

        <p>Actually, the state said that children can’t go to <em>any</em> school in the state if they don’t get the vaccine, not just public schools. That’s what makes it even worse. Good idea though.</p>

        <p>Good grief is right. If you homeschool, you don’t need the vaccine, but again, the vast majority of families can’t homeschool because they work during the week, so this is a de facto mandate, except for the rich. MA is also one of the only states that has a law pending in its legislative chambers to write in a mask wearing law into the MGLs (Massachusetts General Laws). I’m from MA, but in school in Ohio right now. Once I’m done with school, I’m running as far away from Massachusetts as possible.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is mandatory for people learning remotely? That is just insane, and shows this has nothing to do with health in the schools. If the courts had any sense they would strike down this mandate for remote students, since the usual rational basis that applies to in-person learning (i.e. stop disease from spreading in the classroom) doesn't apply.</p>

        <p>Mandating a flu vaccine makes no sense. The justification I read was that it would reduce flu cases so hospitals will have more beds for COVID-19 cases...except the hospitals weren't even close to being overwhelmed in March, let alone now. So what is the justification here? Nothing it would seem. Just an arbitrary and sadistic exercise of power. It must be resisted.</p>

        <p>Yep, but this was pre covid, though I'd be curious to see if I had anti bodies, since this was late October. My eyes were blood red and felt like glass, among many other things.</p>

        <p>I know a lot of people who got similar illnesses around the same time. Two co-workers came back from a cruise with it in late october. It was the first time in 6 years I actually got sick. My mother got the same thing in a completely different state around the same time. We didn't have any of the eye stuff, just respiratory stuff but nothing like any of us had ever experienced.</p>
<p>By the time it ran through everyone at work, it had mutated and almost got me AGAIN! I was able to fight it off with raw foods and apple cider vinegar the second time, which didn't work the first time.</p>
<p>I was a little peeved because I was setting a new personal record for years without an illness, lol. My previous record was about 6 years as well.</p>

        <p>No. My husband always gets a flu shot and nags me (in a gentle way) to get one, but I’m probably batting .250 so far. I don’t have strong enough feelings about it to bother, unless the opportunity steps right into my path and doesn’t cut into my day.</p>

        <p>They guess which strain is going to spread and they've failed the last 3 years in a row. I wouldn't ever get it personally, I've done my research. No safety studies; no thank you.</p>

        <p>I had to because hospitals in my area require you to get them to give birth there. Home birth was not an option for me.</p>

        <p>What?! Legally required or were you pressured?! This is insane, you don't give vaccines to pregnant women or infants!</p>
<p>Is everything okay? If you were forced I think you can sue. Good health to you and your family.</p>

        <p>Yup. To be admitted they required the flu vaccine, as well as for anyone who wanted to visit. I probably could have driven a few hours to get to a hospital that didn't do that, but who wants to go that far from home to give birth? Anyway, at least only the live virus is not safe. I totally understand how antivaxxers feel now.</p>
