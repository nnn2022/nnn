    <strong>To the followers of censorship.</strong>
    <p><p>To everyone who found some answers while searching the censored world it's becoming obvious that were reaching the climax of the movie. Frames are getting faster and people are being fuelled by streams of information or misinformation. Most can at least feel this. So much is going on so fast and it's getting faster.  Nothing is breaking the picture besides the own self sabotage of the weak chain by the upper members. All of it is accounted for with margin for error. We are obviously coming to an end game where someone is going down. This division that's happening is part of something much bigger and after all goes down, every side will do so much damage that being right or wrong won't even matter anymore. As the past is our future and were bound to make the same mistake over again the only thing that matters is the ones who win. While the same people who started this whole parade will start civilization V3.0 as the shadows of the new world. Nothing besides an alien attack right now would change the plan. This is not a case were you have the privilege to make it up as you go. Everyone right now is just playing their part on the narrative driven history.</p></p>

        <p>I hope we actually have real people, real armies fighting our side. And if they win, I hope they realise they were fighting a handful of elites and not just an army, and take out those elites.</p>

        <p>We're winning. It's why the third Obama Reich is trying to make it legal to go through your iPhone's (for now) gallery to find "illegal pictures" in order to make prosecutions.</p>
<p>No clear definition on what "illegal" is, or what it could morph into later on.</p>
