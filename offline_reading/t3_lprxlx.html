<p>covid deaths per 100k residents are 139 for Florida and 125 for california, very similar for the most and least locked-down states. florida with no mask mandate is well ahead of many other states.

        <p>If you want to use overly simplified statistics, here’s one:  the 15 states without a mask mandate average 150 deaths per 100,000 population, but states with a mandate average 139.</p>
<p>Now if you take a population-weighted average it’s 155 (no mandate) vs 150 (mandate). </p>
<p>Many states only began their mandates AFTER things got bad, so they’re considered “mask mandate states” although many of the deaths might have occurred while mandates were not in effect. That swings the argument towards masks helping.</p>
<p>Also, we should really do this at a local level because many urban areas imposed mask mandates even if the state didn’t. This probably swings the argument towards masks not helping. </p>
<p>Then you can’t forget that many people feel safer due to the masks and will increase their socialization which could counteract any benefit from the masks. This swings the argument again. </p>
<p>Anyways, my point is that comparing overal death rates between states is not the right way to ascertain if masks do anything.</p>

        <p>Hi there. Thank you for taking the time to post this, I do appreciate it and I do think that this is a pretty valuable source. Florida is exactly in the middle for Covid deaths/per 100,000. #25. California ranks #19. I compared all this information to the states that have mask mandates and the ones that didn't, and there's really not too much of a correlation. The ten states that have the lowest death rate per 100,000 all have a mask mandate, with the exception of Alaska, which has an incredibly low overall population and population density, so that's really no surprise. However, the bottom four states all also have mask mandates, and they're all concentrated around New York (New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut isn't much better). We're looking at deaths here, remember, so I wonder what is going on with the healthcare in that area. Probably something Cuomo related. I don't really have the time nor the energy to look into it right now. </p>
<p>The states without a mask mandate are then scattered throughout the middle. When you adjust for population density per mile, you see that the highest 20 states, except for Georgia, all have instituted mask mandates. Then it goes Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee, then the next seven all have mandates again. I wonder if that makes a role in the decision making process. Ultimately, I don't think that we can come to a conclusion simply based solely off this data. We're not looking at how effective masks are, and I wish we could say that we were looking at the efficacy of mask mandates themselves, but that's a lot more nuanced than the info I have here. I know you'd like to show that if mask mandates were effective, that those states with strict mandates would be doing great. However, even with strict mask mandates, you're going to have a percentage of the population not following them, and you're going to have places where they're not being enforced, like in Kentucky. Furthermore, we're looking at deaths here, not overall infection rates. When talking about deaths, you need to take healthcare into the equation as well. Just overall, it gets messier.</p>
<p>The last thing that I did was look at the infection rates, using the same site: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/us-coronavirus-deaths-by-state-july-1.html</p>
<p>Here you can see a clearer correlation between infection rates and mask mandates. The top 20 states with the lowest infection rates are all ones that have instituted a mask mandate, with the exception again being Alaska (which, again, only has a population density of about 1 person per square mile!) Out of the top 30 spots, only Alaska, Missouri, and Florida do not have mask mandates. In the top half, 88% of the states have mask mandates. In the bottom half, only 56% of the states have mask mandates. In the bottom ten, only four states have mask mandates (Arkansas, Wisconsin, Utah - dang Mormons and their super spreader events, and Rhode Island). Florida is doing surprisingly well, but they're certainly more of the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think we should keep looking into mandates to find specific things that appear to be working better than others. Take care and please excuse any typos. Thanks!</p>

        <p>That's not true.  I looked at your comment history.  You keep blaming Trump for all of this while ignoring the fact that it was the Democrats, WHO, Dr. Fauci, and media that were completely downplaying the virus telling people to go see movies, go to china town, ride subways, etc... WHO stated that there was absolutely zero proof of human to human transmission.  </p>
<p>At least FIVE democratic state governors signed executive orders forcing nursing homes to take in and keep covid patients which caused tens of thousands of lives.</p>
<p>The only person working to fight it was Trump.  He restricted travel, ordered factories to start pumping out PPE and ventilators like crazy, sent Naval hospital ships to New York and California, and built an emergency hospital structure in New York which provided over 2,000 beds.  All this was ignored and unused because Democratic governors didn't want to accept help.  Cuomo stated on air that he would refuse all help from the president.</p>
<p>This is what you post- You claim that Democrats did everything right and the Conservatives are responsible for the mess we're in.  </p>
<p>You aren't asking for information.  You're just coming here to tell us we're wrong.  I read several of your comments over the last several weeks.</p>

<p>He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds. He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York. Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that. He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals. This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>

<p>All different years. Someone even posted a collage of headlines dating back 8 years and every single one had flu cases overrunning hospitals.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you'll find a download link for an excel spreadsheet that gives the number of pneumonia / influenza deaths at each medical or nursing home facility in the UK from 2015 to 2017. It's quite a lot. Breaks it down by sex and age. This is way before covid so again, you cannot blame all this on covid or pretend it never happened before covid.</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, pneumonia killed 800,000 children, and while deaths from other infectious diseases, including malaria, diarrhoea are falling, fatal pneumonia cases are declining at a much slower pace. </p>

<p>Not everyone lives in the United States.</p>
<p>And the CDC is under a lawsuit for violating federal law and inflating Covid deaths by up to 1,600% based on this study:</p>
<p><a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf">https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf</a></p>
<p>It's been called out several times last year for inflating numbers. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>Sorry, but calling every single death a covid death is pretty fucking lame. I don't submit to fear porn.</p>
<p>Watch some of this doctor's videos. Check out her book.</p>

        <p>Hey. You told me to do my own research, so I did! Here are my findings.</p>
<p>Source 1: CDC inflating numbers by as much as 1,600%
Claim: CDC is under a lawsuit for this.</p>
<p>Dying WITH covid is not the same as dying FROM covid. A positive PCR test doesn't mean covid killed you. And US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710,000. That was just one flu season- BEFORE everything was called Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is a study performed by the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. I can't find much about them other than their website. They claim to be a not-for-profit organization that exists to perform scientific research in the public interest. The only other results I can find are articles and studies disputing claims that they are making, including this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144200/ </p>
<p>The study that the blog post points to as its primary evidence was produced by a private group called the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked a false claim by the institute’s leader James Lyons-Weiler. A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information also debunked Lyons-Weiler’s claim that the virus behind the ongoing pandemic was created in a lab.</p>
<p>In this case, the study does not definitively say that the CDC inflated COVID-19 deaths. Rather, it calls into question guidelines the CDC issued in March 2020 that were designed to more accurately capture mortality data related to the coronavirus. The study’s authors called the guidance "a capricious alteration to data collection has compromised the accuracy, quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of their published data." </p>
<p>Dr. James Lyons-Weiler (founder) claims to be a professor of Genomics at the University of Pittsburgh. The only thing I can find is that he is an affiliated faculty, but Pitt's web page of affiliated faculty does not list him. He seemed to have stopped working there in 2014. This is obviously a huge study, one that I don't have time to dissect (today). However, the claim that only 6% of COVID deaths were actually caused by COVID has been debunked many times now. The 6% that is being referred to are death certificates that only list COVID as the reason for death. COVID can cause many other complications that also attribute to deaths. If I have COVID, and then develop Pneumonia, both would be listed as a cause of death. If I have a heart condition, but die because COVID weakens my heart and kills me, both would be listed as a cause of death.</p>
<p>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/01/fact-check-cdcs-data-covid-19-deaths-used-misleading-claims/5681686002/ </p>
<p>US 2017-2018 Flu Season required: 710,000 hospitalizations. CDC reports it's actually 810,000. I see your chart at ychart showing we're at 859560. I'm not entirely sure where they're pulling that data. Is that currently hospitalizations? The CDC is reporting that the number for total admissions for patients with COVID is at 1,763,235. https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiY2ZjYzY4ZDgtOWRiMi00MTJlLWI0ZWEtODc5MTE2ZDA3OWNkIiwidCI6IjljZTcwODY5LTYwZGItNDRmZC1hYmU4LWQyNzY3MDc3ZmM4ZiJ9</p>
<p>The CDC reports that the deaths for the 2017-2018 flu season was only 61,000, which is only about 12% of the current COVID deaths, so it's significantly deadlier!</p>
<p>Note: I don't want to totally rule out this study, but I do want it to be peer-reviewed. The organization is sketchy at best.</p>
<p>Claim: And we all know that's over-inflated, includes every common cold and influenza, and is spread WELL OVER 1 flu season. </p>
<p>The reason the CDC intentionally inflates numbers is to account for the number of people out there who have COVID, but either haven't gotten tested or are not showing symptoms. </p>
<p>Here's a really great and easy to read article about it: https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-are-covid-19-deaths-counted-it-s-complicated </p>
<p>Claim: Influenza in Bolivia is the number one killer every single year.</p>
<p>Currently, Bolivia has had 244K COVID cases and 11,500 COVID deaths. In 2018, they have 6,259 Influenza and Pneumonia deaths. https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/bolivia-influenza-pneumonia (Note: I don't like this site, but those are the highest numbers I could find being reported. Other sources show it as low at 23 deaths!) </p>
<p>Source 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWNkJUDctdk
I don't have the time to watch Dr. Sam Bailey's video and debunk all the claims that she's making, so I'm going to just do a little bit of research on Dr. Bailey herself. </p>
<p>Here's an article debunking one of her videos though: https://factcheck.afp.com/new-zealand-doctor-makes-misleading-claims-about-countrys-pcr-testing-regime-widely-shared-youtube</p>
<p>The AFP is the Agence France-Presse, an international news agency founded in 1835. It is a “consumer advocate for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. Politics.” It is funded by the Annenberg Foundation, which funds many educational television shows.</p>
<p>Here's more: https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/09/canterbury-doctor-praised-by-nz-public-party-found-to-have-spread-misleading-information-about-covid-19.html</p>
<p>https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122842196/experts-slam-christchurch-doctors-claims-covid19-tests-are-unreliable </p>
<p>What kind of doctor is she, and where did she get her degree? All I can find is that she attributed to a book called “Virus Mania” and lives in New Zealand. Can find no evidence that she is a doctor of any kind.</p>
<p>Source 3: Claim: The New York Times: PCR is giving 90% false positives.
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html</p>
<p>That is a misunderstanding of what the article is saying. Basically, there is a threshold of how much of the virus you have to have to be considered infected. What doctors would like to see is how much of the virus you currently have, as that will be important for your next steps – should you quarantine? If so, for how long? Who are the most transmissible people? The point Dr. Mina appears to be making is that we should not only have a higher threshold (a lower sensitivity), but that we should be testing more often. </p>
<p><em>In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.
The F.D.A. noted that people may have a low viral load when they are newly infected. A test with less sensitivity would miss these infections. 
But that problem is easily solved, Dr. Mina said: “Test them again, six hours later or 15 hours later or whatever,” he said. A rapid test would find these patients quickly, even if it were less sensitive, because their viral loads would quickly rise. 
Highly sensitive PCR tests seemed like the best option for tracking the coronavirus at the start of the pandemic. But for the outbreaks raging now, he said, what’s needed are coronavirus tests that are fast, cheap and abundant enough to frequently test everyone who needs it — even if the tests are less sensitive. 
“It might not catch every last one of the transmitting people, but it sure will catch the most transmissible people, including the superspreaders,” Dr. Mina said. “That alone would drive epidemics practically to zero.”</em></p>
<p>Source 4: https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/</p>
<p>What is Off-guardian.org? “Sources in the Conspiracy-Pseudoscience category may publish unverifiable information that is not always supported by evidence. These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information, therefore fact checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources. Overall, we rate OffGuardian a Strong Conspiracy and Moderate Pseudoscience website that also promotes Russian propaganda.”</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Here's what I think is the same story for a better site, and it gives you a more well-rounded perspective: https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2020-11-27/covid-pcr-test-reliability-doubtful-portugal-judges/56962 </p>
<p>Doctors are claiming the lawyers misunderstood and misrepresented the studies. They go into more detail in the article there. Got a lot of sources to get through or else I'd look into this one more.</p>

        <p>As for your claim that the CDC is accurately recording deaths caused by covid-19, that's complete garbage because they've been recording every reported covid death as a covid death without any independent studies.  </p>
<p>What does this mean?  This means that if Illinois reports 12 covid deaths, the CDC counts 12 covid deaths.  I mean, do you really think the CDC does autopsies?  </p>
<p>Look- I'll show you what I mean:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg</a></p>
<p>Illinois Head of the Department of Public Health states that if there is a positive PCR test, the death is recorded as a covid death no matter what.  She says this in her own words to the camera in a video. </p>
<p>Dr. Birx says the same thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k</a></p>
<p>Deborah Leah Birx is an American physician and diplomat who served  as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator under President  Donald Trump from 2020 to 2021 </p>
<p>She's on video stating this.  You can't disprove this.</p>
<p>That is not accurate reporting of covid deaths.   And if you think that it is, just end this conversation now because we have nothing more to say to each other.</p>
<p>So, if all it takes for a covid death is a positive PCR test, then it's a good idea to be very skeptical because the PCR test itself is very suspect- more on that later.</p>
<p>From that fact check of yours:</p>
<p>" As with COVID-19, it is possible that a person’s preexisting conditions  exacerbated his or her death in the case of a drug overdose, for  instance, but it is inaccurate to say the main cause of death was not  the overdose itself. "</p>
<p>Drug overdose?  Really?  It really says this in there.  It says that if someone shoots up with a mountain of narcotics, they can't have just died of the overdose, because covid must have led to their death.  That's your source?  A claim that a drug overdose must be a covid death?  </p>
<p>Moving on....  </p>
<p><strong>Bolivia</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting that you bring up Bolivia.  The headline is that they are dropping like flies over there due to covid-19.  That's the headline and that's why you quoted it, right?  </p>
<p>I admire the fact that you're trying to do your research, but you're being lazy and not going about it the right way.  YOU saw this article and knew right away that it was solid proof that covid is a deadly virus that should be hidden from behind masks.  Let me tell you what I did a week ago the instant I saw this article:  I dove into the history of Bolivia.  I look at the last several years and this is what I found: </p>
<p><a href="https://causesofdeathin.com/causes-of-death-in-bolivia/2">https://causesofdeathin.com/causes-of-death-in-bolivia/2</a></p>
<p>In 2017, the second leading cause of death was Influenza.  The flu.  In fact, in every recent year, Influenza has been one of the top if not the top cause of death in Bolivia.  Do you know what the top cause of death was in 2017?  Heart disease.  Then it's stroke, liver disease, kidney disease, etc.. Easily adding up to the supposed number of "covid deaths".</p>
<p>Bolivia isn't fighting covid- they're fighting everything they've been fighting over the last several years.  Stop calling everything a covid death.</p>
<p>Not every heart related death is a covid-related death.  Not every flu-death is a covid death.   Not every Pneumonia death is a covid death.  And I really didn't think I'd ever have to say this, but not every drug overdose is a covid death- scratch that- ABSOLUTELY NO DRUG OVERDOSE IS A COVID DEATH!</p>
<p>Do you even know what the symptoms of covid are?  The symptoms are exactly the same as those from influenza INCLUDING LOSS OF TASTE AND SMELL.  That's right- they are exactly the same and the PCR test is complete garbage.  More on that later.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sam Bailey</strong></p>
<p>" I don't have the time to watch Dr. Sam Bailey's video and debunk all the claims that she's making"</p>
<p>In other words, you're saying, "She doesn't say things I agree with, so I'm just going to call everything she says bullshit."</p>
<p>Good to know.  You're just another doomer who thinks fact checkers know more than actual doctors because they literally call drug overdoses "covid deaths."  </p>
<p>That's not research.  You fail.  You literally get an F without even an E for effort.  You are a failure.   Disagree with her fine- but no- you literally said that you're just going to call everything she says bullshit because I used her as a source.  Yes, I'm calling you out on that.</p>
<p>Since you refuse to watch any of her videos because I used her as a source so you MUST know that she won't agree with you, then how the fuck am I to take anything you have to say seriously?   If this were a college course, I'd fail you for failing to do proper research.  Fact check is not research.   Every fact check I've read (including the ones you posted) have been garbage.</p>
<p>She's a New Zealand Doctor, but you don't care about that because you won't listen to people who you don't agree with.  Just like you failed to delve into the leading causes of death in Bolivia and you believed a fact check claiming that a drug overdose was covid-related.</p>
<p>No, I'm not going to stop bringing that up- you actually firmly believe that calling a drug overdose a covid death is good medicine.... Wow.... I mean you actually linked that to me on purpose....  </p>
<p>"Wow!  Calling a drug overdose a covid death!  That's BRILLIANT!"   That was you when you read that, wasn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bailey is spreading misleading information</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you what that means- it means that if you say ANYTHING against masks or covid, you are spreading misleading information.  I was banned from Facebook for posting a blog written by a microbiologist about the dangers of wearing and reusing masks.  Facebook's bots immediately deleted the post ind issued a warning- I posted it again and again and again until it banned me.</p>
<p>That's not stopping "misleading information".  That's censoring information you don't like.  It's not sanitary or safe to reuse masks, but facebook didn't care- I DARED post something against masks!</p>
<p>Fact checkers are FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE</p>
<p>All they do is censor people - like Dr. Bailey.  </p>
<p>I've already told you that I sort through the fact checkers and the claims of misinformation and do MY OWN RESEARCH!  You, live and die by the censors and call drug overdoses covid deaths.  Let's move on...</p>
<p>"Can find no evidence that she is a doctor of any kind. "</p>
<p>Your own fact check calls her a doctor and you don't believe them?  You'll believe it when they call a drug overdose a covid death, but you won't believe them that she's a doctor?</p>
<p>As for your "fact checks" who wrote those?  As far as I know, all of the authors are anonymous and yet you hang on their every word because you WANT to believe them.  I never believe anonymous sources.  Ever.  Especially when they call drug overdoses covid deaths.</p>
<p>It's apparent that you're not going to believe anything I have to say because you don't want to.  PCR test creator and Nobel Winner Dr. Kary Mulis even said that the test is and was not ever designed to be a diagnostic tool, but somehow, you believe that you yourself know much better than the guy who made the test.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sorry, but you get a failing grade.</p>

        <p>Ok so with the next five sources, you're claiming that Influenza overran hospitals before 2020. I'm not entirely sure what to say other than, yeah? I checked them all out (Wow Daily Mail's website is terrible). The most recent one is from 2015, one is from over 11 years ago, and one is from 1999. Because it happened before, that somehow proves it's not COVID? I don't think I understand. Hospitals in the UK are also in bad shape right now: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55362681 
https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-uk-hospitals-nhs-collapsei-doctors-nurses-2021-1 </p>
<p>COVID is also worse than Influenza in the UK
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsduetocoronaviruscovid19comparedwithdeathsfrominfluenzaandpneumoniaenglandandwales/deathsoccurringbetween1januaryand31august2020 </p>
<p>Claim: In 2018 alone, pneumonia killed 800,000 children, and while deaths from other infectious diseases, including malaria, diarrhoea are falling, fatal pneumonia cases are declining at a much slower pace.</p>
<p>Yes, it did. Unclear what this has to do with COVID-19, which has currently killed about 2.5 million people and counting. The UN also encourages wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding crowds: https://news.un.org/en/node/1082272/as-covid-deaths-pass-two-million-worldwide-guterres-warns-against-self-defeating-vaccinationalism-2 </p>
<p>Then you link another Dr. Sam Bailey video. I will not watch her videos or read her book until I find out where she wants to school, and what her degree is in. </p>

        <p>“Several cities and large counties, including Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Hillsborough (which includes Tampa), have mask requirements”</p>
<p>So...Florida has a partial mask mandate. It’s just not at the state level and local governments don’t have as much power to enforce it. </p>

        <p>The American Medical Association prohibited docs from prescribing it for covid. And then reversed their stance entirely on 10/30/20 bc the studies their stance was based on were retracted due to dubious research methods.</p>

        <p>More than just dubious research methods. They specifically ignored that when someone is already in a hospital and/or is not also prescribed zinc, HCQ does not work for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>The former because the infection has become too ingrained to be treated by HCQ, the latter because HCQ's whole schtick is that it allows zinc to more easily get into cells and kill viruses.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm against the whole HCQ thing on the same grounds as I am the vaccines, because it hasn't really been tested enough for the treatment of covid-19. But we can at least say with HCQ that we know what the hell it'll do to people since it's been around since the 19-fucking-70's, and you can't say that much about anything else from this whole nuclear ass disaster of a timeline of ours.</p>

        <p>Can't speak for everyone here, but I believe in it. I had it. I'd take covid over the flu any day. The point is that this is not something that should be altering the world. If you're vulnerable then protect yourself. If you're not then do what you please. But don't disrupt the global economy in devastating ways that we'll be paying for for decades to come.</p>

        <p>I can understand your point of view. I disagree though because If the people protecting themselves are the ones going out and doing whatever, we would have a better outcome than if only the people at risk do. Masks prevent you from spreading it much more than they protect you from getting it, if that makes sense.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic spread has been shown to be exceedingly rare. So if you're not sick then why must you be treated as if you are. I believe in personal responsibility. If you're sick stay home, if you can't then wear a mask. But why must millions of people who won't spread anything, because they're healthy or at least asymptomatic, be treated like they're sick? Destroying the global economy.</p>

<p>Two really good studies to start with. There are a lot of studies out there that discuss asymptomatic infections but any study trying to put forth asymptomatic spread is based on models and nonsense.</p>

        <p>Completely understandable.</p>
<p>However, people can spread it without coughing or sneezing. It's hard to really understand until you consider that coughing or sneezing is just your body exhaling really roughly in order to get something out of your body. When you're asymptomatic, your body isn't doing it for you.</p>
<p>In choirs or sports, you're breathing really roughly on your own, so those scenarios are places where seemingly healthy people are spreading it a lot. Even if nobody there will express symptoms, they <em>could</em> bring it home to people who might express symptoms.</p>
<p>And if we're worrying about the next few decades having to pay for our actions now, then there are people who have long-term affects of covid-19. Heart or lung issues are the most common, but my uncle is an example where common tasks like walking are just harder after having it. That's going to be the rest of these people's lives, which can be more or less than a few decades.</p>

        <p>I don't understand how people can worry about the long term effects of a virus but not worry about the long term effects of this vaccine which we don't even know if it affords immunity. Everything I've seen says it makes you relatively asymptomatic meaning you can still catch, carry and spread the virus.</p>

        <p>This is consistent with every other vaccine. You can still spread the disease, but it is probably at least less likely when your body kills it quicker and before you express symptoms.</p>
<p>This is why older people are getting it first. They are more likely to die from it. For young people, the vaccine will hardly do anything for them.</p>

        <p>Do regards actually believe this? A worldwide conspiracy involving politicians from undeveloped and highly industrialized nations, left wing, right wing, western, eastern, African, dictatorships, democracies. If it was truely a conspiracy it would be the first time in history we've had so much cooperation among world leaders. Truly a momentous occasion.</p>

        <p>Makes more sense than the official stories. “Science says Blm rallies show no evidence of a super spreader event”. Tampa’s super bowl party may have killed your grandma. I’m not saying that there’s a one works order and I’m not saying there’s not but something is off</p>

        <p>Some masks <em>do</em> work. It just so happens that the bullshit masks outnumber the real ones by about 50:1, at least in my neck of the woods. And the incompetent public health authorities have been lying about absolutely everything from the beginning in America. I can't speak to what's going on in other nations.</p>
