    <strong>Utopia - Amazon Prime TV Show</strong>
    <p><p>Amazon's TV Show Utopia came out last year, but filming started in 2018 and was a remake of the 2013 UK version</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(2020_TV_series)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(2020_TV_series)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/09/utopia-amazon-series-remake-gillian-flynn-spoilers-uh-oh.html">Here's</a> the synopsis:</p>
<p>&rt;A group of comic book fans discover an unpublished manuscript for a graphic novel that they believe holds clues about the future, shadowy forces are also looking for the same manuscript, and eventually the comic book fans uncover a global conspiracy<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Here's the plan:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;1. Convince the general public that there is an outbreak of a deadly new virus. To sell the story, poison or otherwise kill people, then attribute their deaths to the phony virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;2. Once the fake pandemic is up and running and the public is terrified, announce that there is a vaccine that can defeat the virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;3. With the help of global elites, NGOs, and world governments, inject everyone on the planet with this “vaccine” as quickly as possible.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;4. Surprise! The vaccine is designed to permanently sterilize all or all but a certain percentage of the people who take it. Sit back and relax as the global population drops from 7.8 billion to about 500 million in a single generation, ushering in a new era of plenty.</p>
<p>Really just makes you wonder...</p></p>
