    <strong>NY Capital Region Meet-Up</strong>
    <p><p>Let's face it. We need each other, we don't know what will happen over these next few months, or even years and the ability to organize over the internet may soon become a distant memory. We may need a familiar face or a helping hand. We need to start building a community against the onslaught of what is coming and as great as this place is, I think we need to get out of our echo chambers and into the streets. </p>
<p>The first step is getting to know one another. Exchanging info, building a movement from the ground up. </p>
<p>So here's what I'm proposing, over the next few weeks I will announce a time and a local location to the Capital District for a meet-up. The location will be very public, maintaining safety is a primary concern. This will be during the day time... preferably a Saturday. It might be cold, so dress accordingly. </p>
<p>How this will work: </p>
<p>Direct message me with an email address. I will compile the list of emails (after I do some vetting of your comment/post history to make sure I am not sharing details of this locale and meet-up with a brigader or someone who would try and compromise our meeting). I would will make the cut-off for DMs 10/31/2020, to give me some time to vet. By 11/5 you will receive an email from me indicating the time and place. I will be sending the email to myself and BCC'ing anyone else as to keep your info confidential. </p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you fellow Cap Regioners.</p></p>
