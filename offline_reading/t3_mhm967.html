    <strong>When told ‚ÄúI want to save the 80 year olds‚Äù</strong>
    <p><p>This is my best response -</p>
<p>Cool, so wouldn‚Äôt a logical response be to have opened up months ago and let the virus burn out through the healthy populous while creating government programs to support old/compromised staying on a hard lockdown for a few weeks? Once we learned what this was in mid April that should‚Äôve been the move. The virus would of been eradicated. Instead, they chose to lockdown everyone which has led to a massive spike in suicides and mental health problems in otherwise young healthy adults.
The option I depict makes sense.    </p>
<p>The option they went with only points towards a nefarious fucking agenda of elite control. Just open your mind for 5 seconds and think about it before flicking back on CNN and dismissing this.</p>
<p>!remind me in 2 years when we‚Äôre still in this horseshit because of some umpteenth variant.</p></p>

        <p>Even faced with new data early on that proved they were doing things wrong, the government is so afraid to let go of power they wouldn't do the right thing. They're still afraid to get rid of masks a year later, despite the evidence.</p>

        <p>I just don‚Äôt get the people that ignore the data and lap up whatever the media says. Could you imagine if we were told in 2018 that a virus was coming that would kill off .017 of the planet and as a result, the worlds economy needed to shut down? Now THAT would‚Äôve been a conspiracy theorist!</p>

        <p>What, so basically you're suggesting that we should have followed the pandemic response that we've always followed? Are you <em>that</em> anti-science?! The only way to protect everyone is to vaccinate everyone. Immune systems are so 2019.</p>
