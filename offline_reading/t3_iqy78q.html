        <p>There's at least <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2020-has-killed-up-to-200-000-extra-people-in-the-us-so-far">200,000 extra deaths this year</a>   compared to the last four, and they started increasing in March. To what else would you attribute this?</p>
<p>Even though they are awful numbers, to deny them would only prolong this whole thing. Once in a century pandemics are just awful and there's no way around it, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>200,000 isn't really statistically significant since the death rate fluctuates by hundreds of thousands of people over a larger time scale than 4 years, like 10 or 20 years. It has been declining over the last 100 years, but this year the death rate per capita is comparable to a year in the 1990s.  How did we ever survive the 80s with such catastrophic deaths every year /s? The Spanish flu caused a massive spike higher than any other year in the past 100 years. You can Google it, this year hasn't been added yet, but it would have been an unnoticeable blip on the 100 year graph and death rates would have dropped next year if it weren't for lock downs causing persistent excess deaths into the next decade probably.</p>

        <p>This is incorrect. It looks like you said google it without actually googling it yourself.  </p>
<p>Every spike after the Spanish Flu is miniscule compared to 2020s extra deaths. 2x the normal death rate equals a national disaster, and we have places that are 5x the normal death rate. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/10/world/coronavirus-history.html">The closest comparison is in fact the Spanish Flu</a>.</p>

        <p>That's a timeline by the the new York times, not a graph. And it only looks at monthly death rates compared to normal for that month, so I believe some people are dying sooner than they would have in the last 8 months, but in totality it amounts to a month's amount of excess death this year. Everyone has the same likelihood of dying this year as they did last year and next year. The article also says it omits many far more deadly wars and famines and includes 'presumed deaths' that occurred because people were afraid to go the hospital. Like I said, we are currently at 1990s level death rates per capita and the yearly death rate hasn't been released. The link you provided isn't related to that.</p>

        <p>That's incorrect. It shows how far above the normal rate of death various cities have experienced compared to past calamities. As I said, anything over 2x the average number of deaths is considered a disaster, and we've had cities experiencing all the way up to <strong>5x the normal number of deaths</strong>. The only "blip" bigger than 2020 that's occurred in American history was the Spanish Flu outbreak in Philly, October 1918, at <strong>7.27x normal rate</strong>.</p>
<p>It's not as bad as the Spanish Flu. It's merely the second biggest disaster in American history.</p>
