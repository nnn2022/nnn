    <strong>The Road So Far</strong>
    <p><p>A) The policies put in place have played a key role in orchestrating a dire situation, and it is all based off of the flawed testing methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flawed testing:</strong> Rapid Antigen tests have a false-positive rate of over 90%. PCR tests are being revoked by the CDC as they are unable to differentiate between viruses. The method and reference standard developed for this assay was bunk to begin with.</li>
<li><strong>Misattributed Deaths:</strong> if you go to hospital for <em>any reason,</em> you get tested for covid. If you test positive (highly flawed, remember!)  and then go on to die for <em>any reason</em> with 28 days of that test, you get put down as a with covid death. This is demonstrated on the CDC website, where they state that only 5% of people died <em>from covid</em>, rather than with it. Hospitals have been paid more per covid-related death in many parts of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Cases, cases, cases:</strong> Media driven bullshit and fear mongering through "high case numbers", once again drive by... flawed testing. Results are meaningless without a solid testing method and reference standard. This is chemistry 101.</li>
<li>Faulty testing has been used to drive a casedemic, with most policies that are being mandated being tied directly to this fraudulent testing methodology. </li>
</ol>
<p>B) The response the the virus has been grossly exaggerated. </p>
<ol>
<li>Masks don't work to protect you against viruses. I don't care what you "think" you know. If you work with masks or as an RT, you know I'm right. Most of you have never worn a mask in your life prior to 2020. Stop believing a piece of fabric that is not properly fitted to your face (with no space for air to enter or escape other than through filters and egress valves), is going to protect you. It absolutely is not. Drop this fucking nonsense already.</li>
<li>Lockdowns, travel restrictions, isolation, and quarantining of people who <em>have tested negative for the virus,</em> is ridiculous<em>.</em> Even if you test positive, <em>the tests are entirely flawed.</em> Asymptomatic? You're probably not even infected. These are psychological measures put in place to distance people from each other. </li>
<li>People are being instructed not to talk to each other in Australia. They may be spreading misinformation when they open their mouths.</li>
<li>People are told to ONLY believe what the government tells them in New Zealand. Unless it comes from the gov, it's not true. The unquestionable truth. This same rhetoric is making it's way around the world in various forms.</li>
<li>Quarantine for "vaccinated" people, is ridiculous. Wearing a mask if you are "vaccinated", is ridiculous.</li>
<li>Denial of acquired and cross-immunity is ridiculous. They are actively denying multiple antibody tests for the same patient. If you are in this camp, you may as well be telling us the world is flat. You are nothing more than a dunce. We have known this to be true for our entire lives. It's the <em>best</em> defense we have.</li>
</ol>
<p>C) The vaccine is not a vaccine, nor is it safe.</p>
<ol>
<li>It does not prevent infection. It does not prevent transmission. It does not prevent death. It <em>may</em> lessen your symptoms. This may be the worst "vaccine", ever.</li>
<li>If it was effective, "vaccinated" people would not need any kind of guidelines or restrictions. Instead, the are still getting sick and dying in larger and larger numbers, and being met with the same kind of restrictions as the un"vaccinated".</li>
<li>Freak accidents post "vaccination" are growing. We know many famous people who have suffered issues and death all over the world. This is unlike any vaccine in history, and the instances don't appear to be slowing down. If anything, they are becoming more frequent.</li>
<li>As you may have guessed from the first point, you can still catch and transmit the virus - but because you now may have less symptoms, you have higher chance of transmitting the spike proteins to someone else if you are sick.</li>
<li>This isn't a vaccine.</li>
<li>Millions of people affected with side-effects at this stage. Tens of thousands are dead as a result of the shot.</li>
<li>People seem to always "get covid" soon after getting their "vaccines", all while they managed to avoid it for the 16 months prior. Interesting.</li>
<li>Doctors are diagnosing people with Bell's Palsy 30 minutes after "vaccination", and then telling those same people that it is entirely unrelated, and they should get the 2nd shot because it is safe. Completely measured and normal response, of course.</li>
<li>This isn't a vaccine.</li>
<li>Treatments are been entirely ignored. Fuck, treatment polices are not even being proposed. "Stay home until you get really ill." People are being gaslight through the media, through politics, through fact-checker shills, and through idiot politicians. There are 30 RCTs on Ivermectin <em>proving</em> it is effective. It has been on the market for 40 years. It is incredibly safe. It is also very effective at preventing and treating this virus. Yet, <em>no one in the media is talking about it.</em> It's almost as if they don't want you to even be aware of an alternative treatment - you know, one that actually works. Instead, it remains in a perpetual state of "we need more evidence." The fuck we do.</li>
<li>Most people that have died from covid (delta) in the UK over the past 6 months were vaccinated. 66% of them, in fact.</li>
<li>Every single day, more and more medical experts are speaking out, giving testimonies, and sharing their experiences which completely contradict all the lies and gaslighting in the media, and confirming the things others are sharing. Every single person who goes against the narrative goes through character assassination, without fail. This is no coincidence.</li>
<li>This isn't a vaccine - it's a potential death sentence.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you haven't noticed that something is very wrong at this stage, you need to WAKE THE FUCK UP. We are sounding the alarm bells. What do we need to do to make you realize that something is very wrong here?</p>
<p>You know damn well things don't make logical sense. None of the measures make sense. It's all utter nonsense. Double standards <em>everywhere.</em> Government officials are often exempt. The rich and elites are exempt. They don't need to isolate when they travel on their private and chartered planes. The people making the rules don't even follow them. They mock us. They have parties and dine out while preventing you from seeing the loved ones they have subjected to their bullshit measures and brainwashing. They are laughing at you while they manipulate you with fear tactics designed by their teams of psychologists. You sit there glued to your TV and social media waiting for your next instructions on how to act, what to feel and what to think. But you don't even think, do you?</p>
<p>You know this isn't right.</p></p>
