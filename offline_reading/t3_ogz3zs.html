    <p><p>I see this argument floating around a lot on Reddit and other social media. That the idea of developing problems from these experimental vaccines 10, 20, or 30 years from now is “almost certainly” not going to happen.</p>
<p>And you know, I can see where they’re coming from. If you disregard the fact that these vaccines are experimental and we know nothing about them and just look to other medications/vaccinations that logic holds fairly true. It’s pretty rare to ever develop symptoms years and years and years and decades down the road from a single one-time medical treatment. If you get a single shot today (a normal, tested, non-experimental vaccine) chances are it’s not going to cause you problems suddenly 40 years down the road.</p>
<p>But if you get <em>three</em> of these new shots this year and then <em>continue</em> to keep getting them annually for decades what in the hell type of damage will THAT do to your body? These spike proteins are toxic. Imagine having your body pump them out on an annual basis. What type of CUMULATIVE damage will <em>that</em> be doing to your cardiovascular system? That’s what’s going to be killing people in my opinion. It’s not going to be some spooky unheard of thing killing people. It’s going to be years of <em>cumulative</em> damage being done by people forcing their bodies to pump out cytotoxic spike proteins on an annual basis. It’s going to be the progressive damage from a mild case of myocarditis once a year.</p>
<p>If you’re elderly and near deaths door already, maybe these experimental vaccines will provide you some benefit. But if you’re young and healthy you should be staying the hell away from this yearly booster shot cytotoxic spike protein nightmare (in my humble opinion).</p></p>

        <p>yep dont know why this a valid argument, theres no debate on whether or not the vaccines are still in a trial testing phase. this is reddit thugs trying to brainwash hesitant people and make them feel more comfortable w taking the vax.</p>

        <p>It's just because the only time "experts" will even check for it is shortly after injection. Might be different with Covid since it so central right now, but if you went to the doctor months after a flu shot with unexplained symptoms they would never think about it and would call you crazy if you bring it up.</p>

        <p>Possibly the same concept that allowed 2 weeks to flatten the curve to keep us locked down till now. Short term vs long term memory?</p>
