    <strong>I want to hear everyone’s thoughts on using masks and mandatory mask using</strong>
    <p><p>Hi! I don’t know if this is allowed, I joined this subreddit to broaden my mind a bit. I’m really curious what everyone’s thoughts on masks are. Do you wear them? If you do why? If you don’t why? I’m specially curious about people who don’t wear masks, since I wear one myself. I’d like to try to understand better the reasoning for not using them. Thank you all!</p></p>

        <p>Ignore the masks for now and look around you, do you see people dying on the streets?, do you hear ambulance sirens all around you?, do you see funeral homes overrun with customers?, do you see hospitals with no beds?, do you see anything that tells you there's a pandemic? The answer is no to all questions.</p>
<p>Now you understand why people wear masks. They are there to give the impression of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Now look at team sporting events and what do you see? Several substitutes and coaches socially distanced, all wearing masks on the bench. Now look on the pitch and you see athletes competing against each other in close contact, breathing and possibly, unintentionally, spitting all over each other. Then watch them hug each other when they score a goal or a try or whatever and eventually team hugs for the winning team, including substitutes and management. </p>
<p>Ever get the feeling you're being played?</p>
<p>Take your mask off and stop being paranoid.</p>

        <p>i was diligent for the first 6 months. i had an n95 mask that i wore to the grocery store (never outside, because that is stupid.) then i visited my parents by train. i was convinced i would get sick from the train - didn't happen. then i started going to the gym, where nobody wore masks - periodic antibody tests show that i never got exposed to covid in 6 months maskless at the gym. i still wear a cotton homemade mask at the grocery store because i'm not here to cause trouble for minimum wage workers. but i really don't think they are anywhere near as useful as just monitoring your symptoms and staying home if you have them.</p>
<p>that's easy for me because i am healthy, so i know if a symptom is due to illness. but most americans are fat, don't exercise, vape/smoke, eat like shit, sleep poorly, and generally don't take care of themselves. so of course they don't detect new symptoms because their default is already sick. how do you tell the difference between a vaper's cough and covid? sore throat and acid reflux? if you sweat going up stairs, how do you detect fatigue?</p>
<p>anywhos. wear one if you want. i won't wear mine a minute longer than i "have to."</p>

        <p>My thoughts: Masks should mostly be optional and gently discouraged, with a few exceptions: a ban on masks in places where security is important (stores with frequent theft problems, etc.), and requiring certain health care workers to wear them when working directly with patients confirmed to have symptomatic infectious illness. They don't keep the wearer from transmitting anything and only n95 masks protect the wearer at all.</p>
<p>I don't wear them except at my job because they don't work, they're unhygienic, and they're harmful in other ways. Causing headaches, sinus problems, and rashes, and that's even <em>with</em> keeping them regularly changed. I don't want to contribute to unwarranted fear and submission either. I don't cover my face for anyone who isn't paying me to - I guess that allows me to maintain a little self-respect in it, like I'm at least getting material compensation. And yes, I'm looking for a job that allows me to opt out of pandemic LARP entirely; even doing it for money is done grudgingly.</p>

        <p>Masks are not there to protect you or the ones around you in this pandemic scenario. A mask (any mask) protects you from a virus (any virus) as much as a barbed wire fence around your yard stops mosquitoes from getting in.</p>
<p>I do wear one, but just on one ear, because the fines are actually high here, and police is hungry to get you.</p>
<p>Doing otherwise would endanger my mental and physical health in the long and even short run if you also have some other respiratory problems.</p>
<p>Masks colect bacteria and form cultures, that you inhale back in a larger quantity than normal, a thing that could lead to bacterial pneumonia.That`s why the advice would be, if you wear one corectly, make sure to change it every 2-3 hours to avoid this.</p>
<p>Also wearing a mask for a long time, tends to make you more docile and naive, as it makes you feel all safe and cozy in your box, making you think that no one around would harm or try to use you.It`s a psychological trick.That`s why even tho some countries removed mask rule now .. alot of peoples still wear them, not because of the mean virus, but just because they feel good.</p>

        <p>I wear one for work because it’s required, and in businesses that require them. I do this only because I don’t want to be harassed or kicked out. If I had a choice, I never would have worn a mask a single time this entire year. I hate how they feel on my face. I hate how sweaty and suffocating they feel, and I hate that they hide your face. I miss wearing bright and fun lipstick colors, and seeing people’s smiles. Masks are dehumanizing in my opinion. I can’t wait until they are gone. I don’t believe they make a difference at all since your breath can still go around the sides. It’s all for show and I’m over it.</p>

        <p>Why would you compare a mask to a seatbelt?  A seatbelt protects the wearer.  </p>
<p>A mask is not designed to protect the wearer, and therefore does not fall under the definition of Personal Protective Equipment.</p>

        <p>Well it's funny that your friends try to jam the narrative down my throat that masks aren't to protect <em>me</em> they are to protect <em>other people</em> (from my breath which we are to assume is full of asymptomatic covid virus particles at all times even though I've had and recovered from covid months ago, I'm healthy, full of antibodies, etc).</p>

        <p>The mask actually does prevent particulates from entering your mouth and nose, thus protecting you, the wearer.</p>
<p>And it's funny you say that considering I worked in multiple warehouses where masks were absolutely required PPE to do the job wonder why the fuck that was?</p>
<p>Next Im sure you're going to start telling me how all of NASA's photos of the round earth are fake and don't actually prove that we live on a globe.</p>

        <p>Whether or not they <em>can</em> 'prevent particulates from entering your mouth and nose' (as if your eyes aren't two inches away), they have a 'loose fit, lack of seal, and inadequate filtration', therefore they aren't designed to offer reliable protection against viruses. </p>
<p>If you are wearing a medical grade surgical mask to protect the wearer against liquid 'splashes and sprays' (such as health professionals) then they would be considered PPE. </p>
<p>N95 respirators are considered PPE. They are designed for respiratory protection. </p>

        <p>You realize that the official government regulations for work environments in which there are airborne particulates, say that standard cloth medical grade masks are not only effective but they are required.</p>
<p>In my old job if you didn't wear a mask you'd be coughing a black tar and dust at the end of your shift, funnilly enough none of the guys who wore the masks all day were coughing up dust. </p>
<p>Fucking black magic? a coincidence maybe?  </p>
<p>Or maybe it's just established medical knowledge that masks are affected at blocking particulates in the air. You can scream and cry like a little baby bitch all day and look like a science denier in front of your friends and family. </p>
<p>It doesn't change the fact that <strong>masks work</strong> and you are literally on the same tier as flat earthers. Does that bother you at all? The fact that the majority of the population likens you to flat earthers? The dumbest of the dumb conspiracy theorists. The ones who will close their eyes and cover their ears when being presented with literally thousands of years of research.</p>

        <p>I really don't understand why this is hard for you.</p>
<p>Medical masks do not meet the standard necessary to offer suitable protection  against <em>viruses</em>. This is why we have <em>respirators.</em> No regulatory body is telling anyone to use anything less than a respirator for <em>respiratory</em> protection or for the purpose of filtering out airborne contaminants.</p>
<p>All of the information in my previous comments comes from OSHA's website, so if you have an issue with it then take it up with them. In the meantime, get over yourself.</p>

        <p>Proper two-layer cloth masks. With braces or bars to stop gaps in The mask and form an airtight seal on your face. </p>
<p>These are the guidelines for the CDC </p>
<p>The right mask, worn properly, with a few feet of distance, will protect you from viruses and particulates in the air, at least ANY particulate that is large enough to be caught by the proper medical mask. So most of them.</p>
<p>If masks are so ineffective it's really weird how through every single major viral outbreak in history the masses covered their faces to protect themselves in their neighbors.</p>
<p>You know you're not smarter than those guys right? you just have a little bit more medical research under your belt as a species. And all that time is done is confirmed what we already knew that you should cover your mouth if you're sick. And cover your mouth if everyone around you is sick. </p>
<p>I don't know why you guys are so determined to kill people just to look stupid.</p>
<p>Because you look stupid, you know history will see you as the butt of jokes at best, at worst it will see you as biological terrorists. </p>
<p>Because if you haven't been covid tested and you have been walking around without a mask on you are very likely responsible for killing somebody</p>

        <p>The people I see walking around are not wearing masks with airtight seals.  They are also constantly touching their mask and face, before and after touching items in the store, keypads, door handles, etc. They jam their masks in their purse or pocket alongside their wallet, place them on the table, etc. Servers touch their masks, then touch plates and glasses and napkins, straws, cash, and credit cards.</p>
<p>Masks are not anywhere near 100% effective at stopping transmission.  Someone in a mask can be just as 'responsible' for 'killing' because they have poor mask etiquette, which the vast majority of people have. How many times have you reused the same mask, or touched the inside or outside of your mask?</p>
<p>Also, why hasn't anyone been accused anyone of 'killing' someone when dealing with the flu all these years?  Do you get a flu shot every single year, social distance, and wear a mask?  So ridiculous.  The common cold can also prove deadly for the elderly.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if unknowingly infected, which many are, I am now made to keep my shedding virus contained to a moist, humid environment such as a mask, which covers my nose and mouth.  Therefore, I am now increasing my own viral load by constantly breathing in this exhaled virus. A single infected cell makes hundreds to thousands of viral copies. Higher viral loads are predictive of mortality. There's a very real chance you are in-fact making matters worse and 'killing' <em>yourself</em> by wearing or being made to wear a mask all day.</p>
<p>It is not as reductive as 'blocking particulates'.</p>

        <p>You can't compare covid to the flu.</p>
<p>Covid is an unprecedented outbreak that we have not seen in many many years. </p>
<p>And flat out wearing a mask even if you're not doing it 100% correctly is better than just saying fuck it I'm not going to do anything at all. At least they are trying to protect their neighbors and friends and family.</p>
<p>Anti-Maskers aren't even making the slightest attempt at keeping anybody safe, if you think that there would currently be half a million dead people if everyone distanced when they were told to in the first place, and wore their masks you're delusional.</p>
<p>If you would have just worn your mask and stayed the fuck away from people for just a couple months. That's all it would have taken everything would have went back to normal.</p>
<p>But now almost 600,000 people are dead from COVID in the U.S alone.</p>
<p>In under what is that 2 years? No big fucking deal right.</p>
<p>You people get flat out told by the scientific community the government the CDC that by not wearing your mask and distancing you are putting people's lives at risk you are killing people, but you care so much more about being the contrarian smart guy in the room that you'll just say fuck all that noise I'm going to play the semantics game to make my own dick hard from feeling special.</p>
<p>The unavoidable fact is had anti-mask morons, and I called them morons because they're just flat out denying established science like flat earthers do, so morons, have they just worn their masks and stayed home, that's the guideline, don't go to in crowds and wear a mask when you're around people. 
M
And then you idiots are acting like it's 1984, like we haven't done exactly what the CDC is telling you to do for every viral pandemic in history.</p>
<p>It's not a flu it's not a simple outbreak it is a <strong>global pandemic</strong></p>
<p>You have the entire fucking scientific community of the entire world telling you that this is a pandemic level airborne viral outbreak, and there's actually only one thing that you can do to keep yourself safe. </p>
<p>And you're so smart you won't do that one thing, you guys are fucking specimens with no empathy or shame I'll tell you that.</p>
<p>I really wish the internet didn't give you idiots a platform to spread your missinformed ignorance to others.</p>

        <p>I didn't compare COVID <em>to</em> the flu.  You said 'you have probably killed someone if you're not wearing a mask', and I asked why no one ever adopted this type of thinking when it comes to flu, which kills tens of thousands every year.  Seems you want to cherry-pick when someone should be held accountable for passing along an infectious disease, which they only got because someone else passed it to them.</p>
<p>I have worn a mask in public since it was mandated in my state, so again, don't know what you're on about.  I think they are unhealthy, unsanitary, and the way that they are used in day-to-day life by the general public ends up mitigating any potential benefit of wearing them.  They offer a false sense of security and turn everyone into moralizing, blithering idiots.</p>
<p>Covid only accounts for around 13% the deaths out of over 1.1 million people ages <strong>85</strong> <strong>and older</strong> that died in 2020.  Meaning about 87% of people 85 and older died of something other than COVID.  Life expectancy for people in the US is 76 for men and 81 for women.</p>
<p>Wearing masks to curb virus transmission is not 'established science'. There are countless studies showing masks do not help to lower ACTUAL transmission rates.  The infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be a only a few hundred particles.  Covid patients exhale millions of virus particles per hour, but it's a 'worldwide pandemic' because of 'anti-maskers'? LOL.  Some things just have to run their course.  We're lucky the death rate is as low as it is.  Unfortunately we've been dragging things out which causes more death in the long run, because the vulnerable population stays vulnerable longer. </p>
<p>My state lifted its mandate 2 months ago and the numbers are lower than when the mandate was first implemented or any time after.  Our new daily cases are 11 per 100k people, which is below the national average of 15 per 100k.</p>
