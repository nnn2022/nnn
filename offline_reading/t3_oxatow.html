    <strong>Don't be threatened by authority</strong>
    <p><p>Story time about one of my many interactions with local police.</p>
<p>I'm home alone and buddy in truck pulls into my drive way. As he pulls in a police woman walks up to his window and asks if he knows anyone who drives a black car(won't say brand, don't want to be too descriptive). Buddy says ,"I don't know" and gets out of his car and I let him in the house.</p>
<p>I step outside to talk to officer and lock the door behind me.</p>
<p>Side note: I always lock doors and or talk through a open window when dealing with police as I've had then come in my house many times with out knocking, they say ,"it was unlocked" but closed... Or one time cop walks up to my car and pulls the door handle trying to rip the door open. That time I was holding the door and quickly hit the lock button and got the door closed. Cop was missinformed and thought I was aggressive but I wasn't.. </p>
<p>Back to story, I'm outside talking to cop and she asks if I know anyone in this black car? I say ,"I don't know", cop asks me," do you live here", I say," I don't know." Cop asks does your mom live here?" I reply kindly," I don't know".</p>
<p>Cop leaves in frustration... </p>
<p>What happened was my mom driving a black car may or may not have done a minor hit and run while under the influence. </p>
<p>I get a call 2 mins later from my mom to pick up her car by the store that she dropped it off at. When I get to the car I'm greeted by a cop. He asks" what you doing?? This your car??"   I simply say," I don't know, I'm just getting in the car, I have the key." He's mad and starts saying," man come on I know your mom was drunk and hit a car and ran, come on tell me what's up." I simply say," I don't know.. not sure what to tell ya" </p>
<p>Cop asked for insurance for documentation reasons and left. </p>
<p>The simple words ,"I don't know" will save your ass many times over, learn them, know them!</p></p>

<p>I know she's your mom. But next time, she might kill someone else's mom. Or child.</p>
