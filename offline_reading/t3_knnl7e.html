    <strong>I really don’t get it</strong>
    <p><p>Immune-compromised people have been around forever. People have been walking around with HIV/AIDS for decades, to give an example. Those people face greater risk from a common cold or flu than others, but we’ve always trusted that they can act in their own best interests and protect themselves as they see fit. Why are we suddenly acting like this can’t hold now that the “at high risk” net has been widened to include the very old and some other conditions (diabetes, obesity, etc)? What is it about this virus specifically that scared so many people into giving up our lives? Just the media coverage?</p></p>

<p>Yes but it isn't merely coverage, they used an enormous amount of advanced propaganda techniques for months 24/7 without a break. To give some examples (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/kehr4e/how_they_pulled_it_off/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">source</a>):</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>catastrophizing,</li>
<li>appeal to "authority" ("experts/doctors/scientists say that..")</li>
<li>lying (e.g. empty hospitals vs their numbers),</li>
<li>constant repetition,</li>
<li>foot-in-the-door-technique ("just two weeks"),</li>
<li>minimization ("such a small inconvenience"),</li>
<li>appeal to popularity ("most people want..")</li>
<li>framing ("plaguerats")</li>
<li>false analogies (muzzles and trousers/seatbelts)</li>
<li>moving goalposts and slice-by-slice ("one more month" -&rt; another one etc.)</li>
<li>gaslighting (blm protests),</li>
<li>false dilemma ("long lockdown light or short, hard lockdown?"),</li>
<li>fearmongering/appeal to emotion (e.g. staging caskets in the central park),</li>
<li>bait and switch ("flatten the curve"),</li>
<li>double binds (numbers up: "we need harder lockdown", numbers down: "lockdown works, we need to stay locked down")</li>
<li>scapegoating ("grandma killer", "Antimaskers are at fault for this!")</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of these propaganda techniques have been used by them before as well - they are professionals after all, but rarely if ever have they been used in such a focused way on a single hoax for such a prolonged amount of time without anything else (maybe with the exception of latestage war times). </p>
<p>Though a lot of people woke up to it all, that's the price that such an amount of systemic change for the very worst comes with.</p>

        <p>Yes. The media. Which then filtered fear through the masses who then go on and bully others into submission. </p>
<p>My point has been exactly that from the start. Those who are vulnerable now, were just as vulnerable before from the common cold. 
Nobody can seem to get this through their heads though - that I know in real life, at least. Many people see it, just many people don't.</p>

        <p>I have no immune system from MS! Guess what!? I try to not wear a mask as much as possible, sometimes I will grab a snack on the way home from a long day of running around looking for supplies at various stores, and don’t get a chance to wash my hands before I eat! (Yeah that’s gross, I also never ever used to do that unless I could wash my hands before, I didn’t want to get sick, now I am just letting the odds take over) and guess what! I have never ever been sick this year. Idk what kind of bs this sickness is but it’s non existent and I was a sheep in the beginning!</p>

        <p>I think a lot of it is people who are so miserable with their lives and the way they've turned out as humans that this is how they get their perceived status bump.  They tell people what to do (through their phone screen or computer), get to sit at home and do nothing, risk joint damage from vigorously patting themselves on the back, and what does it cost them in terms of energy or time?  Basically nothing.  It's the lazy, piece of shit slacktivist dream.</p>

        <p>Don’t look at things logically because nothing the gov’t or media has done is logical. If you look at it from the perspective of “how would I get more power?”, what they’re doing makes complete sense. </p>
<p>It was never about protecting immunocompromised people or all the grandmas, it’s about power. Look at how much people willingly gave up in the blink of an eye all for the illusion of safety.</p>

        <p>Seriously immunocompromised people die at a higher rate than people with a normal immune system. Same for covid. These people are always at risk. Just at a (slightly) higher risk this year. These are the kinds of people I would advise to stay home.</p>
