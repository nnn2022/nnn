    <strong>Don‚Äôt look at the teachers subreddit...</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôm a high school student and I decided to check the teachers subreddit to get a glimpse of the teaching experience with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Oh. My. God. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen so much complaining from any other workforce dealing with the ‚ú®pandemic‚ú®. Some highlights include a teacher promising to ‚Äúmilk the shit‚Äù out of her district even if she gets a very mild case of COVID. She promised to bring in an attorney to sue the fuck out of the school and to take multiple months off to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù (you ever get a cough and diagnose yourself with organ failure? üôÑ). Another teacher was encouraging her colleagues to half-ass the year because it‚Äôs just sOooo hArD having to do your job when there‚Äôs a big bad scary virus out there. A lot of teachers were relishing in the fact that they had to the bare minimum for virtual classes and didn‚Äôt have to deal with bad behavior, saying shit like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs beauty in a muted class‚Äù. Did these people even know what profession they were stepping into? Like...kids talk and misbehave...you know that‚Äôs how things are...right? Shouldn‚Äôt you at least like kids if you want to be a teacher?</p>
<p>I swear to god these entitled people are so far removed from reality. The average grocery store clerk doesn‚Äôt get up and write a reddit post about how they think they‚Äôre gonna die and how they‚Äôre braver than the US marines for doing their job. They just get up and go work because they have an actual grasp on reality. Seeing the fit these teachers/teachers unions are throwing about returning in-person must be so insulting to essential workers who haul ass everyday. They don‚Äôt get to sit on Zoom and read a PowerPoint out loud. They don‚Äôt get to have a union to ensure that their agenda will reign supreme.</p>
<p>I just want to go back to in-person school and see my friends again, but if these are the people that have an influential union backing them... yeah. Best believe I return to physical school never.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a little vengeful on my part, but I hope the teachers I mentioned above get fired. If you hate teaching so much why not get replaced with somebody who actually cares about their students?</p></p>

        <p>Just like the air traffic controllers under Reagan. Demand they return to a critical State function and if not hire newer and better teachers. Let‚Äôs bump their pay based on children‚Äôs success factors and build a new generation of educators by offering state school teaching degrees for no charge if they agree to teach at least 4 years in a public school. Get rid of the rot of what some crappy educators are sowing. Start by investigating these teacher unions and how they operate.</p>

        <p>I'm assuming this is the stated?</p>
<p>teacher pay in the states is shit and classroom teachers are overwhelmed with difficult students, expectations from parents and administration and little to no resources to help their students. A heavy handed approach will get rid of a few shitty teachers, but the system just creates more shitty teachers. </p>
<p>the school system needs more funding. higher pay to attract talent. real and accessible resources to help students in risk.</p>
<p>Performance based pay/funding is a terrible idea which rewards affluent schools and denies high risk schools what they need most... funding and talented teachers.</p>
<p>just invest in your school system</p>

        <p>Weekly pay for teachers is about the same as accountants, biological and life scientists, registered nurses, and editors and reporters. </p>
<p>Teachers also get summer vacations, professional days off, snow days and federal holidays off.</p>
<p>Based on self-reported data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, public school teachers on average earn more per hour than architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, statisticians, biological and life scientists, atmospheric and space scientists, registered nurses, physical therapists, university-level foreign-language teachers, librarians, technical writers, musicians, artists, and much more. </p>
<p>Teachers also have far more generous pension and health insurance benefits packages than almost all other professionals. </p>
<p>You think that because you assert teachers are underpaid, therefore that statement is true.</p>
<p>Your assertion, like the constantly cited notion that teachers are under-appreciated, is fraudulent.</p>

        <p>The trope is that teachers are unpaid and so every teacher yammers it even though they make good money right out of the start. My wife works in child welfare and they are asking for workers requiring a masters degree to make like $18-19 an hour. </p>

        <p>This is the typical tactic used by those who push the lie that teachers are underpaid: attack the humanity of those who tell the truth about teacher‚Äôs compensation. </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou think teachers are compensated more than fairly? You just don‚Äôt care about education.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a slimy tactic, and it‚Äôs transparently phony to anyone with five cents worth of brains.</p>
<p>Repeating lies does not make them true. But you and your ilk will never stop lying in your pursuit of furthering the bloat of public school teachers and administrator‚Äôs salaries. Lie to students, lie to the public, lie to yourselves. </p>

        <p>&rt; teacher pay in the states is shit </p>
<p>Bull. Shit.  My wife is a school administrator who handles payroll.  They have one lady who teaches second grade and makes $90K per year.  The union has imposed rules that dictate specific pay raises be awarded when certain qualifcations are attained.  This teacher has some sort of "state approved awesome teacher" accreditation and so they HAVE to pay her $90K per year.</p>

        <p>you just sound upset that a teacher makes more than you. I won't even get into the specifics of your little rant as you clearly haven't looked at averages, which is much more meaningful than individuals that piss you off</p>
<p>in Canada, teachers are unionized and on a salary grid. the highest paid board tops out at 100k after 11 years. pays well and because of that we have great teachers. we also have resources, never enough, but they are available if a student needs them.</p>
<p>all that to say, if you want a better educational sysyem, you have to invest as a society. If you are content with flat Earthers, climate deniers, anti-vaxxeer, and hoax theories... which are prevalent in the US... then carry on</p>

        <p>You lie so easily. All of your posts are full of lies. </p>
<p>There is no correlation between teacher‚Äôs compensatory levels and student‚Äôs academic performance. In fact, there is arguably a reverse correlation - as teachers have been paid more and more, academic performance of students has descended. This is all easily discerned from even basic research.</p>
<p>You stooges of the left will say anything in pursuit of your goals. Lying is totally fine, because you are so convinced that your ends are righteous. Paying teachers more is a moral imperative, therefore I am allowed to lie in pursuit of that goal.</p>

        <p>It's true.  America pays teachers more per hour than it pays the RN in the emergency room or the achetect who designed your house.</p>
<p>Yet:</p>
<p>In international testing <em>most Americans test</em> <strong>intermediate</strong>.  By international standards that's barely good enough to fill in a multi-page government form.  </p>
<p>The same international tests show Americans to test well below the median in mathematics.  They're barely capable of solving a simple algebra problem, while the highest scorers were capable of solving multi step problems.  </p>
<p>So why are we wasting so much money?</p>

        <p>This is true in my school district as well.  I was talking with my daughter's former teacher before our school year started.  She mentioned to me that only 7% of teachers did not want to go back to in person schooling.  Teachers that I know are happy to be back in class.  The trustees agreed with parents and not the teachers union to reopen our schools, giving us 3 options (in person, online with your kids school or go to a online school that serves our district). We've been back to school now for 3 weeks, going into our 4th week tomorrow.   I have not heard of any teacher complaining.  My kids go to a school with less than 400 kids (elementary school, with 75% of that approximate 400 attending in class) and the teachers right now are doing double duty of teaching in class and the online distance learning. Our school is too small to be able to get teachers to strictly do distance learning.</p>

<p>I honestly think unions are a big factor. They don‚Äôt have a strong hold where she is so going back in person wasn‚Äôt a big fight. My state however the unions are holding the government by a chokehold</p>

<p>You start teaching full time with full salary and benefits like normal. You need a school to hire you to do the program though.</p>
<p>He got hired by going to the open job fair and then the HR helped him set everything else up.</p>

        <p>Yeah they had that as an option in CA for a few years when there was a teacher shortage. It still required the credential classes though. My main problem is I worked my ass off for my MA and for the fantastic evaluations and references I got from teaching college. That should be the end of it. I shouldn't have to do one more year of schooling on top of that, especially when those classes are excruciatingly bad. It's just not worth it. Anyway, I'm not the materialistic type so I'm fine living rough in Mexico. And it's not really locked down here, so I should be able to find work within the next few months. At the end of the day the two times I tried to teach public school in the US I was profoundly unhappy/insanely enraged... and not at the students - never at the students - it was always at the teachers and the admin constantly putting themselves before the students. I've taught English in Italy, China, and Mexico and the US is the only place where students are viewed with such disdain (and hatred!) by their teachers. Again, the unions encourage this.</p>

        <p>That's not how alternative licensure works. You get hired to teacher, and paid to teach, and are given two or three (or more) years to take the coursework to complete a teaching degree. Every state has a program like that, you need to contact the state board or education where you are wanting to teach.</p>

        <p>IMO.  Schools shouldn't be given one extra cent of money to implement the lame distance learning.  The money should go to parents so they can hire tutors and purchase online curriculums.</p>

        <p>First of all, dont ever lose this skepticism and energy. Teachers rarely teach critical thought or encourage it anymore so the fact that you‚Äôre in high school and able to view their behavior through this lens puts you ahead of the curve. Secondly this just pissed me off so much. I don‚Äôt understand why anyone who hates teaching this much would go into it knowing how low pay it is. They legit aren‚Äôt getting anything out of it so I just don‚Äôt get it.</p>

<p>In a lot of states, it's not low, especially when you factor in the phenomenal benefits, job security, <em>insane</em> pensions, and long vacations. There are states where this is not the case, but for the most part, the poor-low-paid-teachers thing is just another part of their self-aggrandizing narrative.</p>

        <p>Upstate NY here. The teachers here live the good life. I know gym teachers pulling down 100K, in a place where the median home value is like 225K. The ridiculous amounts of vacation and time off, their pensions, it just makes me laugh when people say teachers are underpaid and overworked.</p>

        <p>That's why op is full of bullshit, most teachers like their jobs and get shit on by everyone and still do their jobs. Critical thinking is encouraged way more than you'd think as well, at least at the places I've been. Do you really think someone would deal with all this crap society throws at them and still do their job for such little money, if not for actually wanting to teach? You basically gave the answer to your own question. </p>
<p>This goes beyond teachers though, I see many professions under fire lately, and it's easy to shit on them if you A. know nothing about them and B. only see the positives and not the negatives about the job.</p>
<p>But it's reddit though, people complain about everything and I'm sure there are teachers complaining as well, but it's not like all teachers are child-hating lazy idiots limiting your critical thinking skills...</p>

        <p>The voting was anonymous so I'm really not sure. Most teachers are pretty left leaning so it makes sense they'd be more pro lockdown. There were pretty bad (usually the women) for saying they were super overworked when we were distance learning last year. We were required to do office hours for 3 hours per day at that point. I didn't have enough work to cover my 3 hours. One teacher complained about working 12 hour days. I have my doubts.</p>
<p>I teach social studies and am newish at the school so I don't really talk to that many people.</p>

        <p>I'm a teacher in a district that is back almost 100 percent; there is a small percentage of students who are in families that are stay-at-home enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Almost all of my coworkers are super happy to be back and talk about how much they hated online. They also have been talking a lot of hate for the online part of our job now (we do have to still provide learning for those at home). </p>
<p>It sucks that so many teachers are pathetic enough to treat their jobs like it's a chore. You don't get into this profession for the money (old motto, right); you do it for the love of learning and helping students.  I guess I'm one of the few who may still believe in that.</p>
<p>I can't help but worry about this career I've chosen and how horrible it may actually be becoming.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I can totally understand the complaints from some teachers, but the half effort and sluffing it off mentality is not okay.</p>
<p>Despite liking it, or not, we should always put the best effort in. This is how I feel my district is.</p>
<p>I am lucky to have been hired here and hope more districts and teachers figure it out.</p>

        <p>In my country there is something called a productschool for young people who are not in the right place about where they are. What was shocking to me was there was almost more ‚Äúteachers‚Äù there than students. The place was more of a place to put unqualified citizens than students.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt buy their propaganda. They have a free hour during the day to do that, get off work earlier than real jobs, and don‚Äôt even lesson-plan anymore (every time I Google one of my kid‚Äôs homework assignments, it‚Äôs word for word with an answer online. They‚Äôre buying these lessons from someone else doing the real work.) They are (extremely) glorified babysitters whose insipid unions are trying to force you into propping up their failed education system instead of being able to use better options like online charter schools. </p>
<p>If this lockdown crap has shown us anything, it‚Äôs that most local schoolteachers aren‚Äôt worth the taxes we pay to support them and there is nothing they do that an online school couldn‚Äôt do better. So give parents the choice of which product to pay for, not continuing to pay salaries for whichever substandard babysitters just so happen to be employed in the near vicinity of our house.</p>

At best it's just another inefficient government program full of a bunch of self entitled beauracrats a.k.a. teachers. And at worst is strictly government indoctrination centers. Either way it's so obviously bad for kids. I know when me and my wife do have kids they're sure as hell not going to a public school.</p>

        <p>I shouldn't think they'd get a degree if they're really hopeless. Given that the teaching is often both appalling and flagrantly discriminatory, it doesn't neatly shake out like that, either. It's easy to just say 'Oh, I didn't do good at school, it wasn't my fault!', but in mine as a disabled student, it really wasn't. I have a good English degree from a redbrick university.</p>
<p>High earners in the US won't necessarily be the brightest and best either, look at your pro-lockdown politicians, I imagine they pay themselves nicely? What chance would someone who asked more questions, who was more caring, and thus had more concerns about the impact of lockdown on the poorest, on the already sick, on those without much job security, on small business, have had at getting that kind of position? Is acting like that, instead of going with the groupthink flow, something that usually makes someone popular?</p>
<p>I think this should be an opportunity to challenge the education system, not to assume it's getting it right in any way.</p>

        <p>IMO if a perfectly healthy younger teacher doesn‚Äôt want to return to the classroom, that shows that the students never were a priority. That or they‚Äôre so brainwashed they truly believe they and their students are at a horrible risk of dying. </p>
<p>The entitlement of (some) teachers is definitely something I‚Äôve noticed. I know it‚Äôs a tough job and teachers don‚Äôt get paid enough in the beginning. And yet, the only people I know who are able to retire as early and with as many benefits as teachers, are those who literally put their lives on the line every day. And yet to hear them complain you‚Äôd think they never got a dime. I feel like part of the problem is too many go in thinking it‚Äôll be an easy job with good benefits and don‚Äôt actually want to teach. Just my personal observations.</p>

        <p>As a teacher - finally back at school -  I‚Äôm pretty disappointed by the apparent fear that clings to most teachers, despite all the evidence to the contrary (if they looked for it, but they don‚Äôt). Not sure whether this is genuine or feigned, but it‚Äôs there. Especially amongst the BAME or ethnic minority teachers and students.</p>
<p>We do not as yet have a mask policy, but it‚Äôs mainly the ethnic students and teachers who wear them voluntarily in class and collective areas, and are worried about lack of PPE and corridor infections and the like.</p>
<p>We know this is the result of the concerted propaganda campaign against them, but you‚Äôd think the fear and hysteria would have worn off after 6 months.</p>
<p>The majority of teachers did their best during lockdowns and continue to do their best now, but the unions are snapping at our heels, hoping for strikes and further closures.</p>
<p>As a COVID skeptic I am in a definite minority, but there are others who are beginning now to see through this charade or at least realise it‚Äôs proven to be less harmful than a regular flu season, and hopefully there‚Äòll be many more once the rushed to market vaccines are on offer.</p>
<p>I have to admit I haven‚Äôt heard any of the teachers at my school say the kind of shit you quote here. I believe most of the ones I know love their jobs and prefer inperson lessons to Zoom. Perhaps they wouldn‚Äôt dare say the kinds of things you quoted out loud. Each time I check out the teachers‚Äô Reddit, it leaves me with a disappointed shudder of disgust.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting!</p>

<p>‚ÄúEthnic students and teachers‚Äù...jeezus some of the comments on this thread are beyond ignorant and cancerous. I am a lockdown skeptic but some of you complaining about teachers being uneducated is a hilarious claim when you use phrases like this. </p>
<p>‚ÄúEffeminate men‚Äù...‚Äùgay mask mandates‚Äù (which don‚Äôt exist btw)...and ‚Äúethnic students‚Äù...those are just some of the ridiculous phrases I‚Äôve seen used in the first few comments. What rock do you all live under? </p>
<p>Reading some of the comments, I‚Äôm reminded of why I deleted my previous account and got off this sub. If being a lockdown skeptic means being lumped in with ignorant biased bullshit like this, count me out.</p>

<p>Teachers unions are pretty toxic.</p>
<p>But do remember not all of your teachers feel like these schmoes on reddit. If you do get to go back (god I hope you do!) I hope you can go with at least somewhat of an open heart towards your irl teachers. They may feel totally differently. A lot of my teachers were jerkoffs, and kinda worthless, but some of them really did change my life and helped me become who I am today. I wish the same for you!!</p>

        <p>My personal disjointed rant.  My kid just melted down over online homework today. And most of it was doable.  </p>
<p>I don't judge redditors. It's a safe place to vent for some people.  </p>
<p>Unions vary by district. Mine folded to the admin and Board long ago.  They were very active years ago.  Now they make sure they get their extra check as union officials and don't oppose the Board. </p>
<p>Before your ears get red, unnions in cities like NYC often operate with different structures and with chaotic overly large factory buildings.  They became a completely different animal.  More what you describe.  </p>
<p>Teachers that are complaining the most here are in charter schools, not just public.  </p>
<p>If you read ALL the complaints, it's the ridiculous constant refusal of admin to comply with basic covid recommenations, provide PPE, make ballsy decisions what to emphasize during the shutdown (I say math and English levels, especially elementary) that cause teacher upset online.</p>
<p>N.B. My current public school has a great admin, very honest to teachers and parents, because that's the way you survive and achieve stability.  No teachers quit. A few retired.  </p>
<p>Many teachers are scared. This is life and death for those with health problems or living with those with them.  We can't comfort children with a gentle touch any more. We've switched from fire drills  to active shooter and evacuation drills.  Now add Covid-- we can catch a disease that so far hasn't mutated enough to make us feel better or safer.  </p>
<p>(To compare, I  had three teachers who were terrified whenever it snowed in upstate New York.  They'd come in late or not at all if it was icy. For me, it was a normal day.  I came in longer on snow days cause I got more done). </p>
<p>Teachers are always under pressure and for you not to see that is blindness. </p>
<p>It's not to say you aren't in your jobs, but teachers are battered constantly by changing programs, political whims, angry voters and inconvenienced parents [and this before covid].  Probably we need a year of intensive practice in organizational and psych training to keep professional but polite boundaries. </p>
<p>Unpopular opinion... the dictates of special education is out of control and expensive. It is impossible and unwise fiscally to think society can make every child a savant and university bound.  </p>
<p>When special ed began to expand, it helped kids do things themselves.  Can you imagine what a shock the current limitations are?  </p>
<p>Societally, children get more and more passive and the parents expect you to never make the child feel uncomfortable, challenged, pressured.  </p>
<p>Yet they expect teachers and schools to work miracles and devote 90% of the class time reaching THEIR child because YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT FUN, YOU DIDN'T MAKE HIM LEARN AND YOU GIVE TOO MUCH WORK.  The parents have the ability to look at grades online instantly yet don't contact teachers until it's too late.  </p>
<p>Education linked to property values, impossible teacher evaluations (240 points in 30 minute observations) and high stakes testing will never be successful and will never attract the very best. </p>
<p>American education cannot operate as a MBO  business.  Not until it allows schools and teachers to maintain standards and limits without being threatened.</p>

        <p>Teachers have always been a pampered bunch. They always felt that they have some right to their jobs and that the public is supposed to cater to their whims, while in return they get to create illiteracy at growing numbers each year.</p>

        <p>Congratulations on waking up to a bit of reality.  </p>
<p>I am a parent of three young kids. We are lucky to be in one of the few districts where in-person school is in full force. But, in the spring semester earlier this year, ‚Äúschool‚Äù consisted of giving the kids a few worksheets everyday.  </p>
<p>Now, because I am a parent who values education, both my wife and I had to make significant career sacrifices to make sure the kids knew their reading, writing, and math and mastered every worksheet. It was an enormous time sink, almost equivalent to a full time job. They did improve leaps and bounds, so there‚Äôs that.  </p>
<p>But, the kicker is: the teachers wouldn‚Äôt even grade assignments because it was a district policy and not fair to the 40% or so of kids that never logged into class. So basically they threw a bunch of assignments at the parents and never expected to have anything to do with it again.   </p>
<p>There are people here who claim that teachers work harder with online schooling than not, but I simply did not see any evidence of that. The work I saw, I could have done myself in thirty minutes or less a day, and I did continue it in the summer.</p>

        <p>Many teachers that are pushing this narrative are just looking for a raise for their ‚Äúbravery‚Äù. That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs going on in my district. I can‚Äôt go back to even hybrid school till Mid 2021 at the EARLIEST, and that is the best case scenario. There basically has to be no Covid cases for weeks for us to go to hybrid. Full in person is completely out the window for this year it seems. </p>
<p>I wish more people could see through this stuff. Everyone in my area seems to be cheering for remote learning and gets offended when you bring up the negative effects of remote school and not being able to see friends. It‚Äôs like they know they‚Äôre full of shit but they don‚Äôt wanna admit it. Why do people seem to love living in fear and think that if we all shy away in our houses forever that everything will be fine? Mine as well be a hermit. </p>
<p>Also, another piece of bullshit to add. Once my high school is back to hybrid (god knows when), if you display even the smallest Covid symptoms, you get removed from class and placed in a quarantine room (or what I like to call a prison cell) to do remote learning by yourself for the rest of the day. Did they just forget about kids with asthma, seasonal allergies, common colds, etc. that have the essentially the same symptoms as Covid? As someone who has bad seasonal allergies, I‚Äôd enjoy not being in a locked room by myself because of something non-contagious that I have yearly.</p>

        <p>Exactly my point--if you point out to a conservative Christian small business owner (not saying you or I fall into this category) that their beloved Fully Funded Police are the ones making them bake Trans-Gender wedding cakes, they are more likely to point out that the latest court ruling requires that only Lesbian cakes be baked and the notion that its their order-following police that are doing this to them never crosses their minds let alone sinks in.</p>

        <p>There are good teachers, but many are the bottom of the college barrel.  Starting in the 80s, when women found other more profitable vocations, the teaching profession went downhill.  I had a roommate who received an education degree.  She did her entire senior project the night before it was due.  She never did any studying.  The key is this needs to become a well-paid profession and then you will get good people.  Yes, right now they are failing as a profession.</p>

        <p>I too am a teacher in the worlds most totalitarian locked down state of Victoria in Australia. If you don't know what's happening here, look it up as it's frightening. I am totally on your side and sadly I am a minority however the headmaster has voiced to me that this is "bullshit." The hard part about being a teacher is balancing your opinions when they're all lefties with virtue signalling and identity politics galore, it's not their fault they were just stupid enough to absorb every piece of crap they "learnt" at University. If you had any sense of intelligence or understanding of the world you'd leave uni, shrug, think to yourself "well that was an indoctrination and waste of time" and forget any crap they filled your head with. These people, most, have never been in the real world They have been at school, gone to school, returned to school (I started teaching at age 35) anyway that's the teachers. In regards to this great big scam, I plant seeds in my students minds that they should question everything they see etc but ideally I'd love to come at them with the truth but I know id lose my job. Just know that there are some out there not spreading fear and pushing agendas. I watch my students excitement for life fade away each day and it frightens the shit out of me. I'm gonna start going in harder with facts. 
TLDR. I'm a teacher, many teachers are brainwashed, I'm gonna try harder to give fact.</p>

        <p>I was extremely fortunate to have a couple of very good teachers but I believe they are a dwindling minority. Many of them now seem to have no useful knowledge to contribute and are a glorified textbook narrators using standardized lesson plans and grading from answer keys. They contribute very little and I believe the conventional education format should be phased out entirely. The current education system is more about social conditioning than imparting useful knowledge. </p>
<p>Public schools for the most part are geared at creating the next generation of wage slaves. The private schools usually are more focused on empowering the people who will hire and manage them. All very classist and mundane for the most part. </p>
<p>People are more ‚Äúeducated‚Äù today than ever but it sure doesn‚Äôt seem to translate to anything valuable. Even in college and university, the curriculum keeps expanding (filled mostly with useless fluff), people are investing further and further years of their lives and going massively into debt to essentially buy obsolete credentials that have little real world application.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a broken system but I suspect it‚Äôs doing exactly what it‚Äôs designed to do.</p>

        <p>Honestly, our school system is garbage, and as far as I am concerned, destroying it is a good thing. When you are beyond the pale, the correct treatment is amputation. So I only wish they would be more upfront with how useless and shit they are.</p>

        <p>These bitch ass teachers got paid to be off and they want to be off longer and expect pay again, which is why they complain. They make up every excuse so they don‚Äôt have to do shit and get money.</p>
<p>I‚Äòll tell you right now, I‚Äôm a school teacher in Japan and NOT one single child or staff has been sick. I‚Äôm around 100‚Äôs of kids a day and never a problem.

        <p>Well, you are looking at a Reddit that was made for complainers. Obviously the teachers who are happy doing their jobs or the good ones who have a grip on reality don‚Äôt spend their time on Reddit. So take what you read there with a grain of salt- in reality, this is a small percentage of teachers. While it is disheartening to read, many of these teachers in the subreddit teach  in title 1 schools where literally EVERYTHING is put on their plate. I don‚Äôt know you or where you go to school, but I get the perception that you live in an middle-upper class suburb where teachers are compensated fairly and have adequate PPE and supports. Those teachers are probably not the ones of the subreddit. The teachers on the subreddit are overworked, under appreciated, and underpaid. They‚Äôre drained from their job and need a space to vent. They feel vengeful against a broken system. That‚Äôs being said, if they take that anger out on students, that‚Äôs unacceptable. They shouldn‚Äôt be teaching. If they‚Äôre just blowing off steam, let it go. </p>
<p>But again, I beg you to remember that that subreddit is where very unhappy teachers go. Don‚Äôt take that as a reflection of the opinions of all teachers.</p>

        <p>I just found this post so I'm very late responding to it. I  just had a post removed and was muted by mods after I tried to get an explanation on why it was removed. </p>
<p>My post was about how that subreddit has become nothing more than mass hysteria over covid. I acknowledged that protections should be in place, but the posts are nothing more than immense fear. They told me my post was not useful to the subreddit and I was attacking teachers when I can't possibly understand what they're going through (even though I am one). In trying to explain myself, the mods were so rude and then muted me completely. I will never deal with that subreddit again. Very hypocritical and not helpful for the teaching profession at all.</p>
