    <strong>Diving into “this will all end after the election” claims</strong>
    <p><p>So this news site has some biased/junk reporting, but they are conservative/right wing and this is political opinion and analysis that is cogent and brings up some good points. </p>
<p>https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/15/if-hes-elected-biden-will-keep-the-pandemic-going-to-use-its-power/</p>
<p>Would love to discuss with ya’ll. The exhausted optimist in me can’t help but be attracted to the idea this could be over in November. But the cynic in me tends to agree with a lot of the points this article makes. Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>It’s strange that people think a Biden presidency will do anything to reduce the insanity when he is on record of fully supporting it and wanting to make the mask mandates national rather then leaving it up to the states.  </p>
<p>This situation is tailor made for increasing the government oversight the left has been pushing for years (single payer system, requiring vaccines, mandatory testing and checkups, increased tracking of individual citizen’s compliance, etc).  I’m not saying any of that would happen overnight but this is the exact kind of “crisis” that would provide a compelling stepping stone for a lot of the left’s talking points</p>

        <p>And I’m also wondering: if trump gets re-elected, will he start standing up for our rights protected by the constitution but currently being abrogated by tyrannical governors?</p>
<p>Has he hinted at such things? Is there reason to hope for that?</p>

        <p>Good question. At first I was glad that the federal government was mostly staying out of it and letting the states make their own decisions and take the consequences. But at some point, if some states are ending up in potentially permanent "states of emergency" that violate constitutionally protected rights, something needs to be done. I'm not entirely clear what the president can actually do without going beyond his constitutional authority though</p>

        <p>That’s a good question. I think I’d like to see him just speak out about it on constitutional grounds and diplomatically urge governors to restore rights for the good of all. In a non harrassing and hopeful way. A lot of presidents’ power is in the bully pulpit. It would be a start?</p>

        <p>In the interview an hour ago with Stephanopoulos he said that the virus will “disappear” vaccine or not, and that we will not “be in studios like this” (pointing to the nearly empty studio with a handful of people distanced with masks.) He also kind of hinted that he doesn’t think the masks work.</p>

        <p>Now that is a complicated topic. I'm not trying to dodge or evade the question, I'm just looking at the realities we have to deal with. Here in Michigan Gretchen Whitmer has a 1945 law that allows her to make whatever rules she wants as long as she says there is a state emergency. Anybody found violating her rules, no matter how stupid they are, can be hit with fines and jail time. I'm not aware of Trump can do anything to stop her. Michigan courts have been no help in restraining her power. There's an effort to pass a petition and get it adopted by the Republican legislature but that's being fought tooth and nail as well. A consolation prize would be getting rid of Whitmer, but Biden hasn't picked her and her underlings are dumber than her. Now she wants an electric fence around her Governor's Mansion because people want to see her dead. I'm not calling for her assassination but of someone took her out and posted it on YouTube I would make it my screensaver, make popcorn and watch it ALL DAY LONG! </p>
<p>Her fears are well founded. People are hurting and the more they cry for help the more she oppresses them. People want her dead, that's no exaggeration. Forget the little people, she says....buy a million dollar electric fence. Suffering is for people on the outside.</p>

        <p>Hmmm. So in this situation... a Biden administration would empower her, but a trump administration won’t really be able to stop her.</p>
<p>This has laid bare such a threat to constitutional rights: state constitutions that allow for states of emergency where rights can be suspended. Yikes</p>

        <p>You have to take this article with a grain of salt. The Federalist wants us all to believe Joe Biden being elected would be doomsday -- just as Vox would have us believe the same about Trump. I personally don't see the value in continuing the lockdowns etc post-election and to the contrary, the continuance becomes a liability. As time goes on they're just going to lose more and more people sympathetic to the cause. These measures are inherently distasteful but at the moment most people are just trying to do their part and be a good citizen. But as people see others aren't dying in the streets and aren't even being hospitalized it's going to be extremely difficult to keep this up. They're going to eventually risk losing members of their base (although probably not die-hard Redditors!)</p>

        <p>Honestly I can see this dragging on for a very long time. On the one hand, if Trump wins, the states will want to get “revenge” on him and his voters by imposing eternal lockdowns/ restrictions and ever-changing goal posts. On the other hand, if Biden wins, I can totally picture him and his team locking down the entire country for months or until a vaccine is developed “to get things under control”. Either way, I don’t have much hope.</p>

        <p>I disagree. I think the dems are really only continuing this lockdown nonsense to try and hurt Trump. As soon as the election is over, even if Trump wins, they will start ending things before it even further destroys the economy. They will just find another new thing to attack Trump about.</p>

        <p>I don't get why people think this way. If this was really about the economy, they would have re-opened much sooner than they have, because it's clear that the longer they keep lockdowns in place, the worse the economic damage will be. No, this is about way more than a means to hurt Trump and fix an election. I think they do plan to change many facets of society through this, just like how corporations are beginning to go fully online and "touchless", phasing out cash, talking about how the pandemic has made us go "more green", and so on.</p>

        <p>I would agree, but other countries have very progressive/ what the USA would consider left-leaning leaders and ideas and they keep playing the repeat lockdown game. Like Melbourne, which is under a creepy police stare and NZ which locked down twice and will probably have another one because it looks like the virus is spreading there.</p>
