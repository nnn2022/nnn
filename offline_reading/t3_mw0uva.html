    <p><p>I Could really do with help for laying out my reasons for not wanting the jab logically for my family as im not good with this stuff. Im in the UK by the way.  I know their main argument will be its selfish of me for not getting it.  Im in my mid 40s so not really at risk.  Any help or bullet points would be really useful cheers!</p></p>

        <p>I think it's weird that one feels pressured to justify declining an offer.</p>
<p>Here's a short and honest statement that I think applies to a lot of folks who don't want it:</p>
<p>"My incentive for getting it is lower than my fear of potential side-effects."</p>
<p>If someone accuses me of being selfish after hearing that, I would probably use the whole-message-method I learned about from a psychologist:<br>
"I told you that my fear of potential side effects outweighs my incentive for getting it. You then replied, that you think that it is selfish of me to act according to my reasoning.<br>
I think that everyone should be allowed to act according to their own reasoning and I feel uncomfortable when being told that I'm selfish for thinking like that.<br>
That's why I ask you to please accept my decision and not bring up this topic anymore."</p>

        <p>I'll post a link of reasons below.</p>
<p>But in short "no" IS enough. We (anyone) do (does) not need to justify our no.</p>

        <p>Well it is a bit weird that you can't explain it. My answer is I'll talk it in 2023 when the trials are finished and if it is appropriate still, and I see no point in the UK in taking one now as it will be useless by Winter at which point they will need a new variant of it so might as well wait till the very least then, note they was something like four deaths yesterday and Boris has said this was due to lockdown not vaccines. I disagree with both but that isn't the point in this explanation.</p>
