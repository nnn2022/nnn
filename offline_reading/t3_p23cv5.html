    <strong>Ernest Becker on the 'culturally normal' and The Denial of Death</strong>
    <p><p>“This is how we understand depressive psychosis today: as a bogging down in the demands of others-family job, the narrow horizon of daily duties. In such a bogging down the individual does not feel or see that he has alternatives, cannot imagine any choices or alternate ways of life, cannot release himself from the network of obligations even though these obligations no longer give him a sense of self-esteem, of primary value, of being a heroic contributor to world life even by doing his daily family and job duties. As I once speculated, the schizophrenic is not enough built into his world-what Kierkegaard has called the sickness of infinitude; the depressive, on the other hand, is built into his world too solidly, too overwhelmingly. Kierkegaard put it this way:</p>
<p>But while one sort of despair plunges wildly into the infinite and loses itself, a second sort permits itself as it were to be defrauded by "the others." By seeing the multitude of men about it, by getting engaged in all sorts of worldly affairs, by becoming wise about how things go in this world, such a man forgets himself...does not dare to believe in himself, finds it too venturesome a thing to be himself, far easier and safer to be like the others, to become an imitation, a number, a cipher in the crowd.</p>
<p>This is a superb characterization of the "<em>culturally normal</em>" man, the one who dares not stand up for his own meanings because this means too much danger, too much exposure. Better not to be oneself, better to live tucked into others, embedded in a safe framework of social and cultural obligations and duties."</p>

        <p>Do you wish to explain how this relates to the current anti-vaccine/vaccine climate in your opinion? I'm not suggesting it doesn't and it's obviously well thought out.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your question.</p>
<p>It relates to the issue from a sociological perspective, by describing the innate human tendency for readily ascribing to group think and conformity. The tides of such a narrative in this case is two-fold: trusting the representations of power and authority (as media and mainstream medicine), and the "wisdom of the crowd," with the presumption that the ideological movements of the masses is evidence and indication of substantial veracity and severity.</p>
<p>A position (of group think) that is much more adaptable that the potentially harrowing possibility that not only are many people misinformed, but consequently the onus of discerning the true reality therefore becomes the responsibility of the individual.</p>
<p>Dissension would involve a level of "quarantine" that is not only a physical removal from society, but a removal from the ideological framework of the collective, insofar as it isolates and diverges one from the social aggregate.</p>
<p>One of the deliberate facets of social engineering is generating false consensus and appeals to authority, precisely because of our predispositions for group think.</p>

        <p>Group think is a positive evolutionary trait. One could easily see how common thought would aid early man in hunting and in building a sense of community within a tribe or village. Also coming in handy when dealing with a perceived threat to the group whether that be the rival tribe or a pack of predators. There is a fair  amount of groupthink as you describe when dealing with existential threats, that may challenge a persons ideals, or collapse the societal framework of an individual's social persona. The issue I see now is that both groups feel the presence of a very real threat. For both groups this is a matter of literal life/death. This amplifies the effect of groupthink for better or worse. How do you get two sides to come to an agreement when anything less than their stated desire is akin to suicide?</p>
