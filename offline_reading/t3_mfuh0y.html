    <strong>Making an OG post instead of cross-posting, discovered Nazi ties in the companies helping us through the "toughest times of our lives" /s</strong>
    <p><p>In light of a post made by another user, I looked into "JAB Holdings Corp" which was discovered to be the parent company of Krispy Kreme, the same company giving you a free donut a day for a year if you get vaccinated. (Because that is healthy, right?)</p>
<p>This company has multiple public stories of its Nazi ancestors:</p>

<p>JAB Holding Corp has also done business with Pfizer in the past, buying Coty from them, a cosmetics company:</p>

<p>The Nazi's were known for their interest in eugenics, and it is no surprise that an mRNa vaccine can alter who you are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44111476">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44111476</a></p>
<p>This article shows how injecting RNA patterns into something can literally alter it's memories, thoughts, and behaviors.</p>
<p>Now digging into Pfizer, you can see that they are still working with other Nazi-era rooted companies, which you can find by looking here at their 10-K PDF and what companies they work with:</p>
<p><a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx">https://investors.pfizer.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>On page 41 you can see the drugs they are working on with references to what companies are helping them. A company that shows up a lot is Merck, a German company with Nazi roots:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/1999/12/08/100557/merck-kgaa-plans-nazi-era-forced-labour-compensation/">https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/1999/12/08/100557/merck-kgaa-plans-nazi-era-forced-labour-compensation/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB958336118118418184">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB958336118118418184</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Group">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Group</a></p>
<p>If you look into the other companies they work with, a lot of them are partnered with Merck.</p>
<p>So why are all these companies involved with Nazi rooted companies and no one is talking about it?</p>
<p>Sorry this post is all over the place I just wanted as much info to get out as possible. Take what you want with it, and research more if you like. It is no secret that those who operated during the Third Reich are still among us, moved to the US, and were hired by our government.</p>

<p>If you were ever asked what you would do if you were alive during the time Hitler rose to power, look in the mirror, because this is what you would do. These fuckers want dumbed down slaves that will labor for them and make them money and never be brought to justice. Remember to educate yourself. Vaccine Passports are the new Yellow Star.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;So why are all these companies involved with Nazi rooted companies and no one is talking about it?</p>
<p>Because, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, no one gives a shit.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a well-established company that was around back then that <em>didn't</em> do business with the Third Reich in one way or another, especially before WW2 really kicked off.  Just like today, they were Germany, you did business with them.  They didn't build that war machine that they eventually unleashed out of popsicle sticks and construction paper. And Merck is a <em>German</em> company, fer cryin' out loud.  Do you think they just closed the doors when Hitler came to power and said, "Yeah nah, we'll just sit this out."?</p>
<p>One of the great failings of modern education is the belief that the Germans all just snapped one day, started <em>sieg heiling</em> and elected Magic Mustache Man who immediately started banning jazz and shoveling Jews into his Amana.</p>
