        <p>What's the source of this quote, here? Which CDC study is this referring to? Title, lead/co authors? Year of publication? How old is this publication, and were there any follow-up studies? Was this the first and only study into thiomersal? What was the goal of the study? What was the methodology? </p>
<p>The peanut analogy makes no sense. What it's trying to say is the peanut study tested to see if peanuts caused <em>allergic reactions,</em> not <em>allergies</em>. Kids with allergies to peanuts <em>should</em> be excluded from a study testing to see if peanuts cause allergies, because those kids already have confirmed allergies, meaning you couldn't form a causal link between exposure to peanuts, and development of allergies. Also, it would be unethical to expose those already allergic to an allergen, because we know it's dangerous for them. Likewise, if individuals with autism have difficulty detoxifying substances, they <em>should</em> be kept from the study, because they would be expected to be injured from a toxic substance, and either alternative vaccines that don't contain thiomersal should be used for their safety, or else they cannot be given vaccines that require thiomersal. If the study's purpose wasn't to contest the toxicity of thiomersal, but to study the exposure from vaccinations on otherwise uncompromised individuals, these criticisms are irrelevant.</p>
