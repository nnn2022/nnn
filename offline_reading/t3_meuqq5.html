    <strong>Do many here truly believe the vaccine is a death shot? Or that Bill Gates is a murderous James Bond supervillain?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been quiet and tolerant on things that I find absurd but the death shot belief on here seems a little too prevalent. I can’t stay quiet anymore. If this sub that I’ve grown to enjoy is majority filled with people who believe the vaccine is a death shot I’m packin my bags and I’m out. </p>
<p>I’m not taking the vaccine because I believe it was rushed and politicized, as well as unnecessary for me and the overwhelming majority of people. I’m not an anti vaxxer. I’m anti this vaccine. But I have seen no evidence that the vaccine is killing anyone or that it will. To suggest this is a death shot is absurd. So what do you as a member of this subreddit think?</p>
<p>Also... I can believe some things without evidence and concede I can’t prove them. My belief in God and Jesus as Supreme Beings for example. But... Bill Gates? Come the fuck on. Evidence people. If he’s the villain many claim please enlighten me.</p></p>

        <p>Death shot is a bit overdramatic. Not many actually believe that. </p>
<p>But: We don't know WHAT it is. That's the point. </p>
<p>Bill Gates, on the other hand, is a eugenicist. He admits it. Him being involved with this vaccine is highly suspect.</p>

        <p>And plenty of people died or got severe side effects from those vaccines. This is why Gates is now banned from about 40 countries, last one is India.</p>

        <p>Bill Gates is on video saying "vaccines are the best investment I've ever made". He's not a philanthropist it's about money for him. Plus his PR team only told him to go into philanthropy when people started hating him when they found out he just took a program/OS didn't even change it and marketed it as his own. So.
*PR team not or team, thanks auto incorrect.</p>

        <p>Yep I don't get how they're letting someone with zero science background have any of say in any of this. It's scary. It's not like he's a politician, where it's like "oh ppl like him because he's an economist or lawyer or prestigious historian or army vet, which is a nice change from the career politicians". Like just think, people are basically like "oh people like him because he's a tech mogul that plagiarized his way to becoming a monopoly turned philanthropist human experimenter which is a nice change from the career doctors" and that sounds insane</p>

        <p>Aaaand there’s another conspiracy with no basis, whatsoever. Gates is so smart, he anticipated this pandemic, so 40 years earlier he changed the digital world, becoming the richest man on the planet with one single goal: control you, and me, and everyone.

        <p>Trump is a joke, even though I used to support him, but that shouldn’t be the main reason not to take it.</p>
<p>Don’t take it because it’s not a normal vaccine like you probably had when you were a kid. It’s an experimental gene therapy that is not approved by the FDA in the US.</p>

        <p>Bill gates is a business man, business men put profit above all else and he profits greatly from an indefinite lockdown and a smaller and ageing population in western countries, if people are locked down they are more likely to use Microsoft products like computers rather than going outside, also it makes it harder for competitors to import their products</p>

        <p>This, also keep in mind how M$ got in a signature system so that many new computers can't run GNU+Linux with first disabling that feature in Bios, something most people have no clue on how to do. </p>
<p>OSX runs only on Apple devices. People on the move prefer Android or iOS, people at home prefer laptops, xbox (M$) or stationary computers. He once again strengthen his monopoly, and most M$ software today is subscription based rather than using life time licenses.</p>
<p>For Gates tho, I do believe control is more attractive than money. He's already one of the richest, and has been the richest for a ling time. A few more billions or even trillions dollars won't make him happier.</p>

        <p>I think forcing coercing or tricking people into taking something that gives them such severe side effects is torture.  Long term effects are also something to think about, as they can be life-changing. Dont know why everyone just thinks of death like that the only thing that can happen. </p>
<p>And yes I think Gates is a super villan. I thought that long before this kind of jokingly just because of his computer monopoly, but my god its true.</p>

        <p>Listen, I don't think the vax is gonna kill people right away. Of course not.</p>
<p>But it will more likely do its job wich is depopulation one way or another. Disabilities? Maybe. Death? Maybe. Sterility? More likely. Cancer? Maybe.</p>
<p>What I can conclude is that the vaccine is not safe so I won't take it, period.</p>
<p>On Bill Gates: he is the biggest donnor of the WHO, he has got an organization in Switzerland named GAVI (I think) that I believe it is about vaxes and is exempt from all regulations (I don't remember all the details, please google here), he runned Event 201 in October 2019, he is funding all the main vaxes about covid, he is banned from india because of what he did with polio vaxes... and much more if you go down the rabbit whole.</p>
<p>Maybe he is not THE villain but he is certainly A villain.</p>

        <p>I believe there are many possibilities for long term side effects from the vaccine- autoimmune illness, for example. But antibody dependent enhancement is my biggest concern, followed by concerns of prion disease. Because all earlier animal trials did not get past these reference points. None of these will show up immediately due to the nature of these illnesses.</p>

        <p>I’m an independent contractor and we don’t report on person or get to see when clients contact the agency, so it leaves me very vulnerable. Plus, I’m an RN and I’ll most likely “need” it as part of a position at any hospital I go to. It’s hard enough to avoid booster shots!</p>

        <p>You don’t need to justify yourself, I fully understand the situation is though for everyone. That work situation you mentioned is manipulative coercion if you really were not sure about taking it, just something you should consider (stand your ground and don’t take decisions based out of fear or others dictations if you are not 100% in) Hugs, stranger ✨💟</p>

<p>I have lost count of the number of people who have shared the fact that all previous coronavirus vax attempt failed at the animal trial stage because they made the animals deathly ill and/or killed them.

        <p>I think that generally vaccines are a good thing, but this one was rushed and we do not know any of the long term effects. I don’t want to take the risk of having some bizarre side effect years from now. I also find it useless to get vaccines when 1) I still have to follow the same rules and act like I’m not vaccinated anyway, and 2) I’m young and healthy and covid would not kill me</p>

        <p>Depends. But the fact that we don't know the long term effects is what gets me. I have seen posts on Reddit (there's a whole seperate thread containing these) mentioning negative and even fatal outcomes from this vaccine. Bell's Palsy seems to be one of the side effects that have come up. You also have had people who have gotten sick from the vaccine who probably would not have otherwise. </p>
<p>But one must consider history. How many treatments were once considered breakthroughs and believed to be safe because certain medical experts said so? Ans yes I am aware the below have nothing to do with Covid but I am using them aa examples.</p>
<p>Radium (Radium Girls is a good movie on the subject. I believe there's a book as well). Radium was touted as a beneficial supplement and various products containing the substance were marketed. But there were plenty of companies and people who got wealthy in part due to propaganda.</p>
<p>Blood lettting</p>
<p>Lobotomies</p>
<p>Early Polio vaccines (some of the people who took them suffered aversely)</p>
<p>These are the examples I can think of. And when the government puts profits before people bad things are bound to happen. The only ones to benefit from these vaccines 100% are the drug companies. They can't be sued, make lots of money and benefit off of the general fear and ignorance of the masses who are eager to rush out for a vaccine.</p>
<p>I was taught in school that drugs normally take 7-10 years to develop. And in that span there are numerous testing trials. All of this is being bypassed with these vaccines. That knowledge alone should be reason enough to question it. </p>
<p>If we should find out that the vaccines lead to long term diseases or birth defects that would be horrible for anyone that took this shot.</p>

        <p>No. I believe the people who made the vaccine have good intentions, and I think the vaccine is probably safe. I just see no reason to get it because I've already had COVID, I'm young and healthy, and the vaccine seems like a greater risk than the disease.</p>
