    <strong>“Due to covid you can’t be in the same room as your pet when they pass away”</strong>
    <p><p>Just a short but sweet rant.. what the fuck is it with these people that want to sap any form of humanity from society? I had to put my cat down and wasn’t allowed to hold her as she passed on, just coldly hand her off to an employee while they took her to the back. I felt awful and disgusted and sad. I just wanted to make sure she felt safe but no, can’t even fucking do that. What the hell is this world coming to?</p></p>

        <p>Don't beat yourself up. You did your duty and ended her suffering. Most vet techs and vets go into the field because they love animals (not always people though!), so your cat was almost certainly given some comfort.</p>
<p>Yes, it should have been you, but that's not your fault.  Reality is flawed, and we're all doing our best given our circumstances.</p>

        <p>I dad put down our last dog himself, she had cancer. Before that we had a dog that was put down at the vet and it was awful, we could tell she was in pain. So after that the next time my dad got some kind of gas from work. In the comfort of home we were able to set her in a box, the top was wide open so we could see an pet her the whole time, then as the gas filled the box she just got sleepy and passed on. It was so much more peaceful then the vet. It was several years ago so I'm not completely sure but I think the gas was nitrous oxide.</p>

        <p>Literally the only story I've heard about a dog dying that I have felt good about. I don't think anyone could ask for anything more humane. The separating people from their animals before putting them down is heartbreaking and ridiculous.</p>

        <p>The first dog, when my dad took her to the vet, my dad recommend that my brother and I not come with. I'm glad I didn't go because a year later when the second dog needed to be put down he insisted on doing it himself. That's when my dad told us about how horrible it was at the vet. She was shaking, twitching and obviously in pain. That day at the vet my dad promised himself he would never take a pet to the vet to be put down again. It was sad to watch her go but at least she was at home, a place she felt safe; laying on her favorite blanket and in the company of her family.</p>

        <p>If it helps at all, death by inert-gas hypoxia is not only peaceful, but believed to be euphoric.  The pain and panic of suffocation only happens with carbon dioxide due to an evolutionary quirk.  Nitrogen, helium and other inert gases don't activate the suffocation nervous response and so there's no pain, no distress, no suffering.  It's one of the reasons that it's dangerous for kids to play with helium balloons and give themselves chipmunk voices - it's easy to inhale too much helium without any physiological danger signs.</p>
<p>If your little gal was put down with nitrous oxide, you can rest easy that she went in peace.</p>

<p>were you not aware at this point, that the animal vaccines are untested poison just like the human vaccines?</p>
<p>and why did you let them do that? </p>
<p>imagine government telling you, that they will inject some things in secret behind closed doors into your child and you are not allowed to see what it is, how much it is or what ACTUALLY happens behind the closed doors to your child.</p>
<p>why is it so hard for people to just say NO! enough is enough!</p>
<p>but i guess maybe you still just thought, that any vaccine holds any overall benefit, which they don't....</p>

        <p>For the love of god don't advocate for skipping the rabies vaccine. Rabies is 100% fatal and can spread between all mammals. You can minimally vaccinate your pet (adolescent immunizations and then annual titers) but you're an irresponsible shitty owner if you don't vaccinate for rabies.</p>

        <p>We were fortunate enough that our vet was allowing 2 people back in the room when we put our cat to sleep, but my aunt’s vet would not let her in when she had to do so with her dog. It made me so mad, I would have driven to another vet for sure. Ours even let us go maskless though they weren’t supposed to, because we didn’t want the last thing our cat saw to be our masked and covered faces. </p>
<p>Before we took him to the vet we were inquiring about in home euthanasia because taking cats to the vet is clearly very stressful for everyone involved. The places we called told us they’d have to do it in the garage, with the door open, yes even for an 18 year old frail cat who hadn’t been outside a day in his life on a 25° day. They also told us we’d have to step back while they administered the medication because we couldn’t be within 6 feet of the vet. So they’d have our kitty and we’d just be watching from 6ft away in our cold garage. It was disgusting-worse than what the vet was requiring, the vet let me hold him while she did it and didn’t care about the 6ft crap. I have no idea how you can tell someone they can’t be with or hold or touch their pet as they pass. </p>
<p>I’m so sorry for your loss and that this crazy shit made it even more difficult. It’s disgusting and wrong and I feel so deeply for you right now.</p>

        <p>Socialism is inherent authoritarian, precisely because it requires the government controls everything. And basically every socialist content has resulted in everyone being equally poor except for a small elite. Child of Venezuelan immigrants who has followed the situation, so I should know.</p>

        <p>Socialism is the direct control of production. In Venezuela a lot of the production was private back then too. Goverment/public money was gambled away with the belief the money from oil (which was state controlled) would keep rolling in, it wasn't the system at fault it was corrupt officials that failed them. I doubt the sanctions imposed on them by the west helped either.</p>
<p>Socialism has a definition, it isn't defined as the elite get money and the poor don't. The money didn't funnel down to the people. That was the issue, not socialism.</p>

<p>And thats what happens everytime. It's a feature of socialism, not a bug. The people in power tell all the useful idiots how totally awesome socialism will be, then consolidate all power and wealth in the hands of a few elites. It's happened time and time again, and will happen the next time someone thinks socialism is super super cool man.</p>

        <p>No it isn't. The definition is clear.</p>
<p>Because people are corruptible/greedy doesn't mean the system is at fault. You don't blame car manufacturers for people who drink drive. Ridiculous. </p>
<p>I've never once said I agree or disagree with "super super cool" socialism either, but if you're going to say socialism is bad you gotta prove it in way of showing how the system failed not the people controlling it, for example in Venezuela what control did the "whole" have? None, it was crony socialism. </p>
<p>Fed up with this stance, capitalism is defended because the system we have isn't really capitalism its crony capitalism. But when a country is said to be socialist its just "socialism is bad" Socialism isn't allowed a bad name because its socialism not crony socialism.</p>
<p>Venezuela failed because government officials did not as a socialist government should, it's that simple. </p>
<p>Italy had it's most prosperous years in the 70s with socialism. It can/does work but it is totally dependant on having the correct people in government. Same with any system.</p>

        <p>My fiancé and I had to say goodbye to our dog in the fucking car park last week whilst other people waited for their pets to go in/out. Our dog had an IV drip attached to him and could barely stand, we were sobbing, and the people waiting nearby probably had their day completely ruined. </p>
<p>All because of a fucking overblown cold virus we couldn't be with our dog for his final moments and we had to make our goodbyes in public. Fucking disgusting if you ask me.</p>

        <p>What possible harm could come of you having contact with your own pet? If you had COVID-19 it's far more likely you'd transmit it to them within the household than the small amount of time left. Even then, if the pet is going to be taken back to a room by itself what do they think it will transmit the virus to? The whole policy is absurd.</p>
<p>I can't help but think some people get a sadistic thrill out of making others miserable and they are far more prevalent in our society and (especially) its power structures than most even suspect. What other explanation for all this makes sense?</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry to hear about your cat. Such a hard time to lose a pet, let alone not being able to be there with her when it happens. She knows you loved her a lot I'm sure, but that isn't much consolation.</p>

        <p>Our vet was kind enough to let us come into the room, take our masks off and hold our cat Nermal as she was put down (she had inoperable cancer). She was frightened of us and didn't realise who we were until we took them off. I'm really thankful they were empathetic enough to let us do that, so that she wasn't scared and alone. They even sent us a condolence card signed by all the staff a few days later. I can't imagine how awful you must have felt and still feel, not being allowed to be there. I'm so sorry, and angry on your behalf... these monsters are trying to take away everything that makes us human. &lt;3</p>

        <p>It has been frustrating this year with vet visits, I've had to go to the 24/7 ER clinic a few times and you have to wait in your car and hand the pet off. Always made me think what happens in a real emergency, since the wait time is hours and hours. I've actually a few years ago had to go to the same clinic for an urgent emergency, and under these guidelines my dog would have died in the car well before anyone ever came out.</p>
<p>Luckily I have a home vet and when we had to put my elderly cat down a few months ago she came to the house and did her thing as usual no masks or anything required.</p>

        <p>if you live a place, that didn't run a bunch of false flags to disarm the public, then i would suggest the folowing if you got  an animal living with you, that clearly and unquestionable suffers needless and without any hope:</p>
<p>buy a shotgun,  cuddle the animal and then shoot them into the head from point blank.</p>
<p>i am against all animal ownership in general and of course animals can never consent to wanting assisted suicide, but if you are doing all that anyways, then that might be a better option, than to give the animal to some traitors, that will blindly follow criminal legislation from a traitor government.</p>
<p>this suggestion is of course all about the animal's suffering and avoiding that.</p>
<p>shotgun shot to the head has the lowest possible agony and the highest success rate, so it equals the nembutal injection given by the idiot doctor in that regard pretty much.</p>
<p>if you have never shot a gun, then you should of course practice quite a bunch before and learn proper handling of weapons.</p>
<p>not only would this give the animal a likely better ending in their "home" and with their slavemaster, who thinks loves them (refering to you here in this case). but it also makes you not reliant on a sick insane system, that you rightfully point out is insane.</p>
<p>another example would be to do homebirths with proper sane midwifes instead of horrible hospital births, that carry a higher risk of complications and a much higher risk of trauma for the mother and baby.</p>

<p>you know what would really be horrible? if you shoot the animal in the head and the animal is still alive afterwards for some time....</p>
