        <p>I personally do believe in wearing masks because it's a small inconvenience and is something a person can do that might make a difference.  However, I am against governments overreaching to shut down businesses and destroy economies.  So I'd like to ask you why you believe that economies and personal livelihoods should be utterly annihilated to combat a low-mortality virus, if in fact you believe that.  Please explain.</p>

        <p>And what happens when complying with a minor inconvenience, today, opens the door to more restrictive mandates or laws, tomorrow? </p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember when we were told the TSA would be temporary. The government told the American people that income taxes and the IRS were going to be temporary.</p>
<p>People, especially younger people, need to understand, once our system takes something, they never give it back. They don't have to, because our system knows everyone will say, well, there is nothing I can do about it. </p>
<p>Our freedoms and rights have been, slowly, removed since 9/11. It is done so quietly, we rarely notice. Over the last few months, it has been blatant. </p>
<p>Its not about not wanting to wear a mask. Its about their use not making sense. More importantly, its about principle. If no real and consistent explanation can be given, for why we are supposed to wear them, logical reasoning tells me there is something else behind it. </p>
<p>The response to the virus doesn't match up with the threat of the virus. Period. It doesn't feel right. And, I will always trust my instinct over just about anything. People have to be willing to consider the possibility that we are not being told the truth. Our government and our politicians lie to us about, pretty much, everything. This is more clear now than its ever been. Why is it so hard to imagine we are being lied to about the virus? </p>
<p>Power, money and control, the kind the top 1% are used to having, is powerful beyond imagination. We are living in surreal times and it is obvious, anything is possible. You just have to be willing to look deeper into things and to stop believing everything is a conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>We already have the more restrictive things in the form of governments overreaching to close businesses and destroy livelihoods for no reason.  So that's why I say forget about the masks.  The people on this board are really ridiculous with the fixation on masks when something way worse has been going on for eight months and is coming back.  People need to protest in the same way as the race baiters over the summer, and to be taken seriously by the media, they must be wearing masks.  Otherwise they'll just be derided in the media as crazy trumpers.</p>

        <p>Ah, no, you're evading my question by using shaming tactics against people.  Forget about masks.  I'll re-ask.  Why do you believe that governments should be allowed to destroy the fabric of society by overreaching to close businesses they do not own and put people out of work to <em>attempt to</em> combat a low-mortality virus?  Please answer without talking points you've been force fed coming down on those who voted for whomever.</p>

        <p>When exactly did the metric go from hospitalizations and deaths to cases?  Perhaps when the hospitalizations and deaths began decreasing?   Everyone called for increased testing.  As soon as there was, as expected, thebummer of cases went up. Now everyone is concerned about cases going up?</p>

        <p>The people who take time out of their day to visit this sub and ask this question are the gift that keeps on giving. Like herpes.</p>
<p>Can someone please put together a standard response that can be given to anyone else that comes here to ask why all of us enjoy breathing fresh air, more than we enjoy sucking on a saliva covered germ cloth all day long, or, why we prefer not to comply with forced antisocial behaviors? That would make this repetitive, unoriginal question so much easier to deal with. I will do it if nobody else wants to.</p>
<p><em>Note: I don't recall anyone saying they don't believe in masks or social distancing. Of course we believe in them. A mask is an object. They aren't like ghosts or big foot. We see them strapped to peoples faces all the fucking time. Social distancing is an action. Its not some kind of mythical tree elf. Again, we see people doing it all the fucking time as well. So, of course we believe in both of these things.</em> </p>
<p><em>Just like you choose to believe that masks are effective and prefer to wear a piece of fabric over your mouth, we know they aren't effective and we choose not to let our local, state and federal authoritarians tell us what we have to wear, especially over our faces. I am not sure all the mask enthusiasts realize what kind of Pandora's box your childish compliance is opening.</em> </p>
<p><em>And, just like you choose to believe that germs and bacteria and virus particles put on the brakes after traveling 6 feet, we know a three year understands how childish that thinking is and we act accordingly.</em> </p>
<p><em>Point is, we don't ask you to explain why you are so comfortable being told what to wear and not to wear, what is essential and what isn't, how many people you can have in your home, which holidays are allowed and which ones are cancelled, et cetera, et cetera, so on and so forth.</em></p>

        <p>What science?   The science you have been fed?  I've seen enough reports disputing the effectiveness of masks.  Wether the masks are effective or not, they are a symbol of the willingness for people to take what they are spoon fedby so-called authorities.  There is a 99% +/- survival rate IF you contact the virus.  Yet businesses are closing down and our children are losing their childhood.  Now, I'm not sympathetic to those who could be negatively impacted by the virus itself. Those who are in a high risk category must be protected and cared for. That would be money well spent by the feds rather than paying young healthy individuals to stay home.</p>

        <p>It's moreso that I don't believe governents should require the citizens in their city/state/country to wear masks and lockdown.</p>
<p>If someone is that terrified of this virus, they can feel free to take whatever precautions they'd like and to stay home. It's easier than ever to stay home and be lazy. I don't see a reason we need to cripple the economy for a weak as fuck virus, while we simultaneously force millions upon millions of people into becoming victims of poverty, unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, depression, anxiety, and suicide. And that's all just for starters.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why do you guys not believe in masks and social distancing?</p>
<p>This is a loaded question, but since you asked, I will give you my opinion on why I do not wear a mask or believe in "social distancing."</p>
<p><strong>On Masks</strong></p>
<p>I am healthy individual, I do not see why I should wear a medical device that I do not need with an alleged virus that has a 99.06% survival rate. Secondly, I am all for people wearing the mask IF they want to, and not forced to by the government. Just as people have a choice to take the influenza vaccine, I see no difference with a mask. What is the saying pro-choice people like to say, "my body, my choice?" </p>
<p>To the folks that prefer to wear a mask, fine, go ahead wear it, but leave us normal people alone! I do not want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>participate in your conspiracy, </li>
<li>participate in your mass social experiment, </li>
<li>be muzzled like a dog, </li>
<li>be dictated to by a bunch un-elected "health experts" like Fauci, Birx and Gates who couldn't rub to brain cells together and advising on national policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Gates was kicked out of India because his little vaccine fiasco killed people, he is not a M.D., he does not have a college degree (he dropped out), his company Microsoft stole ideas from other companies (Spyglass, Novell, etc.), got sued and lost, wants to depopulate the planet (see TEDx), he wants immunity passpors/papers. I mean, this guy is walking problem, and governments are listening to this guy like he has something valuable to say.</p>
<p>We listened to the "experts" when they said to lock down for a few weeks! Okay, it has been 8 months now, going on 9, and many places in the U.S. are still on lock down. People have lost their livelihoods, lost their businesses, homes, families, friends and worse yet there is no end in sight because this alleged "second wave." Those small mom-and-pop places that went out of business? Guess what? They're not coming back. COVID-19 did not do that, the State governors did that!</p>
<p>Little do these "experts" realize that it is the changing of the seasons, people get sick because of winter. The remedies put in place, lockdowns, masks and "social distancing" clearly is not working. The more the government tries to "help" the worse they are making it.</p>
<p>The NAZIS had a phrase as they sent people off in cattle carts to the death and labor camps when asked by these people, why are they shipping off Jews, Roma, communists, intellectuals and anyone they deemed undesirable: <strong>Es ist zu Ihrer eigenen Sicherheit.</strong> It translates to, "<em>it is for your own safety.</em><strong>"</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Social Distancing</strong></p>
<p>As with the masks, you want to participate in the scam, fine, go ahead, just please do not include me in it. I, like other normal human beings prefer to participate in perfectly normal human activities while understanding the risks. We've been doing it for over two thousand years, and I see no reason to stop.</p>
<p>Now, you mask folks will say, by you not wearing the mask you're being disrespectful to others! Uh, um, no I am not; you do not have to come near me, just as much I do not go near you mask folks because frankly, I think you are psychologically and mentally ill, and I choose to stay away from you.</p>
