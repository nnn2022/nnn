        <p>I really hate to rain on this moment. I promise I do. Don't kill me for advocating the devil here.
But if you wanted a solid, unassailable smoking gun to slap the doom out of people with, this ain't it. It's too easy to pick apart. </p>
<p>Foremost the lady there admits up front to being confirmation biased AF. She says they filed documents and sued and all those things in an effort to prove their premise of "the virus doesn't exist". The response letter they gave her doesn't say that though. It says "you asked us for OUR [the health agency's] records proving virus isolation but we don't have any of those. Move along, not your droids, etc etc". Meaning, we won't state those proofs do or don't exist, just that we don't have them archived or the research doesn't belong to us so we can't produce them at will for you.</p>
<p>All the doomer has to do to stay comfortably in his world of fear is interpret that to mean the agency didn't <em>personally</em> verify the virus studies but are acting based on findings from other organizations that did. Which is definitely incompetent and farcical but not <em>necessarily</em> malicious if you read it that way. I don't, I just want to add. National policy set because of [China?]'s pinky promise that it's really really bad you guys. Sure it was. They're not that dumb. It's a scam, like we've said this whole time.</p>

        <p>This virus has never been isolated by anyone, anywhere ever. A woman named Christine Massey is doing this via FOI requests. No one can verify virus isolation. https://youtu.be/R6-8VRGvNtQ</p>

<p>Not true, adamus8.</p>
<p>You can keep on BS'ing that "They never isolated SARS-CoV-2!" Sorry but the CDC and numerous other organizations have.</p>
