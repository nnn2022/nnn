    <strong>Loner during the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanna tell you people i'm a loner during this no new normal and it's been really depressing, I wanna make new friends I feel comfortable talking with but it became much harder during this time.</p>
<p>I also got banned on Facebook for being too critical about covid</p>
<p>I wish I had people I could talk to during these times.
I wish I could talk to someone  about the mental issues I'm getting from this crisis.</p>
<p>And it's hard for a loner finding friends these times because I don't wanna hang out with people that accept this new normal.</p>
<p>These restrictions is also stressing me out and I have not even smiled one time the whole year because it's uncomfortable thinking about the future and it sucks I can't live freely and do the things I could do during pre-covid and human connections has become so awkward with mask on and that makes me sad and this all hits me harder since I've become a lonely person and I just wish I had friends that listen and i can talk about the struggles i' m going thru without being seen as a evil person or murderer for wanting to live a normal life again.</p>
<p>I miss it I just can't take it anymore, the only thing that would make me happy during this time is to have some good conversations with people that still have a normal functioning brain.</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of us can relate.</p>
<p>It does feel good to find like-minded people but weâ€™re intentionally being separated</p>

        <p>Yeah it sucks that humanity is being separated, I miss human connections. </p>
<p>It's like they created a world that makes me feel uncomfortable to live in but also uncomfortable to die in.</p>
