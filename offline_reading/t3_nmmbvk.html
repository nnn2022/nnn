    <strong>I find it interesting that my wellness plan for work hasn't pressured me to get the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>In order to get life insurance for work, I have to participate in a "wellness plan". I don't like it, because it's invasive. I have to answer questions  about every aspect of my life, every habit, etc. There's even one that lists every food known to man and I have to put how many servings per day, how many times a week I eat it. They want lab numbers, etc. I get credits for taking extra tests for cholesterol and all that. So basically this company is trying to reduce their risk. They don't want me to die, because they don't wanna pay out life insurance. I would say they actually have a stake in whether I live or die. So why haven't they muttered a peep about the vaccine? Have their statisticians found that it's a health risk, not something that adds years?</p></p>

        <p>Have they brought up the flu vaccine previous years?</p>
<p>We have something similar where I work but it mostly just focuses on fitness, blood works and alcohol consumption.</p>

        <p>They're probably not yet allowed to ask; I'm sure their legal team is researching the implications of starting to ask or expect this to blow over before they're clear on their CYA concerns.</p>

        <p>Or possibly it’s all gonna be turned on its head and the adverse effects of the vaccines will be what precludes coverage.  Yeah I’m not convinced that insurance companies would be on the same page as the drug companies...  In fact I had read something about a woman in New York who works for the government I think she is a corrections officer who had an adverse reaction to vaccine and her insurance company GHI which is the one for most New York government entities was apparently refusing to pay the bills. Ultimately maybe there angle to is that the drug companies will have to pay if this does become the thing we are thjnking and the truth can no longer be ignored...  or the government via some sort of 911 type of fund. The buck is certainly being passed all over the place here and think about it - for all of these enticing lotteries etc. I wonder what you have to sign anything because if you are essentially being coerced by free this or that especially by the chance at winning a huge sum of money or by getting a full ride scholarship are they not creating a duty of care to you that if you got hurt by the vaccine they’d be responsible?</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be at all surprised that these "get stuck for a chance to win $1M" have liability clauses 30 pages long for the winner to sign before they even say the word "cash" in the same room as you.</p>

        <p>I was thinking the same thing about insurance in general. They probably aren't happy about paying out for policies that are gonna cost them more money. Same with health insurance. If you're Vaccinated, congrats. You now basically have a pre-existing condition.</p>

        <p>Your wellness program should have been responsible for the response to coronavirus. Sounds like they're actually encouraging healthy eating and reducing risk of disease.</p>
<p>Not telling everyone to stay inside, shut up, and stick out your arm.</p>
