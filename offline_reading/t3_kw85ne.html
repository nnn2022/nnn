    <strong>Corona virus doesn't exist in 3rd World Countries</strong>
    <p><p>It just doesn't. They simply cannot be fucked to perpetuate the fear mongering bullshit. They don't need to. Most (if not all) 3rd world countries have very corrupt governments, they don't need to fear monger the public to do whatever they want, they already do. I was watching this video from <a href="https://youtu.be/v0GjT3DJoHw?t=285">Haiti</a>, a very poor 3rd world country. No corona there. None. </p>
<p>Not to mention, if this pandemic really was that fucked, wouldn't the mainstream media cover how bad it is in other countries? Would they not show footage of piles of bodies on the side of the road and  torn families etc etc. From a rationale stand point, this would make people see what happens when we don't follow the rules and be an effective incentive.</p>
<p>Doesn't add up to me, if it was as serious as they say, there would be multiple examples of 3rd world countries, with no social distancing, masks, hospitals, health care systems, dense populations etc, getting ravaged by covid, but there aren't.</p></p>

        <p>I find it interesting how the guy in the video says first that in Haiti, no one wears a mask. Like that's the thing that tells him COVID-19 isn't a problem in Haiti. And it goes to show that the restrictions <em>are</em> the pandemic. This virus has no impact on the average person. Most people don't even know someone who died. So take away the masks and lockdowns, and "the pandemic" goes away.</p>
<p>And he says no one is dying of it, but if you do some research (which I'm sure this guy would never do), <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">you'll find that Haiti has a low amount of deaths,</a> but it's not zero. In fact, Haiti's death rate is slightly lower than South Korea, a country that's gone nuts with the tracing and the masks. I'm sure if you asked the average Korean what they thought about COVID-19 they'd have a lot to say. And again, it just goes to show that the real impact is the restrictions.</p>
<p>And I think that's also why people get so crazy about the masks. If you take away the masks, and people don't start dying in the streets, COVID-19 is revealed for the farce that it is, and it shows people they're doing all this bullshit for nothing.</p>
<p>But it's also interesting that the guy can't figure this out. He sees Haitians don't wear masks, and he sees no one is dying, but he can't figure out that it's because masks do nothing. Christ, the average person is so dumb.</p>

        <p>The source you've listed outlines two different metrics. First is a case/death ratio, the other is the number of deaths per 100k people.</p>
<p>Haiti has a c/d of 2.3% but d/100k of 2.14.</p>
<p>Korea has a c/d of 1.7% but d/100k of 2.29.</p>
<p>You are being vague and misleading.</p>

<p>While I think there is some truth to this, it is worth noting that people dying in the streets was never a realistic scenario. The goal, charitably, is to stop hospital ICUs from being overrun, which would significantly raise the fatality rate (since the present low fatality rate is based on people actually receiving treatment).</p>

        <p>People have been gathering en masse over and over all year long all over the country and we are all still here.  That PEAK was eradicated a long time ago.   If you really wanted to wait to flatten the curve, you would have realized that that time has come and gone.  The PCR test is bad.  It pumps out false positives and keeps people afraid.  No hospital is overflowing that wasn't already overflowing before covid.</p>

        <p>The PCR test is a bad metric. The only useful metric is the number of remaining ICU beds (which is different from number of hospital beds, because you can have a nearly empty hospital with little ICU capacity), and in some areas those have been at or over the tipping point. Without ICU treatment, the small number of people who become seriously ill would be dying at a far greater rate. Note that even if this happens, in some sense "we will all still be here," because most people don't even become seriously ill in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course there are problems with this - we don't even know that masks and lockdowns even accomplish anything in terms of the spread, but it's not an unreasonable fear. I have a far greater issue with the fact that I'm under lockdown in a jurisdiction that is relatively far away from the hospitals that are at or near max ICU capacity, because governments are just not interested in having very complicated pandemic restrictions, instead reaching for very simple policy tools that the public can be counted on to understand.</p>
<p>On the bright side, scientists can be counted on to figure this stuff out eventually, because science has built-in self-correcting mechanisms, the problem is that a year is basically no time at all in scientific terms but a very long time in human terms.</p>

        <p>It isn't fake, but we over-reacted and went completely insane on shutting down society. I had it. Getting sick isn't fun but swine flu was way worse, in my experience.</p>
<p>Protect the vulnerable. If you are vulnerable you make your choice. That's the end of it and the only advice given previously, even for something with a 30% death rate like a resurgence of some antibiotic resistant Plague. The WHO and CDC never, ever suggested any of this - until China....</p>
<p>My grandmother died of isolation. She was miserable. Heartbroken.</p>
<p>My father-in-law died of cancer which could notbe treated as promptly, not due to busyness, but lockdown. He was hospitalized a few times - hospital was empty, he was the only patient on the ward. Alone. Completely alone. Told he had cancer alone, too. Super awesome.</p>
<p>You pro-lockdowners don't seem to understand subs like this. They are against the over-reacting, insane, society-destroying mandates and lockdowns. Every doctor I know, including my own, and my cousin who is a physician in London who works on Covid patients at St Thomas's, agrees.</p>

        <p>Even if they do have a lot of it, they wouldn't care. They have much bigger problems than a disease with a 99.9% survival rate that almost exclusively only affects people who are already dying. So do we for that matter.</p>

        <p>I was just wondering too with the amount of obesity and sloth-like activity that exists in the First World if that has been our biggest "super spreader" compared to the Third World. I know that many in the Third World are malnourished compared to us and that death from diarrhea is a very real occurrence. I'm not health trainer or medical professional but I would think their constant need to provide for themselves day in and day out, preparing all of their food and often hunting or gathering for it leads to much less sloth, obesity, and the like.</p>

        <p>Lockdown made it even worse, though we never really locked down. The middle class just stayed home while people delivered things to them. In doing so, the already obese American population ended up in a position where they were going to gain a pound or two or three per month.</p>

        <p>Not entirely true. Am from South Africa and can confirm that the brainwashing is very real and active 24/7. People can talk or think of nothing else. I have seen my grandparents deteriorate because they are so fearful of contracting the virus they will die. I am sure if they got a cold today they will be dead tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also, due to the high cases of HIV in RSA, our government has decided it is absolutely essential to lock us down as far as they can. The truth is, the average south african just does not have the means to socially distance. Which, in my mind, means this shit is here to stay and we will all need to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>It wont be long before government starts force feeding us the patriotism in the act of getting vaccinated. We will be forced to.</p>
<p>Also, Bill Gates has a large presence in rural communities in South Africa. So I am sure we will be guinea pigs in one way or another if you believe he has something to do with these vaccines like I do. 3rd world countries are otherwise dispensable, we have served no other purpose but to birth Elon Musk imho.</p>

        <p>Look at Ivory Coast - population 25 million, leading cause of death - childbirth, followed by AIDS, followed by lower respiratory diseases (likely TB). Covid deaths? 150ish.  Yea, scary virus we've got here.  Are we somehow expected to believe that a 3rd world country who can't even stop women dying during childbirth or control TB has a better pandemic response than every first world country? How much more obvious could it be?</p>

I have also heard that teachers and parents will gather testimony to get kids on medication. The teacher wins cause they have a docile student.

        <p>I tend to agree. I think having it too easy can lead to depression. There was a time when primitive people had to struggle everyday to survive. I think we've lost a little bit of that. I'm not saying that everyone with depression has it too good. There are lots of types. But I think doctors should evaluate a patient's lifestyle more before prescribing meds.</p>

        <p>Yep, very good post this one. Thank you OP. This should serve as a good example of what to bring up with the doomers when they inevitably go after us. Obviously they'll spew something, but I think this example minimises the severity of the bullshit we're likely to get in response, and if someone doesn't consider this point as a means to wake up, then nothing will.</p>

        <p>For sure, the hysteria in the West has been extreme. They might have other things to do than sitting around watching TV or Facebook in other places. I could think of a few other reasons as well though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">Go to this overview</a>, and sort by "Total Cases / 1M pop" or "Deaths / 1M pop", staring with the least first. Now scroll slowly downwards. Ignore all the micro-states with less than a million. With very few exceptions, the first hundred is a who's who amongst the poorest nations in the world. They simply don't have any infrastructure nor resources to test millions of people and keep an organized account of the causes of death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in many of those places, life expectancy is significantly lower than in the West. Here, Covid has hit pensioners the most. Not a problem if there is hardly anybody above 60.</p>
<p>Finally, many of those states are already dictatorships or totalitarian regimes. Why waste your energy on scare tactics to control the population when you're in full control already.</p>

The only person i know who died of covid was my very old grandfather. Im not saying old people don't matter, but putting the whole contry in lockdown because some people could die is dumb.</p>

        <p>One important thing to keep in mind from a perspective is how "died with Covid" is calculated to "died from Covid." I imagine if that were more accurate it might change most of our perspective. If indeed it were proven accurate I think we might be more convinced of the seriousness of Covid-19. Unfortunately we know far too many stories of people testing positive after dying from something else completely unrelated or being recorded as "died with Covid" when they were suffering other ailments. Then there is the reliability of PCR testing in this regard.</p>
<p>And let me be clear, I'm not insensitive to death or discount the loss of loved ones. In the last year I had a student who died from a very treatable cancer because his appointments and treatments were delayed "due to Covid" and a former classmate who committed suicide because he was denied access to the hospital for his mental health "due to Covid."</p>

        <p>It's hard to be ravaged by covid when you're being ravaged by other diseases (or you're constantly fighting some). Haiti has covid cases. The death rate for covid per capita is much higher in Haiti. But there are fewer cases and even fewer are reported.</p>
