        <p>If Kary Mullis was alive today he would certainly be fighting the way the PCR test that he invented is being used today.</p>
<p>He was always Fauci's greatest critic, and I recommend looking up the interviews and watching them for yourself.</p>
<p>Sadly, he died just before the Covid-19 era began.</p>
<p>2017 Jan 10 = Fauci says, "there will be a surprise outbreak and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you'll understand why"</p>
<p>Jun 28, 2017 = World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility</p>
<p>Aug 7, 2019 = Kary Mullis (nobel prize winning inventor of PCR Test, long time critic of Fauci) dies of pneumonia</p>
<p>Aug 19, 2019 = Blackrock issues its plan for "the next downturn" with advice to the Fed to transfer large amounts of money but no instructions how to justify doing so</p>
<p>September 17, 2019 = Fed begins intervention in the repo markets</p>
<p>Sep 19, 2019 = Trump signs executive order 13887, paving the way for accelerated vaccines and creating the "Influenza Task force" which we'd later know as the Covid-19 task force. (Formed by bringing together heads of DOD, DOJ, DOA, DHS, USFDA, CDC, NIH, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA))</p>
<p>Oct 18, 2019 = Event 201, pandemic exercise</p>
<p>2019 Dec 1 = Symptoms of the index case (patient zero) began</p>
<p>2020 April 20 = Coronavirus spread triggers World Bank pandemic bond payout (investors lose their money)</p>
<p>timeline incomplete, but this is a rough outline of some key moments in the history of all this</p>

        <p>although this was continuous throughout and not at a specific date, the feds 0% interest rates and quantitative easing tripled billionaire and corporate wealth while the government forced millions of small businesses to go bankrupt through lockdowns. this was a corporate takeover from start to finish, in an attempt to wipe out as many small businesses as possible. big pharma, big tech, big food, all won big this year and into the foreseeable future. neoliberalism won.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. And included in that is smalltime landlords. You wouldn't believe the frivolous lawsuit I am going through right now in California where tenants who haven't paid rent in two years have done over $100,000 in damage to a property, are protected from eviction thanks to Covid-19, and are now suing for $650,000 in "pain and suffering" for having to live in the damage they created.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable. In a normal time this lawsuit would be thrown out, but we are in a time when the system is deliberately crushing small business owners, so we worry.  My wife could lose the inherited home she grew up in over this.</p>
<p>Also interesting - they have certain protections that were given by a tenant protection act that was passed in California at the end of 2019 right before Covid.</p>
<p>Just another coincidence...</p>

        <p>I have other means of income.</p>
<p>Apparently you think it's wrong to rent to someone? We own the property. The issue with unpaid rent is because it's an inherited property where the renters had taken advantage of my mother-in-law's inability to take legal action to get them out. They are squatters. We are dealing with that.</p>
<p>As far as renting it out goes. Well, we could just <em>hold the property</em> and then <em>no one</em> can use it. That would then make real estate even more scarce in this city.</p>
<p>One of the reasons so many people support the Covid-19 agenda is that they believe the talk of "reducing income inequality" that WEF talks about. But these people have no idea of what that actually means.</p>
<p>They think it means for <em>them</em> to do better, but it actually means to push them even further down. They're talking about reducing income inequality between the middle class and the absolute destitute poor. I don't even mean American homeless people, I mean the 3rd world really really really poor.</p>
<p>And this isn't conspiracy theory, it's stated quite clearly in <strong>Kissinger's National Security Study Memorandum 200, Implications of Worldwide Population Growth</strong><br>
<strong>For U.S. Security and Overseas Interests</strong> <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf">https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a></p>
<p>To put it in other words, it states that the middle class has too much money and comfort and it's causing them to think they should have children. By paying them less and making food more expensive, they will be less likely to reproduce.</p>
<p>The poor people they worry about are the ones that have multiple children because they know they all won't make it. They want to bring them up to just below middle class and push the middle class down to the same place.</p>
<p>What they want is that sweet spot of people chasing what we call "The American Dream" but never being able to make it.</p>
<p>So this attack on small business and smalltime landlords is an attack on the class just below, as well.  In reality, we aren't that different. In terms of income we're quite similar compared to the people orchestrating this economic change.</p>
<p>If you put their income on a graph and our income on a graph -- the renter and the small time landlord's little tiny dot of income and wealth looks identical.</p>
<p>Also, turning working people against that next class above removes any hope of them ever aspiring to that level. Want to save up and buy a house to rent out? Start a small business? You won't be able to do that.</p>
<p>The future is all about workers working, and getting less, and never making enough to own anything or have any real control over their lives.</p>
<p>It is plantations and slavery all over again. Don't be fooled just because you resent paying rent. When you attack the next class above you are also attacking yourself, because it is really the UBER INCREDIBLE WEALTHY that are against all of us.</p>

        <p>Great reply and info, there's just a lot of frustration and angst against the rentier class right now. Corporate Capitalism is failing spectacularly and so anything that smacks of defense of this system usually receives the criticism it deserves.</p>

        <p>It's on the list of weird Covid-19 coincidences, for sure, but we have no proof of this. </p>
<p>The way they are using him in "fact checker" websites is really horrible, though. If you watch any video interviews of him, he would absolutely disagree STRONGLY with how the PCR test was used in regard to Covid-19.</p>
<p>The fact checker websites in general are straight up propaganda tools. Sadly, people believe them. They exist to intercept anyone who searches anything after speaking with a so-called "Covid-19 denier," "anti-vaxxer", or "anti-masker."</p>
<p>Combine those tools with general dehumanization of us in media and it programs a logical-short-circuit that is triggered by certain keywords when we converse.</p>

        <p>I know there's no way to prove it, but the timing is awfully convenient. All we'd need is the inventor of the test explaining exactly what's wrong with how they're using the test and the whole coronavirus narrative falls apart.  He could testify in court if the media won't have him. Without their false positives - all the manufacturered "cases" the false pandemic ceases.  They'd have to end the "state of emergency" which means no emergency powers.  Which means no emergency use authorized experimental vaccines. No masks.   No global health theater. Of course Kary Mullis had to die.</p>

        <p>We went from 2.8 million deaths in 2019 to 3.2 million deaths (400,000 extra - 16%) in 2020. You can't just claim the epidemic was mislabeling or bad labs. We have 400,000 extra dead people-- 16%-- in a number that doesn't change more than 5% up or down each year. So--- YOU explain it. You don't like COVID? We want your hypothesis.</p>

        <p>Yeah, over half the reported covid deaths are <em>over</em> the average life expectancy, and only 4% of reported covid deaths are being attributed to covid with no additional comorbidities. The wu-flu is a stiff breeze taking out people who have had one foot in the grave for years.</p>

        <p>Is that your threshold? 16%? Or would you do the same if it was say 10% or even 1%? And would you take it further? What if it was 20%? What would you do?</p>

        <p>I didn't make any claims. I made a statement based on information provided directly by the CDC. </p>
<p>My hypothesis, if you want to call it that, is this, the CDC has made multiple changes to their processes and protocols over the last year, with no real explanation as to why. They changed treatment recommendations and protocols. They changed their processes for classifying and reporting cases and deaths. These changes were made just as things were heating up here in the US. These processes and protocols had been in place for a very long time. These adjustments and changes, in my opinion, make it difficult to know what the true numbers are. The lack of transparency, as to why they were made, makes it difficult to believe the numbers and the data is accurate and/or trustworthy. </p>
<p>As for excess deaths, I would say, yes, there very well could be some of those. We have had seen an increase in suicides committed, overdose deaths and domestic violence deaths. All of which were a direct result of the measures taken over the last year. The lockdowns, the removal of personal interaction, the destruction of economies, the stress and despair caused deaths that probably would not have happened if it was life as usual. Bottom line, for me, the numbers and data can't be trusted at this point in time.</p>

        <p>I am gonna make an educated guess most of that 400k extra was because of doctors over reaction to covid and putting people on ventilators who should not have been.</p>
