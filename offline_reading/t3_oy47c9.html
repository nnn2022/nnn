<title>More proof of Delta bullshit and media propaganda. Public Health England (PHE) which started the entire Delta craze, reported on July 9 that the Delta case fatality rate was only 0.2%, ten times less than regular covid. Delta symptoms are runny nose. Entire thing is fraud.</title>

        <p>Can confirm.</p>
<p>My whole family (no Covid vaccines) got the "Delta Variant" from a fully vaccinated family member that came over coughing, sneezing, and snotting.</p>
<p>It was a harmless cold that passed in a few days. There are 6 of us and most had minimal symptoms or none at all. My 13 year old had a slight fever and went to bed early one night.</p>
<p><em>EVERYONE PANIC! SHUT DOWN THE GLOBE!</em> <strong>/S</strong></p>
<p>The fully vaxxed family member who spread it to us had worse symptoms than we did... And he got it from his fully-vaccinated wife that contracted it while visited family in Mexico.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Bottom line? There's no reason to panic about the "Delta variant" and none of this is about the virus. <em>It never was.</em></p>

        <p>They also massively exaggerated the death toll and risk of the Alpha variant as it turns out: https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/why-no-one-can-ever-recover-from-covid-19-in-england-a-statistical-anomaly/</p>
