        <p>Paranoid delusions. I've indulged several doomers and they are incapable of responding with any level of rationale. Their reasoning is contrived of nothing but verbal assaults. Even when they make an effort to pretend to know something they quickly get backed into a corner and come out swinging with more insults. </p>
<p>It seems apparent that there is a real sickness that has spread, and as a result, we have a sizable population who are sociopathetic narcissists who have also spiraled into a full blown psychosis screaming "killers", "death to all non believers" and "we just want to save lives" all in one breadth.. Scary.</p>

        <p>I tried myself and with all of these people it's no stretch of the truth to say this is some kind of mass psychosis. And you know what? It was always like this, this whole situation just enabled them to do so openly and be praised and even awarded for it. They allowed and contributed their own society's collapse out of nothing but paranoia and delusions in a span of just months, our health is now actually on the line due to restrictions and masks, and it never ends because they can never get enough of it.</p>

        <p>"it Was always like this, this whole Situation just enabled them to do so openly and be praised and even awarded for it" maaaaaan same, that's what my Observation is, it's so crazy - we have like a rise of narcisstic gaslighters where everyone encourages each other to repeat the narrative and shut everyone immediately down who doesn't accept that.
I tried to argue with some, but they CHOOSE to ignore questions, rather they'd insult you just for asking a fucking question. Its insane, is it really only fear?</p>

        <p>Absolutely my friend! It has always been like this. We are natural born actors and adopt the roles we are assigned throughout the ages. This has served bot as a positive and negative construct, merely as a result of our basic psychology, but they are most certainly leveraging and exploiting the negative side now.</p>

        <p>True there is no part of our basic psychology as humans that is simply good or bad. It's all there because it serves some sort of purpose. It's ok to follow some sort of blief system and naturally in faith there is power. We're hard wired to be this way, we're always looking for a group to belong to that understands how we feel personally. And many people when they do get exploited like so.They're views become one way streets and suddenly nothing but the single narrative and what it demands matters.</p>
<p>I've thought about this a lot in general on how I am and what I feel or believe. My own perspective on what it means to me to belong to something and how it ties into how I see the world. I've found we're always acting and to do so extremely elaborately, we don't really know anything else. I do have what I feel is a very base personality based on how I biologically came out but much of the rest is all molded by the environment I'm in throughout my life. We subconsciously pick up and use what makes the most sense to us for our current functionality in whatever we're doing. I try not to give into hate because of this, there will always be others that live and feel things radically different than you. But now we have 2 sides of many different clusters of people going at each other. One side is not just some leftists and the other some rightists. Some people are independent and may take a stance based on something not entirely political or religious. Maybe it's a mixed bag, anything can be going on. I'm a little weird there, I like to study all of them and consider myself close to a couple that align with what I view a master and interpretation of god to be. What is happening to society completely goes against this and so I feel violated because there is some so called authority acting as a god over the people that seems to have other plans for mankind and that they know better what is good for us all as individuals in a one size fits all mindset. I have a reason behind everything I feel is wrong and try not to have black and white views. Belief in say like a video I just watched a government is no different than a traditional religion and can be far more dangerous and illogical. We need to take all these things into consideration when looking at the bigger picture of this situation.</p>

        <p>Very well said my friend!! you have certainly endeavored to study human behavior in depth even from an observational perspective. Very similar to myself. I have reached many of the same conclusions as yourself and perhaps we are both weird lol..But isn't that what makes us human? :)</p>

<p>That's what the whole rabid frenzy about masks and social distancing is about. They're as OCD as they are narcissistic and want everyone to follow the rules, it doesn't matter if the rules don't actually prevent transmission of the virus it's all about feeling in control of it. And the idea that it's all about public health is really just them worried they'll get the virus. Or something like that anyway.</p>

<p>Somehow, while dealing with this insanely deadly pandemic, the average life expectancy in the US has actually risen by 0.08%, the same increase as between 2018 and 2019, and better than the 0.03% increase between the two years before those.</p>

        <p>I mentioned the average reported decedent age to my friend and it started a whole thing. He started going on about how I insulted his relatives who died in a nursing home and I'm a delusional conspiracy nut. We got into a whole argument over the phone that lasted about an hour and he hung up on me mid-sentence when I started talking about TikTok nurses. About an hour later I received a whole stream of insults via text message about how I'm mentally ill and have a persecution complex and I'm a weak baby who's crying crocodile tears because I'm too selfish to stop seeing my girlfriend and what am I complaining about unlike most people I haven't been made involuntarily celibate (this one he kept repeating in various iterations, it was quite funny) and until I resolve my mental health crisis he is not speaking to me for 2 months.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks later about halfway into my sentence he bombarded me with another wall of text claiming I've insulted some relative of his in Texas I didn't even know existed and then he starts calling me fat and I get off on tubs of lards and I am a racist and a sexist and a delusional narcissist and in every society there are 5% of the population who is unemployable and spoiled and pointlessly contrarian needs to be brought to heel to solve collective problems like climate change. To conclude his speech he said he is now extending the sentence to 4 months one month for every relative I didn't know existed that my still-unspecified comments have insulted. He has also blocked me on Facebook.</p>
<p>I was friends with this guy for 10 years, we literally went on a road trip together 2 weeks before this argument happened. People are going apeshit over this. It's making people snap. The human brain was not meant to go 9 whole months without sex.</p>

        <p>In my experience, the past is the past.  Sounds like you have an open slot for some new friends.</p>
<p>That said, don't write the guy off or anything, just tell him he can fuck off until he remembers that you were actually friends and leave the ball in his court.  People either come around or re-assess their relationships.  It's always a bummer though.  I literally had an old, as in almost 30 year old circle of friends implode like this, luckily not due to politics, but some internal strife, coupled with the distant relocation of some.  At this point, I'm a family man and external friendships tend to be more of a casual thing anymore, a lot more fleeting than in my youth, but I, personally, like it better that way as it grants me the flexibility to surround myself with people who are going to be more supportive of me furthering my need as opposed to people who think I should just maintain some status quo.</p>

        <p>Accusing everyone else of what they are like, classic psychological warfare tactic that I can't believe people are still falling for. They just swoop into our lives and force what they want on everyone through punishment and aggressive measures yet we're the most crazy and selfish for saying no. Even worse is it's for "our safety", I haven't felt safe in months as it just gets worse and worse.</p>

        <p>in regards to the potentially dangerous, rather than just dangerous.</p>
<p>i have not found one vaccine, that shows an overall improved health outcome.</p>
<p>not 1! and believe me i researched quite some time now.</p>
<p>the DTP vaccine straight up kills u:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/</a> </p>
<p>the hpv vaccines are so bad, that it caused a bunch of lawsuits:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hpv-yakugai.net/english/">https://www.hpv-yakugai.net/english/</a>  and the number of deaths from those are also insane and horrible stories.</p>
<p>then you got some wonderful nasal flu vaccines, that paralyzed part of your face:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa030595">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa030595</a> </p>
<p>and you got the acellular pertussis actually making it more likely, that you spread it:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24277828/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24277828/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines. </p>
<p>this means, that it is a complete failure btw, yet it is still being used. don't worry about it ;)</p>
<p>and you can look at general data for children getting vaccinated vs not vaccinated in the first year of life:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344</a> </p>
<p>getting much higher developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in the group, that got vaccinated within the first year of life.</p>
<p>and if you compare fully unvaccinated children vs vaccinated you see pretty much the same in this pilot study:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article">https://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article</a> </p>
<p>allergic rhinitis 30x more, allergies 3.9x, asd (autism) 4.2x, etc....</p>
<p>and to end this wonderful list of horrible references we got this study:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a> </p>
<p>our wonderful friend bill gates went on a mass children paralyzing, i mean polio vaccination campaign in india.</p>
<p>what was the result? </p>
<p>&rt; A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP. </p>
<p>(NPAFP =non-polio acute flaccid paralysis)</p>
<p>&rt; The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. </p>
<p>oh  you know he paralyzed about half a million children in india with his oral polio madness.</p>
<p>also if the old definition of polio would get used, then it would actually read:</p>
<p>"gates polio vaccination efforts caused half a million cases of polio in india"</p>
<p>thank goodness, that they changed the definition of polio back in the day to fake effectiveness of the vaccines am i right?</p>
<p>so my point is, that i have not see one! vaccine, that improved overall health. not one!</p>
<p>overall health means, that  the person or child  is protected from something actually harmful and the protection is better than the side effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>this was never found in my research! not once!</p>
<p>not smallpox, polio, hpv nonsense, measles, etc... etc....</p>
<p>either the data shows, that it causes harm, or there is no data, because the industry didn't do any studies and no one else did either. (studies are expensive as fuck)</p>
<p>also if this "dangerous" is just referring to the ingredients of the injections, rather than effects, then holy smokes vaccine ingredients are extremely dangerous. aluminium and mercury are both extremely effective neurotoxins to name just 2 ingredients.</p>
<p>so yeah, the potentially doesn't need to be added there sadly.</p>
<p>the healthy children are the ones who never get vaccinated. don't let them inject you with their poison ever again and definitely don't let them get your children with their poison.</p>
<p>1 injection can mean life long suffering beyond the believe of most people sadly.</p>

        <p>If you have not found that benefit with smallpox, polio, and measles vaccines? You are not looking for it.</p>
<p>Those diseases had a 1 out of 12 and 1 out of 10 fatality rate for polio and measles respectively.</p>
<p>Nowadays? You never hear of someone dying from one of those diseases unless they are exceptionally unlucky or dodged the vaccines.</p>
<p>Same thing for smallpox, it has pretty much been wiped from our planet save for the samples of smallpox in various Biohazard Level 4 labs.</p>

        <p>part 2:</p>
<p>measles</p>
<p>first we need to establish what the actual mortality rate from measles was in first world countries:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236291/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK236291.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236291/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK236291.pdf</a> </p>
<p>page 118:</p>
<p>&rt; Whatever its toll in industrialized countries, where the measles fatality rate is 1 per 10,000 cases (Babbott and Gordon, 1954), ...</p>
<p>so if you get measles you had a 1 in 10000 chance of dying back then.</p>
<p>would we still be at 1 in 10000 in the modern age? do we have better nutrition and do we have simple highly effective treatments to prevent any chance for  bad outcomes?</p>
<p>yes we do:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1245303/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1245303/</a> </p>
<p>vitamin A supplementation given for measles cases 400000 iu is a great treatment. measles can be an issue if you for some reason are vitamin A deficient.</p>
<p>but one can't make billions by giving people vitamins now can they?</p>
<p>the science of measles is more interesting however.</p>
<p>so let's assume, that the measles vaccines prevent measles infections for a time period.</p>
<p>so what is then actually happening in society?</p>
<p>instead of children at the ideal age getting measles once in their life time and being protected for life and even giving immunity to their baby in the first year through the placenta and breastmilk, instead you get  measles vaccines, that give you a short period of claimed immunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669617/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669617/</a> </p>
<p>so now you got people getting multiple injections in a life time and  no longer being immune over time and not providing immunity to babies through the placenta and breastmilk and shifting the age from children to adults in many cases where they get measles.</p>
<p>now that all sounds bad, BUT the really interesting part is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490323/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490323/</a>  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043</a>  </p>
<p>&rt; Overall, risk reduction increased with the frequency of infections, with febrile infections affording the greatest protection.  </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122188/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122188/</a>  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915015013805">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915015013805</a>  </p>
<p>&rt; Measles and mumps infections were associated with decreased risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease. </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16406019/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16406019/</a>  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145212605004662">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145212605004662</a>  </p>
<p>&rt; Our findings provide additional support to the hypothesis that infections by most common childhood pathogens may protect against HL or, at least, be correlated with some other early exposure, which may lower the risk of HL in adulthood. In addition, our study shows that measles may provide a protective effect against NHL. </p>
<p>(it is just 3 studies, i added the sciencedirect links, because they are broken sometimes)</p>
<p>these 3 studies show, that having a childhood infection like measles results in less health issues from cancer and heart disease later in life.</p>
<p>with cancer and heart disease being the in the top killers of the people, the question needs to be asked:</p>
<p>is getting childhood infections like measles, with an extremely low mortality rate with treatment and in modern age far far below 1 in 10000, something good, that actually increases life expectancy?</p>
<p>but hey let's look more at the vaccines.</p>
<p>ups what do we have here: 38% of measles cases are from vaccine derived strains of measles:</p>
<p><a href="https://newstarget.com/2019-03-06-genetic-sequencing-science-breakthrough-just-proved-that-measles-outbreaks-are-caused-by-the-measles-vaccine.html?fbclid=IwAR3b0IWt5W98kxD4K6bC9LxK45QuNUial8Rk2hqV4DNy5GvUTldP6PyM0Pw">https://newstarget.com/2019-03-06-genetic-sequencing-science-breakthrough-just-proved-that-measles-outbreaks-are-caused-by-the-measles-vaccine.html?fbclid=IwAR3b0IWt5W98kxD4K6bC9LxK45QuNUial8Rk2hqV4DNy5GvUTldP6PyM0Pw</a> </p>
<p>but i thought, that vaccines should prevent diseases and infections and not cause them.....</p>
<p>now at this point i would love to link you to some decent safety studies on any measles vaccines, but they don't exist. the industry refuses to do RCTs using fully unvaccinated as control groups.</p>
<p>i could say, that they won't do them, because they already know what the results would be, but hey that would be an assumptions.</p>
<p>so what can we do instead? look at vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system), which is a massively underreported dumpster fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. </p>
<p>you can go to this website and get a decently easy to search way to access it:</p>
<p><a href="https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php">https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php</a> </p>
<p>at vaccine types select "measles ... " and then event characteristics select  for one search "died? YES" and for another search:</p>
<p>disabled? YES!</p>
<p>you'll find over 1900 cases of people being disabled after a measles vaccine and over 450 people, who died after a measles vaccine.</p>
<p>to take a closer look at some of the cases you can read this:</p>
<p><a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/3/383">https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/3/383</a> </p>
<p>now you can rightfully say, that those are just reports  and can't be compared to studies.  to which i would say, that the likely for someone to by some random chance finds out, that vaers even exists and then reports a case of adverse reactions is very VERY low. less than 1% as stated by the report before.</p>
<p>so despite that all those reports are in vaers. what are the true numbers of disability and death from the measles vaccines? well the government doesn't want to collect that data, as they refuse to get vaers to work properly and they refuse to do the safety studies.</p>

        <p>alright off we go:</p>
<p>a full presentation going over smallpox:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs</a> </p>
<p>it is full of references, that can and should look up for yourself.</p>
<p>how effective was the smallpox vaccine actually?</p>
<p>well let's look at   <strong>Leicester, England, smallpox mortality rate vs. smallpox vaccination coverage from 1838 to 1910:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png</a> </p>
<p>at 100% vaccination rate with some people even taking extra doses the biggest smallpox outbreaks happened.</p>
<p>there is 0 effectiveness visible from the smallpox vaccine whatsoever.</p>
<p>but you might see, that that can't be, because smallpox is no longer an issue today.</p>
<p>now i would like to invite in the 1850's "cities", where you lived in shit, you had contaminated drinking water, you were starving, you had no hygiene and people were living 10 people in one smelly shity room.</p>
<p>there were NO sewage systems yet. let me repeat that, NO SEWAGE SYSTEMS YET!</p>
<p>you can literally not imagine the "living" conditions, that the people lived in back then.</p>
<p>to the surprise of no one, who actually understands health a bit, once the living conditions changed, the smallpox issue disappeared, regardless of vaccinations.</p>
<p>turns out clean drinking water, hygiene, sewage systems and enough food and somewhat nutritious foods are kind of important.</p>
<p>now let's look at the actual smallpox vaccines.</p>
<p>the smallpox vaccine is so harmful and deadly, that at acip (advisory committee on immunization practices) meetings they discussed, that a wide spread modern smallpox vaccination campaign would cause tons of harm, but more importantly to them it would shake the faith in vaccines as a whole up by the suffering from the vaccine.</p>
<p>the video presentation will go over this part and show the places to get the acip meeting transcripts yourself to look at them.</p>
<p>what did a smallpox vaccination look like back then. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X02000282">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X02000282</a> </p>
<p>look at the second picture, or download it through sci-hub.</p>
<p>the "typically good arm" after a vaccination back then looked horrible. not some redness, but completely horrible. no modern person  would accept that.</p>
<p>however the real issue was, that the vaccinations caused so much harms and deaths, that the parents after seeing, that the vaccine showed 0! protection were no longer willing to sacrifice their children.</p>
<p>the smallpox vaccine thus created the first anti vaccination leagues fighting for medical freedoms.</p>
<p>and this happened before people had internet and could share video too btw, so imagine how bad it was.</p>
<p>smallpox would have disappeared with or without a vaccine and the people back then realized it and fought against the mandates of the time. that is the reality of the matter, but that story won't get told.</p>
<p>you also won't hear what gets said in acip meetings about how harmful the smallpox vaccine in a mass vaccination campaign would be, because they don't want you to know the REAL history of vaccinations.</p>

<p>the science of measles is more interesting however.</p>
<p>so let's assume, that the measles vaccines prevent measles infections for a time period.</p>
<p>so what is then actually happening in society?</p>
<p>instead of children at the ideal age getting measles once in their life time and being protected for life and even giving immunity to their baby in the first year through the placenta and breastmilk, instead you get measles vaccines, that give you a short period of claimed immunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669617/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669617/</a></p>
<p>so now you got people getting multiple injections in a life time and no longer being immune over time and not providing immunity to babies through the placenta and breastmilk and shifting the age from children to adults in many cases where they get measles.</p>
<p>now that all sounds bad, BUT the really interesting part is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490323/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16490323/</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361090X06000043</a></p>
<p>&rt;Overall, risk reduction increased with the frequency of infections, with febrile infections affording the greatest protection.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122188/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122188/</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915015013805">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915015013805</a></p>
<p>&rt;Measles and mumps infections were associated with decreased risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16406019/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16406019/</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145212605004662">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145212605004662</a></p>
<p>&rt;Our findings provide additional support to the hypothesis that infections by most common childhood pathogens may protect against HL or, at least, be correlated with some other early exposure, which may lower the risk of HL in adulthood. In addition, our study shows that measles may provide a protective effect against NHL.</p>
<p>(it is just 3 studies, i added the sciencedirect links, because they are broken sometimes)</p>
<p>these 3 studies show, that having a childhood infection like measles results in less health issues from cancer and heart disease later in life.</p>
<p>with cancer and heart disease being the in the top killers of the people, the question needs to be asked:</p>
<p>is getting childhood infections like measles, with an extremely low mortality rate with treatment and in modern age far far below 1 in 10000, something good, that actually increases life expectancy?</p>
<p>but hey let's look more at the vaccines.</p>
<p>ups what do we have here: 38% of measles cases are from vaccine derived strains of measles:</p>
<p>(linke removed to avoid auto censor)</p>
<p>but i thought, that vaccines should prevent diseases and infections and not cause them.....</p>
<p>now at this point i would love to link you to some decent safety studies on any measles vaccines, but they don't exist. the industry refuses to do RCTs using fully unvaccinated as control groups.</p>
<p>i could say, that they won't do them, because they already know what the results would be, but hey that would be an assumptions.</p>
<p>so what can we do instead? look at vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system), which is a massively underreported dumpster fire:</p>
<p>(linke removed to avoid auto censor)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.</p>
<p>you can go to this website and get a decently easy to search way to access it:</p>
<p>(linke removed to avoid auto censor)</p>
<p>at vaccine types select "measles ... " and then event characteristics select for one search "died? YES" and for another search:</p>
<p>disabled? YES!</p>
<p>you'll find over 1900 cases of people being disabled after a measles vaccine and over 450 people, who died after a measles vaccine.</p>
<p>to take a closer look at some of the cases you can read this:</p>
<p><a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/3/383">https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/3/383</a></p>
<p>now you can rightfully say, that those are just reports and can't be compared to studies. to which i would say, that the likely for someone to by some random chance finds out, that vaers even exists and then reports a case of adverse reactions is very VERY low. less than 1% as stated by the report before.</p>
<p>so despite that all those reports are in vaers. what are the true numbers of disability and death from the measles vaccines? well the government doesn't want to collect that data, as they refuse to get vaers to work properly and they refuse to do the safety studies.</p>

<p>measles part 2:</p>
<p>measles vaccines also have an interesting case attached to it.</p>
<p>ask yourself what happens when a doctor and research says, that because of the current cases in a case series i would advise against taking the combined vaccines, until research is done to see whether there is an issue or isn't one.</p>
<p>well we don't have to wonder, because dr. andrew wakefield did say that and as a result the pharma industry  with the front attacker being brian deer.</p>
<p>short documentary about what happened:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> </p>
<p>so because one case series got published, that was free of any issues  the pharma industry and other interests did everything possible to destroy someone's life.</p>
<p>and remember, he didn't even say to not vaccinate. his original statements said, that the combined vaccine should be avoided until more research is done.</p>
<p>the goal by pharma to push combined vaccines as much as possible could not allow such statements to stand, so everything was done to throw dirt at the researcher, lie about the research and of course most importantly to prevent proper safety studies to EVER get done on the combined mmr vaccines.</p>
<p>this is how  strong the industry will attack anyone who even remotely questions one vaccine.</p>
<p>today you got criminal measles vaccine mandates, that are in fact measles, mumps and rubella vaccine mandates, because in most cases the single measles vaccine is no longer available. this of course is great profit for the industry.</p>
<p>i want you to understand the process here.</p>
<p>what should have happened is, that all mmr vaccinations would get stopped immediately and the best RCTs would get done with fully unvaccinated children to see whether or not the combined vaccine was safe.</p>
<p>instead of this a campaign was started against the doctor raising the concern and the clear goal to make an example out of him was also part of it.</p>
<p>today you might even hear some research say, "yes i know, that they cause harm, but i can't research vaccines, because i don't want to get 'wakefielded'. "</p>
<p>so overall NO, you can't claim, that the measles vaccines improved health overall for anyone.</p>
<p>there are NO proper safety studies done. there are tons of cases of death and disabilities and countless ones, that never get recorded to vaers.</p>
<p>measles itself is extremely harmless  and beneficial even and certainly nothing to fear and the vaccine causes measles outbreak as the study showed too and the vaccine shifts the ages around of when you get measles and it prevents the life long immunity to happen and the immunity, that would protect the baby in the most dangerous time, the first year of life.</p>
<p>so again NO, the measles vaccines do not improve overall health for us. there's no evidence for that and the evidence we do have shows the vaccines to kill, cause brain damage and to be MASSIVELY inferior to the natural beneficial infections, that give life long strong immunity.</p>

<p>polio.</p>
<p>i honestly wrote enough at this point, so let's keep this one short.</p>
<p>let's start with this short referenceless video, that brings it perfectly to the point:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZc2aRsAGK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZc2aRsAGK0</a> </p>
<p>wonderfully explained by liam  scheff.</p>
<p>remember, that i already wrote this:</p>
<p>"and to end this wonderful list of horrible references we got this study:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a></p>
<p>our wonderful friend bill gates went on a mass children paralyzing, i mean polio vaccination campaign in india.</p>
<p>what was the result?</p>
<p>&rt;A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP.</p>
<p>(NPAFP =non-polio acute flaccid paralysis)</p>
<p>&rt;The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate.</p>
<p>oh you know he paralyzed about half a million children in india with his oral polio madness.</p>
<p>also if the old definition of polio would get used, then it would actually read:</p>
<p>"gates polio vaccination efforts caused half a million cases of polio in india"</p>
<p>thank goodness, that they changed the definition of polio back in the day to fake effectiveness of the vaccines am i right?"</p>
<p>but to have a whole picture about polio i suggest this presentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns</a> </p>
<p>sorry for the bad quality some references might be hard to read.</p>
<p>so the true polio story is a story of lead arsenate and DDT neurotoxins to be put on and in everything. worthless vaccines and a nicely changed definition of polio to fake the vaccines into looking effective.</p>
<p>why did most of polio go away? because DDT and lead arsenate use went down.</p>
<p>children literally went running behind the fogging trucks!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2NmuQW8cjE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2NmuQW8cjE</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4m6cIEv1LU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4m6cIEv1LU</a> </p>
<p>that sprayed neurotoxins around.</p>
<p>and this is an example of the advertisements back then for DDT:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P12.6-DDTGoodForMe.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P12.6-DDTGoodForMe.png</a> </p>
<p>again i like to remind you, that DDT is a neurotoxin.</p>
<p>they sprayed neurotoxins everywhere to fight off polio.</p>
<p>they sprayed paralysis causing neurotoxins around to supposedly try to stop paralysis in children. yes that happened!</p>
<p>alright this is already getting quite long.</p>
<p>long story short: the polio vaccine causes paralysis, which i showed you the peer reviewed modern study for even.</p>
<p>the neurotoxins were responsible for the paralysis back then.</p>
<p>but none of this gets looked at by most people. they just go with the believe of the miracle cures from the past.</p>
<p>the myth of the heroes in white coats saving humanity and the children.</p>
<p>producing some amazing cure, that saved us.</p>
<p>that is not what is going on with measles, smallpox and polio.</p>
<p>and that also never went on with those diseases/infections.</p>
<p>i provided you tons and tons of references and it took quite a while to write all of this.</p>
<p>so i would hope, that you spend the time to actually go over the references, given the effort i put into these detailed responses.</p>

        <p>Ok the only thing is that vaccines are the only way to effectively immunize a person without actually succombing to the full blown disease and the effects that come with it</p>
<p>Jonas Salk gave his polio vaccine away for free and changed the world</p>
<p>He's a true hero</p>
<p>not these fucking sheep that say "lock me in the house i'm a true hero!"</p>
<p>while expecting essential workers to keep their lights on, run the gas stations and pick up their trash</p>
<p>with that said you have to explicitly trust that the "vaccine" actually is doing what it's supposed to and without any "extra"</p>

        <p>You should probably do some research into what the actual "vaccine" really is. It has nothing in common with the normal ones you described. It is a highly experimental, never approved before <strong>mRNA delivery system</strong> that has been rapidly approved within 6 months compared to the normal process that takes years by companies that have hundreds of billions of dollars at stake to be the first-to-market and are 100% immune from any liability of the serious effects such as auto-immune disorders that it will inevitably cause. The side effects that no one knows about, since there is NO DATA ON IT.</p>
<p>Go ahead and get the poke though, if it makes you feel safer. You'll need one every 3 - 6 months too though. And they say it will make you sick for days so you will have to miss work, hope you have sick pay saved up. If you still have a job, due to the lockdowns that destroyed many of those. Or a place of business to work at, those were killed too. I'll take my chance with the 99.9%+ survival rate from the virus that most people don't even know they get.</p>

        <p>No, they are not 100% immune from any liability. If they are found to have hid evidence that these things cause auto-immune disorders, which by the way people said regular vaccines caused but that has been debunked years ago? They will be held liable.</p>
