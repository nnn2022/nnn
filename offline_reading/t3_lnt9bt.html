    <strong>Hello!!! Have a story.</strong>
    <p><p>I was kind of an anti masker like you guys, and I just wanted to share a story. I work at a company where we go out in vans because we install stuff. With covid we have had no coworkers in the vans and have all been using personal cars or work vans to get around. Well, my co workers car broke down and he still wanted to work so my company OKd it for us to work in the van together but we had to wear masks the whole day even while being in the van. 8 hours of us being in the van together, working closely with eachother, but wearing masks the whole time. The only time we took them off was when we ate lunch but ate it out of the van far from one another. My co worker took masks very seriously so he wore one and so did I because he would probably have reported me if i took it off. I didnâ€™t wanna get in trouble. Well it turns out, he didnâ€™t tell anyone he was feeling very very tired days before we worked together and went and got a test just to make sure. He tested positive for covid 19, he got his results back a day after we had already worked together. I was then told by HR I have to quarantine. So I went and got a test 4 days after and came back negative. Had no symptoms. Nothing. The masks work. I donâ€™t care what anyone says. They work. And for people thinking I was asymptomatic and had a false negative but actually had it, I ended up catching covid from somewhere else a month later and symptoms hit me hard as hell. There was a time where I considered going to the hospital because of how sick I felt. Lost 14 pounds. Have had the flu, itâ€™s not the flu.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, just take life as it is. Donâ€™t stress yourself over things that donâ€™t really matter or effect you that badly, family and relationships that are meaningful is really all there is to a meaningful/happy life, and also donâ€™t get angry at random strangers on the internet that came here only to offer a story and what they believe because they thought it might prevent you guys from feeling how I did</p>

        <p>I know itâ€™s hard for a sociopath like you to understand and connect with people but maybe just try it. Also, not even close to a trick driver. My job requires a bachelors degree in computer science, you have no idea what we install and what we do so maybe donâ€™t say things like that without knowing what youâ€™re taking about.</p>

        <p>Oh. Something to do with surveillance then? Locks, cameras, that stuff?</p>
<p>I'm just confused why you would come on and start praising the masks and hyping up how scary covid is. How about you provide some more detail? The coworker got tested positive, right? Did they become sick? I'm feeling very very tired often, and it's just depression, not covid. Now, if I were to go and get tested, would it be a surprise if it came back positive? It's been said many times on this very sub that tests are a hoax and are used to inflate the numbers. Carrots test positive, etc. But you choose to take it as a sign that the mask protects you. Okay. And then what about your own sickness, how was it? It was covid, right? Did you also test positive when you got sick? How did it all go?</p>

<p>Not hyping up covid, just saying I got really sick from it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coworker lost his taste and smell but didnâ€™t have many bad symptoms(covid effects people differently)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been tested 4 times prior to testing positive because I wanted to be careful before spending time with my family for the holidays. Tests arenâ€™t always accurate, that is true, not denying that. Rapid tests are really ineffective and PCR tests arenâ€™t 100%, but they are closer to it than rapid tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost my taste and smell and still donâ€™t have it back, I felt really really sick, high fever, awful dry cough, could barely get out of bed and one night I felt like if I went to sleep I wouldnâ€™t wake up so I stayed up til 4 am</p>

        <p>yes actually, the virus basically kills off your tastebuds and smell receptors, therefore cutting of your brain from getting any signals about what the stuff tastes like or smells like, therefore removing said senses in a way  </p>
<p>Also hello, I'm a bit confused of this place since there's been links to "proof masks don't work" linked to conspiracy theory sites filled with complete bullshit, so is NoNewNormal a seriously anti-vaxxing-against-covid or a joke reddit? or filled with people from both of those options?</p>

        <p>Oh, then it's one of those long-lasting threats of covid? I did the research, it says up to 80% covid-infected will get smell loss... but if you do you should be happy, because if you don't you go into the ventilator basically. Pretty lucky to have such a surefire sign if you ask me.</p>
<p>But the unfortunate thing is for many people their smell is gone forever. Or not gone but everything smells like literal rotten meat now. So, best not catch covid, I guess... follow every precaution. Get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>that depends again thou how serious it actually is, and if I can even get it, and hopefully I can take the Vaccine in say a year or two, when we know long term effects</p>

        <p>Yeah. Until then, stay home, wear mask, stay safe. We'll get through it.</p>
<p>The article I read said literally this: either it is serious, as in you go into a ventilator, <em>or</em> you lose smell. That's how people've been recognizing they've got covid, short of being under a ventilator.</p>

        <p>But I caught it a month later and was completely knocked out from it. Iâ€™m not miserable, having a loving girlfriend, financially stable, and a lot of amazing friends. Why would you say that? Just wanted to share my story because I donâ€™t want anyone to have to go through the symptoms I had and was just referencing how masks work.</p>

<p>The science has been out for a long time that face coverings that arenâ€™t the sufficient rating (N-95 or higher) donâ€™t prevent the spread of airborne respiratory viruses. Iâ€™m unconvinced that a surgical mask would do anything in an enclosed area but thanks for sharing your experience</p>
