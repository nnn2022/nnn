        <p>I think staring at this character for most of our lives has had some influence on the current mask situation. Just subconsciously taking in the colors, we see the mouth/mask area specifically highlighted. If you inverted everything, like satanists enjoy doing, you would end up with all white person with a black face covering. We of course see this every time we step outside. And for soooome reason everyone thinks they are a damned super hero for looking like this. Just a coincidence?   </p>
<p>Looking at the original colors, the symbolic man behind the color "mask" is pure black. He is of the dark side and has devil horns on his head. He is covered in armor and dons a cape, signifying his impenetrability and hero status. <strong>THIS is who we see people becoming!!</strong> Or who they want to become.  </p>
<p>They think they are strong, scary, and righteous as they "beat" the shit out of "criminals." They mistakenly think the darkness and devilry is just a costume they can remove at will. They think they are good people of course underneath it all. But as we all know they are just assholes lol.   </p>
<p>So yeah lol. Maybe lets try to forgive and forget, lest we turn into these monsters ourselves.</p>
