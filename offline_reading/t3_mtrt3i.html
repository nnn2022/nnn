    <strong>Did we flatten the curve yet?</strong>
    <p><p>So I remember back when this whole thing started, the narrative was "we're not going to eradicate this thing, we just need to not have everyone get sick at once and overwhelm the hospitals and ventilators."</p>
<p>Now, a year later, and we know that you can flip people on their stomach instead of ventilate them. The hospitals are nowhere near capacity. We did it, we flattened the curve!</p>
<p>But somehow the narrative has shifted. If you actually talk to a Doomer, they really believe that the goal is the eradication of sars-cov-2. But this is impossible, it is out of our grasp to eradicate a coronavirus. It is endemic.</p>
<p>Does anyone remember when the goalpost was moved from "we don't want to overwhelm the hospitals" to "we're trying to eradicate this virus"?</p></p>

        <p>That's the scary part, nobody can really remember when the narrative suddenly changed, it's just sorta...did. It's complete psychological warfare to the point where you just don't remember anything anymore, you've been memory holed by the media parasite. </p>
<p>Although I can almost recall the narrative really started to be twisted around the middle of last summer/early fall. Everyone had their hopes up for the vaccine so the media jumped on the every illusory eradication bandwagon</p>

        <p>I think the reopening of schools and the teacher’s unions freaking out was one of the first times I felt like the bar was suddenly much much higher and it being vocalized. I then could express my frustration over not prioritizing the well-being of the kids, essential workers who can’t be home with their kids, etc. without the heavy backlash for questioning that came early so it feels early in the goal post shift. Probably even earlier honestly. 
This is a great question to ask doomers. I don’t debate them and asking this makes them have to zoom out from the narrative a little</p>

        <p>After the curve was flattened in Ireland, we were presented with a new goal to 'reduce the r-number'. While we were distracted with this, the Zero Covid people arrived on the scene.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/zerocovid-movement-cult-dressed-as-science/">They're a sinister bunch of shills</a>, and they have franchises in many countries.</p>
<p>In Ireland, most politicians loved them, until <a href="https://gript.ie/revealed-how-zero-covid-activists-deceived-politicians/">these emails</a> were leaked. They were so arrogant they couldn't resist boasting to each other about their lies and deceit. When you read the emails, it's hard to believe these guys are academics in their 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>They were using ideas from  Saul Alinsky's 'Rules for Radicals'  in an attempt to subvert the Irish political process. Now that they've been caught they have shut up and thier friends in the media don't mention them any more.</p>
<p>Watch out for these kind guys in your own country, they're bad news.</p>

        <p>No it is to "stop the spread" aka live as masked up isolated drones and die an early death without healthcare because healthcare has turned into a cult and most people will be psychotic by the time this is all over and won't want to go to a hospital even if their leg gets chopped off by a chainsaw.</p>
