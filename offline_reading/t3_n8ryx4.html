        <p>mask are part of their culture. even before covid mask were not uncommon. If you felt ill you were a mask or you were one if you were being overly cautious. also Singaporeans are rather nonconventional so they move away rather than deal with him.</p>

        <p>Because you believe the science that says masks work, it kinda goes like this. No mask for you and no mask for me has highest chances of passing a airborne virus. Especially in a closed space like this  A mask for me and no mask for you is better but a mask for me and a mask for you is best. No one is under the illusion that masks stop the virus 100% of the time. Science has proven that. But if i wear a mask and you wear a mask, it gets me that much closer to not getting the virus. </p>
<p>Just being humble about what I know and what i don't. And listening to the people who know more on this subject than me.</p>

        <p>Very true. But i can put on 15 masks, and still have a chance of the other guy getting the virus onto my skin or an object i have to touch. Science will still say me with 15 masks and you not wearing a mask is worse than me wearing 15 masks and you wearing a mask too. </p>
<p>And while no one is stopping me from wearing a dozen masks and gloves and a full blown hazmat suit, no one is stopping me from walking away from the dude with no mask. But if your actions make other people actively avoid you, you are a bad member of our society. But you can be an angsty teen and say i don't want to be a member of your society. Then live in the woods and don't use public transportation where society is.</p>

        <p>By that logic wouldn't power hungry elites want health experts to downplay the virus? Keep us all working and buying. Covid and lockdowns did a number on almost all corporations not named Amazon. Especially since most of the true elite have their hands in oil and gas that was hit very very hard in 2020.</p>

<p>By that logic, wouldn’t global elites take pleasure in watching countless small businesses shut down, in watching big business grow larger and larger, stealing market share, cashless surveillance money system in the works i.e. “the great reset”, obedience to authorities (global elites) is deemed “life saving”, scrapping people’s constitutions for their fake planned emergencies, restricting gatherings to stand up against them, citizens social conditioned for further totalitarian restrictions, gullible populous trusting governments i.e “you get your rights back after our next goal post” (goal post keeps moving), governments appearing as the heros, talking negatively about governments and global elite agendas deserves censorship i.e. “misinformation”, keeping the scam running, introducing universal income i.e. “government handouts”?  F**k, I could go on extensively, not to mention the depopulation perks.  Coincidentally, exceptional benefits and power moves for our good old trustworthy global elite UN overlords.</p>

        <p>Yeah..... That's all nonsense. Every bit of it. </p>
<p>First the big business idea. Small businesses stopped last year but they have that flexibility to reopen next year. WalMart is big business and they aren't patting themselves on the back after last year when lockdowns pushed more and more people to online shopping. They want to keep people in stores. </p>
<p>Next you again have oil and gas. Super big business with tons of politicians in their pockets. They didn't want people being locked down and more and more people moving to work from home.</p>
<p>And as to the government, no one can say this past year hasnt been filled with people pushing back against their government constantly lockdowns or not. </p>

        <p>It appears you misunderstand what I mean by “global elite”.  Global elites have more money than they know what to do with.  Profit is but an negligible aim, political power is their priority.  They hold the highest authoritative positions in the UN and majority of governments around the globe.  If a government is obtaining power over it’s people, then that government is probably controlled by the global elites.</p>
<p>I expect this to compensate for your misinterpretations.  The global elites are scheming to gobble up our rights, and the covid scare is but a conduit for their greater merciless agenda.  Obedience will only make their dystopian totalitarian oligarchical vision of the future, that much closer to reality.  Thanks for your cooperation.</p>

        <p>"global elites" don't and can't exist in a free market and capitalism. Perhaps in a place like Russia they have elites that control the country but that doesn't work on a global level. Because if they try and control anything, there are others trying to fix a need to profit on unmet needs. For example a Rockefeller comes along to control global price of oil and gas. You have an Elon Musk or similar finding a product that either replaces oil and gas or doesn't require it. And then there is other competitors to also provide the same need as Elon Musk to drive his price down. This example works across all industries. </p>
<p>Political power isn't attainable in a democratic society. Say these elites want to control an election in the US. They would leave a trace. They would pass the secret to the wrong person who sees a book deal and invites to news shows if they just spill the beans.  At any given time there are thousands of people close to elections across the world that seek personal gain. They can get the information out instantly via social media. If this was 59 years ago you could say something like newspapers and news organizations are also controlled by the global elites and would stop that information before it aired. Twitter can perhaps silence after the fact but not before it reaches millions. The individual has soo many outlets to get that information out into the world these days. </p>
<p>So it's impossible. If there was someone pulling the strings, with enough time, we would know who and how they try to do that. And the whistleblower would be famous. And others would come out of the woods as well.</p>

        <p>Global elites barely care about competition, profits, controlling prices.  The assets and money they own already, is in the hundreds of billions, likely trillions.  Money can only get you so far.  They care much more about granting the government extreme totalitarian brutal control over society, while they remain in the highest administrative positions of power in the government.  Meaning they wish to be the overlords of over 90% of all humans on earth, who are all their total slaves.</p>
<p>The global elites censor "conspiracy" content because they own YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Google, vast majority of mainstream media, big pharma, CDC, WHO, etc.  Since the global pandemic struck, these global elites have been censoring any information exposing their covid-scam agenda.  They label it "dangerous misinformation", when really it's information to be safe from global elites.  </p>
<p>If you read or watched George Orwell's 1984, it gives you an idea of the kind of global society the scheme to create.  </p>
<p>There are whistle blowers who expose global elites and their agenda for world domination.  They are difficult to find due to the censorship.</p>
<p>How is this utter nonsense, super improbable, and unrealistic?  What evidence demonstrates how this is extremely unlikely happening?</p>

        <p>Coming back late but just remembered something that puts a wrench is the whole globalist thing. If some group did in fact control everything, they wouldn't want people to wear masks at all. Wearing masks has now been normalized and people going forward, like they do in Asia, will often wear masks outdoors just because. Or when they are sick. If the government and the powers that be were to try and control us, the next step is facial recognition wherever we go. They want to know who we are and where we go. Everyone knows this is a real thing coming down the pipeline. An ability to catch crimes is what they will say. But they will have more datapoints. They want facial recognition. Masks make facial recognition much more difficult. In fact they would probably try and convince people to stop wearing masks.</p>

<p>I think people on this sub are misguided and cynical. The want no new normal. Spoiler alert but no one wants a new normal. Everyone wants to go back to the pre pandemic normal. You know how we actually get there? Masks and vaccines which people on this sub rally against. Herd immunity is now a pipe dream because there are so many people who won't get it and we probably won't get to 70% of the population with the vaccine. And wearing masks until you get the vaccine so you stop the spread.  Anytime an idiot gets covid and passes it on, it pushed normal back. </p>
<p>The real people pushing back against a new normal are wearing masks and getting vaccines. Because that's the only actual way to get back to normal. Everything else is lip service</p>

        <p>The thought behind this is that spit particles that would normally be spread through breathing or talking are now caught on the inside of the infected person's mask. Even prior to doing research on the matter, this was a fairly simple concept to understand for me so I'm curious as to why you believe otherwise. Why would a mask that's thick enough to catch these particles be non-effective without a respirator? How did you come to believe this?</p>

<p>You sound like a dumbass. You are the embodiment of social media and the mainstream media. You’re a walking generic houseplant. A mask will not stop aerosolised particles from entering your mouth. If you want proof, just try breathing with a mask on. If you can, then congratulations you won’t stop yourself from getting infected if you are in a contaminated area.</p>
<p>Masks are effective at reducing transmission probability if you are infected and showing symptoms. This man on the train looks more healthy than anyone else, and definitely is not showing symptoms. I wish I could fucking thank this guy. It must be tough when people treat you as diseased while being healthy and uninfected</p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty? Seems like we are all infected until proven healthy.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly astonished at how close you are to the right answer, how much of the correct context you've given me, and yet somehow you still don't understand, perhaps intentionally.</p>
<p>As I've stated before, masks are not meant to protect yourself. They are meant to protect other people. Your argument that wearing one won't stop the wearer from getting infected is invalid at best and misleading at worst since that's not even in the ballpark of what's being discussed. Crazy how you made my point for me and acted as though it worked for your argument.</p>
<p>Those aerosolized particles you spoke of are spread through breathing and speech as well, you don't have to be symptomatic to spread the virus. This guy very well may be completely healthy, but he's choosing to chance other people's lives and well-being for his own sentiment. You don't get to cut other drivers off on the road simply because you're confident in your abilities to avoid an accident.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to say for your last statement. The state of U.S Law doesn't even begin to correlate with this virus. Innocent until proven guilty doesn't work here and I don't know why you thought that it would.</p>

        <p>But why though, if as I said, the mask is meant to catch these particles? Airborne doesn't mean that it's transmitted through gas, a large number of these particles will be trapped before they have the chance to make contact with surfaces or other people. This is why a mask may feel damp after a while of using it.</p>

        <p>Homie you’re not understanding what I mean by airborne. Covid spread on BOTH large infectious droplets AND aerosols. You cannot stop aerosols without a respirator attachment and a properly fitted mask with strict protocols on wear/touch. You would also need excellent ventilation systems in place. So while I agree a mask of any kind may catch some large droplets, its not stopping the aerosol spread.</p>

        <p>The mask doesn't stop aerosol spread but it does heavily prevent it from traveling as far as it would unrestricted. If you were to take an aerosol can and spray it in the air with and without a mask in front of it, the result is drastically different.  I agree that half-assing the mask isn't going to be as effective as it should be but that's why we have multiple systems in place(six feet social distance, working from home, no gatherings bigger than a large amount) so that the mask doesn't have to do all the work.</p>

        <p>First, covid is smaller than dust. Dust is smaller than the aerosol can products you’re talking about. Masks without respirators will do NOTHING to stop aerosol spread. 6 ft distancing will also not stop it, as aerosols stay suspended in the air for 3+ hours...</p>

<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579175/.</p>
<p>The staying power of the aerosols is a valid point, but I don't think that detracts from the value of the mask at all.</p>

        <p>... did you read your own articles man? The number you gave for the covid particle size is for infectious droplets. Which is not what were talking about. Your article does, however, state that aerosol size is 0.09nm.  Do you have any idea how small that is?</p>
<p>Id like to refer you to these standard precautions for airborne diseases, I think they could help you understand. </p>

        <p>I definitely did but I'm not sure if you have. The smallest particle possible for the virus is not .09 nm, it's .09 um which is drastically different from nanometers. This isn't even a practical unit of measurement as it's an entirely theoretical size based on if the particle is 100% comlposed of the virus. That means it's unattached to any form of liquid that should be housing the virus, hence the infected particle example that I gave you.</p>
<p>4.7 um is used to describe the average respiratory particle (which is the term the article uses in place of aerosol at points). The size of the larger infected droplet that your talking about is described to be over 100 um, after which it entirely talks about respiratory particles in varying degrees of viral occupancy. An estimate is given for a 100% virus to liquid ratio (.09 um) as well as a much lower ratio with more saliva housing the virus (maximum of about 42 um).</p>
<p>As for your article links, I'm struggling to understand what portion of your argument that they might help me understand. In each case, giving the infected patient a mask(or potentially infectes passerby in terms of this pandemic) is encouraged. The airborne virus protocols admit that the mask is less effective, but they still encourage the use of it. I've seen the argument that these masks encourage people to believe that they are safe in close quarters which I find as a strong counterpoint. Is this the point you're trying to get across?</p>

        <p>Yeah I saw um a bunch but I also saw nm being used to describe the aerosols.</p>
<p>Anyways, you know exactly what im trying to prove because I have said it 3 billion times now, man. Masks won’t stop aerosols from spreading. Even in the protocols I linked you, they didnt just give that patient a mask and call it a day. They gave that patient a mask (its important to remember they are only doing this when they dont have proper protection present) and throwing them into a special room with enhance ventilation and double sets of access doors.</p>

        <p>The only place I've seen nanometers as a measurement was in the first article talking about product aerosols rather than viral particles. I'm not going to try and play you and say that these products are "insert number here" nanometers large though, that was just the scale that the electrical diffuser could measure, and the point of linking it was to show how these two types of particles could be comparable in size and tests.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be malicious about it, I just assumed that that wasn't the specific point that you were trying to make because I didn't see it as an effective argument. Yes, the protocols linked offered a few procedures in addition to the mask wearing, but that doesn't take away from the fact that masks were still employed as a semi effective deterrent. In the same way that using a turn signal or seatbelt by themselves are not as effective as using both together to secure oneself in a car, using a mask by itself isn't going to be as effective as isolating oneself away from others in addition to wearing a mask. But in both examples, at least having one form of protection in lieu of using both if the option isn't available, is more beneficial to safety of everyone. </p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that these protocols specifically list a symptomatic patient as the subject they are preparing for. A coughing and sneezing patient is going to release these aerosols at a much higher speed and magnitude than someone who is simply breathing them out.</p>

        <p>Alright, I understand now that you’re not trying to be malicious. Its hard to judge someones temperament through Reddit.  </p>
<p>This entire time I have actually agreed with you that a mask will block the transmission of infectious droplets. What I have disagreed on, however, is the blocking of aerosols. Only a respirator can filter aerosols. No ifs, ands, or buts. The mask also has to be fitted, strict no touch/wear protocols, you must be in that special ventilation room, and be behind 2 sets of doors. </p>
<p>Basically, the stars almost have to align for you to have proper protection from aerosols. Im done arguing about droplets; droplets are besides the point because aerosols are the actual concern. Lets look at it this way, you’re trying to use the effectiveness of the other prevention methods as crutches for masks. In order for the mask to prove its effectiveness against aerosols it would have to be able to stand on its own 2 feet, which it can’t without a respirator. Even THEN... you STILL need those several other methods in tandem in order to provide proper protection. </p>
<p>Im actually pleased you pointed out that a patient must be symptomatic for any of this to matter. Because asymptomatic is extraordinarily rare and in some studies completely nonexistent.</p>

        <p>That's understandable, people love to cause trouble on both sides, and I think having a little caution is good, especially when trying to reach a consensus.</p>
<p>Speaking directly about the aerosols, like I said prior, I don't believe in the mask providing an ultimate protection against it. I just believe that having one would be more beneficial to curbing the spread than not having one would be. I view the mask as the benefit outweighing any risk it might pose. With viral aerosols being comparable in size to product aerosols, and product aerosols exhibiting reduced spread with masks, I don't see why a mask wouldn't be considered at least semi effective in this case. Here's a video I found comparing the transmission between a masked and unmasked individual:</p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_bM1y1IpJY&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>My question to you would be, given the fact that these two aerosol types are similar in size, why do you still believe that a mask would be totally ineffective? Do you just not believe the study I posted or is it something else?</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people being extremely rare is also a point I hadn't really considered. Which studies have you seen that pointed out the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic?</p>

        <p>I would agree that having a fitted mask with a respirator would be better than nothing. I will not agree though that a cloth mask does anything with aerosols. Just looking at your video, those aerosols coming out the top, bottom, and side will stay suspended in the air. They don’t have to project 6 feet to be dangerous to other who may walk through the plume. So here is my thinking, to curb the spread of an airborne disease on a societal level, we need to have sick people who are symptomatic staying home or if they have to work, put them in that mask with a respirator. Theres no reason everyone needs to wear a cloth mask</p>

        <p>As well anyone intelligent should.  Here, from the study.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>We were unable to measure face cover use in the community (that is, compliance with the mandate).</p>
<p>Just shows benefit in states with the mandate, not that masks actually did any good.  It's like Fauci saying the reason Texas cases have fallen was because people are still wearing masks despite not being required to.  Even though we see stadiums full of unmasled people.</p>
<p>We know Covid is airborne like measles or TB, and you have to wear an N95 to protect yourself AND the infected person wearing one doesn't help because the seal is only present when NOT exhaling.  That is evident to anyone who has worn one.</p>
<p>No matter how you slice it, the doomer "science" is more like voodoo.  Next thing you'll present is that chicken blood prevents spread.</p>

<p>"<em>On the topic of masks, AORN recommends that “surgical masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as goggles, glasses with solid side shields, or chin-length face shields, must be worn whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated” [1]. Here, the debate is less vivacious, but</em> <strong><em>it serves as an example of a habit that is not borne out in the evidence</em></strong><em>. The AORN guidelines astutely recognize this and note that the surgical mask really serves 2 roles: supposedly protecting the patient and assuredly protecting the providers [1].</em> <strong><em>We wear surgical masks in the operating room and have been doing so for nearly 100 years [13]. Perhaps this is simply because it’s the way “we’ve always done it” [35]. In 2002, a Cochrane review did not show a significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection between masked and unmasked providers [16, 36]. In fact, the nonsignificant difference favored not wearing a mask.</em></strong> <em>Deep down, surgical masks protect the wearer, and perhaps for that reason, no one is rushing to remove them. However, masks have never been shown to be helpful in reducing SSIs [35, 37, 38].</em></p>
<p><em>In sum, the data are conflicting or at least suggest practices that may be of marginal benefit but fly in the face of societal norms (again, think of naked surgeons without face masks). Moreover, there are other considerations when mandating a policy in the hospital aside from direct effects on infection control: how patients perceive their caretakers, how caretakers interact with one another, and how efficiently patients move through the system [7, 39]. Male caretakers still wear ties, female practitioners wear jewelry, and both wear white coats, although from a strict infection control standpoint, some have advocated that we should abolish these habits [6, 40, 41]. Yes, there are other factors at stake:</em> <strong><em>Patients prefer their physicians to look the part!</em></strong>"</p>
<p>The abstract of another paper titled, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076815583167">Unmasking the surgeons: the evidence base behind the use of facemasks in surgery,</a> published by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2015 says:</p>
<p>"<em>Examination of the literature revealed much of the published work on the matter to be quite dated and often studies had poorly elucidated methodologies. As a result, we recommend caution in extrapolating their findings to contemporary surgical practice.</em> <strong><em>However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination.</em></strong> <em>More rigorous contemporary research is needed to make a definitive comment on the effectiveness of surgical facemasks.</em>"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Surgeons wear masks not because the scientific consensus supports them, but because it makes people feel safer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you realize you're completely wrong.</p>

        <p>Singapore isn’t a place for these stunts. The population are too meek, they listen to everything their govt feeds them. Still have family living there and they were locked down and faced hefty fines for not wearing masks out in public and restrictions on number of people allowed in their homes. Meanwhile I’m in the US, live out in the country in Texas with all my freedoms in tact. Crazy times!</p>

        <p>same boat as you, even in texas too. I always told people who were visiting Singapore "their country, their rules." Hell just owning a yard isnt something a normal Singaporean can dream of, but here in texas I have a yard with grass, and a car older than 10 years old.(cars over q0 years in Singapore are subject to heavy taxes so it is highly encouraged that you replace it every 10 years)</p>

        <p>They also cost a shit ton. I don't remember what some guys from Singapore that I met told me so I'm not putting out numbers but they were speechless when I told them that I had paid measly 1k for an ~18yo Holden Commodore. Meanwhile they were renting a car which cost them about as much a month.</p>

        <p>Might not want to do that in singapore. Lived their for a few years and if they have a mask mandate in place and you violate it they will arrest you.

        <p>it was prob the most safe i've ever felt in a country walking around at night, but at the same time you can't do anything without being on a cctv. A soldier accidently dropped a spent rifle round in yishun (they think it was stuck on his pants legs or bag) and they literally shut down that area, had police on site, and tracked the guy down to his appt by following him on cctv.  </p>
<p>Another time a guy was vapping out in public and the police told him to turn it over to be destroyed (it was illegal at the time) he refused so they literally deported him back to india.   </p>
<p>It is a lot of give and take living in that place, but they make it work. But their country their rules.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's because the country is really small, the police is also quite well trained and deployed at a lot of Key Installations like the train stations, and there are CCTVs virtually everywhere. Anyone who wants to try anything funny will think twice.</p>

        <p>I qns the part about the police being well trained. Older singaporeans may remember but there was once somebody excavated a ww2 bomb back in early 00s, called the police.  Police told him not their business,  go find a private bomb disposal company. Like wtf</p>
<p>The police are just lazy</p>

        <p>punishments were to extreme that people didn't try to break the law. graffiti will get you canned, commenting any crime with a firearm is the death penalty, drug dealing is the death penalty, kidnapping is the death penalty.  </p>
<p>while I was there for 3 years, i can only recall 2 murders and both were sentenced to death. one was a maid who murdered her boss and the other was a stabbing.   </p>
<p>as long as you followed the many rules you were good to go, but breaking any rules was followed by extreme punishment.  </p>
<p>again, their country, their rules. I dont expect other countries to have the same values as America and I can understand why Singapore has to deal with things like this.</p>

        <p>Okay, so some context. In Singapore, only the Armed Forces are allowed to have firearms and rounds. And when it comes to ammunition, even spent cartridges (RAI), the Army takes accounting for them extremely seriously. Any ammo that is unaccounted for is immediately a serious situation, hence it was handled the way it was.</p>
<p>Vaping is illegal here in Singapore, mainly because the government can't effectively tax vape cartridges the way they can cigarettes. (But they'll say it's because vape contains toxic and harmful chemicals, don't let them fool you.) So, the law is the law...</p>

        <p>Mask logic in Singapore: You must wear a mask at all times when going outside. But if you're taking a drink of water or exercising, you may go without the mask. If you are eating at a restaurant, you must wait for your food to come before you can remove your mask. Even if you've got your two shots, the mask stays.</p>

        <p>That article you posted to me in the other comment was crazy, I can’t believe the insanity and assumption that he was making people unsafe, that is not scientific at all, it’s downright terrifying. Wearing a mask is quite comfortable said a passenger, actually it’s the most uncomfortable thing I wear.</p>

        <p>This guy is so calm, caring &amp; level headed. I don't understand why millions upon millions of people are listening to the News &amp; Big Harma over their own intuition. On an energetic level, can't  people feel that others like this guy are trustworthy &amp; have something to teach them? You would think this sort of interaction would spark curiosity but so many people are still so hi-jacked by fear.</p>
