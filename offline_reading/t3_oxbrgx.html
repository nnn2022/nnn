        <p>I usually don't want to point fingers and divide by us and them, but I often times question myself how can someone be so radical about (mis)information spread by governments and mainstream media?</p>
<p>How can someone take such (critical) information without any solid research to base their facts on something? Heck, if someone says even the most banal thing that I haven't heard of I would hesitate from giving an opinion on it since I barely know anything about. Then, if it peaks my interest I will do the work and gather as much information as possible in order to not sound like an idiot next time. </p>
<p>I'm under the impression that they're living in some virtual, fictional bubble of "facts" that they want to believe in. And I know they most likely say the same about us, but from an objective point of view we know who's more likely to get real information. And this is not speaking from a biased perspective, but I strongly believe that majority on this sub do base their opinions on facts because we're so open about it. </p>
<p>Just look at the amount of flairs we have. We're open to anyone sharing their general objective view, while the most (bot) populated sub-reddits that are pro vaccine have only biased flairs. In some you can't even share your bad experience. </p>
<p>It's kinda dystopian, but at the same time encouraging because I think that the saying: 
&rt;Hard times create strong men, Strong men create good times,
Good times create weak men,
Weak men create hard times.</p>
<p>Got its full cycle and now it's time to repeat itself. We are destined to be "the strong men" from the saying. No disrespect to the women here, it's just how the saying goes to get the point. </p>
<p>United we stand, divided we fall. Don't let it be too late. Truth will always find its place. Stay strong and keep fighting against what they came for! It's yours and deserved. </p>
<p>FREEDOM!</p>
