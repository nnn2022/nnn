        <p>We do our own research, even a broken clock is right twice a day, there are many studies from different countries and organisations with the some conclusions.</p>
<p>One of the things that can prompt us to do our own research, is when there is so obviously a one sided and imbalanced perspective being rammed down our throat 24/7</p>

        <p>My friend. It does not seem either of us will cross to the other side. You asked for studies, I've provided what I could find in ten minutes.</p>
<p>That to you the <em>agenda</em> is about making it disappear, as opposed to continue justifying lockdowns, mask wearing, loss of freedoms and liberties etc...</p>
<p>There is clearly an agenda being played out (at least on that we agree). But you and I fundamentally disagree on what the agenda is that we should be concened about.</p>
<p>I will avoid getting dragged into the use of labels/defending/clarifying people's positions in the face of such misrepresentation.</p>
<p>There's no point discussing further as both of our positions are immoveable. I wish you all the best.</p>

        <p>This is not a place of science...</p>
<p>These people think if it‚Äôs less than Ebola, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù pandemic. They think the mortality rate is way lower than reality bc they discount any comorbidities deaths, while ignoring that‚Äôs how we‚Äôve always counted deaths for everything. They also don‚Äôt get that many of the comorbidities are super common things like being overweight or 60. They think that the dead are people who were decrepit and dying anyways, when in reality it‚Äôs your otherwise healthy 60 yo neighbor, your average looking but overweight friend, or your cousin with diabetes. Also, being overweight is so common that half the people here are likely at higher risk of complications, but they don‚Äôt recognize that bc being overweight is so common it‚Äôs normal, and the outliers are soooo big, they have a false sense of security. </p>
<p>Look elsewhere for meaningful dialogue. There‚Äôs a lot to be discussed about what measures are effective and what‚Äôs ‚Äúworth it‚Äù, but here you‚Äôll find nothing but angry children, made they‚Äôre being asked to wear a scratchy mask, and conflating a minor in ovine eyes with authoritarianism, racism, and genocide.</p>

        <p>Science made the thing you‚Äôre writing on, raised billions out of abject poverty, granted literacy to the masses, and is why you don‚Äôt spend hours everyday fetching firewood and water so you can boil the typhus away. It is singlehandedly how we can provide for 8 billion people and why you have any quality of life. Things you never even stop to think about, like lightbulbs, aluminum cans, and machines alloys took centuries of technological advancement over generations. Science did that. Not religion, not capitalism, not ideology or economic changes. Science. </p>
<p>You can mock it all you want, but the rest of us are going to continue to pursue this thing that brought us out of the dark and into civilization.</p>

        <p>... definition of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù: conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected. </p>
<p>So, common is kinda synonymous with normal. </p>
<p>The point is that this sub misrepresents comorbidities in the context of covid. This sub acts like the comorbidities contributing towards the high death count are exclusively things like late stage cancer, significant heart issues, extreme age or weight...</p>
<p>In reality, it includes age ranges where we would expect people to normally have several decades of life left, and good quality of life at that. It includes being overweight, at levels where many people don‚Äôt even recognize that they‚Äôre overweight. (Being overweight and obese is so common that many of people, including here, likely think they are a healthy weight and in fact, are simply fat. And live in a society where they are unaware how fat they are. A third of the USA is obese and another third is overweight...) It also includes asthma, pregnancy, heart disease, kidney disease, and a suite of less common ailments. </p>
<p>In other words, these things describe your average American, as literally the average American is fat, 30.3 million Americans have heart disease, 37 million Americans have kidney disease, 34.2 Americans have diabetes (88 million have prediabetes), etc. </p>
<p>This sub misrepresents how the word comorbidities is used.</p>

        <p>Relative to health, "common" is not only NOT a useful synonym for "normal" but it's counterproductive.</p>
<p>'Proper' is a much for useful synonym for "normal" relative to health.  Much if the rest of your comment illustrates this.</p>
<p>We can say 'obesity is common, despite it not being proper health.'  Nobody in their right mind would say "Obesity is fine because it's normal." (using a "common" interpretation of the word normal) even though if we consider the 'proper' interpretation of the word "normal", we <em>could</em> say 'that's fine because it's normal, even though it's not common' about other things.</p>
<p>As far as observed comorbidities go, the application of this information to date is pseudo science because there are also other observations that have been made of those population cross sections, and ignorance of other science is anti scientific.  When anti scientific information is proposed as science, it's then pseudo science.</p>
<p>While some, many, most, perhaps even all observed comorbidities have some explanatory basis for evolution of disease processes in a body, the other observations tend to have more <strong>fundamental</strong> and more meaningful explanatory basis as both causative factors for the comorbidities AND how and why the comorbidities contribute to disease processes in the body and therefore demand first priority in problem solving.</p>
<p>Yes, obesity is epidemic in many regions of the world.  I don't really read this sub enough to otherwise evaluate your statements relative to positions taken on this sub.</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree that what is ‚Äúcommon‚Äù health wise is most often not what is ‚Äúproper‚Äù health wise. My point is only that this sub tends to disregard most covid deaths because most covid deaths list comorbidities, when in reality the majority of people today have at least one comorbidity. </p>
<p>This sub tends to treat it as if those that died from covid were basically fucked to begin with, or that it‚Äôs their fault that the dead did not live the healthiest lifestyles. But my point is that the comorbidities list basically describes your average person.</p>

        <p>&rt;Can you clarify?</p>
<p>That's an excellent question.  Yes, I can.</p>
<p>Science is well aware that the human body requires quite a lot of different raw materials aka nutrients to function properly.  These include elements such as magnesium, copper, selenium, molybdenum, manganese, chromium, etc.  They include more complex molecules such as vitamins like; A, B complex, the K vitamins (K1, K2 Mk4, K2 Mk7), etc.  They include amino acids.</p>
<p>Study after study, survey after survey, report after report, paper after paper has shown again and again that for every different nutrient we require to carry out normal metabolic processes, significant portions of the population in every nation around the world don't intake even the bare minimums of one or more nutrients (often multiple) required for normal metabolic function, much less good healthy amounts required to approach optimal health.</p>
<p>These statistics are dramatically worse for certain cross-sections of the population, especially those that have been observed in the past to tend to have poorer outcomes when they've reported to a hospital for COVID-19 treatment, such as the elderly, the obese, and T2DM patients.</p>
<p>For other cross sections, such as those with a history of cancer and these obese, science has observed PPAR dysfunction in them which can promote or lead to excess cytokine production, either chronically and/or under certain types of challenge that the human body is in fact well equipped to deal with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, science has observed that PPAR-Œ≥ partial agonists can mitigate that.</p>
<p>Science is expressly specifically about NOT reporting some things such as co-incidence of some events while ignoring known related information.</p>
<p>Without addressing it being their fault at the moment, I feel pretty confident that comorbidities in the population is NOT the fault of the rest of the population whom is being punished for the comorbidities.</p>
<p>The problem has NEVER been that a virus exists; the problem has always been that some people don't take good enough care of their immune system so that they remain well enough under the challenge of a pretty pathetic virus such as this one.  It simply is NOT airborne rabies.</p>
<p>The most fundamental aspect of all of this is the KNOWN significant prevalence of lack of intake of nutrients required by humans to carry out ordinary metabolic processes (such as properly dealing with a respiratory virus and properly transitioning to resolution and repair, without becoming dysregulated).</p>

        <p>Why only now? For the entire history of human kind there have been unjust rules. Why are you only speaking about it now? And over such a little thing. If you are so concerned about unjust rules then why don't you fight for something more important. Like a gay couples' rights to adopt children. Or maybe a woman's right to be able to simply exist without having to fear for her life. How about the extreme rise in hate crimes against Asians recently. Isn't that a little bit more important than a piece of cloth?</p>

        <p>My friend.</p>
<p>Out of interest, how bad was your friends covid? I hope they're ok, and I'm imagining it would of been fairly mild/positive test result?</p>
<p>So to break it down.</p>
<p>Effectively speaking, the children are not at risk, so low a threat it's practically zero.</p>
<p>There are many studies, including one from China involving millions of subjects that show asymptomatic people do not spread.</p>
<p>Now risk to the teachers.... Well one could say it's higher than it is for the kids. But it is still very low, somewhere from 0.3-0.003% for a relatively healthy teacher under 60 years old.</p>
<p>So again I would surmise... Effectively no risk, or risk well within tolerable thresholds.</p>
<p>If children carry lots of germs, they always have, have they not? They have never needed to wear facemasks before.</p>
<p>Why is wearing a facemask such a big deal?</p>
<p>Firstly, it increases the chances of catching respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is not needed, provides no benefit.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it trains people, teachers and students to comply, with a rule grounded in neither logic nor sense nor science.</p>
<p>What is the cost of that dog training? false virtue, self policing, disconnection from fellow humans, greater sense of isolation, bad breath, conditioning to not question nor think - to just mindlessly obey. And for younger kids especially, it can increase anxiety and sense of disconnection.</p>
<p>Imagine a whole generation growing up in that kind of environment. Consider how easily they could be controlled nor manipulated.</p>
<p>Look it's not your fault, your a kid. It's the failing of the adults around you, including those cowardly teachers screeching that it is too unsafe for them to go back to the classrooms..</p>
<p>I'm sorry we are all letting you down, the cost will be yours to bear far more than ours. üòî</p>

        <p>Yes he is fine now. What relevance does that have? He still got it. So yeah, there is a risk, actually.</p>
<p>We've been growing up in this environment, man. My entire life I've been complying with what adults want. I can't wear shorts or tank tops when its hot outside, because the boys will get distracted. No they won't, they never have, its the creepy old male teachers who always get mad at us. Why is a boys education more important than mine? I can't go to the bathroom without permission. And often im denied that permission, because i need to "pay attention". I am told when to eat lunch and what to eat for lunch. I am told when I can and cannot socialize. I am told not to ask my friends for help with schoolwork, even thought that would help me learn. And for what? I try so hard every day and im learning absolutely nothing. So to me, having to wear a mask really does not make a difference. If kids being controlled is really what you're upset about, start talking about how the school system is failing us. We are taught to memorize just for specific tests. And after those tests are done, we forget everything. I dont fucking care that a mouse's fur can change color. I don't care why a triangle is a triangle. I want to learn something useful. I want to learn how to manage money properly. I want to learn how to get a job. What the fuck is a resume? I have no idea how to make one of those. Every single day my curiosity is crushed by the school system. Because they truly don't care whether or not I learn anything. They just want me to get good grades so that they can get their government money. I shouldn't be wanting to kill myself over some numbers. I shouldn't be cutting myself just because I have assignments that are late. But they don't care.</p>
<p>You've seemingly never had a problem with any of these things before. And they control us and teach us to simply obey. They teach us that grades are more important than out mental health. The only difference is that now, the pandemic helped President Biden win. That is the only reason you're so upset about something that's been happening for decades.</p>

        <p>Hey there üôÇ awesome response!</p>
<p>So your complaints about the school system I absolutely agree with!! Very much so.</p>
<p>I cannot comment on boys education being prioritised over girls. I could relay stories about being strangled by a p.e teacher for making a mistimed joke/comment, and many other things to highlight my own misery and experiences at school! But overwhelming we are on the same page here.</p>
<p>Personally I think the school system, aims, approach etc...needs to be changed, much in the spirit you point towards.</p>
<p>We sent our kids to an alternative school, with less pressure, less goal orientated standards for example.</p>
<p>And yes absolutely, school generally is a problem in my eyes and in need of drastic change. I'm sorry it's so bad over there.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of your point re. biden winning? I'm not in the US if that helps understand my lack of clarity on the point you are making.</p>
<p>The reason I'm against covid measures... Especially in schools, is because they are born of the same seed, the same things you describe about school that you struggle with. Except now it's infringing on the most basic of human needs and impulses (touch, connection, air, freedom)... The measures are even further reducing your freedoms, and mine. That what bothers me about it.</p>
<p>We do not combat a society which teaches obedience and lack of critical thought by doing it ever more extremely. (I.e. covid measures)</p>
<p>All the best, for what it is worth, I think overwhelming you're on the money with your discerning!</p>
<p>And I'm glad your friend is in good health.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou dislike kids categorically? Do you think maybe you‚Äôre exaggerating a bit? You dislike kids. Even the ones you haven‚Äôt met...‚Äù</p>
<p>Buddy dug in and backed his claim up by saying it isn‚Äôt that surprising of a thing to say.. or something like that. </p>
<p>I see so many ppl using their kids in half baked virtue arguments to justify the efficacy of masks. It‚Äôs sickening. </p>
<p>I honestly think this sentiment comes from crack pot humanities profs shoving overpopulation theories down young adults‚Äô throats year after year. Canada is for the first time ever experiencing a natural birth decline, which means more people are dying than being born. That‚Äôs fucking crazy.</p>

        <p>We spend on average 10k a year per kid in school. Some places it ends up being much higher like 20k. Imagine if the states just gave that to parents to either homeschool or pay for private schools, which are only about 11k on average. You could even have maybe 10 families get together and hire a teacher for 80k or so a year and maybe spend 20k on materials and rotate whose house the teacher teaches at. </p>
<p>I had few good teachers, but most of them while maybe good intentioned seemed unaware and unqualified. Even with their degrees. It is not all their fault. Parents a lot of times don't teach their kid a thing so when kids show up at kindergarten they barely even know how to talk and are no where near ready to begin reading, writing and arithmetic. 
  But it has always seemed silly to me that we should pay someone any amount of money to teach basics like the alphabet and addition.</p>

<p>Today I read through the teacher subreddit.  </p>
<p><strong>Come hell or high water my children will NOT be in ph mic schools</strong>.  These people are disgusting.  There were some good ones but the air of entitlement and condescension is absolutely disgusting.  I hope parents everywhere see the nastiness that is in our public schools and pull their kids in droves.  I hope they all lose state funding and end up jobless.  Ugh.</p>

        <p>Homeschool. Instill a sense of curiosity and willingness to learn. Explain that if you're teaching them something, especially something difficult, that they're expanding their capabilities. Explain it like exercise, it might hurt and be difficult now, but in a short time they'll be able to understand.</p>
<p>Don't hold them to stupid deadlines for learning things either, that was my biggest beef with public school. You have two weeks to learn algebra. "Well, shit. I seem to be at a roadblock but you're not helping and we're two weeks out from the last test I failed, so not only do I not understand this concept but I still don't get the last one and you treat me like a waterhead for not knowing the last one yet."</p>
<p>Public school is misery that only the most placid, complacent, low-watt rule followers excel at.</p>

        <p>Totally agree! One of my favorite college classes was Anatomy and Physiology but I literally just crammed the entire semester. After the semester was over and I was taking a break from a college I spent like a year actually reading the textbook and I got so much more information out of it. Maybe I am slow...but that's just how it is.</p>
<p>For anyone that homeschools I recommend a bit of Charlotte Mason. Her main view is that if you instill from very early on in children a love of truth and learning, you won't have to work so hard later on to teach them more advanced things because they will be motivated themselves. She was a teacher in the 1800s but she was so far ahead of her time. One thing she said was "in the current system you can have a student that goes on to higher education and receives good marks but never has a single idea." (Paraphrased) She goes into a lot of great detail about teaching character and academics.  Also Montessori and Waldorf are great too.</p>
<p>I have talked to teachers that have taught lower and higher grades who have said that the younger kids are more eager and excited about school but every single year you go up less and less seem to enjoy learning.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that's the key.</p>
<p>By the time I graduated highschool the majority of the kids I knew were so tired of the bullshit that they were only going to college because they were told to (myself included).</p>
<p>If I were allowed to drop out at 16 and work for a while, then travel a bit and enjoy life, I would've gone to college for business and graduated with good ideas.</p>
<p>Instead I fumbled through failing college for 9 years, breaking out with my AAS midway through, and ultimately not having any paper to show.</p>
<p>It's OK though, I've been finding opportunity where I can and can't say I'm unhappy. Life's good. People don't see <em>now</em> as a beautiful moment often enough. It's always about being more than they are.</p>

        <p>Why is it okay for someone to force their kids to go to public school but not homeschool? Parents have a right to choose what is best for their children. </p>
<p>Also kids were socialized hundreds of thousands of years before schools existed. School with peer groups can actually cause a lot of trauma and isolation. And because kids are constantly rotating through teachers they don't ever get to bond with an adult, and if they do it is ripped apart the next year. Homeschooled kids can become isolated, but most homeschool parents are fairly intentional about going out to co-ops, playgroups, lessons, spending time with family and friends. Because education doesn't take as long in a homeschool environment there is more time for kids to interact with their friends and develop hobbies and skills for their futures. And homeschool kids are often around a wider variety of people due to the fact that they spend time in libraries, co-ops, museums, and churches. in public schools you are only around people that are your age and live in the same area as you. 
You might be surprised those Amish have some of the happiest population on earth and one of the highest retention rates of any religious group. I read a book where several Amish attributed this to constantly being around large family and being home a lot.</p>

        <p>&rt; Parents have a right to choose what is best for their children.</p>
<p>Only if their children agree with it ,and nop not every deranged lunatic has a right to chose what's "right" for their kids ,just cos the sky daddy or whatever fairytale they chose to believe in told them to do so.  </p>
<p>Yeah your comparison of how children were socialized for centuries before is irrelevant as ,bellieve it or not we live totally different lifestyles now ,then we did in feudal ages or whatever times you are referring to. Kids didn't attend school then solely bcs they needed to help on the homesteads/farms to survive ,not bcs of their parents believes, what's best for them.  </p>
<p>IMO everyone that  forces their kids to be homeschooled is a socially introverted freak that needs to have their kids taken away for their kids sake. I'm not saying if the kid wants to be homeschooled ,but forcing them not to attend school and public activities is fucked up and i hope you never will have kids as you said you won't ,as you'd prolly be a terrible parent.  </p>
<p>And regarding Amishes: yeah most ppl don't really consider them to be normal part of society ,do they? I mean if you want to go back to middle ages ,be free to do so, but live the innocent kids to decide to themselves ,unlike Amishes , so fuck them too.</p>

        <p>I grew up around the Amish. A lot of Amish kids yank over and they are still welcomed by their family. All Amish spend a portion of their teenage life like theyre not Amish and most will decide to come back and join the community, it's called rumspringa. The Amish are a respectful peaceful people.

        <p>I have read quite a few books about the Amish and admire them so much! One thing that has really stuck with me is something an interviewer noticed was when he asked Amish what they wanted most for their children the answer was that they "grow up to be good." For nonAmish the answer was that they  "grow up to be happy." It wasn't that the Amish didn't  want their kids to be happy but they saw being good as a prerequisite to being happy. If you were bad you could not be happy. It has changed my out look on life for sure.</p>

        <p>So should people who force their kids to go to public schools get their kids taken away too?</p>
<p>We do live totally different lifestyles now and it seems to be going terribly. Many of these kids end up on drugs, committing suicide, suffering from mental illness, divorced, and just generally extremely unhappy and unhealthy. You didn't address the main theme of what I was saying though was that kids can clearly be socialized without going to public schools. Living different lifestyle doesn't mean they cant be socialized.</p>
<p>With your their paragraph I am thinking you must be a troll or really young. I don't know how calling people "socially introverted freaks" is any kind of valid reason to not homeschool. most homeschoolers score higher on tests than their public school counterparts and end up committing less crime and being less aggressive. I am really not sure how that would make the homeschoolers their socially introverted freaks. Yes there's the rate case where a parent abuses it, but public school is one of the number one places kids experience violence, verbal assault and sexual assault. If a parent loves their child and would prefer to keep them out of such an environment why would they be terrible for doing so as long they ensured the children ha plenty of interaction with other people and we're receiving and education comparable to that of a public education? You ignored every single beneficial thing I said about homeschooling in my first response so I am guessing you won't answer this. </p>
<p>Also pretty much all schools are entirely on zoom now anyways so I don't think there is much socializatiob going on there either.</p>
<p>Millions of people homeschool...it's no like it's a few hundred kind of thing. Do you think just become someone does sometHing different from what most of society does they should have children taken away? Is your goal in life literally to be normal? Because thats what i am getting from your responses.</p>

        <p>If there is something, i love nowadays ,it's ,that as soon as someone has a different opinion ,they are either troll or very young and naive right away. Well i'm not a troll ,nor i feel that young at 28. </p>
<p>I don't know where are you getting your data on "happy and socialized" homeschooled kids, over-achieving their publicly schooled counterparts ,i don't have any to offer either ,but i saw some of them IRL and they aren't exactly what i'd call normally socialized kids. Just my subjective experience. </p>
<p>I dunno how your public schools in USA work ,but I, and pretty much everyone that IK of in EU ,attended public schools and they are doing all right, wo any sexual assaults ,verbal assaults or whatever evils the public schools may bring in your opinion. </p>
<p>And regarding your socializing argument, on how kids can be socialized by only being in contact with their families, relatives and closed circles like that; that is exactly why kids need to have normal education and socialization  (i'm not saying that Zoom schooling RN is normal at all BTW) in order for them to learn that the world is bigger then their immediate families and friends, and that they are gonna have to function in it. You get a lot of valuable friendships and experiences by being exposed to the public, even if it comes with some negatives. </p>
<p>And no, i'm not striving to be normal at all and i never will be. If i were ,i'd prolly not be active in this sub ,but i'd be calling ppl to muzzle up instead and i'd believe in everything  my GVT says.</p>

        <p>Also just so you know some people so still live on farms and homestead. If there is ever a truly terrible pandemic or famine people will wish they had taught their children how to grow and find food, how to build, how to sew, etc. To many people and especially rural Americans this is still ever day life and it is vital that their kids know these things</p>

        <p>Here we go... Idealizing  living on a homestead wo any real contact with society, but learning on how to sew and forage instead... Great if you want to live in the middle ages ,just don't force your kids to live like that if they don't want to.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you can learn all those things while also function in modern society. Most rural ppl know those things wo them being recluses from societies and BTW i'm rural too and IK a thing or 2 about those things.</p>

        <p>Your only reasoning against homesteads is it is not normal? That's the only reason you have given me why people shouldn't homeschool and homestead. I don't know if anyone from the EU is really rural. In a lot of places you literally can't homeschool and have to pay to grow tomatoes.  I grew up on a farm, my husband grew up on a farm and my kids are too. We have plenty of friends and family. It's like this for most rural Americans. In a lot of places here you're still allowed to pull your kids out of public school for days for farm work. It's literally how our society functions and we are fed. It's hardly being a recluse or hermit in a cave. No we are not climbing cooperate ladders or going out to bars but it seems pretty clear to me whatever kind of experience you have with homeschooling and rural areas is very limited to think we are socially introverted freaks.</p>
<p>And you still haven't answered my question. Is it okay for a parent to force their kid to go to public school? An live in the city and never grow a plant or animal and get everything they eat as processed food from a grocery store?</p>

<p>LOL nop, no one in Europe is rural ,we don't have farms nor villages, only mega cities and our milk and veggies all grow in supermarkets... Get real. Unless you consider rural to be only those half literate hillbillies ,living somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Tx desert ,New Jersey Mountains ,West Virginia or even Siberia and stuff of that nature, where their lil town or farm is like the only thing that exists for 500 or whatever miles and their outdated backwards lil community is the only thing they know, then IG we don't have rural places.  I don't know if you realize that Europe doesn't holds the uniform laws  (for majority of things) ,which means ,that even if you heard that somewhere you have to pay "to grow your own tomatoes" (whatever that refers to) i don't think that's the norm for the majority of countries. You do pay the land tax, when you purchase the land as far as IK, but what you grow is up to you.</p>
<p>&rt; Is it okay for a parent to force their kid to go to public school? </p>
<p>If i recall correctly i've said that homeschooling is cruel only if kids don't want it ,but to answer your question, i think it's nothing wrong if parents force their kids to attend the public schools. After all ,not every parent has a time nor will to sit at home all days to homeschool their kids and pretend to be better qualified then teachers who studied on how to teach.</p>

<p>I recommend you check these out. These are literally just th things I have personally read and saved. There are hundreds more studies with positive outcomes for homeschoolers. Maybe you had a bad experience with some but it does not mean the majority are like that. If you ban parents from being able to homeschool, children are extremely susceptible to government propaganda. Hence the new normal we are currently in because of a cold. </p>
<p>By the way you do realize homeschoolers go out in public right? They go to the store, parks, museums, play in community sports, go to college, get jobs and work (in the case of farms many of them deal with customers very early on). They even have internet. Your only reason you have given me is homeschoolers are socially introverted freaks that live like it is the middle ages. </p>
<p>You are literally saying it should be legal for the government to make it mandatory for children to live a certain lifestyle. That is globalism and the death of culture. You have no proof that homeschooling causes any harm (as a matter of fact it benefits children overall), yet you are saying it should be illegal because it is not like normal society. </p>
<p>Let me quote back to you what you have said</p>
<p>&rt;You sound like those radical unschooling freaks or some amishes.
&rt;And regarding Amishes: yeah most ppl don't really consider them to be normal part of society ,do they? I mean if you want to go back to middle ages ,be free to do so, but live the innocent kids to decide to themselves ,unlike Amishes , so fuck them too.
&rt;And no, i'm not striving to be normal at all and i never will be. If i were ,i'd prolly not be active in this sub ,but i'd be calling ppl to muzzle up instead and i'd believe in everything  my GVT says.</p>
<p>You say you are not striving to be normal but your entire argument for why parents should have their children taken away for homeschooling is because it's not normal. Do you see how logically inconsistent that is?</p>
<p>And I did not say you were a troll or young because you had a different opinion but because of how illogical your opinion sounded.</p>
<p>You are saying a family that has farmed for generations should literally sell their house and move to the suburbs because their 7 year old decides so. That makes no sense. As long as that child is getting the education to move off the farm one day there is no reason a family should make decision based on the desires of child on a whim.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't 'deprive the kid of schooling', I would ensure that (s)he was educated better than would occur in school (not difficult). In terms of socialisation, I would ensure that the child has plenty of opportunities to mix with others. The best place for this isn't school, which is detrimental to the well-being of young people generally. It certainly wasn't good for me.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat confusing outburst on the whole, as many millions of children are homeschooled now. For example, the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova were all homeschooled.</p>
