        <p>Today, (actually yesterday the 12th of July, since it's 02h34 in the morning here), Président Macron has declared new mandatory measures will come into place from 15th September. Many measures including, but not exhaustive :</p>
<p>-Mandatory vaccination for healthcare personal (nurses, doctors, etc etc) ;</p>
<p>-"Pass Sanitaire" (you can translate by Sanitary Pass) meaning to enter a public place (restaurants, bars, long distance trains, buses and planes) you'll have to show either a negative PCR test, proof of previous contamination (hence anticorps) or proof of vaccine. </p>
<p>But it's the first step as they'll in the future enlarge it to everything and you'll have to show proof of vaccination (and it'll become Passe Vaccinale or Vaccine Pass in English) - &rt; my analysis shared by millions of people</p>
<p>And many other things but I'm tired at this moment and about to go to bed. But see they are all lying. It took him slightly more than 6 months to do what he said he wouldn't do. </p>
<p>Now, fight for your liberty and your dignity!</p>

        <p>At least they include "proof of previous contamination". In that case, I'd take infection with Covid + Ivermectin + Fluvoxamine over the vaccines.</p>
<p>You might not even need that, a hell of a lot of people have already been infected without knowing it. Its essentially a choice between (a) a targeted inflammation of the lungs treated by safe drugs with a very highs success rate, or (b) an experimental treatment that may not offer any long term protection and which has a high chance of loose spike proteins creating random long-term, negative health effects.</p>
<p>As you say though, this option (prior infection) may be removed in future.</p>

        <p>Don't be naïve, it's the first step. At the moment, PCR tests are free in France which makes the Pass Sanitaire more or less acceptable. But from October onwards, you'll have to pay for a test meaning they'll add contraint to force you to take the vaccine (who is going to pay every 3 days a PCR test to enter a restaurant, go to the movie, the theatre or take the train when taking the vaccine is free?).</p>
<p>And at some point, they'll say: "look guys there is this new variant Zeta so PCR tests don't work, previous infections are useless so you've to show that you're vaccinated to enter."</p>
<p>That's how it works. They always do it step by step. Never everything at once otherwise they'll provoke a revolution.</p>

        <p>I would pay not to get the vaccine, so i will atleast. Maybe others too. Unless they start dragging people out from their house and force the poison on them, but then we will be in different times than now, so i will go down fighting before i take something I DONT WANT!</p>

        <p>It's gonna be like €60 (approx. $71). </p>
<p>You'd pay that every 4 days to enjoy normal life (on top of what normal life activities would cost you)? For ever?</p>

        <p>Who says its forever? Yes i would pay that, its not that easy to coerce me into doing something i don’t want, i have money and i will pay this if this comes to my country. You realise they are only doing this so that people will get the vaccine, im not giving up like some pussy.</p>
