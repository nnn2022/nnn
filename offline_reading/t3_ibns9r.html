        <p>If things were as terrible as they mentioned, you would see hazmat suits and proper Powered air respirators for rich people that could easily afford them and anyone else that had them.</p>
<p>But they know its bs, and that would <em>embarrass</em> them to be seen wearing such things. </p>
<p>They can temporarily get behind the smaller embarrassment of the cloth masks, in order to force it on you, however.</p>

        <p>I have a HEPA filter mask that I've used when working with lead paint, I should start wearing it.  If enough people started going full hazmat we could troll regular people into thinking it's necessary.</p>

        <p>Oh great, a guy that thinks the virus is nothing because 'his friend caught it and is fine'. Like, are you for real? You think that proves a point?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We don't know the long-term effects of the virus at all, potential organ damage is on the table among other long-term health issues <strong>because the science is inconclusive, we've been in this pandemic for 6 months, that's nothing.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People that smoke, and various other groups that have health issues already (not limited to lungs) are much more at danger from this virus than your normal 20-something, including old people, a lot of people are asymptomatic, don't get tested, and think they just caught a flu - they're the biggest risk factor in transmitting the virus to the groups at risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, it doesn't block 40% of droplets, there's different sizes of particulates, so that number, at best, is misleading, at worst it's just straight up false. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't even form  a sentence properly, why the fuck would you put a space and then .. two dots like that? I know people that do that, they're fucking dumb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't need to be scarred to death, in fact, I'm not even close to that, but I'm not denying the existance of the virus, nor am I denying that it's dangerous to a good chuck of the population. I don't want to be the reason someone else dies or has major health complications because I couldn't be asked to wear a fucking mask for those poor 10 minutes while I'm in the store.</p>

        <p>I never denied the existence of the virus .. the virus isn't shit .. two dots .. two dots.. this is a forum not a fucking college term assignment I'll put how many dots I want and I'm not an idiot for doing so.. you're a prick and you know you're a prick and everyone around you knows you're a prick .. come at me calling me names? Wtf dude what's your problem? Get a real job ..  and yes the masks only block 40% of these droplets you love to talk about. You know the large droplets that before masks you'd walk around and get spit on by people all over the place .. those droplets .. the other microdroplets go right through your fucking mask. This post is not meant to be an antimask post like you idiots think, it's meant to show you how fucking stupid it is to think a dust mask stops the spread of a deadly virus ..  all you're doing is spreading your virus more because now you're walking around the entire planet thinking you're safe when you're not you've never been safe with your dust mask not for one second. But God forbid we can't stop people from going to Walmart or Safeway but let's shut down all the schools and hair cut places .. it's total bullshit .. I can go into Walmart with 40 kids with me and that would be fine and guess what that teacher is at the Walmart too hahaha you're being lied to and I know it sucks when you're starting to realize it. Don't rely on a 2 dollar dust mask to protect you or other from a virus it won't happen .. if you don't want the virus stay the fuck home or wear a proper hazmat mask</p>

<li>Long term side effects will be similar to other long term viral side effects, and those who experience them will correlate with those most at risk of dying. The majority who catch COVID-19 &amp; don't know about it or get over the infection without hospitalisation will be unlikely to suffer anything severe or any of the potential long term effects.</li>
<li>You have conflated what asymptomatic means. It means without symptoms so people will not think they have the flu because they will not have any symptoms to make them think that. Asymptomatic spread is also pretty rare, given you do not cough or sneeze, and it takes extended exposure to pass on the virus.</li>
<li>Most cloth masks are not very effective at blocking viruses, varying wildly in efficacy. Estimates come from various sources about this and it is not a settled topic. The WHO for instance states: "The filtration of cloth fabrics and masks has been shown to vary between 0.7% and 60%." </li>
<li>That's quite rude to the person you are replying to and not particularly constructive. We could easily point out minor formatting and spelling mistakes in your comments but it's not relevant.</li>
<li>It is becoming increasingly clear who is at risk from COVID-19 and consequently who needs to be altering their behaviour to adapt to this. Society cannot be expected to bend over backwards to make everything 100% safe for the minority adversely at risk and to the detriment of all others. As mentioned before it takes extended exposure to catch COVID-19 and is exceedingly rare for truly asymptomatic people, with symptomatic staying home and physical distancing measures this risk is incredibly minimal especially for the 10 minute shop.</li>

        <p>120 upvotes, this subreddit is pure cringe tbh, I've been coming here for a good 2 weeks laughing my ass off at what these dumb cunts post lol</p>
<p>don't worry too much bro, humanity was fucked either way, with or without the internet. People are fucking dumb, the internet just makes that readily apparent.</p>
<p>OP, i too want to express that you're dumb. You have all the information humanity has accumulated for the past 100 000 years in front of you, you don't even need to stand up or go the library, and you're still incapable of harnessing it.</p>

        <p>No mask stops a virus .. that's why this post is funny .. the dust mask doesn't stop a virus .. and it only stops less than 40% of your "droplets" .. but let's shut the entire world down for the world's most deadliest virus .. haha</p>
