    <strong>Face masks with skin conditions</strong>
    <p><p>I have a skin condition where it's incredibly important that I not get sunburn on my face. It's been difficult for me because sunscreen has always given my face breaks out horribly if I use it. I found a great solution during the pandemic, wearing a face mask outdoors. </p>
<p>I often hear people say "Covid is a hoax, and masks don't work, and individual rights, and I have a medical condition I don't have to say what it is." Everyone thinks it's sus that almost everyone with a medical exemption is also someone looking for every reason they can to not wear a mask. Especially when others brag about how easy it is to lie about it. I think it's only fair for me to say that I don't need to disclose my condition. </p>
<p>I'm not making up a medical condition as someone is going to accuse me of. I do not want to wear a mask when I mow my lawn, I'm not making up excuses. It's been really nice though, bonus effect of helping my allergies. </p>
<p>Despite it being my private health decision, I receive snide comments over the fact that I'm wearing a mask outdoors. People got more vocal after the last CDC guidance changed, and I do think Tucker inspired some of this to.</p>
<p>The pro-mask people didn't call me out and question me. They assume I have my own reasons. The Anti-maskers mock me, and I see plenty of comments online too mocking people for wearing masks outdoors or in their cars. I say I have a medical condition that is best assisted with a mask, I'm mocked and treated like a sheep.</p>
<p>Why do pro-maskers respect my health, medical privacy, and freedom- but Anti-maskers always seem to care more about smug superiority.</p>
<p>Do you guys really just assume that someone doing something you don't want to do is inferior? Does my medical need to avoid sunburn just make me stupid or a liar? Are the Anti-maskers casting judgement on me wrong?</p></p>

        <p>I see judgmental pricks all around.  </p>
<p>My observation going about my day to day business is that people in general don't seem to bother one another too much and no comments- snide or otherwise are offered unless there's a conversation initiated and an opinion is solicited.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to get my head around the setting where you're meeting bad actors who are saying troubling things when you've laid out reasons for wearing a facial covering.. notwithstanding that the mouth and nose covering still leaves a good amount of skin exposed to the sun.</p>
<p>Adults who have reached the age of reason offering unsolicited insults are few and far between whatever their beliefs.  You've typed out a rant for a pattern of conduct I have a difficult time getting my head around as it just doesn't aseem to fit how even the most disagreeable folks I know and work with behave around strangers who otherwise mare minding their own business.</p>

        <p>The mask situation may well be regional (as is my understanding) but people acting out seems a bit of an outlier to me that it would occur to such a degree that someone would come here to a place they think shares certain views and rant- as though we were to account for the behavior.</p>

        <p>You're not going to get any grief about a choice of whether or not to wear a face covering- let alone skin issues if people around you have manners and class.</p>
<p>You post very adeptly called out anti mask people as being the source of your troubles and you seemed to want an accounting from members here for a behavior you treated as a characteristic of a specific school of (political?) thought.</p>
<p>There is diversity of beliefs here- we are not all one ideology- what we are is united- albeit loosely- by a set of disbeliefs and distrust of a situation and system it seems to be paving the way for.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.  I hope that you experience success in dealing with your skin problems and can grasp the fac that an abuser will act out at the expense of his or her own credibility.</p>

        <p>If sunblock is making you breakout, you could either put less on, or use one that wont clog your skin.</p>
<p>Also, wearing a mask has been shown to increase acne, probably way worse that sunblock would ever, so I guess it's your choice in the end</p>

        <p>The pro mask people don't bother you because by all means it looks like you've capitulated to their every whim. It's as easy as that. Otherwise those busybodies would be on you too. Did you ever try to not wear a mask in a store in April of this year? It wasn't snide comments that you'd get, your be told to leave like a persona non grata while the crowds clap and record you on their phones in case the almost 400 day attack on your dignity and freedom caused you to snap. </p>
<p>Sorry if people are taking it too far in the opposite direction, but MAN does it not even compare. What is this, day 20 for you? </p>
<p>We can't call the dogs off because we don't take orders from a central source, that was your side doing that. Those people are freelance assholes. If you think it's bad now wait for the pro facist side to think wearing a mask makes you an anti vaxer. You're gonna have to wear a t-shirt that explains the situation!</p>

        <p>Really? You're presumably 20+ years old and you only recently realized that covering your face with something would help prevent it from being sunburned?</p>
<p>I ultimately don't care what you or anyone else does with one's own body. I might call you (plural) idiots or laugh at you (plural) depending on the exact situation, but I wouldn't want you (plural) to be disallowed from doing whatever activity it is.</p>

<p>The majority here couldn't only care less what you wear, some people entered here because or even only because they're having the exact same trouble with pro-maskers the other way around ... </p>
<p>The pro-mask side paints their walls with irony, don't you worry about a damn thing they claim of us, anyone who respects my choice not to wear one is welcome here by me.</p>
