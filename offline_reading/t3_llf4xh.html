    <strong>I need to rant. Let's start with this: It's just a mask</strong>
    <p><p>It’s not that hard. It’s just a few square inches of cloth covering your face, what’s the big deal? How selfish can you be? Sure, most people won’t be affected by covid, but many will. Seniors and compromised individuals could get sick or die, and by refusing to wear a mask you are basically saying you don’t care about them; you’re saying that your personal comfort is more important than their lives. You don’t care about anyone but yourself and your narrow, narcissistic desire for “freedom” is putting everyone in danger. You selfish asshole!</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not a big deal to you. Maybe to you, the millennial who works from home and orders DoorDash and has Zoom parties, it’s an easy sacrifice. Maybe, secretly, you kind of like it. Maybe to the boomer who is actually threatened by covid, it’s important. Maybe you saved for 40 years to enjoy your retirement and if only people would stop being selfish and wear their mask you still might have a chance at your golden years. Maybe, if people would just grow up and lock down and wear their masks for a couple years, you’ll be able to enjoy Sunday brunch again at your favorite restaurant. Maybe, in your world, it’s just a mask. </p>
<p>Fine. Ok. You’re right, it’s not really a big deal to me, either. I hate wearing a mask, but I’ll put one on at the grocery store if it makes you feel safer.</p>
<p>But listen to me really fucking carefully: to my 3-year-old, who is just getting her feet in the world, who is learning about social interaction, emotional intelligence, and empathy; still very much in the middle of cognitive development, still trying to grasp language, trying to piece together verbal and non-verbal communication, trying to control her own emotions and understand the emotions of others, it’s ABSOLUTELY A BIG FUCKING DEAL. To my 18-month-old, who is struggling with language, who does speech therapy via Zoom, who will soon go off to day care to interact with other masked children and learn from masked teachers, who will hear muffled words but not see where they're coming from, it’s ABSOLUTELY A BIG FUCKING DEAL. To me, a father of two kids, who’s only goal in life is to make sure they are safe and nurtured and given ever opportunity that I had, that my parents and grandparents had, it’s ABSOLUTELY A BIG FUCKING DEAL!</p>
<p>In 2011, when the Fukushima nuclear plant melted down, hundreds of retired and aging engineers volunteered to relieve the current workers. Go home, they said, you are young and have your whole lives ahead of you. We’re old, we lived our lives, and we will gladly sacrifice to ensure that you get the same opportunities we had. </p>
<p>When this happened, I was moved, but not all that surprised. Most humans have similar values. Most seniors would indeed sacrifice their lives for the lives of their grandchildren. What the fuck happened?</p>
<p>Today, we’re asking children to sacrifice for seniors. My kids have zero risk from covid, but you are asking that they give up part of their childhood, to risk their development and their futures so Grandma can live a few more years. Listen, Grandma can fucking quarantine. Maybe she’ll get lonely or depressed, and that sucks, truly; I sincerely hope and pray that she makes it out ok. But hopes and prayers are not enough for my kids, sorry. They cannot and will not quarantine. Grandma’s safety and wellbeing, while obviously extremely important, pales in comparison to that of my children. This shouldn’t be a controversial notion. Frankly, I’m pretty sure most grandmothers would agree.</p>
<p>What’s worse, though, is to call me selfish. To shrug off or diminish my very real concerns for my kids and their futures, is heartless; to call me an asshole because of those concerns is extremely disheartening. I’m a reasonable person. I can and will take necessary precautions. I can and will follow the science and listen to our authorities – but not blindly. When it comes to my kids, there’s no authority great enough to get me to ignore my gut, to stop me from asking questions and voicing my concerns, to get me to follow faithfully along when something seems awry.</p>
<p>I don’t care what your politics are, or how you feel about Trump, Biden, Fauci, and the rest. Like em or hate em, whatever. But if you ignore your own intuitions or suppress your own reasonable concerns in favor of some impersonal authority, you’re a fucking fool.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m an “anti-masker”, but you’d probably never know, and I’m certainly not a jerk about it. Like I said before, I’ll wear the mask to make others comfortable. I am not ignoring the pandemic, but goddamnit I can ask questions! Don’t paint me as insane for my very sane concerns. Don’t call me a monster because I’m scared for my children. This is what is pushing us all apart. This is how you fill a powder keg with anger and resentment and fear. I’m a reasonable person, but when I’m not allowed to ask reasonable questions that concern my kids, my options are narrowed. And I’ll never stop asking those questions. Never fucking ever. </p>
<p>None of this is supposed change your mind. Please, by all means, push for masks and lock downs if that’s your conviction. I know you only have the best intentions; the majority of people do. At the end of the day we all want the same things, of this I’m convinced. We differ greatly in our approaches, but we can still be reasonable with each other. All I ask is that you take me seriously, that you show me and my children the same compassion you do for the covid dead. Ignoring me, gaslighting me, calling me an asshole will only strengthen my resolve and elevate my concerns. </p>
<p>Finally, please, stop with “it’s just a mask”. It’s not. It’s much more than that to me, and to my kids. Maybe I’m wrong about everything, maybe I’m a fool. But if you really think so, if you really care, if you really want to convince me, start with understanding. Calling me selfish only convinces me that you don’t understand at all.</p>
<p>(Note: hopefully it's clear this isn't directed the people of this sub, but to those who oppose it)</p></p>

        <p>The government's COVID-19 response isn't about protecting Grandma. Five Democrat governors got the COVID death count party started by sending sick COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, killing many thousands of Grandmas. They created draconian lockdown policies that turned many more thousands of Grandmas into prisoners locked in close to solitary confinement for close to a year, loneliness and depression killing many more prematurely.</p>
<p>This is about turning formerly free citizens into compliant serfs who obey rather than decide on their own. You should care about the politics because this is a political attack on us by totalitarian globalists.</p>

        <p>For children and autistic individuals there's something called a facial expression chart. It's a learning tool that shows people making different faces and which emotion goes along with that. It's a helpful tool, but doesn't allow for individual variants that real world experience brings.  Social media and only communicating through text was already fucking kids up. This is proven. But kids at least had some face to face interaction at school. Now that has been taken away too. People think, "well, maybe it's not ideal but oh well....". No, not "oh well". Certain ages are critical with development of these basic communication skills. It's not something you can just catch up on later and everything's cool. This stuff is detrimental.</p>

        <p>I agree with your sentiment, and the icing on the cake is the studies of masks hardly even working, meaning they are a pointless measure and this damage to your kids is just a result of overblown virtue signalling.   </p>
<p>As for prioritising young vs old, I personally think a life is a life and it's hard for me to justify one over the other, but I do struggle to wrap my head around how we don't know these older deaths weren't going to happen anyway. Here in the UK, the average death age of COVID is higher than the normal death age - which says to me these people are at the end of life anyway, so I honestly don't think we should have even been counting carehome deaths. Contrary to that, the deaths as a result of lockdown measures (in my life I can name 3 so far and sure there will be more to come, long after COVID is over) are entirely preventable imo. You can't say "he would have probably killed himself anyway" when his whole life has been flipped and career ruined due to lockdowns. Therefore I think lockdown deaths are more scary, unnatural and preventable than COVID deaths.</p>

        <p>I have a 4, 2 and 1 yr old.</p>
<p>We <em>never</em> talk about Covid or “sick people” in front of them.  They are not required to wear masks.  The older two attend preschool without masks even though some kids willingly wear them.  I encourage them to interact with strangers and not be afraid of people (unlike what so many parents are doing to their kids!!!)</p>
<p>I take them everywhere I can.  To the store, park, wherever.  Luckily kids are elastic and the masks other people wear (and mom) don’t bother them much anymore.  But I’m not going to psychologically torture them.</p>

        <p>Great rant. They should have made special hours available for seniors and the immune compromised,like 7 to 9 in the morning,made delivery services free for them,and then let the rest of us work,kids go to school,go to my gym classes to stay healthy, etc. I have watched people who own small businesses lose their business people lose their house because they lost their jobs, this would have been a better compromise.</p>
