    <strong>Anecdote from the office I work at</strong>
    <p><p>I overheard how a colleague disclosed to our common supervisor that he had the second covid-shot (Biontech) yesterday and now feels pretty bad. He complained about muscle-ache and a general hard to define feeling of being unwell.<br>
Short background about my supervisor: He worked for a manufacturer of medical-equipment before and his wife is a biologist. </p>
<p>So the colleague goes on to ask whether our supervisor knows about a difference between the 1st and the 2nd shot since he did not have issues like that after the first one. He also was second-guessing him already. "My doctor asked if I had any questions. And I said no. Now I do have questions."</p>
<p>Supervisor answered the question with: "The shot is not different but your immune-system is now." He went on that he considers it as too risky and won't take the shot.<br>
Poor colleague was second-guessing himself some more and I came to them and asked: "What kind of research have you done before about how the vaccine is supposed to work?" Answer: "Nothing. And I kinda regret that now."<br>
I said: "Uh, okay. In case you go to the doctor again, maybe ask for a d-dimer test."<br>
Both him and my boss get curious about what that's supposed to do. And I tell them about Charles Hoffe and also suggest that: "If I had just taken the vaccine and already feel bad about it, I probably wouldn't want to hear what exactly he said. So do you really want to hear it?" Colleague agreed not wanting to be confronted with information like that at that moment.</p>
<p>Then my boss says: "But I want to hear! Come, let's go to a meeting-room!"</p>
<p>I tell him what I've heard from Dr. Hoffe and in total we are in there for like 20 minutes talking about all sorts of bio-chemical mechanisms because of which the vaccines are bad. He tells me a lot of things that I haven't even heard of.<br>
For example about a substance that's also used as poison is included, about how due to some stabilizer that stuff stays active for 4 month, which is completely unnatural exposure to something like that, about increased risk of cancer due to the risk of the RNA being coded back to DNA, about how the spike-proteins could block the receptors of the anti-bodies and thus weakening the immune-system from fighting off an actual infection.<br>
At one point I summarized both our points: So we have cardiovascular-issues, respiratory-issues, cancer-risk and infection-risk. All the stuff people normally die from increased by those vaccines.<br>
Then we went on about censorship, about how probably way more people think like us than it seems apparent, defamation of everyone who dares to even suggest that it's a choice and should stay a choice, propaganda and even conspiracy-theories coming true. He ended up on the notion of how refreshing it was to talk to someone like-minded and emphasized that he really doesn't want me to falter under pressure and get the vaccine.</p>
<p>It's really nice to have one's boss' back in that regard.</p></p>

        <p>Oh, and I forgot to mention:</p>
<p>From the 5 people of whom I am aware they got the shot there's now 2 who have talked about having a pretty severe reaction shortly after.</p>

        <p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I've heard about those too.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about cardiovascular-issues is how they can impact and cause so many other issues that don't seem all to related to it.</p>
<p>Obstructed bloodflow can negatively impact every single kind of organ we have and thus create a vast variety of different issues with different seventies.</p>
<p>Reproductive issues may just be influenced by that or they may be something extra with it's own biochemical mechanism.</p>

        <p>So if I understood correctly mass d-dimer tests of vaccinated might be pretty cool in regards of micro-clots theory?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'd like to know whether Dr. Hoffe's theory is correct. Right now I haven't heard about anyone else testing for that so it's a single-source-information.</p>

        <p>That's some good news. Everyone in my life currently (except my SO thank god) is a brainwashed zombie. I hear more and more people (mostly at work) complaining about persistent side effects, and even how they have been dismissed by doctors despite going to the ER. I also know two people who have remained in ICU after getting the vaccine, one with multi-organ failure (only 58 years old), and the other with clots (\~65 years old). I still don't know anyone who ever went to the hospital with Covid.</p>
