    <strong>SCOTUS Rules In Favor of Rockefellers</strong>
    <p><p>A California law saying that charities have to disclose their largest donors was struck down.</p>
<p>This is a very beneficial ruling for the Rockefellers. Their modus operandi is to operate through a bunch of fake charities.</p>

        <p>Dr. Emanuel Josephson writes:</p>
<p>“In the field of medical research, <strong>the Rockefellers and their agents have created</strong> the usual, <strong>unhealthy atmosphere</strong> that results from their predatory entry into any new field. <strong>Intensive commercialization and monopoly have become the keynotes of medicine and of medical research.</strong> Vested interests and frank rackets have been created or enhanced in those fields. Institutional and personal <strong>jealousies</strong> and <strong>commercial rivalries</strong> have been <strong>intensified by the power acquired by small cliques with the funds of the Institute and of other Rockefeller controlled "philanthropies" and allied organizations.</strong></p>
<p>This situation was well described in thinly masked fictional form by Sinclair Lewis in his Arrow-smith, which centered about a true story of Rockefeller Institute activities. <strong>A factual exposure of the evil influence of the Rockefeller medical "philanthropies" was published by Hans Zinnser, a brilliant bacteriologist, researcher and scholar, in the February 1927 issue of Atlantic Monthly magazine.</strong></p>
<p>The medical research cliques thus subsidized seek to protect their reputations and jobs, as well as the prestige of their institutions upon which both are dependent, by setting up a <strong>monopolistic control</strong> of research. <strong>Manuscripts of research results are censored by them</strong> to make sure that no researcher can publish a discovery that will enhance his reputation to the detriment or overshadowing of their own, or that will jeopardize commercial interests with which they or their sponsors are allied. For this purpose <strong>they have reestablished medieval dogmatism in many medical fields and a monopoly of medical education.</strong> They conspire to dictate "accepted medical practice". They dictate the directions which research shall take and block research by capable, independent workers whenever they can. They undertake to protect their own mediocrity and ineptitude by the device of group medical research which enables them to take for themselves the credit for the work of others. <strong>Discoveries by independent research workers, no matter how important, are suppressed, or stolen, unless it serves their purposes to permit release or publication of them.”</strong></p>
