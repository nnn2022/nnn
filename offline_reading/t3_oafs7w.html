    <strong>Is war with China imminent? Why or why not? Will they try to become the new world superpower?</strong>
    <p><p>I know the vaccines are a main topic here, so this might be a bit off topic. However, I was just banned from offmychest for commenting in this group after not being active here for months. So might as well go all out. </p>
<p>My discussion pertains to China. My father is rather paranoid and believes we are going to war with China very soon. He keeps up with every shred of news from China, the military, stocks, agriculture, and trade. Every time I talk to him it is all doom and gloom, world war 3 is coming. </p>
<p>Then I got online and started digging about China and discovered that war might be as close as he claims. China is embedded deep in everything. They're in our entertainment and media. They manufacture a lot of stuff for us. We have let ourselves become dependent on them. If I were making steps to become the new world leader, that's how I'd start off. I'd worm my way into every aspect of the current world leaders lives and silently takeover before boots on the ground, maybe release a virus to weaken them first. China really does seem to be making moves to be the new world leader. How do we feel about having a world leader that has concentration camps? I mean it kind of feels like it would be worse than giving the Nazis control of the world because China is playing it smarter. </p>
<p>Has anyone else been keeping up with the China topic? Does anyone else see war coming or is just fearmongering? I'm just curious to hear how others feel about China after hearing my dad go on and on about how war is near and we need to prepare for hard times. He gets pretty riled up about how blind people are. Says it's all right in front of us but no one can see because people are too worried about topics that in the long run don't even really matter. Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>I think it's less of a "takeover" and more of the western world adopting a technocratic, authoritarian model of governance similar to China's, especially when it comes to lockdowns, dealing with dissidents, etc. </p>
<p>China is definitely primed to be the new world leader in the 21st century. With most US corporations kowtowing to them, as you said, why even need a war? China is already in the process of dominating much of the east with the Belt &amp; Road initiative, as well as having its big business buy up parts of Africa. They are just biding their time, thinking in terms of the next several decades as the US's hold over the world begins to decay.</p>

        <p>No. We won’t go to war with China or anyone else for the foreseeable future. The same people who are in control of China also control us. There is no “us” and “them” or “good guys” and “bad guys”—there are only  bad guys, and us.</p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>I don’t think there will be a war-they’ve already bought Biden and most political leaders in charge so if there’s a war it’s for show. They are already infiltrating our media and controlling our elections and most other things. Their end goal is to take over America and our farmland to provide food for the communist party and China back home.</p>

        <p>Highly doubt that we'd go to war for Taiwan. In any case, China does not need to go to war with US. They already control all our manufacturing and better leave to Leftism the task to wipe America's supremacy and teach generations to hate it. Why would you fight a formidable enemy when he is stabbing himself?</p>
<p>The Chinese know that in the XV they were the most advanced civilization and blew the opportunity to become the world power, eventually falling behind and being bullied by the West. Now they're marching towards regaining the prize they once let slip and this time they won't let go for good.</p>

        <p>We are already engaged in a trade war with China, sanctions are a pre-cursor to war. While COVID may have been first identified in China, it was present in wastewater and lab samples in USA and other countries prior to it's isolation in Wuhan, the White House issued a gag order on this- the media's hands are tied, if there are any honest ones left. Notice how the worst outbreaks seem to be in places where mass socialist movements have been underway or places of geopolitical importance to the belt and road initiative? </p>
<p>Also, the epidemiology of the disease is like no other and suggests human intervention of a purposeful nature, and it isn't China.</p>
