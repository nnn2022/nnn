    <strong>Does a 0.04% Rise in Canadian Mortality Constitute a "Pandemic"?</strong>
    <p><p>Using Canadian government data, we may easily prove once and for all that there is ZERO "pandemic" in the most draconian lockdown nation in North America.</p>
<p>2020 Canadian mortality increase (unadjusted for lockdowns and pop growth): <strong>0.04%</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=10&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=10&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&amp;referencePeriods=20171001%2C20201001">https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=10&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=10&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&amp;referencePeriods=20171001%2C20201001</a></p>
<p>Myriad reasons that excess mortality at essentially rounding error of 0.04% would be up in 2020, but here are just a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased suicides</li>
<li>Increased anxiety and depression can lead to increased heart attacks</li>
<li>Elective surgeries cancelled and people dying while awaiting needed surgeries</li>
<li>In-person doctor appointments are now a rarity so screening processes that would normally catch cancers and other illnesses may not be caught</li>
<li>Possible increased workplace accidents leading to death (depression leads to a higher rate of accidents in workplaces).</li>
<li>(If geriatrics were treated the same during 2018 flu season as in 2020, we would have similar results/data.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Addendum : <a href="https://divergemedia.ca/2021/01/06/all-cause-mortality-2020-canada/">https://divergemedia.ca/2021/01/06/all-cause-mortality-2020-canada/</a></p>
<p>So what are we to make of a nation that has experienced virtually nothing from the dreaded killer virus, and yet has behaved as though it was killing half the population?</p>
<p>That public health is not driving its behavior, including its push to "vax" everyone.</p>
<p>Now, a segment of Canadians will rush to defend the government and simply ignore the above verifiable numbers, or attempt to excuse them by hypothesizing that it “would have been so much worse” had the government not virtually eliminated the population’s rights, but that’s as unprovable as hypothesizing that the power of prayer, or an alien overlord, caused the death rate to be statistically unchanged.</p>
<p>Let the arguments commence!</p></p>
