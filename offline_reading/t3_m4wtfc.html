    <strong>Last Chance U: Basketball Episode 8 is the first documentary series of what it was like during the week of March 8th, 2020. Absolute must watch for how ridiculous that time was.</strong>
    <p><p>The latest season of last chance you just came out on Netflix and it might be worth to jump in and view episode eight. This episode shows the team getting ready to go to their conference tournament and as soon as they get on the bus they find out that it is canceled. It’s even more interesting because it’s a california junior college and we all know what will go down in california in the months to come. The episode does such a good job of describing what the whole week was like and just how ridiculous lockdowns were and the negative impact that had on young peoples lives. 
Just watching it the exact same week a year later it’s almost real of how we let things get to that level. Never again.</p></p>
