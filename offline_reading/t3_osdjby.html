        <p>You're not wrong. The "left" and "right" wings are both part of the same liberal bird. </p>
<p>But we don't really have the terminology to distinguish between the various sub-groups among the "left" and "right" yet. Or rather, such terminology has not become popularized and standardized yet.</p>
<p>Most people haven't even realized that "liberalism" as a whole, whether it is "left wing" or "right wing" liberalism, is just a covert form of totalitarianism.</p>

        <p>I consider "conservatism" a colloquial term. It doesn't refer to any consistent ideology, it's more akin to a tribal group. A group of disenfranchised people, or perhaps, different groups of disenfranchised peoples, who know in their hearts that something is deeply wrong with the course that American society has taken, but lack the perspective to accurately describe what has gone wrong, and what is still going wrong. They can only react, and by the time they react it is always too late.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the saying, "conservatism is just liberalism's shadow"? That is what I believe. Liberals make the changes, conservatives follow in their footsteps and cement those changes 20-30 years after they are first made. For the ordinary citizen, the grassroots conservative, this is not deliberate. They are just trying to live their lives in peace. But the "conservative" politicians are controlled opposition. They are part of the same establishment as the liberals. The "conservative" politicians ARE liberals, they're just liberals who are wearing a certain mask and playing a certain role.</p>
<p>Politics is a revolving door. Elected officials come and go, but who remains? Who holds on to power for decade after decade? Who funds the politicians? Who promotes them? These are the people who are really in power, not the people we vote for in elections.</p>

        <p>Have you heard the quote "conservatives are progressives driving the speed limit"? It explains it pretty well. Not sure who it is. Michael Malice if I had to guess. Look up 2040s republican, its a meme that breaks it down in a funny way. Not that im right wing or anything, just lost.</p>

        <p>No, it's not leftism going on right now.</p>
<p>The other poster is largely correct, and it's something I have talked about in the past.  The interesting thing is that the "conservatives" (I am not one) are actually the major "resistance" party right now, because the entire system is grinding away to prop up "neolibs/neocons" right now.</p>
<p>Just think about that last sentence.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself why would all the most financially/powerfully elite people be pushing communism, a popular claim from conservatives?  They wouldn't.  Yes, communism always benefits the elite group at the top, but there's zero chance that Jake Tapper is sitting around thinking "gee, if I just support communism I can become even richer and more powerful!"  Never happen.</p>
<p>I don't want to type an essay here, but you need to understand the elites have been scheming towards a "third way" since the fall of fascism and communism.  Both are appealing to elites for obvious reasons, but neither one was ultimately self-sustaining.  A "gentler" approach has been pursued now for some time.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of wikipedia, but it was literally the first link that came up when I searched, so here it is.  Feel free to look up definitions/descriptions somewhere else, but you'll find largely the same thing:</p>
<p>"Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe."</p>
<p>Here are the stated components of fascism:</p>
<p>authoritarian, ultranationalism, dicatorial power, suppression of opposition, regimentation of society and economy</p>
<p>It is inarguable that all but one of those is occurring right now, with the only possible exception being "ultranationalism", but what is ultranationalism at its essence other than holding of your group up above all others.  Are you saying that isn't happening right now?</p>
<p>This is the third way.  It has been in implementation for years.  All 2020/2021 did was accelerate the timeline.  Never let a crisis go to waste, right?  And what better "crisis" than a global one?  The problem with "conservatives", honestly, is that so few of them are willing to actually read material they should be reading to understand the problem, so they fall back on the classic boogiemen from their youth.  Not that those boogiemen weren't evil, but we have boogiemen right now, too.</p>

        <p>You are thinking in 1-dimensional, black-and-white terms. Don't you think there's more to these ideologies than modern, reductive definitions?</p>
<p>They all possess common characteristics. Mindless obedience to authority. Materialism. Neglect, or even rejection of the most basic human needs, especially that of community, familiarity, and spirituality.</p>

        <p>I bet a few people vomited in France when they saw a crudely fashioned metal sheet slice through the neck, spinal cord, and throat, when the "lame" overthrew them the last time. </p>
<p>They had several heads collected in baskets, most with facial expressions stuck in the last horrifying seconds of their lives. In... a bucket.</p>
<p>So, some people probably vomited. And those people are lame, as you say, because they couldn't stomach what needed to be done at the time. </p>
<p>Unless you think what happened was wrong.</p>

        <p>Interesting read.</p>
<p>Given the path that Western governments are heading with regards to mandatory vaccines (focus currently on France), it seems that a violent insurrection is inevitable. </p>
<p>Is this a threat to the System? Or do you think it is part of the plan? Perhaps in order for the System to "Build back better" it first needs to destroy the old structure.</p>

        <p>Well as he says, it's not really a "plan" it's just how the system works. He's more talking about people who don't really know what they're mad about and choose from a list some (approved) distant, subjective wishy-washy romantic cause. If you read Industrial Civilization and it's Future he goes into more detail about leftist causes and 'surrogate activities.'</p>
<p>I think in this case people know exactly what they're mad about and they very much have a legitimate right to be. That being said, they could still end up serving the system inadvertently, the way beep43 pointed out, but I don't think that's how it would go down. I think the way the system would try to use this to it's advantage would be to let it happen and then just report on it dishonestly all the time and use it to brainwash pro-lockdown people to beg for a more fascistic government response. Like 'look at these violent anti-lockdown people, aren't they so bad?' That's not to say they shouldn't riot... just that's how the system would try to use that momentum to their advantage.</p>
<p>Generally, I think if the system encourages and defends a form of protest (BLM riots) then it probably serves the system. If it relentlessly attacks anyone who questions the narrative and throws protesters in prison for decades for minor offenses (anti-lockdown protests, Jan 6 protest) then it probably doesn't. The cause of protesters on Jan 6 did not inherently serve the system, but ultimately their actions did the way I talked about in paragraph 2.</p>

        <p>Most frustrating part of this whole thing for me.  I didn’t want trumps warp speed virus, neither did my friends and family.  They all forgot that when Biden was elected and are now all fully vaccinated.  Trump was the one making the deals with big pharm
Pfizer and Moderna.  Trump was the one pushing the CDC and FDA to approve before the elections to save his presidency.  That vial is full of trumps vaccine, and all those ninnies got in line for it anyway.</p>

        <p>Makes sense to me that one should be skeptical of a politician’s bold claims in the months leading up to an election.</p>
<p>Y’all have to keep in mind the time periods in which these things happened. We were dealing with a White House that was attempting to seize control of the virus reporting, going so far as to mandate numbers go straight to the White House as opposed to the CDC. </p>
<p>Our president at the time took every opportunity to downplay the seriousness of the virus. </p>
<p>In August an unscrupulous business man and serial liar says, in between contradicting his own advisors on the very stage they shared, that a life saving vaccine will be ready as early as October. </p>
<p>Something very crucial would be happening within weeks of this made up delivery date.</p>
<p>To not be skeptical would be a tremendous failure of critical thinking. Hyuge.</p>

        <p>Sigh... I feel like All this shit is happening because the people left responsible are inexperienced and slackers despite their educational history. I also feel like the opposition is desperately cleaning on to the fantasy that there is a shadow organization. That is to say we would all rest more comfortable at night if we had the confirmation that this and all these horrible things were pulled by the strings of someone who is in control... but quite frankly the reality of the situation is it's just left up to random chance and chaos. There is no right and there is no wrong. There is no vaccine chip that is going to track you down and hunt you and study you for whatever, fucking bullshit. There's just a boring disease that could infect some people with a slight chance of mortality loss, and the people who accept paychecks to prevent this don't know and wanna play it safe to justify their paychecks. It's not a conspiracy it's not  planned That's just how fucking crazy and chaotic unplanned, unsafe and vulnerable we are as a nation, a people and a species. Stop looking for a deeper meaning because there's not one. You don't matter and never well. Hate to break it to you but there is no big brother looking out after you. I mean you suck and you're boring you know this right?</p>

        <p>Note the dates. Also note who was President on those dates. ALSO note how each President handled the pandemic. We had one guy who suggested killing it in humans with BLEACH and the other who...DIDN'T, and that's the one who actually rolled out a vaccine! So are you really SURPRISED people trust the vaccine more now than they would've???</p>

        <p>Nice backflip on your stats bud.</p>
<p>Setting aside India and China are withholding accurate rates of infection, the reason the death tole isn't 75 million is because of masks and quarantine, hate to break it to you.</p>
<p>Why are you talking if you don't give a fuck about life mate?  4 fucking million people you sociopath..</p>
<p>Also, as you err on the side of ignorance, some of those that survive are left with irreparable conditions.  As you don't know, its a respiratory illness, which effects the whole body and like-conditioned illnesses.</p>

        <p>Right because there’s no other way we could have prevented covid other than fucking the economy and forcing the healthy to stay inside….</p>
<p>Lmao buddy your virtue signalling is so cringe idk why you even bother coming to this sub. I suppose you constantly masked up every flu season and fearfully worried about cancer and heart disease deaths as well before covid? Seeing as how both kill majority of people worldwide a year……</p>
<p>Covid isn’t polio….. it’s a flu….  A flu like respiratory virus with a 99.8% survival rate is not deadly mate….. Ebola is deadly for fucks sake</p>
<p>In the span of one year during these lockdowns that were supposed to save lives and slow the spread we’ve seen..... Police brutality; deaths from vaccines; lockdown side effects including but not limited to suicide, delayed cancer treatment, substance abuse, domestic violence, depression, and dehumanization; the destruction of livelihoods and global supply chains; censorship; corporate consolidation and conflicts of interest.  All that shit happened....... in one year. </p>
<p>If you advocated for the lockdowns then you supported the Rich becoming richer while the middle/ poor class suffered. Yet I am the one who’s an Ignorant asshole? Lol buddy take a good fucking look in the mirror because people like me never asked for any of this is happen. We aren’t the problem…..</p>

        <p>I'm sure the TopMinds of NoNewNormal have brainstormed a totally foolproof plan with all that hindsight going around.</p>
<p>And do you know that there are cultures that wore masks when sick before Covid hit?  Holy smokes, much wow.</p>
<p>I got recently virtue signalled by a guy that said "death is a part of life", you won't believe.  </p>
<p>Mate if you didn't start by thinking the government should've supplied foods and provisions in the wake of a disaster you're on the wrong foot.<br>
Do you know how long a Store owned by a Corp. can survive if they used the money theyre earning?  You also won't believe.  How much can rent and stock be?</p>
<p>The infection number is still in the millions, the fuck, guy.</p>

        <p>Oh really how many cases are confirmed covid cases? Are the PCR tests accurate now all of the sudden? Still doesn’t change the survival rate though so…… </p>
<p>Did you know there are countries who had no mask mandates or vaccines and still had very low infection rates ? Wow magic…</p>
<p>You are part of the problem in this country, thinking it’s all “anti vaxers” faults while in meantime bootlicking the elite completely oblivious to the fact that the reason we’re still in this mess is because you comply….. (read that part again)</p>
<p>Anyways at this point you’re just blabbing on nonsense because you have no argument and can’t counter any of my previous statements…… You can have the last reply though, I can tell you need a win in your life champ 😉</p>

        <p>Yes indeed, you re right. In February and March 2020, i thought covid was something dangerous and serious. In April and May i started to have doubts. In Jun I was convinced it's all a hoax. When they started to talk about vaccines and vaccine passports last year (pretending this would never become mandatory), i knew it was a global scam. My mind changed also :)</p>
