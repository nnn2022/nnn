    <strong>Risk Assessment Madness in the Age of ‘Rona.</strong>
    <p><p>A few days ago, at the weekend, I found myself in a situation that still to this day, absolutely boggles my mind. So I thought I’d share a bit of humour. </p>
<p>I live in a small village in the UK, I’ve been at my current house for around 3 years with my Partner. Our neighbours moved in around 2 years ago, and they’re amazing. They truly are probably the best neighbours I could imagine having. They’re a bit older than us but they’ve got a great sense of humour and they’re always really helpful.
Currently, they are isolating due to a positive PCR test, no symptoms as far as I know (shock right?)</p>
<p>Anyway, on the weekend I was working in the garage, grinding a few welds away from a beer keg that I use for home brewing / distilling, and it occurred to me that it was quite loud. 
We’ve got a little WhatsApp group so I messaged them checking in, they said they were more than fine with it and suggested I moved outside to protect my ears (very wise, this is advice I followed)
After a while I became a little more conscious about the damage I was doing to my ears. </p>
<p>I asked them if they had any ear defenders I could borrow, to which they referred to being the “germ house” at the minute so probably not wise. 
I didn’t want to force the point with them of course, they’ve been more than helpful and aren’t obligated to do anything for me.</p>
<p>So, I carried on, in shorts and canvas shoes, with a beer keg between my legs, using an unguarded angle grinder.</p>
<p>But at least I won’t risk the big bad ‘rona hey?!</p></p>

        <p>Just sounds like good people who have never spent more than a minute researching the so called pandemic. When they start wanting your rights taken away or avoiding you because you might asymptomatically spread it to them, then it's time to complain.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s that deep to be fair to them. In general I think they’re just trying to do whatever they think is right, but the irony of me being in a fairly dangerous situation was clearly completely lost on them!</p>
<p>For me I think it highlights the power of fear and a collective blind-ness to anything outside of the “Vid”</p>

        <p>The vast majority of people have been brainwashed to think that healthcare is beyond our control. That eventually we will get old, disabled, and probably develop cancer and/or some kind of mental disease and there's nothing we can do about it. This can't be farther from the truth because our health is mostly in our own hands in this modern society (avoiding things like microplastics, pesticides, air pollutants, and so on is extremely difficult, but what's responsible for the vast majority of our health problems, food and lifestyle, is within our control). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jp2nrr/prolonged_fasting_with_healthy_diet_the/">Shameless plug</a>.</p>
<p>So it's not surprising that they, like most people, would see their health from a pathogen to be beyond their control, and see you doing metalwork and knowing you can take safety measures and have a reasonable expectation of safety to be within your control and thus nothing to worry about. Like people freaking out if you touch a wild animal because of diseases, but driving a car on the freeway at 70mph is perfectly fine.</p>

        <p>That’s a really good point to be fair. </p>
<p>I did appreciate that I could have been doing more and was taking risks that were perhaps not warranted, but the irony made me chuckle nonetheless!</p>
