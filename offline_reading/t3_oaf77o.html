        <p>I'm sorry my friend. Do you live in Brussels? My brother here in California is faced with losing his public school teaching job or taking the jab. The evidence is growing that these experimental injections are not safe, but our authorities are coercing us all to take them. </p>
<p>The article is full of double-speak from the health authorities.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can force anyone to be vaccinated, but we can force people who are in contact with the sick to be vaccinated. This does not seem to me to be problematic from an ethical point of view."</p>
<p>He means he doesn't think they can force EVERYONE to be vaccinated. But at least they can force care workers to take it.</p>
<p>"These results do not surprise me. It’s shocking that some health care staff don’t want to be vaccinated at the moment in certain health care facilities.”</p>
<p>Not surprised but shocked? Which is it?</p>

        <p>Australia just implemented mandatory vaccines for aged care workers. Now they want to implement mandatory vaccines for everyone more or less. Media, government, and people on reddit screaming at people to get the vaccine. They think this is way out of all this. They will be in for a shock when we are still locked down 2 years later. </p>
<p>The government told us yesterday that if 80% of people aren't vaccinated then we are not even having a conversation about opening up our borders. And people nodded their heads.</p>

        <p>Canada province, Manitoba is paying employers up to $5000 per employee who vaccinates as part of their 'recovery plan' though to me it is incentive to FORCE people to VACCINATE.</p>
<p><strong>PROVINCE LAUNCHES NEW $30 MILLION HEALTHY HIRE MANITOBA PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p><em>Under the Healthy Hire Manitoba Program, local employers can apply for up to $50,000 in provincial support to help cover the wages of new employees who can attest they have been vaccinated or will be vaccinated. (</em><strong><em>$5,000 per employee</em></strong><em>)</em></p>
<p>$5000 / 3 months pay = $1666.66 / 160 (FT) = $10.416 per hour, about minimum wage.</p>
