        <p>But they can't do either.  But, feel free to prove me wrong.  I've been inside a tear gas chamber in boot camp without a mask.  I know its effects.  So if anyone wants to prove to me that masks work, put on a cloth or disposable surgical mask and step into a tear gas chamber.  We'll see if you can speak full sentences after standing in place for 1 minute.</p>

        <p>Knowing how the effects of tear gas, the mask would make it worse. Coughing, crying, vomiting right on to the mask. Plus The tear gas would stick to the cloth of the mask once dampened creating a worse environment 30 seconds in.</p>

        <p>Just as masks made influenza worse in 1918.  Everyone wore masks and Dr. Fauci's paper on that outbreak concluded that most of the 650,000 Americans who died did so because of a bacterial pneumonia rather than influenza.  The flu weakened everyone's immune system and the masks caused an infection that people couldn't fight off after winning the war against influenza.</p>
<p>https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic</p>
<p>Before some troll fact checks me, Fauci didn't attribute bacterial pneumonia to the masks.  But, as far as I'm concerned, the link is obvious.</p>

        <p>I guess this is your go to response when people ask you to wear a mask, huh? whatever. I spent 20 minutes typing this all out, I might as well post it on a few of your comments.</p>
<p>Here are four studies, all from 2000 to 2020. Three of them predate Covid. One of them, the last one, is a meta study conducted in 2020. That means it analyses the results of other scientific studies. The other scientific studies were conducted before Covid, just not the meta analysis. </p>
<h3>Here's a study from 2015.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310104">Uptake and effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections at mass gatherings: a systematic review</a></p>
<p>This is a meta-study of many factors. One section talks about the effectiveness of facemasks against respiratory infections in mass gatherings.</p>
<p>&rt;[Of the] 13 studies [that] examined the effectiveness of facemasks [at mass gatherings], ... their pooled estimate <strong>revealed significant protectiveness against respiratory infections</strong></p>
<p>emphasis added.</p>
<p>The whole article is more complex than the single quote that I gave you. They study a lot of different factors. In most of the 13 studies referenced, the researchers were unable to make a statistically significant conclusion. But in the ones where a conclusion could be reached, it was that masks are effective.</p>
<h3>Here's another from 2008.</h3>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002618&amp;utm_campaign=Sonya%2C%20Supposedly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population</a></p>
<p>&rt;Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.</p>
<p>Again, it's slightly more complicated. But this one is a study instead of a meta-study.</p>
<h3>Another, from 2009</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/">Face Mask Use and Control of Respiratory Virus Transmission in Households</a></p>
<p>This one is about roommates wearing masks around the house in an effort to control virus spread during a normal flu season. The researchers admit mixed results, because participants didn't always wear the mask, or wear it correctly.</p>
<p>&rt;We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease.</p>
<p>But in households where participants wore the masks <em>correctly and consistently</em>, the masks were effective in controlling viral spread:</p>
<p>&rt;Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the relative risk of ILI [Influenza-Like Illness] in the mask use groups compared with the control group; however, &lt;50% of those in the mask use groups reported wearing masks most of the time. <strong>Adherence to mask use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ILI-associated infection</strong>. We concluded that household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI. <strong>If adherence were greater, mask use might reduce transmission during a severe influenza pandemic.</strong></p>
<p>Consistent and correct mask use reduces transmission risk. Most of their participants failed to adhere to mask protocols, and their incorrect mask use did not have a significant effect on transmission. If they had all worn their masks consistently and correctly, they might have reduced their risk.</p>
<h3>Another meta analysis, from 2020</h3>
<p>This meta analysis is from 2020, but it examines studies conducted before covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477893920302301">Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></p>
<p>&rt;A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. <strong>Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect</strong> ... Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) <strong>can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80%</strong>... **and 47%</p>
<p>emphasis added.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just wear a goddamn mask. There's no real scientific question that it is effective. The fact that people are still getting sick is literally <em>your fault</em> for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Boy, you are the very first one- The very first one!  To do what I asked.  and for that, I have to admit to some respect.  I challenged you and you responded and responded well!</p>
<p>I'll have to spend a lot of time on these studies to formulate a response- there's a LOT of information in there and I'll go through it when I have adequate time.  But for now, thank you.</p>

<p>I don't know how you put on 1 mask, but i usually put it on my mouth, not my eyes</p>
<p>And i know they don't protect against things like teargas, but corona isn't teargas</p>
<p>If you sneeze on someone's mask, less of the sneeze-snot-things will get trough the mask to that person</p>

        <p>I have.  I've looked for them.  But I'm not going to wear a mask until I see proof that they will protect me from something very deadly... but there also has to be something very deadly.  The flu and covid aren't dangerous.  I've had them both.  I don't fear them.  I've traveled the world without a mask multiple times.  Still not afraid.  I've been exposed to and vaccinated against viruses that most people never see or hear about and I'm still not afraid.  </p>
<p>So I'm not going to wear a mask.  My immune system is very strong and has been tempered by lots of exposure.  So I have no need to wear a mask.... ever.</p>

<p>If you didn't wear a mask each and every flu season before 2020, your defense of everyone in the world doesn't hold much weight.</p>

        <p>I guess this is your go-to response when people ask you to wear a mask, huh? whatever. I spent 20 minutes typing this all out, I might as well post it on a few of your comments.</p>
<p>Here are four studies, all from 2000 to 2020. Three of them predate Covid. One of them, the last one, is a meta study conducted in 2020. That means it analyses the results of other scientific studies. The other scientific studies were conducted before Covid, just not the meta analysis. </p>
<h3>Here's a study from 2015.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310104">Uptake and effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections at mass gatherings: a systematic review</a></p>
<p>This is a meta-study of many factors. One section talks about the effectiveness of facemasks against respiratory infections in mass gatherings.</p>
<p>&rt;[Of the] 13 studies [that] examined the effectiveness of facemasks [at mass gatherings], ... their pooled estimate <strong>revealed significant protectiveness against respiratory infections</strong></p>
<p>emphasis added.</p>
<p>The whole article is more complex than the single quote that I gave you. They study a lot of different factors. In most of the 13 studies referenced, the researchers were unable to make a statistically significant conclusion. But in the ones where a conclusion could be reached, it was that masks are effective.</p>
<h3>Here's another from 2008.</h3>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002618&amp;utm_campaign=Sonya%2C%20Supposedly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population</a></p>
<p>&rt;Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.</p>
<p>Again, it's slightly more complicated. But this one is a study instead of a meta-study.</p>
<h3>Another, from 2009</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/">Face Mask Use and Control of Respiratory Virus Transmission in Households</a></p>
<p>This one is about roommates wearing masks around the house in an effort to control virus spread during a normal flu season. The researchers admit mixed results, because participants didn't always wear the mask, or wear it correctly.</p>
<p>&rt;We concluded that household use of face masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective for controlling seasonal respiratory disease.</p>
<p>But in households where participants wore the masks <em>correctly and consistently</em>, the masks were effective in controlling viral spread:</p>
<p>&rt;Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the relative risk of ILI [Influenza-Like Illness] in the mask use groups compared with the control group; however, &lt;50% of those in the mask use groups reported wearing masks most of the time. <strong>Adherence to mask use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ILI-associated infection</strong>. We concluded that household use of masks is associated with low adherence and is ineffective in controlling seasonal ILI. <strong>If adherence were greater, mask use might reduce transmission during a severe influenza pandemic.</strong></p>
<p>Consistent and correct mask use reduces transmission risk. Most of their participants failed to adhere to mask protocols, and their incorrect mask use did not have a significant effect on transmission. If they had all worn their masks consistently and correctly, they might have reduced their risk.</p>
<h3>Another meta analysis, from 2020</h3>
<p>This meta analysis is from 2020, but it examines studies conducted before covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477893920302301">Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></p>
<p>&rt;A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. <strong>Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect</strong> ... Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) <strong>can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80%</strong>... **and 47%</p>
<p>emphasis added.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just wear a goddamn mask. There's no real scientific question that it is effective. The fact that people are still getting sick is literally <em>your fault</em> for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Yes, maybe that’s true. However, constant mask use is not healthy. Especially on children. If you are a healthy person there is absolutely no reason you should be FORCED to wear a mask. </p>
<p>I really don’t understand why everyone is so afraid of germs and bacteria. We literally need them to survive. Masks, gloves, hand sanitizers, are doing more harm than good. If this was about health then the #1 topic would be how you could be boosting your immune systems and not suppressing it by mask wearing. Everyone needs to start holding themselves accountable as to why they are sick or the shape their health is in and stop placing blame on those of us who make our own health a priority. </p>
<p>When the ‘pandemic’ first started and people were running mad to the grocery stores, guess what was out of stock first. Frozen pizzas. That. Is. A. Huge. Problem.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is like putting a bandaid on a broken arm. Or however that saying goes.. That’s how I see it.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Gas is permeable through many types of material, but when it comes to a liquid or excretion like spit, snot, etc. it can at least catch it from contacting the body directly. It's up to the user to decide when to properly dispose of a contaminated one, and it can be contaminated far less if both people in an interaction have one on, that way others around aren't receiving any contaminants if they are maintained by a mask.</p>
