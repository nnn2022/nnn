    <strong>I'm not getting a vaccine because "safe" pharmaceutical injection almost killed me and made me sick for 2 years</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sharing this story again because I'm speaking from personal experience. In 2018 I had a minor skin allergy and therefore received a hydrocortisone injection from a doctor. This is a corticosteroid drug used to suppress immune reactions. I'm not exaggerating when I say that within hours it felt like I was fighting for my life. I couldn't breathe and it felt like my entire body was shutting down, it sent my body into shock.</p>
<p>It continued the next day and it was hellish. Two days after the injection these side effects started to an extreme degree:</p>
<p>Painful pressure in bones of back, knees, hips, fingers, jaw and face, Non-stop adrenaline, unable to sleep, pain in brain, dizziness, swelling of my face (round face), weight gain, muscle weakness, thin skin, slow wound healing, difficulty breathing, fast heart rate, pressure in chest, hypertension</p>
<p>This continued for over TWO YEARS. All doctors treated me like I was crazy because while these are known side effects of corticosteroids, they didn't believe it was possible that a single injection could cause this. They diagnosed me with "psychosis". The worst was non-stop pressure in my bones, it felt like my bones were being crushed from within. The first doctor to take me seriously was an osteopath that did DEXA scans of my spine and found massive bone loss in a short time. How much? -16% loss of bone mass in 9 months. Here are the scans</p>

<p>So I have some type of hypersensitivity to this drug which means that while it might be safe for most people, the cells of my body are much more sensitive so one injection is like receiving 100 injections. The side effects get weaker each month, and now it's nothing compared to those first few months. After this experience I will never take a medication again unless it's a life or death situation, I trust nobody.</p>
<p>All I take now is lots of vitamins and natural supplements. If this happens to anyone else who reads this in the future you should start taking activated charcoal, a few tablespoons per day mixed in a glass of water. It helps detox and remove drugs from the system quicker.</p></p>

        <p>I have gone through similar situations which have shaken my faith in the healthcare system. People who have yet to be in a situation like this will have a rude awakening should they every experience any side effects from the vaccine. The terror of being completely hopeless with nowhere to turn, the last resort of a hospital not really knowing what to do.</p>
<p>It's ironic in the sense that it's very similar to covid. If you're the 1% that gets a strange reaction you're simply dismissed because it's uncommon enough that it doesn't even cross a doctor's mind.</p>

        <p>Remember someone has to be the statistic.  It’s up to you to choose where you want to place that risk (in getting Covid and risking small chances of severe illness or in taking a vaccine and risking side effects).  That’s what informed consent is.</p>
<p>Personally I will not be taking the vaccine as I’m young and I have less of a chance of severe illness than vaccine reaction.</p>
<p>Also-I’m another walking statistic.  I almost died from internal bleeding after a simple outpatient procedure (and like OP, doctors didn’t believe me until I literally lost consciousness from blood loss-it was internal so you couldn’t “see” it and it pooled against my diaphragm).  It was a 1:3,000,000  chance side effect.  If something isn’t “right” keep pushing until someone takes you seriously.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. This is important to hear. Most never question whether the medical <em>industry</em> is on their side. It is not. But stories like your own empower others who may have been silenced by that same industry not to share their own, and caused others to question what they are told. Thank you! This takes bravery and strength. 💓</p>

        <p>Well I'm taking tons of different supplements to help my bones. Something that gives me hope is that all the studies I've read about this condition (Cushing Syndrome) say that bone density and size almost fully recover after cure, though the process can take up to ten years.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for all your symptoms but I’m not sure I understand the connection here. Hydrocortisone is a drug that we have a pretty good understanding, is very cheap, and does a lot of good things in the right context. You had a very unfortunate, rare reaction to it, and that is difficult. That said, I don’t see how a bad reaction to a generic medicine should make you swear off the rest of medicine altogether.</p>

        <p>I know that hydrocortisone and vaccines are not related. The point is that hydrocortisone is listed by the FDA as safe, when it almost killed me and literally caused all the bones in my body to start breaking down. When they list a drug as safe they don't account for rare reactions that no one can explain.</p>

        <p>No drug is completely free of risk, and every doctor will tell you that. Ask people on HIV medications whether the side effects are difficult and you’ll get a resounding answer.

        <p>Direct kickbacks are illegal and you are free to look up your individual doctor’s gifts thanks to the Sunshine Act. The majority of doctors are simply not getting that, especially at academic centers. Plus, in this case the drug prescribed was a cheap steroid that been around for decades. Nobody is getting kickbacks on that</p>

        <p>I don't think doctors necessarily prescribe things at random or there would be plenty of deaths that couldn't be explained away. I do know over <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2016-09-27/the-danger-in-taking-prescribed-medications">100,000 deaths happen annually in the U.S. due to mis-prescribed drugs and adverse reactions</a>. That's pre covid so they're already not looking good.</p>
<p>I would be disturbed if an A.I. was assisting doctors and only considering pharmaceutical treatments.</p>
<p>It seems medical professional have indeed lost their common sense. I took my step father to get his test results on his kidney infection. The staff was so concerned over covid they failed to see his obvious hypoxia and advise him to remove his mask. The stand in physician couldn't read his chart and kept asking why we were there even though we had told him 5 times to be exact, we were there for his test results and a prescription for more pain medication. We decided to wait for his actual Dr. who was able to help, thankfully.</p>
<p>Then there is my mom who had surgery to remove gall bladder stones around Christmas. She had over 500. They didn't give her an IV after surgery which nearly killed her and severely slowed her recovery. Me and the wife canceled Christmas with the in-laws to take care of her. If we hadn't I'm sure she would have died because that's when my step dad went down with his kidney infection and could not have taken care of her.</p>
<p>honestly I would stay away from any medical facility right now unless it was serious, and even then you're rolling the dice.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Did they determine where the fluid went? Hypovolemic shock means you’ve lost 20% of your blood volume - which usually means you have bled out somewhere or you have had severe vomiting/diarrhea for a long time.</p>

        <p>There was no vomiting or diarrhea. The doctors had no interest when I told them I was having severe side effects since the injection, because it's "safe". The only test they did showed my potassium and sodium being off, also abnormally low levels related to white blood cell count. I remember being completely dried out and my skin couldn't produce any sweat. I could barely breathe until I got the IV fluid replacement, I was getting weaker and felt like my body was shutting down and I was going to lose consciousness. It felt like I couldn't get any air in my lungs, my breaths were very shallow. I also couldn't control my urine flow. Now I know that the symptoms I had match adrenal crisis, which can be caused by a corticosteroid injection and causes hypovolemic shock.</p>

        <p>So are you saying that you had hypovolemic shock? Or did the doctors? </p>
<p>The way that adrenal crisis causes hypovolemic shock is by causing copious amounts of vomiting and/or diarrhea, and the fluid volume loss causes the shock.</p>

        <p>Extreme dehydration can also cause hypovolemic shock and adrenal crisis messes up the electrolyte balance. I know that not because I read it somewhere, but because I was in that situation. If you think I'm making the symptoms up then here you go</p>

<p>I can't say for sure that it was hypovolemic shock, all I know is that I felt sicker than I've ever felt in my life and could barely breathe and was extremely dehydrated regardless of how much water I drank until I got the IV fluid replacement, which I got the day of of the injection and multiple times the next day. In between each IV treatment it got progressively harder to breathe.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying you are making up the symptoms. I 100% believe that the steroid triggered something in you and caused what you experienced. </p>
<p>I am disagreeing with you adding diagnoses to it that don’t make sense. Yes, extreme dehydration cause hypovolemic shock but extreme dehydration means that you have lost litres of fluid. </p>
<p>You needed fluid, yes. It made you feel better, yes. Usually what happens is that if you have an extreme reaction like that your blood pressure drops, and electrolytes get out of balance, and your body has a higher need for fluid to correct it. </p>
<p>Your (incorrect) assumptions IMO:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you had an adrenal crisis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you had hypovolemic shock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it was because the steroid was an injection and other injections therefore will do the same </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of years ago I lost 80% of my heart function from a virus that gave the rest of my family a mild cold-type illness. It sucks, and I will be on heart meds for the rest of my life, and possibly need a transplant if it happens again. </p>
<p>Shit happens sometimes, and sometimes it is unavoidable. I would bet though that what you need to be concerned about is related to steroids, not injections. If you had a vitamin B12 injection for example, or a flu shot I’d bet $1k you wouldn’t have that reaction.</p>

        <p>Yes it felt like low blood pressure and my body wasn't getting oxygen because I could barely breathe. I said it could be hypovolemic shock because I was also extremely dehydrated and couldn't produce any sweat with messed up potassium and sodium on a blood test. Are you saying that extreme dehydration can not cause enough fluid loss for hypovolemic state within a day? My body was not in a normal state where I simply was dehydrated from not drinking enough water. It was not a mild case, this drug caused total chaos in my body.</p>

        <p>Extreme dehydration doesn’t CAUSE fluid loss. Extreme dehydration is the state where you have LOST a lot of fluid and been unable to replenish it. </p>
<p>But to get to extreme dehydration, the fluid needs to have gone somewhere - either bleeding profusely, vomiting and/or having diarrhea profusely, sweating very profusely, or having nothing to drink for days. </p>
<p>Your body needed more fluid because of the reaction, and you were likely taking in less because of the symptoms. </p>
<p>But unless you LOST a significant volume of fluid somehow or had nothing to drink for days you didn’t have “extreme dehydration” either.</p>
<p>You had a significant reaction to the steroid. It triggered something that likely caused the bone loss. In the immediate short term you needed more fluids to help your body and you got them.</p>
