        <p>Yupp. Its ultimatively about compliance and obedience.</p>
<p>But it also does a great job at teaching people not to think for themselves. It creates an environment where you have to do illogical things constantly. So you are forced to either believe you yourself must be too stupid to undertstand the wise ways of your experts. Or you may acknowledge the fact that it is illogical but act against all your instincts and still do it.</p>
<p>I once read a piece on how the insane storys about Kim Jong-Il affect the minds of those who are to repeat those storys. The idea was that having your servants repeat storys they knew would be impossible. But because everyone kept saying them, it creates an atmospehre of helplessness. You know its wrong, but everyone says it, so you say it to. The idea was, the more unbelievable the story, the stronger its effect.</p>

        <p>Don't forget apathy. You see nonsense, but forced to live with it every day, and under demoncracy or totalitarianism (similar for this situation) being an ant against the collective. So, you stop caring, and focus entirely on career and consumerism that are malleable and accessible, diminishing any remaining focus about political power and events.</p>
<p>There is often around 50% of those who don't vote. There are Chinese citizens living prosperously and happily, obviously paying 0 (zero) attention to their party,</p>

        <p>This is it, for me. </p>
<p>I don't care if I have to wear the mask, or stand 6 feet apart or whatever. I'm just trying to sustain my life. If they're gunna not let me shop if I don't wear the mask, I'm just gunna wear it cause I need groceries. </p>
<p>I gotta answer a questionnaire every day at work? Fine, I need money, don't care.</p>
<p>The more I pay attention to politics, the more apparent it is that I can't do anything about it. Any actual influence I could have needs such a massive diversion from my current life path and a perfect storm of supporting circumstances, that I'd need to risk everything I have for a CHANCE of change. </p>
<p>So I don't even pay attention to the politics now. I vote, but I don't think it matters. I'll still vote, but whatever. </p>
<p>Since I stopped caring, life is more enjoyable. Great lol.</p>

        <p>Its not about safety its about controll</p>
<p>I also believe that it's no one single thing.. there's multiple reasons all combining together..</p>
<p>One of the reasons was that they wanted to crash the economy to hurt trump. In 2017 they admitted it on live TV on Bill mahers show thatt the goal was to cause a recession</p>

        <p>This is it, all part of the biggest psy-op in history. It debases people. Making people comply with “mandates” they know don’t make any sense, but they go along to get along, it’s a psychological abuse. </p>
<p>Related: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” – Edmund Burke</p>
<p>It appears there aren’t enough good men left, or they aren’t willing to fight.</p>
<p>Also related, for the more religious:</p>
<p>If you falter in a time of trouble,
how small is your strength!
Rescue those being led away to death;
hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,”
does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?
Does not he who guards your life know it?
Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?</p>
<p>Proverbs 24: 10-12</p>

        <p>The word of God is not religion, its a personal relationship between God and creation. By you saying the word of God is religion like you just did, is like admitting to vaxxing because it will make all of this go away and going back to normality which wont happen. You CAN'T accept the definition that the world has given the word of God, we have to keep it excluded from any definition or category humanity can ever give it.</p>

<p>I believe this might be true to some extent but if I went on talking about this point it would roll more into the book of Revelations &amp; prophecies, I think all of this is headed that way.</p>

<p>Rules are openly inconsistent and illogical. Their point is not to accomplish something, it's to remind you that <em>they</em> tell you what do do and <em>you</em> do it, otherwise you get the hose.</p>
<p>Propaganda doesn't aim at changing public opinion, it aims at demoralizing. The state is all knowing and all powerful, and you can't do anything to change that. They tell you everyone agrees, everyone knows that it's not the case, but you still need to smile and nod, or you get the hose.</p>

        <p>Indeed. And it also won't. According to the most accurate pollster I am aware of, Richard Baris, most Americans agree on "kitchen table" issues at a rate of between 62% and 85%. He went through a long list of things they agree on. But the point is, the propaganda is desperately trying to tell us we all agree with the government, and it ISN'T working.</p>
<p>The internet has set mankind free. This is why all the authoritarian states that are suffering resistance are shutting down or restricting internet, but even that doesn't work because there are too many access points to shut down unless you shut it down for the entire country at once.</p>
<p>And if they shut it down entirely, the people who are kept pacified by their ability to vent online will lose their outlet, the hope for help from outside will disappear, and the people who are currently in a state of minor rebellion will feel like they are well and truly up against the wall. It risks immediate revolution, to shut down internet. It won't always happen, naturally, it just is more likely to spark it than leaving it on is.</p>
<p>We need to wait another thirty to fifty years for the internet to finish its job, and during that time we have to continue resisting the technocratic and fascistic elements of society that want to re-centralize power into the hands of government. We have to resist their resistance to the internet. Near-instant universal communication can and will shatter the ability to hold power by means other than naked force and deception, and deception is becoming ever more impossible too.</p>
<p>We have to keep up ourselves, first, and ride out the tyranny, and resist it when it comes. A better future awaits if only we can continue to leech off the power the governments of the world have aggregated, bit by bit.</p>

        <p>Good comment but think you're too optimistic if you think we have 30-50 years to let the internet do it's thing.</p>
<p>We cannot communicate freely online even today.</p>
<p>Censorship is off the charts thanks to COVID. But its hard to know censorship is happening unless you have tools to watch for it. So most people are misled into thinking our speech is still free.</p>

        <p>I can understand why you think that way. Really, I do. Censorship seems rampant and connections are being cut off all the time. However, consider: Those connections were enabled by the internet in the first place, and each time a given connection is cut off, thousands of alternatives yet remain for that individual. Further, the very fact that you were cut off is itself the spur that causes you to want to take action to fix it so that can't happen, which causes many actors out there to create their own social media companies, or to support or shill for existing companies with better policy, and yet further spurs people to engage in activism to fix the problem. There are now even entire countries changing their laws explicitly to prevent tech companies from doing this, levying things like fines in ridiculously high amounts and on a per day basis if a company does something like this.</p>
<p>In the aggregate and over the long term, censorship is decreasing every single year. Consider what it was like when the FCC was the biggest concern, and they ruled over what could be said on radio and tv. How much possible content that could be made was objectively stamped out by the censors? It was much, much more, I tell you.</p>
<p>The problem of today is less the QUANTITY of censorship, and more the TYPE, if you ask me. That is to say, power is being wielded to censor on purely partisan or ideological grounds, but the actual amount of censoring is decreasing. Instead, because of the partisanship, it is both more impactful and more dangerous, and this is creating the ongoing backlash that I believe will play out over the rest of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, that's just my opinion. :)</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply.  I would love to know on what matters we all agree on.  Will look up Baris.</p>
<p>I don't think the internet is liberating or freeing us.  People were opting out of "live" things even before Covid and there was a push to try to do things in-person so as to counter the trend.  I think the internet connects us over long distances and separates us over shorter ones.</p>
<p>But worse than that is the censorship.  Because even now freedom of the press is still limited to those who own one.  The difference is that it's a lot easier to "own" one.  At least in theory,  until you realize your website (press) is owned by the people who control your platform and servers.  You can build something for years and then piss off the wrong set and lose it all overnight.  Reddit has had a number of purged subs in the last couple of years that prove exactly this.  And that's just Reddit.</p>

        <p>To look up my source RE what Baris said, check out his Youtube channel The People's Pundit Daily, or his locals. I forget the locals address, but it includes the people's pundit in it so should be easily found with a search engine. I believe it was three weeks ago that he covered his data on "kitchen table issues". I'm not sure which episode that was on his show, so you may have to dig in. He puts his data, often in chart form, up on the screen during episodes, so clicking around inside his episodes should be able to find it. You can also purchase copies of the polling data itself through joining the locals community, and there may be other ways tom access the data at the company website Big Data Poll. Good luck!</p>
<p>"I think the internet connects us over long distances and separates us over shorter ones"</p>
<p>This is really, really insightful. Agreed, there is a separation of local and distant going on in the current iteration of the web, I hadn't thought about that. Can I quote you on that? And what name would you want credit under if I do?</p>
<p>I address my ideas on the total quantity of censorship, and the type (and what that says about society and where it is going) above in my other comment to tangled night sleep; that response applies here too. </p>
<p>As to the idea that you can lose everything overnight, yes and no. It is true that your data is hosted under the dominating control of the business you contract with to host that data, and they can destroy everything they host with a flip of a switch. However, it is also the case that you can copy and store your data regularly, that you can set up your own servers not under their control with an investment cost, and that you also can contract with other individuals who are similarly evading their control by setting up their own servers. The data itself exists separately from the host. If one allows it to exist solely under the control of that host, one is taking an enormous risk with their livelihood.</p>
<p>What we are facing at this time in the fight against the centralizing forces is a crisis in TRUST; specifically, centralization leads to abuse of power, by definition, and abuse of power destroys trust. To my way of thinking, this crisis of trust is actually good for society, because we were too trusting in the first place, which led to the allowance of centralization in the first place. The effect of censorship and centralizing attempts going on by the corporations and the government at this time is to reduce trust and to increase the urge to decentralization.</p>
<p>The advantage goes to decentralization when it comes to internet, because each individual physical device is itself a component of the web in a vast sense. The internet, as a technology, is inherently decentralized to begin with. Centralizing it in the first place is exceedingly difficult. Just look at how much still leaks out of China despite the attempt to make a single access point for the whole nation to route through to visit sites outside of the country. </p>
<p>Essentially, the very fact that we are all here, that we are all saying No New Normal, that is itself evidence that the backlash is a normal part of human nature that is responding to the push toward central control, and that is only occurring because the internet has been having the impact of reducing the central control. If it weren't, there'd be no need to push for more central control.</p>
<p>Consider how often various public figures are caught lying because of increased connectivity caused by the internet. For example, during his campaign Joseph Biden promised one group of voters he would end fracking and then promised those that do fracking that he would never end fracking. Politicians do this ALL THE TIME. They even fake accents of the locals when they speak to those locals, changing their accent based on who they are talking to. The fact that we catch them at it is much more now than ever before is due to increased connectivity.</p>
<p>Previous to this age, we all lived under a form of de facto censorship imposed by the nature of reality itself. That is to say, you could not be aware of things that happened somewhere else where you are not present. That form of natural censorship is being defeated by near-instant communication. The small segment of the internet that is now censored by the centralizers is a tiny fraction of the total communication we engage in on a regular basis, and that communication is expanding our awareness, our intelligence, and our moral inclinations to act.</p>
<p>What does the world look like if they keep this up? Can they even crack down on the internet hard enough TO actually keep us from seeing what they are doing? I don't think they CAN. They can't even get everyone to accept things like vaccinations. The internet has exposed how truly powerless the government is WITHOUT their using force. Not even China, the country that has done the most of all places on Earth to crack down on the use of the internet, has been able to make the Chinese people unaware of what is going on in the world. But that's another story for another day.</p>
<p>Do let me know your thoughts when you get a chance. Ciao for now.</p>

        <p>I don't care about being credited for that idea.  I'm sure I'm not the first to notice it.</p>
<p>You are correct that you can back up your data and have your own servers.  You can even use an archive website though that could also be purged.  It does seem like something for people who enjoy doing that sort of thing.  If you're not a techie and have ever had to set things up on-the-fly because of deplatforming, it's not a fun experience.  IMHO, at some point it all becomes a quality-of-life issue.  Is this what I want to do with my time here on Earth?  The answer is no.  More power to you if you can stand it, I guess.</p>
<p>I'm with you on decentralization.  The State (in the Marxian sense) loves it some good centralization, but so do all the other autocratic forms of government and even the more seemingly benign democracies.  Centralization is aided by technology as much as by human loyalty to its precepts and structures of enforcement.  But even so, distance is the natural enemy of centralization.  Centralization was probably the linchpin to the collapse of Soviet Russia.  Turns out non-local food production in a continent-sized country isn't such a good idea.  Famine after famine ensued and the rest is history.  Or so I've been told.  </p>
<p>But capitalism also gravitates towards centralization because of its intentional growth propensity and desire for "efficiency" (however brutal) and cost reduction.  Not that you can't have a lot of small and medium players all playing the game, but eventually they will be devoured (acquired) by the bigger fish who will also strive for cost reduction and streamlining and viola!  Centralization once again appears, trying to control everything and everyone in the interest of profit and everlasting, never-ending, unsustainable growth.</p>
<p>Decentralization, on the other hand, though not without its own shortcomings, is the basis for the autonomy of human communities of all <em>diverse</em> types.  It's like sunshine to vampiric hierarchies that cannot survive real empowerment in human beings.  And that's just in terms of human relations without necessarily factoring in the newer forms of communication.  I don't know much about these but, I wouldn't assume it cannot all be shut down by whim of a bureaucrat, legislation or sabotage.  In that case, I suspect well-organized but decentralized (which does not mean disorganized) communities would fare better.</p>
<p><em>"Previous to this age, we all lived under a form of de facto censorship imposed by the nature of reality itself. That is to say, you could not be aware of things that happened somewhere else where you are not present."</em></p>
<p>I've come to believe our priorities as a species have greatly changed since agriculture or since (and if) we were genetically engineered to be a slave-race for the "gods".  So once upon a time, we were stargazers with great psychic abilities and long telomeres.  So what you say is true in a very real, 3D, material sense.  But it's clear to me that we are not more "evolved" than our remotest ancestors whose historical records have been long lost, just shallower.  Just like it's clear to me that we only have "more" access to a <em>certain type</em> of information.  We are also not the first advanced, global civilization, just the current one in this <em>aeon</em>.  You are correct that without technology, starting with the wheel, we are much more limited in our current paradigm.</p>

        <p>I definitely agree that it is a quality of life problem. We shouldn't HAVE to use onerous alternatives to the existing easy options because of bias by people in the marketplace.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with you on capitalism. Capitalism is an economic system entailing the free exchange of goods and services in a market with few or no regulations. This does not lend itself well to centralization. It's efficiency is greatly reduced when you try.</p>
<p>What you are describing is corporatism, which is a political AND economic system entailing the fusion between the State and economic sectors divided up by the role that sector plays, with power in that sector centralized into one or just a few actors, which we refer to as corporations. Fun fact, this economic-political model is almost identical to the original form of Italian Fascism.</p>
<p>Capitalism can only become corporatism if the power of the state is used to interfere in the market, which enables a corporation which engages in anti-competitive behavior to stay in the market despite being out-competed. Would social media companies be so powerful today if they weren't given special protections and immunities, which they are not abusing to maximum effectiveness? Would Big Oil have been such a problem a generation ago if they weren't given special protections back then?</p>
<p>The IMO error in your thinking here is the presumption that if a company has a great deal of power and effectiveness now because of past success that it is guaranteed to have it in the future. Capitalism is completely agnostic to this process because that isn't an economic question at all. It's a political one. If your political system allows special privileges to special interest groups, this WILL cause corporatism to manifest, and that's what we are dealing with. But it didn't have to be. Have you ever heard of Medici Bank? The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A &amp; P)? How about Sears? Enron? Corporate giants can and will fall completely apart in a free market when a superior start up company comes along. They can even fall apart in a CONTROLLED market that is trying to keep them from falling apart.</p>
<p>I also don't agree that "never-ending growth" or "unsustainable growth" is a thing to be concerned about. That's not actually the case in any model, including the one under discussion. Indeed, if the growth truly is unsustainable, then it actually proves what I am saying right here, because the company that has unsustainable growth won't be sustained, and will collapse...unless someone intervenes, or they change their approach.</p>
<p>This leads us to the problem of price. If a corporation is doing something that cannot be sustained, that is reflected in the price. As they demand more scarce resources which have alternate uses, such as an oil company demanding a bigger share of petroleum, this demand drives up the price of that resource. The government can force a change in price by subsidizing the company, but this doesn't change the amount of oil that there is, and this comes at cost to other sectors of the economy because the funds to try to coerce this change came from the taxpayer, which manifests as rising prices for every other good in the economy - which includes the other goods the oil company needs to do its work. There is no getting around the fact that the definition of a price is "the current value of a limited resource as compared to every other limited resource in an economy". That value didn't change, and so this creates price distortions in the economy, resulting in damage to society.</p>
<p>Additionally, this interference has the effect of making the oil company feel secure, knowing they will be backed up if they fail, and productivity and efficiency then actually declines. So in the NAME of never ending growth and increasing efficiency, the actual growth and efficiency is REDUCED, because the company was failing and is now incentivized to fail HARDER.</p>
<p>Real growth requires non-intervention as much as possible, because we all make thousands of decisions based on price, and if prices distort due to the actions of others, we lose relative value in the form of currency on everything we do, denigrating the economy writ large.</p>
<p>Anyway. Yes, decentralization has drawbacks. The biggest one is (wait for it...) lack of communication! The one thing that has always kept human beings needing some level of advanced centralized structure through all of human history is the need to organize a large group to defend against another large group. In this time, in this place, we can now do that with a distributed structure! This is what I mean when I say it is forcing decentralizing on the government, and that is WHY the governments of the world are pushing so hard for centrality. </p>
<p>Let's say the government flips a switch and shuts off the internet. OK, what does that actually MEAN? What is the physical reality of it? Well, that means that physical wires or wireless transceivers have been set up to run through some sort of centralized location, such as an Internet service provider, and the connection has been cut at THAT point.</p>
<p>But wait...if that's all it is...that has a solution. You can string wires or set up transceivers yourself and re-establish connection. The physical reality of attempting to block all the decentralized connections is that you need total control over the populace to achieve that. It just isn't possible any more. It hasn't even been possible in China; there is a significant underground network of rebels against the Chinese, and they receive all kinds of foreign aid in the form of information and advice as well as some monetary support.</p>
<p>I'm not going to comment on the spiritual claims. I'm a realist, data type of guy. Your ideas might be right, might be not. *shrugs*</p>

        <p>It is in a logical state, but when you want to create chaos in order to gain power, the oxymoron is intentional. Release all the murderers from prison because we need to protect prisoners safe from this terrible, horrible, deadly virus (anarchy) while putting people in jail for awful crimes such as opening their business in order to earn money to feed their children (tyranny).</p>

        <p>The ruler is absent, in that they allow violent criminals to run free with no consequences. New York releases violent criminals same day, no bail, and they go right back out to commit more violent crimes. Seems to fit the definition of anarchy.</p>

        <p>Only reason the rollout was so effective was because of lockdowns. Word would have gotten around QUICK if we were still allowed to go to work or visit with our families in person when the rollout started.</p>
<p>Lockdowns didnt control the spread at all. But they are about to lock us down again anyways this winter. </p>
<p>If last lockdown was to keep us separated so we would grow desperate enough for a barely tested vaccine, then what will this next lockdown be about?</p>
<p>Prlly to keep folks from hearing about serious side efffects &amp; death. Which they're counting as COVID deaths, btw. Unbelievable.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree. That and the data consistency shitstorm that makes it impossible to accurately compare anything related to covid. That's how you end up with headlines like 99% unvaccinated in US hospitals, and 60% vaccinated in UK hospitals. It's complete and utter nonsense.</p>

        <p>yes. its a sociopath logic. ive seen that multiple times in the past with different humans. people that want to get away with something, keep your brain busy with nonsense. they hope (and it most of the time works) that you forget what you initially had in your mind.</p>
<p>they keep repeating the same method over and over again. its a take and give strategy, which keeps you busy, while in the background the plot thickens.</p>
<p>in short: winning time by confusing you. taking away your focus - just like a magician does. oh look there, a pink elephant - while i steal your wallet.</p>

It is starting to come out that the FBI was most likely directly involved in the planning and entrapment of the supposed Whitmer kidnap plot. The government has been illegally spying on Americans for decades and lying about it. The intelligence agencies lie in order to advance the interests of weapons manufacturers over the interests of the average citizen. The government shut down society and transferred trillions in wealth from the middle class to the billionaire class over a virus with a pathetic death rate. </p>
<p>Yes. The government is the enemy.</p>

        <p>That happened to me in a UK supermarket. I completely lost it with the woman enforcing it, because if we'd just lied and/or turned up a minute apart she'd never have known, so it was pointless.  We didn't know about their made up rules, and it was so petty and unreasonable. I've done customer service jobs in the past, and in situations like that you really just have to turn a blind eye.</p>

        <p>That's the added bonus of pandemic restrictions: they make it really hard to manage life with kids. They make it more stressful, expensive, and nerve-wracking. Work from home, no school or daycare or babysitters, limits on people in stores, make your toddler keep his mask on or get kicked off a flight, etc. </p>
<p>Make it hard enough, and parents will stop having more kids. And non-parents will decide to never have them at all. Woo hoo depopulation!</p>

        <p>The advice to the public hasn't been updated for months.  We know now that Covid is almost exclusively transmitted through aerosols.  That means that ventilation is the primary defense against transmission.  You have near immunity to being infected in almost all outdoor environments, even without a mask.  Also, you can't be infected with one inhalation of infected air - there's a temporal element that they ignore. </p>
<p>And what's so stupid about the masks in public is that the studies show they only have a tiny effect on public transmission, except in environments like beauty shops.  If they really wanted to stop transmission, they would tell people to wear masks when they enter their homes, NOT when they leave them.  Most transmissions are in homes.</p>
<p>The authorities aren't saying "Open windows".  "Use fans".  "Meet outside."  "Limit close conversations to under 10 minutes."  They're still saying "Wear a mask in public"  "Wash your hands".  It's like they got their programming in Kobol in 1980, and then all the Kobol programmers died or retired, so now they're perpetually unable to innovate new and appropriate advice.</p>

        <p>Good post. Their advice is completely inappropriate, you're right about that. Another example: Instead of telling people to stay healthy (the best defense against covid) they shutdown gyms. And tell people to "stay the fuck at home."</p>

        <p>Limiting crowding in shops. Looks fine on paper but it causes a huge crowd outside where people stand packed together. Yes, it's outside but because of lack of space, they need to pack together so they don't fill the street. Combine it with the one-way rule in some shops forcing everyone to spend double time inside. Well, honk honk, send out the clowns.</p>

        <p>Reminds me of the latest mandate from the Thai Immigration Department about visa renewals.</p>
<p>It used to be you could renew your visa up to a week before it expires.</p>
<p>Now, you can only renew it up to 3 days before because Immigration doesn't want to deal with 'congestion'.</p>
<p>Um...won't cramming the same number of people into 3 days instead of 7 cause more congestion?</p>

        <p>&rt;Why is there plastic on the payment keypad.</p>
<p>Because stupid people who work there kept spraying water based cleaners onto the keypads to clean them and broke several which are quite expensive to replace.  There are cleaning agents that could have been used instead but that would cost money and require them to find a supplier for such a product and get it passed through the bureaucratic process the company uses. </p>
<p>&rt;Why don't you pack the grocery bags anymore.</p>
<p>If you are talking about paper or plastic bags there is no logical reason.  If you are talking about reusable bags it is because people are filthy animals who don't wash the damn things.</p>
<p>Everything else is the illusion of safety and the control of behavior.</p>

        <p>Just because something is contagious doesn’t mean everyone must be infected, otherwise everyone in the world would currently be infected with cold/flu/chicken pox all at the same time. I agree we cannot practise bio lab level protocol, but don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. There are still measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the disease spreading, even if they aren’t 100% effective.</p>

        <p>It's all theater, and now that we are 19 months into it with no end in sight it seems to be in the service of some, other, shadowy and sinister agenda (or at least it has turned out to be that way). Also, the American left thrives on illogical stuff, so there is that. Perhaps the most illogical thing that has happened in my town, along with everything else this person lists, is the fact that our Health Stasi dot Gov just put in a strong-arm recommendation that even vaccinated people start wearing masks again, contradicting even the CDC's current advice and I'm sure depressing vaccination rates even further, which they bitch and moan about as it is.  It follows no deductive reasoning at all why they we do this. We ALL must be punished now for the un-vaccinated.  I keep thinking the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Most "epidemiologists" went into their particular field because they all had some inner-Nazi wanting to get out. Why this field attracts authoritarian, crazed hypochondriacs is really confusing to me. </li>
<li>The actual field of "public health" seems to basically be a mirage, and as far as I can tell anymore consists of capricious decisions, whole scale deception, and in the case of lockdowns criminal human rights violations that only benefit our WFH tech overlords.  When all is said and done (it may take decades to sort through all this) I hope the field is literally gutted and replaced with something far more human-centric.</li>

        <p>I've been reading about how it took the W.H.O. like a year to acknowledge that Covid could be passed through aerosol particles. </p>
<p>When you look at all their recommendations, it looks like the work of one or two sheltered and arrogant people who got their degrees in the 70s.  They eye-balled Covid, decided it must work exactly like a previous coronavirus that they thought they understood, and then proceeded to demand ridiculous levels of proof for a contradicting opinion, since they would lose face for ever being wrong.</p>
<p>Connections, not competence, seem to be the chief requirements for ascending the W.H.O.</p>

        <p>I honestly think one of the dumbest things we've ever done as a society is to put on a mask, walk 5 feet to your table at a restaurant, and take the mask off. In any other situation that would be like, sketch comedy levels of stupidity.</p>

        <p>I would definitely say the person's reading stuff in that's not meant to be read into - anyone who's ever worked in retail can tell you it's not "confused look, no words -" it's "trying to get rid of a difficult customer as quickly as possible, no words." </p>
<p>People who work in retail see hundreds of customers every day - they don't see you as important and they don't value what you have to say. They're not paid enough to care about what the customers have to say.</p>

        <p>They see hundreds of customers every day -it's not possible for every single one to be important. I got to say this seems to be a common theme on this sub - a lot of people on the sub seem to be kind of classist.
