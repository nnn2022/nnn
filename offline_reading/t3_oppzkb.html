    <strong>Scientism vs. reading the Science</strong>
    <p><p>I ask this as a healthy 18 year old male that has gotten symptomatic COVID and beat it with only a lack of taste and smell. In fact I ran a mile in the upper quartile time during COVID. </p>
<p>Looking at the Nature study and the one from the Cleveland Clinic natural immunity is just as good or better than the vaccines, moreso for younger people. However, any rational discourse for those with natural immunity still heavily pushes vaccination without any discussion of the actual numbers. </p>
<p>An example would by my comments on a r /news article. Sure people quote me the message that I still need the vaccine but they refuse to discuss real numbers. I suspect they would be forced to admit my overall risk (18, male, healthy, natural immunity) is something like .000003 or something. All they do is quote the advice instead of the data. </p>
<p>That is scientism vs. science. Just blind trust in whatever the person in the lab coat says instead of coming to ones own conclusion.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p></p>
