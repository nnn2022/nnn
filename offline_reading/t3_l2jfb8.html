    <strong>I've been thinking lately about just how much our world is going to be different from now on, even after COVID ends</strong>
    <p><p>Up until now, I've been more or less assuming that COVID problems will be more or less temporary. Everyone freaks out, all the lockdowns and mask mandates get implemented for 6 months to a year, death rates eventually start going down, and everything more or less goes back to normal with everyone complaining about the same stuff they did before. </p>
<p>However, seeing some of the pictures of how children are having to go to school and the effect COVID has had on economic indicators (wealth inequality, national debt, etc.) has made me realize that there are going to be significant alterations to society that are probably going to last for decades. There's probably going to be a whole generation of children that will struggle with mental issues and the like as they grow up. </p>
<p>Imagine being 5 or 6 years old when this whole thing started. Think about just how little knowledge you had about global events at that age. You were probably just going to school and growing up as normal. Then everything starts shutting down, you're sent home for the rest of the school year, you can't go to the park or do anything with other people, then after 6 months (which might as well be forever to a little kid), you start doing these things again, but you have to wear an uncomfortable mask everywhere, possibly for hours at a time with no end in sight. All the while, you have no idea what's going on besides some incomprehensible statements from the adults around you about some sickness that's going around. From your perspective, your life has been drastically altered for no reason that you can understand. </p>
<p>I think one can realize just how much this will affect young children, most of whom cannot really comprehend what is going on. The effects on adults are bad enough. We're probably going to see a massive uptick in teen/youth mental illness in the next 5, 10, 20 years. Think about the "weird kids" you went to school with, then imagine every kid at your school being like that. This is what we're probably going to be facing.</p>
<p>That's not even the worst part. Consider just how much wealth inequality has increased as a result of COVID. The political discussion surrounding this and similar topics was already abysmal to begin with. Can you imagine what it's going to be like in the future? Combine this with the rise in mental illness, the censorship which has been occurring, and you'll be left with a society where radical beliefs and political violence are the norm. The political scene will probably degenerate to that seen in third-world countries. The craziness surrounding the 2020 election and similar riots will become standard. Also keep in mind that higher wealth inequality is usually correlated with rising corruption. Authoritarianism, corruption, and centralization of power will increase like never before.</p>
<p>Also consider the probable economic ramifications of pumping trillions of dollars of stimulus money into an artificially-destroyed economy. We were already set for a recession before COVID hit, looking at just how low unemployment got compared to pre-Financial Crisis levels. Now, given Austrian Business Cycle theory, we're probably due for a Great Depression-level slump. The economy has recovered extremely quickly since COVID began and the lockdowns started ending. This isn't something you would expect from an economy on the brink of a recession (lockdowns would have triggered a multi-year slump) unless something fishy was going on. Since everyone was forced to go to work online, and the NASDAQ being at all-time highs compared to other indexes, it's very clear that the current economy is almost entirely centered around the technology sector. The lockdowns effectively acted as a stimulus measure, giving the technology industry the edge it needed to come back from likely collapse, taking the rest of the economy along with it. Big Tech is the column holding up the economy. Once the money runs out for these companies, however, we'll see a crash that will make every industry crash in the same way tech did after the .com bubble. We can see this already with millions of people starting to move away from big tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google. It's only a matter of time before this starts a chain reaction, bankrupting Big Tech companies in the same way Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went under, eventually affecting the entire economy. </p>
<p>Imagine what affect THAT would have on the political scene. </p>
<p>We're going to be dealing with the impact of COVID and restrictions for a long, long time.</p></p>

        <p>I like it how the keep telling us they will fix wealth inequality whilst destroying the only income the majority has and enriching the already obscenely wealthy.  </p>
<p>They are destroying it first so they can "build back better".</p>

        <p>Let me be clear: there's nothing inherently wrong about wealth inequality. It's actually a good thing, in that it provides the incentive people have to be productive, facilitates the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and allocates wealth in a way that produces the most utility. However, when the state artificially causes inequality to increase, that's when problems are created. The state can only acquire property through coercion. This means that any advantage given to the rich by the state (e.g. lockdowns, bailouts, easy money Fed policy, etc.) is necessarily going to harm anyone who's not the recipient of these benefits, leading to rising wealth inequality and a shrinking middle class. This has both economic and political impacts, as corruption goes up and radical (usually leftist) political sentiment rises.</p>

        <p>&rt; there's nothing inherently wrong about wealth inequality. It's actually a good thing, in that it provides the incentive people have to be productive, facilitates the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and allocates wealth in a way that produces the most utility.</p>
<p>While I agree with you that there is nothing inherently wrong with what you re describing I think that is idealism I don't think that we have ever seen moral wealth inequality in North America maybe before the federal reserve(read the creature from Jekyll Island) was created but still.</p>
<p>While I understand what you are saying by stating "it provides people the incentive to be productive" Do you think that this is the only thing that could provide society with such a mentality?</p>
<p>IF so isn't that cynicism even if it is a small amount and logical, Like I'm not a Marxist and I'm also not a capitalist I understand people need motivation for a society to succeed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But why does that motivation always have to come in the form of you can make more money or get a job or be homeless because isn't that really where capitalist motivation comes from in the end get a job or be on the street...</p>
<p>I just feel like there has to be a better way to motivate people in a society than we see in north America but Im also not a Marxist even though I think that everyone agrees with marxism a little bit even if they dont realize it and even if they don't want it this quote comes to mind</p>

        <p>Defo agree on the point about young kids. I just watched a tiktok of a guy taking his baby to the supermarket for the first time and soooo many comments were saying how they haven’t taken their young kids out in MONTHS</p>

        <p>We (meaning the mainstream) used a definition of 'survival' that was far too narrow. Combine the above with hyper-inflation; water crises; climate change (whether people in here think humans are causing it or not...), and desertification, we might really be facing a collapse this time.</p>
