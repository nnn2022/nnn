    <strong>A rant from a HS in the Northeast Senior</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to say that you guys are one of the only reasons I think I'm still sane, Legit being a former doomer myself it's been such a relief seeing others question the legitimacy of this bogus pandemic. Having my life completely whittled down to being in school 2 days a week while being muzzled, most of my family are mortified of this thing, and seeing just all the propaganda from my Governor and having so much shit taken has strained my mental health. I'm thankful that I've been able to work and i'm not stuck in one of the most restrictive states but it's still not as good as some of our other states., even though it seems like things are just getting worse. It's almost 2 separate realities. I work retail for good old Target, Seeing people muzzled screaming about how restaurants are going to kill us all meanwhile this weekend the store was packed to the brim with no distancing to be seen from the same people. I don't want to be brandished a hero working a minimum wage job just to earn some cash for my future. It just makes my head hurt seeing this clown world and trying to cope with the losses of freedom and individuality I've seen all around me. I've even personally had this retarded virus and had minor chest pain with a bad cough for 3 days, brother had a fever for 1 day and we all ended up fine! I wish I could do more but unfortunately I'm still constrained by doing more by my age, so I just wanted to say thank you to all in this sub still trying to get reason out there, you converted 1 guy and seeing how this sub has grown since I joined late spring, I still have a tiny little bit of hope left.</p></p>
