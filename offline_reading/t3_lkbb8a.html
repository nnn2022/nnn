    <strong>We will never surrender.</strong>
    <p><p>It is our right as human beings and people of the world that we are to be able to live, able to breathe, able to laugh and smile, able to co-exist and share, able to be free and to love one another, to visit family and friends, and to see to it that we are able to be the one thing we all want. </p>
<p>Freedom. </p>
<p>Doesn't matter what the men at the top say. What the news says. What the angry guy on the internet says. What the government says. You are free. We are free. As human beings it is our right to be free. As the children of tomorrow will see to it that our world is the one we are the leaders of their world. And I want it to be a free one. I won't let them ruin the life I have. The gift that was given from me from birth. I won't waste it.</p>
<p>So do things that make you smile, laugh, see your friends, go outside, focus your energy on positive and uplifting things, find a lover, and live your life to the fullest. Don't lose yourself in lockdown. We will never surrender the things that were already our right from birth. To be free. If they label me a crazy teen for simply being human, being normal, then so be it. </p>
<p>If it is criminal to be human in our society than it is those who lost their humanity who rule the world.</p></p>
