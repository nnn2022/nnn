    <strong>Ever notice how provaxxers will, over time, turn into antivaxxers, but never the other way around?</strong>
    <p><p>I've never seen an antivaxxer go, "you know what? That last jab I took really worked! I'm taking all my shots from here on out."</p>
<p>But you always see...</p>
<p>"I went partially blind after the Pfizer vaccine. And now I can't trust them with any more shots."</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>"I've been feeling like shit for few weeks since taking the shot. How long are these side effects supposed to last? I don't think I can handle the second shot."</p>
<p>Just as a few examples. It's like Neo taking the red pill in The Matrix. Once you've been personally affected by this bullshit, how can you ever go back to "trusting the science" again?</p></p>

        <p>Maybe you should be.</p>
<p>Think critically for a moment, you don't trust these people who have lied go you again and again and again with the COVID vaxx lies they tell. Why would you trust the same bodies and people when they tell you anything else.</p>
<p>Oh Timmy here has lied to me a million times about stealing my cookies, surely he's telling the truth though when he says he didn't eat my cake.</p>
<p>I'd also add, stop pussyfooting and giving them an inch. They have no right to inject anyone regardless what the reason is. You saying but we aren't antivaxxers will just be taken as you're right but.</p>

        <p>Yes. I actually have been vaccinated in the last year with the DTaP shot.</p>
<p>Two lessons: one, not anti vax. Two, combo vaccines suck and I'm never getting the DTaP shot again, it felt like I had a pool ball in my arm that throbbed pain for nearly six months until the knot broke up.</p>

        <p>The fda and pharma no longer make single vaccines for many things. They just recently approved a 6 in 1 for babies. In that trial BABIES DIED. And they STILL got it approved. Shit is about to get real ugly... it was already pretty gross and bad with pharma and their immunity. Buckle up. They got like 200+ vaccines waiting to be approved.</p>
<p>Edit to add- that those 6 in the 6 in 1 will not be available at all for individual shots. Parents will HAVE to get the 6 in 1 if they want anything to do with any of them.</p>

        <p>Yep. Infant vaccines are not about the well-being of infants at all, and the packed schedules are simply designed to ensure maximum compliance. It is statistically proven that combination vaccines and multiple vaccines administered on the same day trigger more adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Neither of my children are vaccinated and we're homeschooling, so they won't be vaccinated for school. The only big challenge now is enabling them to catch childhood illnesses like chicken pox (I went to a pox party as a kid). If we can't find anyone to share those diseases, we may have to opt for the vaccine eventually to prevent severe adult onset of those diseases.</p>

        <p>Look into germ theory vs terrain theory, there is no "catching" disease. You can look up work by Dr. Andrew Kaufman, Dr. Tom Cowan, Dr. Stefan Lanka, just to name a few. It's another level of the bullshit lies fed to us our whole lives</p>

        <p>Thanks for the resources, I'll check those out! Terrain theory sounds much more in line with traditional medical understanding that dates back thousands of years (a bit more credible track record than today's "scientific" studies conducted to make a profit).</p>

        <p>It’s all a scam! Vaccine conversation is a podcast that talks about all vaccines and the industry and the deeper you get the more disturbing the whole schedule is for vaccines…. We vaccinate babies for hep b on their first day of life… that’s transmitted via blood or body fluid, why does a newborn need a vaccine for essentially a sexually transmitted disease? On the first day of his or her life… that’s just the top of the ice berg.</p>

        <p>As a Brit seeing the vaccination schedule for American infants... is absolutely insane... And the cases of SIDS and general infant mortality is so much higher in the US... The Hep B one really got me for sure, it's so reckless.</p>

        <p>It’s disturbing for sure! The most disturbing part is that parents just do it because doctors tell them to. There is literally no education or research done on vaccines by 99% of parents. They are just supposed to get their babies vaccinated, so they do and their children suffer. Then the parents who actually educate themselves and choose to protect our kids are vilinized.</p>

        <p>For sure, I would've never had any scepticism towards 'normal' vaccines if it weren't for watching a certain notorious but heavily banned and censored documentary. Even if you want to know this information it's actually extremely difficult to find. I still think most of the vaccinations that are at least given to European children are a net positive, but it is shit there is no where to have an open, balanced, and transparent discussion about the scheduling, the need of some of them, the side-effects, the lack of victim compensation, or how huge a dosage some of these vaccines are for children...</p>

        <p>That documentary was a game changer for me. I had already been leaning towards not vaccinating until I saw it and it helped me make that choice. I am all about families doing what is right for them. It just wasn’t right for us. 
You are right there is literally no place to have an open discussion about it. Your doctor just repeats the talking points of safe and effective with no side effects. That’s a huge red flag! Why can’t we all talk about it? 
The US has the worst schedule in the world. Japan has probably the safest and least amount of vaccines from my research.</p>

        <p>With how China happily provided the genome to make our COVID vaccines, and then refused to adopt those vaccines themselves, it almost seems like China wants the whole world except for themselves to use MRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Before granting an EUA to MRNA vaccines, the FDA should have ordered the NIH to analyze the possibility that a future virus could be made that would only be able to infect MRNA-vaccinated people. I honestly wonder if that could be China’s motivation here. Unless that possibility could be ruled out with 100% certainty, the MRNA  COVID vaccines never should have been approved.</p>

        <p>Well mRNA vaccines aren’t groundbreaking science for actual biologists; it’s only the public that considers them new. Them being made in a day has no bearing on their safety. The truth is likely that there are mild negative effects on fertility pertaining only to those with a specific allele, same with what determines the severity of reactions.</p>

        <p>Antivaxxers are also more likely to be college-educated. </p>
<p>Although, I hate the term “antivaxxer”...it’s an inaccurate, discriminatory term, that no one should adopt for themselves. Hardly anyone (other than maybe some ultra crunchy radicals) believes the world would be better place without any vaccines whatsoever, but rather that they shouldn’t be a routine or mandated procedure, as it should be a personal decision made between an individual/their parents, and their doctor. Some people are more at risk of adverse events from diseases, and perhaps some diseases are worth avoidance altogether; but again, that should be considered on a case-by-case basis, rather than assumed. Vaccines aren’t our only defense against disease, especially in the 21st century.</p>

        <p>It’s funny that Fauci used the “if you criticize me you’re anti-science” approach. It’s the same bullshit deflection Pharma has done with their vaccine protection racket.</p>
<p>Criminal Pharma has played the “trust the $cience” gimmick really well. They manage to be one of the most corrupt industries on earth, having steadily reframed the narrative around any of their vaccines, through bought $cientists, deception and sleight of hand. They’ve conveniently set the limits of debate, so you can be marginalized by daring to ask questions about any of their liability-free rackets, which are supported by corrupt captured agencies.</p>

        <p>I always thought doctors had all the answers until I got sick and it took 8 years and <strong>dozens</strong> of doctors/specialists for my non-medically trained husband to tell doctors what he thought I had and they said yeah it does sound like that! Let’s get her tested to be sure! Trip 3 (my 3rd week) at Mayo and they confirmed what my husband suggested.</p>

        <p>I lost my faith in doctors when my husband got Lyme disease and every doctor called him crazy and attention seeking, until finally one didn’t and took him seriously. I am also a nurse and see people in health care poopoo and make fun of people every day. Doctors are just people that went to school for a bit longer than most, they are not gods.</p>

        <p>I had my primary doctor to tell me to stop looking for answers just before my husband suggested what he thought I might have. I had a neurologist tell me I was faking my symptoms and lectured me which made me question my sanity and wonder if my symptoms were in my head which also led to me taking a year off of doctors visits. Turns out a neurologist or cardiologist are the doctors who typically diagnose my condition. The 3rd or 4th cardiologist I saw  confirmed my POTs in less than 5 minutes (with more tests to follow) and assured me my numerous symptoms were all related and due to that condition. Not crazy but doctors sure made me feel like it.</p>

        <p>If you read people’s accounts on r/pots youll  see  that  most  of  them  were  given  antidepressants  first  (myself   included)  as  one  of  the  most  common  symptoms  is  exhaustion.  My  heart  rate  zooms  to  180  as  much  as  100  times  a  day  just  for  switching  positions  or bending  down.  Doctors  assume  being  exhausted  means  depression.  However  i  explained  if  im  depressed  its  only  because  i  cant  do  as  much  as  i  used  to  because  I’m  so tired.  Im  not  tired  because  I’m im  depressed!  Apparently  none  of  us  know  our  bodies  enough  so  if  we  want  to  get  through  round  one  we  have  to  play  along  and  take  the  meds  to  prove  that’s  not  helping.  Then  my  new  insurance  wanted  me  to  get  off  what  has  been  working  for  me for  years because  apparently  they  want  people  to  try  2  antidepressants  before  paying  for  other  meds.  Ridiculous!</p>

        <p>Insurance is a joke as well. They dictate treatment as much as doctors half the time. </p>
<p>My husband had to see a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants for his Lyme as well. Luckily we found a doctor that specializes in it not far from us. He didn’t accept insurance though (most insurance companies don’t cover what he suggests) and we had to pay thousands out of pocket. We are just blessed that we were able to do that. Most can’t.
And thank God my husband got better and is healthy now. 
Plus it opened our eyes to the truth about the medical community and is the reason we looked into vaccines and chose to not vaccinate our kids and eventually led to us being skeptical of this vaccine. So in the end, it worked out for our benefit!</p>

        <p>I went to the ER really sick one time. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but I knew it was serious. Fever for seven days straight with no end in sight, as well as other prominent upper respiratory symptoms. I'd never been anywhere near that sick in my life.</p>
<p>They treated me like I was an idiot, and told me I just needed to go home and take some Tylenol. After I insisted that it was something serious, they rolled their eyes and agreed to give me a chest x-ray.</p>
<p>Turns out I had pneumonia.</p>

        <p>The issue is that every single thing in motion right now be it the casedemic, the shots, trannys, 'climate change', media manipulation, etc etc etc, relies on 100% unfiltered propaganda.</p>
<p>It's all open fraud, concealed by censorship, imposed on the ignorant. It's all 50 shades of the same spell.</p>
<p>Once a person sees the trick they can no longer unsee the trick. Thus its not just vaccines, it's essentially all these manufactured issues which are a perpetual war of attrition for them.</p>
<p>This is why on all fronts the propaganda becomes more consuming, the censorship becomes more total, and the push to divide us so we fight amongst ourselves gets stronger every day. They are in a race against time.</p>

        <p>I believe traditional vaccines work. They clearly have worked in the past and improved human quality of life. </p>
<p>I don't trust the mRNA cocktails because they're rushed and based on flawed science, though I won't deny the technology is cutting edge we're still 20 years out from perfecting it. I don't trust them because they're being pushed as panacea with donuts to boot and anything that incentivized is either junk or evil incarnate.</p>
<p>I don't trust the single-shot cocktails because they're based on the same scientific hoo-doo the mRNA jab is, except in vitro.</p>
<p>Last, I've had covid and made it my bitch. Most people I know have had it. They beat it. Even the elderly and sick ones. Some have since been vaccinated, their choice. I don't see any reason for myself and frankly I have a deep-seated bad taste in my mouth when pondering getting it and I'll go with my intuition.</p>

        <p>100% especially w this latest WHO nonsense about perma pandemic measures, and portugal and israel re-locking down despite the ~~sheep~~ smart, educated ppl taking the injection is also shocking.</p>
<p>Like, does the vaccine even work? obviously the chinese vaxs is fake (prayers for chile, seychelles, uruguay, and all the other countries scammed by them) i always thought vaccines gave sterilizing immunity, i.e. 100% effective. i think that might be because other viruses had decades to evolve into a peak fitness form, and once it reached that point it was easier to vaccinate against cause it would be very stable even with vaccine evolutionary pressure.</p>

<p>But that's not true. The majority of people have very minor side effects. Two of my friends are vaccinated and they are doing fine. Most of my coworkers are vaccinated and doing fine. It's not like dropping dead or losing limbs to blood clots is the majority.</p>
<p>Understandably, the people who get vaccinated and have minor side effects are puzzled why we are so concerned about safety.</p>

        <p>If you want to roll that dice, it’s your business, get vaccinated until your heart is content. But because your friends “are doing just fine” doesn’t mean I’m convinced everything is okay. Plenty of people here have “a friend” with insane side effects. But they must be lying right? And you have facts.</p>
