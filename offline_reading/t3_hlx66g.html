    <strong>NYC: So let me get this straight. It's July and you still cant really sit down anywhere but restaurants are open, kind of? What is the point of this city?</strong>
    <p><p>People aren't even bothering to go sit on the patio as most businesses arent even setting their chair out anymore, and people arent going to pay $15 for a drink and $20 for a tapas to stand outside,  get bit by mosquitos, with a mask on that they have to pull down every time they want to take a sip. People are literally walking around to do "essential" things, hours of city operations completely shaves down to a 10pm curfew.  Public transportation is empty. So why are you open?  its because you already lost thousands of dollars and you are desperate. YET we still have to hear from bots and blue checks to PuT On A mAsK RiSinG CasEs!!!!1!</p>
<p>All because of the common cold. Unbelievable. They sold the idea of the asymptomatic super spreader and rising cases and the population is just going along with it. The summer is gone. Oh and dont think we will make it up during the holidays. Most people won't even be working. And guess what, those unemployment checks wont get extended.</p>
<p>Your landlord will evict you. The landlords will default on their taxes. And many public sectors will get defunded. And many will depend more on government funds more than ever. </p>
<p>Do these people actually think this is going to work?
So you were working 100 hours a week so that you can afford your room for rent, in a mice infested building over a bodega? You are already struggling and you think we are all in this together, along with the millionaires living in the 7 figure brownstones and $6000 a month condos. Ok</p>
<p>It's a good thing I spent the last 5 years becoming recession proof. The economy will take at least 6 years to get back to normal. I couldn't imagine being told to wear a mask while I'm on the brink of being evicted with no food in the fridge</p></p>

        <p>I’m pretty fascinated to see what happens to big city real estate in places like NYC, Seattle, and San Fran. I think things are gonna get pretty ugly over the next year. </p>
<p>I for one am leaving the city life and moving to the burbs. Supposedly certain suburbs are having a mini-boom right now.</p>

        <p>I have a Facebook connection who rents a run-down apartment in SF, and her recent Facebook status said, “Zillow has turned into my favorite online game!” She went on to comment that she and her boyfriend are considering buying if prices continue to go down. I want to leave a sarcastic response like, “yeah, see how much good that does you.”  I mean, what’s the point of living in SF if half of the fun businesses close permanently, no one has money to maintain parks or public works projects, the drug addicts are everywhere, and everyone acts suspicious of everyone else?</p>

        <p>Better do it now before the market crashes and everyone else arounds you tries to put them up at the same time. Then it becomes a buyers market and hard to sell. Get out now while you can the cities are done if this covid fear porn keeps up.</p>

        <p>Honestly their is no point in living in a city anymore , the rent is crazy , jobs are gone , all the fun city things are gone and now people going to get evicted , crime is high , random riots happen every few years it’s just a shitshow ,</p>
<p>And god I’m worried about the end of this month two things could happen </p>
<p>1- the checks get cut and eviction freezes stop leading to mass evictions soon </p>
<p>2- government decides to go further in debt and kick this down the road only making its 10 times worse , </p>
<p>It’s most likely going to be 1 and it may just be what gets everyone to end lockdowns permanently</p>

<p>Yes, they are convinced that nothing bad will come of the lockdowns. Even LDS has some people who are like, "Don't be so pessimistic, there might not be much damage done to society due to this"... People really underestimate the sociological, psychological, physical, emotional, and financial damage of these lockdowns...</p>

        <p>I hope she will, because it would mean we won. At that point, watch a big percentage of the covid cultists claim they were against lockdowns the whole time and claim they knew the virus wasn't that dangerous. Too bad for them, everything they've said and done is heavily documented online.</p>

        <p>The immense economic and societal damage is being completely ignored by the media and the idiotic population. These cities and states are headed towards Soviet-style collapses. There will come a point where they can no longer act like the economy is still functioning and keep pretending that covid is the bubonic plague. There's not going to be a United States anymore. Why would states that didn't completely commit suicide for a common cold want to be part of that shit show?</p>

        <p>I know several people in the city that are now planning to not come back-either their job is something that has decided wfh is permanent, they lost it, or can transfer-they know that half the restaurants, small theaters, bars, etc aren’t coming back, crime is gonna spike, so spending thousands on a tiny place is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Wait how does the mask rule work on the patio? I’d assume you were consistently considered to be eating while you’re there. No masks required on patio here in Toronto but we as of Tuesday I think you might need it to go inside and piss at a pub (indoor mask rule).</p>
<p>Are people drinking in parks there? That’s kinda what we started doing here in Toronto a lot. I’ve hit a few patios too, but most of the ones that are worth hitting have queues. I’d rather hit whatever brewery I want and meet the boys for a drinking walk. I’m guessing cops are less cool there.</p>

        <p>I've lived in NYC since the early 1990s, and know plenty of native NYers who described what life was like here in the 70s-80s (very bad- there were neighborhoods not even cops entered, vicious stray dog packs roaming the streets, massive drug use, etc). It's really only been since the late 1990s that NYC became a tourist playground.</p>
<p>Even if tourism diminishes and companies move out, I don't see the city descending into a Detroit type spiral. The second rents go down the city will fill right back up with artsy soul searching types and intellectuals, the kind of people who've been flocking here for generations.</p>
<p>It's also possible that the outer boroughs will become more desirable while Manhattan proper loses some of its desirability. Just speculating.</p>
<p>As far as crime, most if not all of the shootings have been gang related and relegated to specific neighborhoods. NYC has always been a place where there are certain neighborhoods to avoid because of crime, this is nothing new.</p>
<p>For every person who leaves there are probably five willing to take their place at the right price. Honestly if rents go down, that will be a good thing.</p>

        <p>I always felt NYC was designed to stress you out anyway (with all of the lights and excessive loudness, especially in Manhattan), so what's new?</p>
<p>If you're in NYC, get out of there and preferably cross a state line while you're at it.</p>
