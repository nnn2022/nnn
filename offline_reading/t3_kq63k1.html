        <p>This is happening in Singapore. </p>
<p>Brief summary of this whole shebang, last year the Singaporean government (my government) decided that it'd be a great idea to invent some sort of electronic and token tracking system based on Bluetooth tech for "contact tracing" in combating the pandemic. Half a year on and millions of dollars thrown down a pit, and there are still teething issues with Bluetooth connectivity and interference, botched handouts of physical plastic tokens because of bad supply chain planning, as well as zero tangible proof of the efficacy of the system in combating the pandemic in a society that still hasn't implemented mass-testing to find out just how "prevalent" the COVID-19 virus is amongst a potentially asymptomatic population. </p>
<p>Now in the first Parliamentary debate of the year, the worst privacy concerns of those of us in Singapore have been realised. Read the following paragraph and weep. </p>
<p>"Authorised police officers may invoke then the Criminal Procedure Code ... powers to obtain this data for purpose of criminal investigation, and for the purpose of the safety and security of our citizens, but otherwise TraceTogether data is indeed to be used only for contact tracing and for the purpose of fighting the COVID situation." </p>
<p>Question is, who watches the police officers and who's in charge of homeland security? Bear in mind we're talking about a country that made world headlines for charging an activist with illegal assembly... because he held up a placard of a smiling face ALONE in front of a police station, ostensibly in support of two climate change activists who got placed under police investigations earlier last year.   </p>

<p>Singapore is not this open and international and cosmopolitan city that it likes to present itself as. It's only modern in terms of its appearance, but highly intolerant when it comes to people just expressing themselves. And be very worried if you live in the West and you hear politicians touting the success of Asian countries like Singapore, seen to be sufficiently Westernised to be acceptable in Anglosphere countries, and a "successful example" of how COVID-19 has been combated with social engineering and technological surveillance means. </p>
<p>There is no new normal. There's only the dystopian Brave New World those in power tout as the "new normal". And if you think this sort of thing happening in a small city-state of 5.9 million means nothing to you living in a larger Western country, think again, because the very existence of such case studies will no doubt be used to give impetus and justifications to the worst impulses of your leaders wherever you might reside.</p>

        <p>By this point, I agree. Well, I have gotten into actual arguments with many of my family, and watch as they just eat up the narrative and then say that I'm crazy. Or just see the vaccine and say that we have a saviour even when the government has made no inclinations towards saying anything would be gone after. </p>
<p>I did manage to find a fellow Sinkie who shared my views. I guess the only thing that's a positive, the vaccine isn't mandatory except there is a ton of pressure for you to take it.</p>

        <p>Hong konger here, the govt is pulling the same shit, they infact just turned the 安心出行from QR to bluetooth based, and govt said they won't rule out possibltiy of making it mandatory (already mandatory for businesses).</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, our govt is obessed with "reducing cases to 0" which is impossible for a city like HK without a total wuhan lockdown.</p>
<p>Our govt has stupidly put in the stupid policies which has questionable effects</p>
<p>&rt;Social distancing to 2</p>
<p>Doesn't work because most people are now gonna gather in someone's house instead of a bar, only hurts small businesses</p>
<p>&rt;Mandatory masks</p>
<p>Stupid law, doesn't account for if a mask fell to the ground, and masks are not very effective in tropical placed with high humidity and temperature, because sweats will render the mask useless (waste of environment)</p>
<p>&rt;Muuuh vaccines!!</p>
<p>Our govt plans to vaccinate most of the population with the vaccines which is funny.</p>
<p>&rt;Lockdown placed after 8pm (?)</p>
<p>Useless because everyone knows viruses disappears after 8pm</p>
<p>&rt;Fines for ones breaking rules</p>
<p>This is the worst, as there are many police officers patrolling right now who won't afraid to fine you 1/3 of the median salary just because you took a drink or "gathered". Also people will just gather at private property (homes) to party instead of restaurants or bars.</p>
<p>Partial lockdowns doesn't work and HK, despite having one of the strictest and longest anti pandemic laws there, actually isn't effective.</p>
