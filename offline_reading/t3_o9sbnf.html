        <p>I was only a kid in the 80's when AIDS really exploded and it was obviously prior to the internet and social media but the general consensus then was that the  "science" caused it</p>
<p>The theory was that it came from an attempt at a malaria vaccine</p>
<p>Chimps as the "science" tells us are our closest related primate and they are also immune to malaria, the attempt was made by using chimpanzee blood in the vaccine (in a similar way to the adenovirus vaccines now) but the science failed to spot that chimps also carry HIV which was introduced into the human population through trials with soldiers and unsuspecting native Africans, it was quickly hushed up but its no surprise that AIDS is still rife in Africa whilst the rest of the world got off relatively free</p>

        <p>That phrase is unbelievably obtuse. Not that I consider myself or above average intelligence. </p>
<p>Facts must not be believed for what they are, but for what they explain.</p>
<p>It is said that half of the information in a science textbook is outdated within a few decades. So what then constitutes a scientific fact? From the point of view of outdated science textbooks, it can be concluded that biology is a historical science, i.e., a scientific fact has a history and could not be understood without understanding its history. The changing knowledge in science is the result of refutations or the falsification of a theory. </p>
<p>So when someone says trust the science to me it would have me assume that they acknowledge the possibility that things can change and new information could shed light on something altering what was previously believed.</p>
