<title>Wouldn't it be more effective persuasion to say that it's 100% survival rate for anyone who isn't exceptionally unhealthy and usually survivable even by them?</title>

    <p><p>Modify the above how you see fit for your purposes, but that .1% always seems to be doomers point of contention.</p>
<p>Let's face it folks, covid has replaced the flu/cold/respiratory illnesses and the bogus pcr test is used as the holy grail. &lt;--This right here will never break MSM brainwashing, but in my experience, neither does 99.9%. </p>
<p>Knowing what we know about this illness, if you're not knocking on deaths door, and you're not given horrific treatment, you're 100% surviving it. The other possibility is dying from something else and being lumped into the covid numbers which we also know they're doing. &lt;--however this right here also won't convince  anyone.</p>
<p>As a statistic ~99.9% may be correct, but it considers the population as a whole, not the person right in front of you. Unless you've got a morbidly obese person, or old and frail person in front of you, you're surviving this illness, because it is the cold/flu that nearly except the ridiculously at risk people, gets over.</p></p>
