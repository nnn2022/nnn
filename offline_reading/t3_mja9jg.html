    <strong>What is it like in New Orleans these days? Restrictions?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi there, simple question. My SO is trying to plan a trip to New Orleans for us towards the end of May. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me what it is like there in terms of masks and restrictions, etc.  I'm from the Detroit area and people are still pandemic crazy around here, with lots of stuff still closed or highly restricted.</p>
<p>I'm already very nervous about having to go through the airport and deal with the airplane, in terms of whether I will have to get a mandatory nasal swab, having to wear a mask for that entire length of time and deal with panic and claustrophobia, etc.</p>
<p>But the biggest question is, will I be able to actually experience the city the way that I would want to?</p>
<p>I have always wanted to go to New Orleans, but I do not want to spend the time and money and everything else involved with taking the trip just to get there and find out that everything is closed, there is no live music, I can't go to restaurants, etc.</p>
<p>Any info anyone can provide would be appreciated, thank you very much.</p></p>

        <p>I went for Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>The mayor closed everything down that week. Bars in the Quarter were closed. No liquor sales. At night for the entire week, and during the day on Mardi Gras day, Bourbon Street was closed with heavy police presence. </p>
<p>Now that Mardi Gras is over, everything should be open, but expect to be made to wear a mask indoors. Outdoors, no one cares.</p>

        <p>Might not help now, but I was there in November.  There was a city wide mask order at the time but no one was wearing one other than the song-and-dance when you go into a restaurant.</p>
<p>Great town.</p>
