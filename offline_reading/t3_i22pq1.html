    <strong>Anti-maskers are less selfish than they are made out to be</strong>
    <p><p>LAST UPDATED ON <strong>23 AUGUST 2020</strong></p>
<p>Pro-maskers hope to help crush the "curve", whereas anti-maskers hope to help flatten the fear: 
&rt;Wearing [a mask] for show makes me complicit in something I know not to be true (not the reality of the virus, but rather the wisdom of the broader public health strategy since March). It plays into a hysteria that I will not be a part of or endorse. I want people to see I'm not scared to perhaps give them a bit more courage, as well. (Redditor PlayFree_Bird) </p>
<p>Note that being anti-mask is not a selfish or anti-social stance: anti-maskers have ethics and values, just like pro-maskers do, but in their ethical system they rank higher the importance of: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flattening the collective fear/mass hysteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affirming the central value of normal human relations: "<a href="https://culturalanalysis.net/2020/08/05/de-facing-victoria/">mask wearing is degrading our human relations</a>: that which made human life worth saving in the first place...Face masks efface us"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defending civil liberties/fighting government overreach </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respecting only evidence-driven public policy (i.e. refusing to be part of a charade)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter point has two aspects to it: (4.a.) some anti-maskers are aware that we do not have any strong evidence that cloth masks for the general public in nonhealthcare settings are effective (hence mandating them undermines the integrity of the scientific enterprise, basic respect for facts, and the principle of effectiveness in public health policy); (4.b.) other anti-maskers argue that even if masks were known to be effective, using them would be counter-productive because the best strategy is to get faster to herd immunity by encouraging low-risk demographics to live normally. Martin Kulldorff, a Harvard Medical School professor of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety, has spoken to this issue on <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/herd-immunity-is-still-key-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/amp?__twitter_impression=true">8th August 2020</a>: </p>
<p>&rt;As a society we should appreciate young adults who help generate herd immunity by living normal lives and keeping society afloat. Thank you, thank you, thank you. <strong>When people throw misguided complaints at you, falsely claiming that you are endangering others, remember that the opposite is true</strong>. </p>
<p>Professor Udi Qimron, Head of the Department of Immunology at Tel Aviv University, said the same on <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/285341">16th August 2020</a>: </p>
<p>&rt;I would also ask children and young people to take off their masks. </p>
<p>Going out in public without a mask can be a scientific, political, and moral statement that many of us choose to make even at the risk of being bullied by the pro-mask <a href="https://jordanschachtel.substack.com/p/the-cult-of-masks">cult</a>. Genuinely selfish people would find it less costly to just wear the damned mask, even if they didn't believe it works.</p>

        <p>How much worse would it be if the whole world had lost their minds and you believed you were alone in questioning everyone's sanity? I refuse to wear a mask because I want people who also question the sanity of the world to know that there are many people who feel the same that way they do.</p>

<p>And that's not counting the long term neurological damage of some of the people it doesn't kill.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to cut that number in half just by people putting on a fucking mask, which is the smallest act of human decency that could be asked of you...and then not doing it. </p>
<p>You would deserve to be a pariah for having zero consideration of others and no understanding of objective reality.</p>
<p>Your not wearing a mask is not you taking a brave moral stand, it is you and people like you being fucking idiots who will get themselves and others needlessly killed and brain-damaged.  </p>
<p>This is just basic hygiene and minimal human decency.</p>

        <p>Our mammalian brains can only truly care about so many people. If you claim to care about anyone outside of your immediate social circle, you're shallow as fuck and just virtue signalling.</p>
<p>And for anyone who doesn't know, "higher SES" is basically PC-speak for upper middle class. More evidence that the majority of "New Normal" supporters are well-to-do and don't personally struggle with the socioeconomic issues wrought by COVID control measures. In other words, this person is both classist and an intellectual elitist. I think we already knew that though.</p>

        <p>There IS something outside our control to be scared of: the corruption of those in power. Sorry, but people in power DO conspire, this "theory" has been proven time and time again. And not wearing a mask isn't "crying about the lack of ability to make a personal choice" nor is it my responsibility to keep you or your grandma safe.

        <p>My society? You mean the society I never chose to be a part of, the society I'm working toward dropping out of insofar as I possibly can? No, it isn't my responsibility, because I couldn't care less about the vast majority of people. You don't really care either. Our little human brains can only muster up genuine compassion for an immediate social circle of maybe a few hundred at most; anything else is shallow, hollow, vapid, self-righteous virtue-signalling. Go ahead, feel free to insist you're so superior to the average human and you really do care so much about millions of total strangers.</p>
<p>Likewise, go ahead and treat me like I'm not a functional member of society. I don't want to be, at least not a member of your society, because why would I want to align myself with sneering imperialist trash? It is indeed your choice to treat me like a petulant teenager, just as it is my choice to treat people like you as the sociocultural tumor you are. You ever see a tumor? That's you: a fleshy veiny malignant mass of inflammatory degeneracy that doesn't truly belong anywhere. Oh, and my grandma died a few years ago from pneumococcal pneumonia because she was an old chainsmoker who probably would've died in several years anyway, which is just as well because she was ready and willing to die. If she was still alive, she would be appalled by the state of the world. Especially snobbish little shitheads like you.</p>

        <p>But the reason that the western world has a higher death toll is that many are obese and avoid exercise.  Closing down sports clubs and gyms did not exactly encourage fitness.  Being forced to wear a mask whilst doing intense exercise is dangerous and much of the population will end up less fit as a result.   </p>
<p>Are you telling me that people can communicate as effectively with masks as they did before, I can't understand what someone is saying when they are wearing a mask.  Also facial expression is so important in understanding people, especially developing children learning the world.  Finally think of the psychological effect of treating fellow humans not as people but as disease vectors.</p>

Compulsory masks for everyone is beyond basic precaution, which would be washing hands and basic hygiene.  Huge social and economic destruction has been caused by the Lockdown.

        <p>Lol, so in your prior post you seem to be opposed to fat-shaming and ableism, and now you're okay with killing fat people and the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions and anyone who isn't you because...what?  You're selfish trash?</p>
<p>Even if you're selfish, it would make sense to not want to be a pariah and not contract the virus yourself at that.  </p>
<p>But you're too much of a mess to think or behave like an intelligent person of any value.  Sad, but also funny.  I'd pity you, but you aren't even worth that.</p>

        <p>No, I personally couldn't care less about ableism or fat shaming. People like you usually claim to oppose those things though, along with the typical woes of racism, sexism, and homophobia. Yet you say any smart person would keep fit and healthy, implying obese people are less intelligent, and you readily insult people you believe are less intelligent than you. That's prejudice. Bigotry.</p>
<p>You have a point though, why would I want to be a pariah if I'm so selfish? If I only care about myself, why would I willingly subject myself to such horrible suffering as the scolding you are currently serving me? Maybe because, despite my selfishness, I really do have morals and ethics. They just don't align with yours. And as for contracting the virus, I already have. Was the worst cold I've had in awhile. Lo and behold, I still think controlling the virus is worse than contracting it.</p>
<p>I'm done with you and your "high SES" bullshit, fuck off to wherever you upper middle class snobs fuck off too. kthnxbai</p>

Nope, I'm at a healthy weight, and I consistently test higher than average on measures of working memory.

        <p>As a human able to reason at a level significantly higher than pack animals, you should be able both to generalize your concern for other human beings, as well as see how your individual welfare is tied in with those of others, in situations including but not limited to contagious pandemics.  </p>

<p>You are alive and breathing only due to the efforts of countless other people, who you are too stupid to recognize or care about.</p>
<p>Your stupidity, and the stupidity of people like you, affects more than just yourselves, particularly during a contagious pandemic.  So trying to educate you is in everyone's interest, including your own, whether you ever realize it or not.  </p>

        <p>I mean the pandemic is culling a huge amount of those demographics though, right? You said it yourself remember? 
And at the same time international foundations are receiving funding from governments all over the world, to help prop up a centralised medical/health infrastructure which isn't really about global health as it's is about big pharma and creating a centralised control grid. Even though their documents might be presented in the interest of global health, it should be clear this language is a type of doublespeak which is obvious to people who might be familiar with these kinds of papers.</p>
<p>As for the so called "conspiracy theory", a term that's getting kind of tiresome don't ya think?</p>
<p>How about we use
"books, conferences, and interviews where known globalist explain to everyone how they plan on transitioning the global population into a new global society"?
I like that more since it's more accurate and isn't a widely known CIA talking point used to discredit genuine critique on the global oligarchy.</p>
<p>Anyway here's some homework
Klaus Schwab's book 'the shaping of the forth industrial revolution'</p>
<p>You know who he is right?
You should considering he has been making important commentary on this "pandemic" as of late. In that book he lays out what we are seeing right now.</p>
<p>Now consider what projects he's apart of.</p>
<p>Can you think of any events that might be associated with him say since around October last year?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna give you the cheat sheet because you should know how to use this part of your brain by now.</p>
<p>Alright, come back to me when you think you know the answer to my last question.</p>

        <p>I'm against all of it..</p>
<p>The reason I bring up the WEF is because of their part in hosting event 201</p>
<p>https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/scenario.html</p>
<p>Held in October 2019, it was an exercise performed by a range of different leaders of government and business etc.</p>
<p>The exercise simulated a global pandemic eerily similar to what we are experiencing right now.</p>
<p>It's a strange coincidence that the WEF held an event that simulated something that became a reality only a few months later.</p>
<p>And on top of that, conveniently provides a "rare" opportunity to initiate a global reset</p>
<p>There are other aspects specific to this pandemic that I haven't gone into aswell, i.e. the other collaborating foundations and ngo's who are dictating government actions and preparedness to this specific event.</p>
<p>As for the masks, apart from being a tool of promoting fear and general dehumanization they are symbolic of transition. To be worn by the initiate. </p>
<p>Are you ready for the new world?</p>

        <p>Holy fuck. Are you kidding me? </p>
<p>I know the world is complex. That's why I'm trying to expose some depth to your low fidelity understanding of this pandemic. </p>
<p>You literally have only cited and regurgitated a surface level mainstream worldview.</p>
<p>You're just resorting to uncertainty because you're so obviously shallow and can't comprehend any deeper insights to your oh so precious "objective reality", which is so obviously your own retarded opinion and not based in objectivity AT ALL.</p>
<p>And you haven't added anything to what I've presented except arbitrary dismissals. 
I would at least appreciate it if you could present a legitimate argument as to why I might be wrong.</p>

        <p>You have the burden of proof to show that you're right, which you haven't met for any sensible person.</p>
<p>Be more humble.  Do quality control on your own thoughts, ideas, and theories.</p>
<p>No one is obligated to even give you the benefit of the doubt for your speculative theories when you don't even bother with evidence, self-criticism, self-education, or quality control on your end.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation has made pandemic preparation one of its goals for years - why wouldn't they, in collaboration with other experts at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, have reasonably realistic preparations/simulations of what they've been predicting as likely pandemic scenarios for years?</p>
<p>Barack Obama left a whole pandemic playbook for the next administration because it was likely that after SARS and Ebola that something similar would be likely to happen in the future, and possibly on a more devastating scale if not handled well.</p>
<p>Oxford University was already preparing a coronavirus vaccine because they saw a similar threat coming.</p>
<p>Lots of people and organizations use crises to try to make changes that they want.</p>
<p>If your theory is accurate, why are you the only one, or one of the only ones, who has it?</p>

<p>Huxley is basically telling all here and at the same time laughing in the audience members face about it.</p>
<p>His family are known eugenicists and his brother, Julian, coined the term transhumanism. Which is what this is all about.</p>
<p>You have to look at this in a holistic way when considering this stuff..  Then when you look at what some of the "great" minds are saying you soon realise it's about transhumanism in one form or another.</p>

Corbett is highlighting the bio metric ID systems being developed, essentially tagging people. They are now are number. Are you willing to be just a number?</p>

        <p>640,000 isn't really a lot. Roughly 100x that die every year all around the world. 9/11 honestly didn't kill very many people either, tragic as it was. The only reason we care so much is because of how sudden and shocking the attacks were. If those few thousand poor souls overdosed or committed suicide in their homes, no one would really give a fuck except maybe their immediate social circle. People like you might pretend though.</p>

<p>The lady who brought out the groceries could tell I had been crying and asked what was wrong so I just spilled it, and she told me she hates them too but they make her wear it. She also had a customer who asked her not to stand so close to her car! She was putting groceries in it, she said “I should have told her sure, I’ll just sand back a few yards and pitch them.”</p>

        <p>In NJ that's what the order states, and from everything I've read, no cops are enforcing it. Orders are not laws anyways. The police know that. If any of these actually start being enforced with fines than this will probably end up being some exciting supreme court decisions.</p>

<p>If they do work to any degree (looking more and more unlikely) &lt;100% (an accepted fact), they only serve the function of delaying herd immunity, extending lockdowns and causing more deaths/economic ruin.</p>

        <p>One thing I want to add, selfishness has a worse rep these days than it should. Many philosophists in the past have praised the kind of positive selfishness. Ayn Rand and Alan Watts comes to mind. Austrian economics is also based on the self interest of people. When two people with self interest come together and trade it can be a win-win situation. </p>
<p>In regards to mask wearing or civil disobedience in general. It is not a bad thing to be selfish. In the end nobody else will bear the consequences of your decisions on your life, wether they be positive or negative. I want to breathe fresh air is a perfectly valid reason to go outside or to not wear a mask. </p>
<p>Let's not be led by the prevailing virtue signal mentality. Since when does everyone have to be the savior of everybody else? We know it's the reality most of us have enough to worry in our own lives and we aren't so arrogant as to presume we know what is best for somebody else as we know very little of their actual situation.</p>

        <p>"flatten the curve" was ostensibly a short lived measure to avoid overwhelming hospitals <em>at the peak</em>. That's it. End of story.</p>
<p>That was shown to be flawed at best or a deliberate lie at worst, hence the riots and protests ever since. The MSM can keep trying to downplay any protest, ridicule any dissent, but it won't work.</p>

        <p>I'm in healthcare and honestly this obsession with masks solving everything is ridiculous. And dangerous. People wear their masks and pat themselves on the back for a job well done. </p>
<p>The real damage is being done right now with these ridiculous lockdowns and curfews. Freedoms have been curtailed so much the world feels unrecognisable right now. I'm not denying that people have died from this virus. But why has this particular disease caused so much panic and craziness? </p>
<p>We are expected to just take all these crazy contradictory rules so that politicians can feel as if they are helping. Were they not to flatten the curve? Which happened. The aim was not eradication of this virus but to stop hospitals overrunning.</p>
<p>These measures also disproportionately effect younger people. How much should they be willing to sacrifice for the elderly. I'm not saying the elderly don't matter. Just that their lives don't matter more than the young. Who now face yet another economic crisis and loss of employment. As well as any semblance of freedom and fun. And for what? </p>
<p>The vast majority of those dying had a small number of years left to live. The average age of death is something like 80 I believe. </p>
<p>Honestly it feels like living in the matrix at this point. People would spread the flu round all the time and no one called them murderers? </p>
<p>Sorry for this rant but I genuinely can't believe this has happened sometimes. I understand that during the beginning of the pandemic it was uncertain just how deadly this virus was. But now we know so much more and the fact is the majority of people will recover from this virus. </p>
<p>We can't halt the world indefinitely for a vaccine that may not be ready for months or perhaps years. If people want to hide away from this virus until then that is their decision. But honestly, I think in a few months even the most avid lockdown proponents will change their tune. When there is recession and mass unemployment and depression.</p>

        <p>This is a big reason I don't wear one (only in the supermarket, because my governor's an asshole). I have OCD, and I never make other take part in my OCD rituals. That's MY problem, and I don't inflict it on anyone else. I refuse to indulge a bunch of hysterical freaks with a virus fetish.</p>

        <p>You are painting a picture that makes anti mask people look like heroes. The reason people speak out when they see someone not wearing a mask is not to deride or belittle them. It comes for the scientific evidence that having a filter over your nose and mouth significantly reduces the particulates you exhale, reducing exposure. It is simply about public safety. 
Just to address the theme I see about this being part of a big brother type conspiracy. Why would the gov want you to wear masks as a new norm if it messes up facial recognition and makes identifying someone harder? The only reason people are asking others to wear masks is to keep others safe. Same principle of smoking in restaurants or dwi. Its not just your safety, it is everyone's including you.</p>
