    <strong>Vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>Let me say that I'm not anti-vaccine in general, just anti- this vaccine and anti-mandatory vaccine. What will we do if they try to unconstitutionally make it mandatory to do anything? To go anywhere? Obviously crazy, even if you don't think about other vaccines to go to school, never has anyone needed a vaccine "passport" to go to the store or an event or on a plane or anything. This is obviously unconstitutional, but what if everyone is still so braindead that they don't challenge it? Like with face diapers. There are tons of people against them, but nothing ever changes because the maskers just don't give up. As hard as we push against muzzles, they remain in place and as much as I hate to admit it, little progress has made against the insanity, tyranny, and dehumanization that is muzzles. If people want a vaccine, whatever, but it should be my choice, especially this one, since I don't feel at all like I need protection from the Corona Virus. To me, it's just a bad cold in most cases and I don't want this vaccine and I should not be barred from participating in society just because I don't have it. I just don't trust this one since it's so rushed and another reason is just because people have gone so far over this virus, completely without need, and I resolved from day one that I was not going to do react to this virus any more than I would cold and flu season. This virus didn't even freaking exist for more than a year! And now you're trying to get me to take a vaccine against it? No. I'm not taking it. But what to do at that point when the shit hits the fan (it pretty much already has with the muzzles) and they try to force you to do anything in public?</p></p>
