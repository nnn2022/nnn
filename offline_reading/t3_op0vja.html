    <strong>Is there a legal definition of "safe"?</strong>
    <p><p>I say this because in previous jobs, I was told to avoid words like "safe" or "dangerous."</p>
<p>For example, in property management, we didn't say the community was safe; instead we recommended they look up the local crime rates. Despite the fact that this was what would be considered a safe neighborhood, we could face a lawsuit if we told someone it was safe and they become a victim of crime. We also called the security service a "courtesy patrol," whatever that means, so we didn't imply being secure.</p>
<p>Also, working in traffic engineering for a city government, we got annual reports of the intersections that we called "high-accident locations." To say they were dangerous might imply that we knew they were dangerous and therefore assume some liability when someone crashes. Of course, on the news they'd say the city released the most dangerous intersections, but we never said that. </p>
<p>(BTW having analyzed the accident reports, the most accidents resulted from glare, especially during sunset, and police chases in certain parts of town. We could minimize glare but what could we do about criminals running red lights?)</p>
<p>So if the government or a drug company says something is safe, what does that even mean?</p></p>

        <p>There is no guarantee of safety, there is no right to safety or safespaces, as it would be impossible to promise such a thing.</p>
<p>Still, the Cult of the Mask's aim is to create a 100% safespace for themselves, taking over our society, our institutions everything, and locking out free and perfectly healthy People in the process.</p>
<p>"Zero Covid" is impossible as well, but they're going to try unless people stop them.</p>
