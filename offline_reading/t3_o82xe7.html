    <strong>Fake Papers</strong>
    <p><p>Been seeing comments about how fake papers are a good thing.</p>
<p>I'm not here to say I understand your situation. Maybe your workplace mandated it and have a sick kid at home so you just say fuck it I will do <em>whatever</em>. I've never had that, so I don't know how I'd react. </p>
<p>It seems like a number of people don't have a sick kid at home, but they're merely just wanting to blend in. They want to go into the office and have lunch with their coworkers so they got fake papers to avoid drawing attention to themselves. This is the intended audience of my post.</p>
<p>I'd like to quote Morpheus to describe the situation:</p>
<p>“The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.”  </p>
<p>By going the fake papers route, you are identifying yourself as the enemy. </p>
<p>We are in a war. You faking papers and pretending is just adding to the number of people who outwardly accept this governmental abuse. You are part of  the problem.</p>
<p>Our enemy is literally injecting their children with poison and you are hoping to blend in with them? To tell them you are one of them? To validate their perception? Their actions? </p>
<p>Stand up for yourself. </p>
<p>Have dignity. </p>
<p>We are in a honeymoon phase with this whole thing. These little paper vax cards are just the stepping stone to the digital pass. You can't fake the digital pass. If you are hoping to stay un-injected, buckle up because this fall/winter it's about to pop off. And in round two, you won't be able to fake it. What then? Have a spine now.</p></p>

        <p>i won't be getting any 'papers', authentic or fake</p>
<p>for the same reason i refuse to wear a face diaper anywhere, as it is an outward symbol of acceptance of (even more) government abuse as you put it.</p>

        <p>Another practical reason not to get the fake passports: if the situation develops drastically and the vaccination status would actually prohibit you from doing certain things, like, say, flying or donating blood, how do you prove you are not actually vaccinated?</p>
