    <strong>How will the vaccine lead to mass death?</strong>
    <p><p>I didn’t know this sub existed until today and I hadn’t heard this theory. Someone said folks who get the vaccine will be dead in 4 years?</p></p>

        <p>So it’s difficult right, because the mainstream narrative is clear bullshit, and any legitimate scientist/doctor/researcher challenging it is deplatformed so we’re all just trying to piece together something that makes sense from scraps of info.</p>
<p>Essentially the thinking among ‘vax as bioweapon’ proponents is that the vaccines trigger a cascading autoimmune response eventually ending in premature death.</p>
<p>The sad thing about this is all of this has been so botched that this should be clearly and evidently impossible—but there’s so much bullshit being passed off by media/governmental organizations as fact that we can’t rule out these terrifying alternate narratives</p>

        <p>Drs. Sucharit Bhakdi, Michael Yeadon, Peter McCullough, Geert Vanden Bossche and others have cited things like mutagenesis, ADE, immune escape and other potential issues.</p>
<p>“There is a condition known as <strong>disease enhancement due to pathogenic priming,</strong> and this was <strong>discovered in vaccinated animals</strong> and past vaccine safety studies when they did conduct vaccine safety studies on animals on coronavirus vaccines, <strong>where vaccinated animals got more serious disease after being vaccinated, and then when they acquired an infection from the wild type vaccine, more animals got serious infections, serious conditions, and more animals died.”</strong>
https://dryburgh.com/james-lyons-weiler-coronavirus-vaccine-safety-warning/</p>
<p>“Early efforts to develop a SARS vaccine in animal trials were plagued by a phenomenon known as <strong>”vaccine-induced enhancement,” in which recipients exhibit worse symptoms after being injected</strong>— something Fauci said researchers must be mindful of as they work to quickly develop a vaccine to protect against COVID-19.”
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/05/scientists-were-close-to-a-sars-coronavirus-vaccine-years-ago.html</p>
<p>“Some scientists worry that a rushed vaccine could result in what's known as "enhancement" whereby a vaccine actually weakens a person's response to a virus when they contract it. 
<strong>For example, one study on a SARS vaccine in 2004 found that some ferrets developed hepatitis, rather than a resilience to the coronavirus.”</strong>
https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-quest-18-months-fauci-experts-flag-dangers-testing-2020-4?op=1</p>
<p>“The greatest fear among vaccinologists is the creation of a vaccine that is not only ineffective, but which exacerbates disease. <strong>Unfortunately, CoV vaccines have a history of enhancing disease, notably with feline CoVs.</strong>”
https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706717_8</p>
<p><strong>Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE)</strong></p>
<p>“Vaccine scientists have long relied on antibody as a measure of a vaccine’s efficacy. <strong>It is a little- known fact that any antibody, even a vaccine-induced one, can render a person more vulnerable to disease.</strong> There is an undeniably delicate balance between protective immunity and the induction of <strong>enhanced susceptibility not only to the disease vaccinated for, but other diseases as well,</strong> and often this enhanced susceptibility comes from a vaccine that was administered to protect.</p>
<p>A virus recognizes and binds one or several specific cell surface receptor(s), enabling the entrance into cells. Some antibodies increase the ability of viruses to infect their target cells. This phenomenon is called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection.</p>
<p>There is no controversy over the fact that the inactivated measles vaccines led to an abnormal immune response and, later, a form of original antigenic sin. Several mechanisms have been proposed over the years.</p>
<p>Measles virus has two important proteins on the surface—H (hemagglutinin) and F (fusion). The killed vaccine only programmed the recipient to manufacture antibodies to H. Then, when the natural virus or a live attenuated vaccine virus was encountered, the recipient could only respond to H protein because of faulty initial immune programming. Meanwhile, the F protein permitted viral access to human cells, causing victims to be more vulnerable than they would have been if not vaccinated at all.</p>
<p>The measles literature contains many admissions of how much is still not understood regarding measles virus pathogenesis and what actually constitutes immunity.  Development of new vaccines has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of protective immunity and of the priming for enhanced disease by the inactivated vaccine. [This "priming ” refers to the Antibody Dependent Enhancement.]</p>
<p><strong>The phenomenon of ADE has also been a problem with dengue fever, RSV, rickettsial, trachoma, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae vaccines</strong> and is one of the reasons there is no HIV vaccine to date.  It also has been seen with Coxsackie virus.</p>
<p>Original antigenic sin (OAS) and ADE are different aspects of a similar phenomenon. They both apply to vaccines as well as infections and can lead the immune system astray, crippling the innate ability to fight disease upon exposure and rendering the victim more susceptible.</p>
<p>The more scientists learn about the immune system, the more they realize their profound lack of understanding.  Regardless of the fact that not even the tip of the iceberg has been breached in immunology, <strong>immune systems have been manipulated by vaccines for more than 200 years.</strong></p>
<p>Excerpts from the following immunology journal of 2006 are revealing and have startling implications for vaccine science.</p>
<p><em>It is increasingly apparent that, rather than being inherently good or bad, the effects of Abs (antibodies) are either beneficial or deleterious in a host, depending on the type of microbe-host interaction, including the setting in which damage occurs as a function of the host immune milieu and response. A logical extension of this concept is that an Ab that is protective in one host may not be protective in another if the nature of their immune responses to the relevant agent places them on different parts of the damage response curve. These concepts have important ramifications for vaccine design since vaccine efficacy could depend on enhancement of the immune response for those with weak immune responses, but </em><em>enhanced responses could be detrimental in those who naturally generate strong immune responses</em><em>.... Hence, rather than being a static or stable characteristic, the ability of an Ab to mediate protection is likely to be dynamic, changing as a function of time, the host response, available host receptors and inflammatory mediators, and the state of the microbe in the host... Considering that the immune response to pathogenic microbes includes Abs to many Ags (antigens) differing in the predominant isotvpe and amount, one can </em><em>easily envision unfathomable complexity</em><em> that becomes even more daunting if one considers host genetic variation. Clearly, defining protective efficacy of an Ab molecule in a predictive fashion is currently beyond the state of immunological science and may not be possible with current reductionistic approaches to scientific problems... Immunological knowledge is insufficient to predict the Ab characteristics that will be protective. Therefore, in most instances, determining the efficacy of Ab remains an empiric rather than predictive discipline.”</em></p>

        <p>Check it out! Antibody Dependant Enhancement is no joke. I hope im wrong but I think the media/social media is amping up on "the divide" between vaxxed/unvaxxed so that IF or WHEN vaccinated people fall ill/die, they'll blame it on unvaxxed. Of course I hope im wrong, nobody gets hurt, and no two-tier society ever happens.</p>

        <p>Here’s a couple of interesting articles. Dr. Bossche talks about immune escape related to the shots. The second link asks other doctors what they think of Dr. Bossche’s claims.</p>
<p>“Dr Bossche believes that vaccinologists, clinicians, and scientists are only focusing on short-term results at the individual level and not the consequences at the global population level, which he believes will soon become evident. Evident in the form of  having transformed “a quite harmless virus into an uncontrollable monster”.
https://dryburgh.com/geert-vanden-bossche-open-letter-to-who-halt-all-covid-19-mass-vaccination/</p>
<p>“Because of the interest expressed, I decided to have a first-round of validity scoring. I pinged three top-scientists, namely:</p>
<p>Dr Byram Bridle, Viral Immunologist</p>
<p>Dr Knut Wittkowski, Epidemiologist</p>
<p>Dr Mike Yeadon, Former Vice President and Chief Science Officer for Pfizer</p>
<p>And asked their thoughts in a few email exchanges.”

        <p>Lots of them will be, since this is the initial trial run of a new type of drug that didn't go through the normal rigorous testing process that takes several years.</p>
<p>I mean, unless it did and the pharma companies knew about covid back before it escaped the lab and were already developing a vaccine in anticipation of a scheduled pandemic.</p>
