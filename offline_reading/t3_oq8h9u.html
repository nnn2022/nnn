    <strong>Our hungarian neighbors have approved the 3rd vaccine shot to start from august the 1st and i'm really concerned romania will do the same</strong>
    <p><p>I dunno if anyone else from my country's on this sub , but still , i saw on the news they were talking about a government meeting in the following days to give benefits to the vaccinated and restrictions to the unvaxxed , such as restrictions to the places they're allowed to enter . They stated they want to follow the trend of other european countries , like france .</p>
<p>This is really concerning for me , i'm in the army so i know at some point they'll get me whether i want to or not , but i just want to hold out as much as i can until a tried and tested serum with much less severe side effects comes along .</p>
<p>I'm not scared of brain control or anything of the sorts , i'm just young and i don't want to die because of a damn overhyped flu shot , y'know ? </p>
<p>My grandma got the astra zeneca one , it was before the other serums were available in romania , and her GP practically threw her on a list of at risk people to be vaccinated . And the next 2 days she was basically tied to the bed , fever , muscle pain , dizziness , nausea , the whole 9 yards . My dad got the zeneca one as well as his workplace forced him to , and he felt like shit too but only for 1 day . Grandpa got the JnJ one , which he got because it's only 1 shot and done , and he even said "if they want me to do it again i ain't doin it".</p>
<p>I really hope the top brass either get satisfied with the results and decide to shut the show down , or i dunno we just get down and dirty if we have to .</p>
<p>I was planning on attending this year's F1 Austrian GP with my dad but covid shut that down , my local airsoft field is also still shut down . And the whole atmosphere of the city is just a lot more depressing , not that it was happy before , but it's a noticeable difference in mood.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to my rant , if it doesn't belong here , mods please take it down or tell me and i'll do it.</p>
<p>Have a good day , stay safe and don't get vaccinated if you don't believe it would benefit you.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, boosters are coming and that will change the definition of fully vaccinated. If you aren't up to date with the vax schedule, you will be cast out of society along with the rest of the "antivaxxers". That's why it was so important to resist the first shot.</p>

        <p>My neighbour who's up there in age just got his second dose and is laid out. It's been a couple of days now and he says it feels like the worst flu he's ever had. </p>
<p>It's absolutely criminal what these so called leaders are doing.</p>

        <p>I wouldnâ€™t worry about not being able to attend non essential events. Worry about the depopulation agenda, the effect on fertility, Antibody Dependant Enhancement, shit like that. Look at Doctors Geert Vanden Bossche, Mike Yeadon, Peter McCullough and Robert Malone. All censored by Silicon Valley, all say someone like you should definitely not take it.</p>
<p>Peace</p>
