    <strong>For people here living in the UK, what's your opinion on Sajid Javid's current rhetoric?</strong>
    <p><p>From reading news about the UK, it seems like Sajid is MUCH different compared to Hypocrite Hancock, and even Boris Johnson is so far ignoring pleas to extend restrictions/lockdowns past 19th July, which leads me to think two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The firing of Matt Hancock was planned, perhaps Boris also wanted to move on and wanted people to spy on Hancock to get him fired since his viewpoints were opposite, and then hire Sajid who is more in line with wanting to open up the UK. Seems to me that even Boris Johnson wants the UK to "learn to live with the virus" instead of Australia's stupid zero-covid goal, for example. It all seems too convenient, the timing of Hancock's departure and Sajid's arrival. Saw this theory on LockdownSkepticism that Hancock would've wanted to lockdown further which conflicted with Boris Johnson (Bojo)'s goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or they'll reopen on July 19, lockdown for the flu season, and then reopen completely in Spring 2022. Also saw this theory on LockdownSkepticism</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not in the UK so all I am going off are the news sources. For people actually living there, how is it so far?</p></p>

        <p>I don't believe a word he says. Until he actually does what he says and sticks to it then it's nothing more than hot air coming out of the face hole of a tory talking head.</p>
<p>As you said, I think this is just for good will before another winter lockdown. Because sage have bojo by the bollocks.</p>

        <p>He has literally said that vaccinated and unvaccinated people should be treated differently... he’s a bait and switch! No different than the ‘eat out to help out my mistress’ Hancock!</p>

        <p>In my opinion the Hancock affair and grope videos are theatrical hoaxes because yes, of course this is and always has been completely planned in advance.  These people are connected and the aides husband once dated a royal cousin. The aides father a chief exec of a pharmaceutical company. Oh, what an incredible coincidence. </p>
<p>The script is for the plebs to muse over. Hancock has committed crimes whilst in office which can now be brushed under the carpet. Plus you get a covid reprieve, for now. This isn't over. Half time oranges. Javid is just another controlled mouthpiece. His rhetoric is inconsequential, I will not comply with anything they say, unless of course someone wants to award me a multi million pound ppe contract and pay for me to go to Mustique. Of course that will not happen, I just have to pay my taxes and getocked down like a good little slave.</p>

        <p>It's impossible to tell.</p>
<p>It seems as though we've been very compliant in following measures and taking the vaccines, enough so that I think they can afford to relax the restrictions for now.</p>
<p>In the press briefings there is never any mention or acceptance of the group of people who will never want to take the vaccine. Even Boris said on Monday, that they still aim to have every adult vaccinated by September this year.
It used to be that every adult would be eligible and offered a vaccine but again, little movings of the goalposts.</p>
<p>The general consensus among the "experts" is that we are actually at the start of a third wave, that locking down would just be postponing the inevitable so instead of waiting for winter or spring to reopen let's do it now before the colder seasons.</p>
<p>My personal belief is that there's enough of a percentage of the population vaccinated so that it will be easy, and more believable, to blame an outbreak of illness amongst the vaccinated groups on the unvaccinated's refusal to get jabbed.
It's a rhetoric that's spreading, even at my volunteer position the other day my manager was aggressively declaring my colleagues and I's unvaccinated status as a health risk to herself.</p>
<p>So my theory is this is just a setup for all the bullshittery coming up. I aim to enjoy the summer while I can, pray to God that we're all wrong here or that if the worst case scenario hits that the government can at least retain some semblance of order so that society doesn't go tits up and I can at least study my degree.</p>

        <p>Sajid is a trustworthy servant who will look after the interests of people who pay his salary.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, that's JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Banks love lockdown <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/imf-paves-way-new-era-austerity-post-covid-19">because public assets get transferred to their debtors</a>. I'd be stunned if he's here for anything more than a 'restructuring' smash-and-grab, which will involve U-turns and loans until everyone else works for JP Morgan too.</p>

        <p>dont forget the covid legislation is on the books until september ( the start of flu season and plenty of time for the numerous effects of the injection to be wide spread )</p>
<p>this is also the time they want people taking their 'booster' injection <strong>AND</strong> a flu shot <strong>on the same day.</strong></p>
<p>add into the mix the unknown effect the flu will have on the immune systems of the injected.</p>
<p>deaths will spike and it will be blamed on a variant and the 'unvaccinated', I hope im wrong but it seems to me that this scenario is exactly what they want.</p>

        <p>The whole Hancock thing was a blatant set up, which at the time I felt was his own set up to get out of the job, he had shown gross incompetence,  gross fraud, literally anything that normally would have had him out and because Boris has "done worse" he was allowed to continue, he had to fall back on something he had condemned another for publicly so the news could do their pot kettle bullshit and virtue signal him out on principle. ( he was on record calling for Neil fergusons dalliance to lead to resignation) 
There is not a woman alive who would willingly shag that man ( without the duress of old money and the kind of alliances that innocent rich people base lifelong commitment on, think his wife is one of these, quietly dignified, pull the nightie down when you are done type) he is of the same level in my eyes as fucking someone who is mentally challenged. Or in the dark places in pornhub. Just no. The thought of him placing a hand on is enough for the uterus to scurry backwards within ones self screaming for fire and brimstone
. Just no. 
Javid was ushered out just before all this and at the time it was said he was in a clash with Dom Cummings but he left as Chancellor to go to Goldman sachs  ( I think I recall, this may be me lumping all the banking c words into their own bucket of shit together). Now Javid appears just as the government appears to say sod it, we break up on holiday on 22nd and don't plan to do any work til September, and everyone, the Britiah public are thrown into a petri dish together. 
There are a few things I want to say at this stage which I think are pertinent and will skew the figures to whatever their actual plan is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The current high cases are higher as the general population has been encouraged to take lateral flow tests. Parents of school children for example, twice a week. Children were NEVER advised to test previously when the rhetoric was they didn't catch it, we all knew they did. These asymptomatic, previously invisible cases are now showing officially on the PCR side. This means the 30000 cases vs ONLY 30 deaths is being portrayed as the vaccine works... but those 30 deaths may have only been from a pool of 3000 cases in the olden days when lateral flows weren't a thing. This makes it look like the vaccine works when actually it could be a very different story. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lateral flow tests are rumoured to be charged for from next month, meaning people will just stop doing them, sliding the scale back to how it was where the cases lower but the hospitalisation and deaths increase proportionately again. This will either be pushed as unvaxxed are causing a massive problem, or look its all ok let's continue to rub up against each other and actuallyake it far worse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double jabbed people, whom the ONS have quite openly showed in the data are dying more than unvaxxed, are allowed to travel unrestricted. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double jabbed no longer have to isolate in many circumstances, meaning work places won't lose staff to 10 day stay at home inconveniences. So the only way these will ever make it into any figures is if they get raging symptoms, again, making it look like unvaxxed are causing the problem. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make of that what you will, but from the beginning it's always been set up to look a certain way by omission. I am at the point where my brain is so fried by trying to compute it and deal with the lowest base reactions of the stupid I cannot for the life of me decide how this will go. </p>
<p>Sorry that was long but I had to brainfart it out here as its the only place one can do so anymore. Damn censorship.</p>
