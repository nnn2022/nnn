    <strong>EMPLOYER PURPOSEFULLY REFERS TO FACE MASKS AS “FACE COVERINGS” INSTEAD OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) TO AVOID LIABILITY</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve recently discovered that some employers are purposefully referring to these cloth masks and other face coverings as part of these mandates as strictly “face coverings”, most likely to avoid liability and additional financial burden to the company. While this may seem like a minor nuance, the difference between calling a cloth mask a face covering versus PPE (which it is by definition) are significant.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.mcrsafety.com/blog/ppe">here</a>: The official PPE definition from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (<a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/personalprotectiveequipment/">OSHA</a>) states that personal protective equipment is any equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries and illnesses.  </p>
<p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, any reasonable person would say that the intent of these mask mandates for wearing cloth masks, face coverings, and other equipment has been to protect others and to protect yourself from this airborne threat. Based on this, I would argue that any type of face covering is considered PPE.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132">OSHA law/standard 1910.132</a>, an employer must provide PPE to the employee that provides ADEQUATE protection from the intended threat, in this case Covid.</p>
<p>Some other notable sections</p>
<p><strong>1910.132(b)</strong></p>
<p><em>Employee-owned equipment</em>. Where employees <strong>provide their own protective equipment</strong>, the employer shall be responsible to assure its adequacy, including proper maintenance, and sanitation of such equipment.</p>
<p><strong>1910.132(e)</strong></p>
<p><em>Defective and damaged equipment</em>. <strong>Defective</strong> or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used.</p>
<p>The terms “defective” or “adequate” may be subjective in some cases, but in this case referring to this specific threat, the term adequate should be based on the CDC’s test standard for evaluating N95 masks. When worn properly, the N95 is scientifically proven to be effective at capturing airborne particulate. </p>
<p>I have an entire post detailing how this testing is performed along with test results <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mg2wid/effectiveness_of_common_masks_against_covid19/">here</a>. There are many other studies that conclusively show that cloth face masks and similar face coverings provide no protection against virus particulate. </p>
<p>If employers need to be providing adequate protection against Covid for their employees, then they need to provide them with N95 or higher levels of protection. However, this would be at an enormous cost since N95s are expensive and if this is required, the company would also need to initiate a fit test program for all of their employees wearing this protection. If companies are held to this standard and would be liable for employees contracting the virus as a result of ineffective PPE, the requirement to wear a face covering would be gone overnight.</p>
<p>By extension, if places of business require patrons to done PPE to enter, would it not also be the place of business’ responsibility to provide the customer with adequate PPE? By further extension, would governors be responsible if they told people to wear PPE that was known to be ineffective against the threat that it was intended to protect against?</p>
<p>I believe that there will be lawsuits soon that will hold these entities responsible based on these statements about PPE and what the obligations are of the entities that put these mandates in effect. Once these lawsuits start coming, watch these mask mandates start to be retracted.</p></p>

        <p>Why the theatrics? I just don't get why we're made to wear these masks when they don't work. </p>
<p>Let me be clear, masks work when used properly, but everyone with a piece of t-shirt stuck to their face is wearing a theater prop. I used to work in a hospital and we had to have a "mask fit test" to make sure our masks didn't have gaps around the edges. Otherwise they were considered ineffective.</p>

        <p>I missed this one.   But you bring up the points I've been asking my own employer for the past year.</p>
<p>I'm going to ask the dentist this question next time I go for a cleaning.   I'll see if they can get me a medical evaulation and fit test before I enter their waiting room.  :)</p>
