        <p>Those are islands, and their people seem to value human rights much less.
 Here in USA people seem to be forgetting what our nation stands for. Yes we are willing to trade deaths for freedom, and the unequal enforcement of lockdowns and restrictions are against the 14th amendment.
All I ask for is that our government be honest with us and give GOOD health advice, which they have completely failed to do. So no I will not follow their rules if they cannot properly represent us.</p>

        <p>I would argue that that they value human rights much higher. The Gini index in the US is 10 points higher than theirs. We actually have the same economic dispersion as .... drum roll... China, a corrupt communist country. Mortality rate for Covid for people over 80 yo is above 10%, over 70 yo around 8% if I recall correctly. If this was a condition killing 10% of babies everyone would be freaking out, wearing masks and getting vaccinates, but unfortunately as a society we value the life of older people less.</p>

<p>It's nice to see they are mostly back to normal, but make no mistake, they are only mostly back to normal and the precedent has been set that government knows best.</p>

        <p>We all are IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN,  that's how continents work. Australia has a massive influx of people from China and India. They just make them quarantine for two weeks when they come into the country. It worked. 25% of the population of Australia is born overseas, one in four Australia was born outside AU, do you know much international travel Australians do and how many people visit? Let's do the math :)
in 2019 they has 10 millions tourists that is for every 10 Australian there were 4 tourists.
In the US we have 80 millions the equivalent to two and a half tourist for every American. Australia has almost 60-70% (a lot of rounding done) more yearly tourist per year based on population. The isolation situation seems like an appropriate explanation. Regarding international airports, It makes sense that a country with a 10% of our population would have 10% of our airports.</p>

        <p>The US-Mexico and Canada border has been closed for non-citizens for 9 months. You must be a resident, a citizen or an essential worker to cross it. Just like in Australia, same quarantine measure can be applied in the border since citizen and greencard holders cross through ports of entry not smuggle through the desert.</p>

        <p>In the month of November alone, Border patrol apprehended 67,000 individuals trying to cross the border into the United States. Australia does NOT have to deal with a similar situation to that. Not to mention how many of those you mentioned (residents, citizens, etc.) who are traveling back and forth daily. Again, Australia doesn’t have to contend with this and you can’t quarantine people for 14 days who live in Mexico and work their essential job in the US and vice versa. If you can’t see that a country with the worlds busiest border can in anyway compare with an island in the Pacific, I don’t know what else to tell you.</p>

        <p>I mean we are reaching 200k cases per day, and those are not from freshly arriving immigrants. Can the system work if it’s not airtight? Yes, it can, that’s what masks and tracer are for. These island countries are not without outbreaks. Australia gets around 50K known illegal immigrants per boat per year. They even have a specific Island where they will send them if they catch them before making it to land. The US even takes of some of them as refugees. I get what you say about the essential workers (I guess you are referring to the Tijuana border as the busiest), yes we could ask them to quarantine and do daily rapid test even with its variance of accuracy, we just decided not to do so, but absolutely possible. Some of those essential workers are hospital worker, but the majority are not, the majority work in the service industry and within a close range from the border some. Crossing to the US takes 2-3 hours, you could literally test them as they start waiting to cross and have the results by the time the have done so.</p>
