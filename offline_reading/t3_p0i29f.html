    <strong>Things are starting to look a little better</strong>
    <p><p>There are more and more protests by the day. France is in their fourth week of massive protests. England protests the same, Italy started, many US States are against vaccine passports. They can't hide the fact that people are protesting anymore, its everywhere on the news. A few months ago, we heard nothing about any of the protests, now they are everywhere. Every day counts. The narrative is being lost. People are realising that this "pandemic" is a cover up for government power over the people and they are trying to resist. I believe soon the myth of the hospitals that are crowded will be officially debunked, same with the vaccine protection. Natural immunity and healthy lifestyle is what actually protects us, not this vaccine. It's only a matter of months. Now of course, a few countries might be forever lost, like Australia, Canada, South Africa, some US states like California and New York, but overall things will cool off. People can't stand it anymore. In my country, Romania we have the least restrictions, us and Bulgaria and hopefully things will stay like this. I want to be optimistic about this. DON'T get vaccinated at any cost. We are winning. Slow, but we are.</p></p>

        <p>There have never really been mass protest in the United States, but that's probably in part because our restrictions weren't as bad as most countries. Well, that, and with the restrictions being done by states rather than the federal government it would have been hard to form an anti-lockdown movement that existed across state lines.</p>
