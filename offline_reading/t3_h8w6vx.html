    <strong>Hunch: New Jesuit Pope's Dark Ages Pits Left vs. Right</strong>
    <p><p>COVID is catering to weak-minded able-bodied lazy people who want to get paid to play game while the poor are murdered by Police. </p>
<p>A new wave of stay-at-home UBI recipients has emerged, and will enjoy bliss locked in their homes. Still, some of them may be taken into forced labor, which is explicitly against the Constitution 'if not a punishment for a crime'. </p>
<p>Perhaps only the lockdown breakers and social distance violators will be forced to work...hmmmm...once the government has trained thousands of snitches, the criminals will be in high supply. </p>
<p>The forced labor camps  already being filled are penal institutions and later we will find out, concentration camps similar to those of the Hitler era. New chemicals and drugs and human experiments we won't learn about for untold years, will cause mass suffering and death on a grand scale. They are already spraying chemicals on ICE detainees without ventilation, and they are getting skin rashes and blowing noses with blood coming out. They are killing them! This is by design not incompetence!</p>
<p>Key fact: in this pandemic the government has the authority to cremate you. In NY some officials complain about religious burials and how inconvenient they are, but Cuomo promised his friends they would have burials. Still, I think he would break his promise, as he broke his oath to the Constitution and his constituency...</p>
<p>...Soon they will come, to snuff out the light, remember that the new Jesuit Pope is to blame. Do not blame your neighbors! The new Dark Ages has come! </p>
<p>My ancestors were Cathars and Frisians, and if you know their stories you will know they were decimated by religion. America was founded by Protestants wanting to read a book freely, and now in the Middle East newspapers are banned 'due to COVID'. Many places state they 'prefer' not to take money. </p>
<p>Cashless society is being pushed coupled with a loss of federal protection of health status, privacy, all civil rights and legal protections for once-free citizens. That means the government will soon force medication on people. It will be experimental medication. Nobody is safe! Save yourselves!</p></p>

        <p><em>Sigh</em></p>
<p>Shit like this is why we get labeled crazy conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>&rt;The forced labor camps already being filled are penal institutions and later we will find out, concentration camps similar to those of the Hitler era.</p>
<p>Where are these camps? So far there isn't any rounding up into camps, at this point it is mass house arrest. Bad and draconian but not Hitler levels as of yet. </p>
<p>&rt; New chemicals and drugs and human experiments we won't learn about for untold years, will cause mass suffering and death on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Nothing new.</p>
<p>&rt;Key fact: in this pandemic the government has the authority to cremate you. In NY some officials complain about religious burials and how inconvenient they are, but Cuomo promised his friends they would have burials.</p>
<p>I believe this idea was only thrown around by Doomers when NYC's infections were at peak, the virus never got bad enough to warrant this so the whole thing about mass/mandatory cremations never really came to fruition. </p>
<p>&rt;...Soon they will come, to snuff out the light, remember that the new Jesuit Pope is to blame. Do not blame your neighbors! The new Dark Ages has come!</p>
<p>What does the Pope have to do with this? The Pope doesn't even have much political influence on a global scale. Evidence points more towards China being the instigator of a lot of shit on a global scale, not the Pope, I don't even see how the Pope would do it.</p>
<p>&rt;My ancestors were Cathars and Frisians, and if you know their stories you will know they were decimated by religion.</p>
<p>Nice to know, bro. </p>
<p>&rt;America was founded by Protestants wanting to read a book freely</p>
<p>Wrong. There were many reasons colonies were set up in the new world, not just religion, the first successful English colonies were established for profit by private companies, America itself was founded much later due to tax disputes and political divergence between the colonists and British and later the desiring of self-governance.</p>
<p>&rt; the Middle East newspapers are banned 'due to COVID'.</p>
<p>Not like they had rights to begin with. </p>
<p>&rt;Cashless society is being pushed coupled with a loss of federal protection of health status</p>
<p>To be fair this was the trend long, <em>long</em>, before the lockdowns came about.</p>
<p>&rt; That means the government will soon force medication on people. It will be experimental medication.</p>
<p>Probably the only part of this post I agree with. I can see the government possibly doing that if they keep getting away with shit, doesn't change the fact the rest of this post is incoherent rambling.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't understand why you made this post. You can easily point out the Orwellian nature of the "new normal" without making it into something it's clearly not.</p>

<p><em>you hear rummaging</em></p>
<p>...https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2020/05/08/coronavirus-patient-arrested-after-leaving-nashville-quarantine/3098005001/</p>
<p>Arrested for escaping a camp he was put in for his own safety.</p>
<p>If those camps start do what ICE is doing to immigrants, you owe me an apology, if not we will all laugh about it anyways so no harm done.
 https://news.yahoo.com/immigrant-detainees-say-ice-is-using-coronavirus-disinfectant-sprays-that-cause-bleeding-burns-and-pain-170426900.html</p>
<p>Doused with chemicals without ventilation causing deleterious effects.</p>
<p>Oh FYI I said the government has the authority to cremate you. I didn't claim this was happening yet on a mass scale. I predict it will.</p>
<p>The post was admittely a hunch, and so your anger at me for freely thinking and using my mind- your calling me names and labelling me as crazy right out of the gate...you already owe me an apology for that one.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>You are talking to the eldest son of the eldest son, for generations, of the fiercest ancient barbarian resistance to the Roman Empire, and I am prepared to lead the next one!</p>

        <p>Not quite camps, but okay.</p>
<p>I agree with you about how fucked up and Orwellian this shit all is, but no need to make it out to be something it isn't. I do not know where you get the idea it's some secret grand plan by the Catholics trying to take over the world, especially since there are plenty of pointers towards the culprits behind the current situation such as China, elite politicians, corporate moguls, etc.</p>
<p>lmao I am not "angry" at you, I just think this post is dumb. No, I do not owe you an apology for anything.</p>

<p>Okay this is becoming fucking entertainment.</p>

        <p>Is this entertaining? You aren't taking this seriously. Many remember the Nazi concentration camps and some still remember the dark ages. The Roman Inquisition never ended. It merely changed names twice to become the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It is said to not enforce its rules, but I worry there are signals when such enforcement will happen again. As the Inquisition was a model for what became the judicial system (Roman Law yes, but developements were made in the Dark Ages). Now with 9/11, a war of revenge pushed and accepted by US Catholic Bishops as 'just', new laws against Anti-Terrorism were created to justify the worst oppression for the most bleeding-heart, trumped up charges one can find (the crime of thought).</p>
<p>I was a soldier in Kuwait and Iraq. I may have unwittingly supplied ISIS, a likely fictitious enemy used to invade Syria and build oppressive laws in many countries and at home. Inter-national organizations declaring an end to terrorism have been forged. The machinations of control have been built, and already they are being pushed against protesters and other people with civil rights. We developed war systems to control Iraqi citizens and used 'advanced interogation' and tracking to control an entire country. It is my believe those techniques will be used against common citizens. Such torture and interogations and secret courts are reminiscent of the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>So I have elaborated on why I believe what I believe. Still think I am a fool? Then you must be blind or ignorant, if that is true. I am telling you of relevant history that has been documented, of which nearly everyone is aware. Are you living under a rock??</p>
<p>Here is Trump swearing to sell out America to the Jesuits at the Al Smith Memorial Dinner in 2016. He admitted he attended since childhood yearly, when he was brought by his father </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/mpR96zVrmNY</p>
<p>Here is Trump saying openly that he is a pro-Catholic leader,  https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2020/04/trump-says-hes-best-president-in-history-of-the-church-in-call-with-catholic-leaders/</p>
<p>See, each time you have a concern I have information for you, which you appear to not be aware of.</p>
<p>Sonplease stop with ad hominem attacks and your clown antics. You should take this with the utmost seriousness. Of the 15 amendments to the US Constitution, all but arguably 1, have been suspended. Barr even requested to suspend Habeus Corpus but was denied.</p>
<p>There is certainly a storm brewing over America and it is starting to really pour down now. Please do pay attention and try to understand. Thank you .</p>
