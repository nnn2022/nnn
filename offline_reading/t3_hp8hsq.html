        <p>Yesterday someone commented the people that seem to be in most favor of a lockdown have a nice house, husbands/wives or partners, kids, a job where they can work from home, a steady income, or other factors. It makes sense that they would be the most pro lockdown, being as they‚Äôve lived and don‚Äôt mind waiting this out as long as it needs. But they don‚Äôt care about those who haven‚Äôt reached those milestones yet. </p>
<p>Their response is either ‚Äúhow selfish can you be to think of yourself?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúToughen up, suck it up, nobody‚Äôs dreams come true, your plans can wait, people are dying.‚Äù And they have the nerve to call others selfish for just wanting to live a regular human existence.</p>

        <p>We are not the norm then, my husband and I hate this and think it‚Äôs total bullshit. Although, I can see that would be the people pushing it. We have a bunch in our neighborhood that seem ok with this shit, but at least one neighbor feels the way we do. I don‚Äôt think anything should be forced on any human being. This all sickens me daily and causes great stress. We don‚Äôt mask up and we won‚Äôt be sending our kids back to public school in this environment.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Well I have three boys and two older ones are already homeschooled(that‚Äôs a whole other issue, war on boys type thing) but my youngest was doing well and had friends he will miss but no way I‚Äôm putting masks and ridiculous rules on my nine year old. Not to mention the blatant political propaganda the district started sending about BLM, I don‚Äôt know what their end goals are but they do not revolve around the education of our youth.</p>

        <p>You should tell your kids to start a movement with their peers to combat the new normal bullshit. I‚Äôm 16 and if my school tries anything short of normal I‚Äôm getting as many of my peers as I can to protest the schools bullshit until they cave. I wish I had parents like you who saw through the bullshit, but my parents love the lockdown since they‚Äôve lived most of their lives, have a stable income, and have seen no change in their lives besides a quicker commute and getting to virtue signal by wearing 2 masks in the car alone. Also because they worship the government and media.</p>

        <p>Yup this describes my sister. She‚Äôs a nurse who says the classic phrases: ‚Äúthings opened too early,‚Äù ‚Äúrising cases,‚Äù etc. She has a nice house, husband, and daughter. Meanwhile I‚Äôm 23 and my life is put on hold indefinitely. She hasn‚Äôt called me selfish for my current anger, but I‚Äôm sure she thinks I‚Äôm ignorant because people have died, or something. But I know for a fact if my sister were my age she would have been against this from the start.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs hilarious though because my brother in law actually had the virus and he thinks the new normal‚Ñ¢Ô∏èis stupid.</p>

<p>A lot of people around here harp on work from home people, as if they're all having a great time, and are pro-lockdown monsters, but I think there's many people out there who miss their offices and jobs that they did outside their homes.</p>

        <p>I think there's also just people who are too terrified of the virus to go back to normal, and they are just waiting for "permission" from the government/the media to go back to normal. Politics is a factor, of course, but they <em>tend</em> to trust the left leaning media like CNN over the alternatives.</p>

        <p>Why can‚Äôt we pay people to stay home? Everyone who wants to quarantine should be paid, but the catch is they CAN‚ÄôT leave the house ever. Everyone else who wants to rebuild the economy and socialize can have their jobs and be out in public without distancing or masks or any of the bullshit. We‚Äôd basically be paying to keep the most annoying and destructive people out of the way. Society would be SO NICE without them around, it would be worth it.</p>

        <p>As a life-long Californian, please send the "safety state" people to Michigan or New York City.  I don't want them here.   That includes Hollywood, Nancy Pelosi, Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris,  they can go too.  Get them out of my state.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that I‚Äôm the last year or two the concept of UBI was introduced to Americans by way of figures like Andrew Yang. Prior to that I‚Äôd never really seen any mainstream discussion of it.</p>

        <p>I think the one good thing about the lockdown is people being forced to define their identities by something more than where they work. Hopefully they take advantage of that.</p>

        <p>I used to get physically ill when I had to drive myself to work. I was working a degrading job, going to school fulltime, and it was incredibly draining. being at home has been a vacation for me, and there are millions in my situation:terrible job, long commute, draining schoolwork, stress, unsatisfied with life. Why would we want to go back to that? </p>
<p>Obviously, I care about civil liberties and I don't want the government shutting down our civil liberties forever, but I am showing the perspective that many do not see: there were so many miserable people, driving 2-3 hours to a job they hate, why wouldn't they want to stay home and get a check? especially if you have nice amenities at home, or a decent social life with your partner/family/roommates, that's much better than getting yelled at by karens all day or getting bullied by an incompetent boss.</p>
