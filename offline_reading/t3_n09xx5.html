    <strong>The real reason we don’t do jack-all to stop the oncoming tyranny (except complain on the internet).</strong>
    <p><p>It’s because we’re not united. And we’re not united because we just want to be left alone and do our thing. We have this false idea that “maybe it’s not that bad” or “this isn’t yet the time.”</p>
<p>The reason we’re not united is because we don’t have a leader to unite us. No one wants to be the first guy who initiates the revolution only to look back and see that no one is following him. It’s the prisoner’s dilemma. </p>
<p>We had an opportunity to do something on January 6th, but we didn’t do it—actually, more importantly Trump didn’t do it. </p>
<p>He let us down. </p>
<p>How? Simple: He didn’t lead the march onto the Capitol building. </p>
<p>If he walked down to the capitol building, leading the charge, then all of the republican traitors, and Mike Pence especially—would have been forced to send back the votes to the states to undo the results of an obviously fraudulent election. Instead: we get these individuals being labeled as radical domestic terrorists and one-by-one hunted down by the FBI and set in front of a kangaroo court. </p>
<p>The protest on January 6th was about 1% as violent as the average BLM protest and yet it was labeled an “insurrection” — by the evil media. </p>
<p>We thought we had a leader in Trump &amp; Pence. Pence betrayed us at the most important possible moment and Trump abandoned the people that he himself rallied. Now you can say whatever you want about why Trump wasn’t with them (secret service wouldn’t let him, etc.) but the simple fact remains that his participation in the March and the “storming” (most polite storming I’ve ever seen) of the Capitol building would have radically changed everything.</p>
<p>When BLM rioters decide to attack people, they have a massive bail-out fund. When they get hauled in front of a court, their DNC lords issue light/non-sentences. (Remember bike-lock guy? Attempted murderer walks free, while a guy dressed as a Viking gets sentenced to years away from his family for simply being present in the capitol building).</p>
<p>The Fact is this: without a leader to unite behind then it is foolish to do anything but stay low and make our personal apocalypse plans.</p></p>
