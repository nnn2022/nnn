        <p>Ugh good lord. I live near Boston, which has pretty much hit herd immunity levels. But now my work has been obsessed about planning for the second wave. One of my close friends, who was somewhat anti-doomer, is now getting into doomer mode about the second wave. Worried that others I know who were starting to see through the foolish lockdowns will now take a step backward in their perception with this “second wave” fear mongering.</p>

        <p>I'm sure they'll find a way to manufacture a second wave, if they want to, and it seems they are gunning for it. </p>
<p>Fauci ain't hiding worth a damn. Why would he? People are still kissing his ass for the most part. I'm pretty sure he made some kind of statements recently, I just don't care to follow him. I still see people on our side supporting him, and wishy-washily defending him. Sad.</p>

        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; But with the official start of fall a mere 23 days away, epidemiologists and medical scientists have bad news: A dreaded second wave is almost inevitable. It’s just a matter of how bad the outbreak will be in New Jersey.</p>
<p>&rt; In a matter of weeks, temperatures will drop and outdoor activities and gatherings will become less tenable, forcing many to move inside. Students in some districts will also be back in classrooms. Other reopening measures — including indoor dining — are also expected to be in operation by then. With the religious holidays in September and October, and then Thanksgiving soon after, large family gatherings are inevitable.</p>
<p>&rt; Those factors could form a combustible combination that will almost undoubtedly lead to a surge in infections across New Jersey over the coming months, experts said.</p>
<p>&rt; “My prediction is that it will get worse in the fall,” said Martin Blaser, director of Rutgers’ Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine and a professor of medicine and microbiology. “I’m hopeful and I think it’s reasonable to expect it will not be as bad as it was in March and April because we’re a lot smarter now than we were then. But there will be thousands more cases and there will be more deaths.”</p>
<p>&rt; It’s not all doom and gloom, however. Several of the state mandates in place — such as requiring residents to wear masks indoors, limiting the number of patrons in gyms and restricting indoor dining to 25 % of a restaurant’s capacity — are expected to help curtail the chance of a significant COVID-19 resurgence. It also will help that many school districts plan to begin the year with all-remote learning, and large social gatherings and full-capacity indoor dining still will mostly be banned.</p>
<p>&rt; How seriously residents continue taking precautions like washing their hands frequently, not touching their faces and maintaining social distancing in public and private will go a long way toward determining the extent of a second wave in the fall, experts added.
“I don’t want to see a surge. None of us want to,” said Judith Lightfoot, the chief of infectious disease at Rowan University. 
&rt; “Everybody says, ‘We’re tired of this.’ I understand that we are. But we’re going to be out of it soon. If we just hold on, we can avoid a surge. With proper PPE, social distancing and safety techniques, we can avoid the surge.”</p>
<p>&rt; Yet there is one significant factor complicating the possibility of a second wave: The start of cold and flu season, usually around the middle of October. Since COVID-19 and influenza often have similar symptoms, especially in the early stages of the viruses, experts are anticipating plenty of confusion.</p>
<p>&rt; Some experts fear some people who contract COVID-19 might instead believe they have the flu, which could lead the novel virus to spread further if those people don’t quarantine. It’s one of the major reasons medical experts are encouraging residents — more than ever before — to get their flu vaccinations this year.</p>
<p>&rt; “If you’re home and you get a fever and a cough, how do you know what you have?” Blaser said. “There’s going to be a lot of uncertainty, and there will be a lot of trips to the emergency room because people want to be cautious.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; But Blaser and other experts cautioned: The coronavirus is still here in New Jersey, even though numbers have dropped precipitously. The state is reporting roughly 300 new cases of infection each day — a significant drop from the peak in March and April of about 4,000 per day. But the number of new cases is still enough to make controlling the disease an issue.</p>
<p>&rt; Samuel Wang, a professor of neuroscience and quantitative and computational biology at Princeton University, said it will be important for the state government to be nimble in re-implementing restrictions if circumstances change.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>“If the case rate starts to grow again, the first step would be tougher enforcement of existing measures, since compliance seems to be dropping slightly,” he said.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; And if the state can’t corral the rate of infection, the next steps “would be to reinstitute shelter-in-place and close of nonessential businesses and other activities,” he added.</p>
<p>&rt; Some experts said those drastic measures most likely will not be necessary. But it all depends on how seriously New Jerseyans continue taking the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; “The second wave is coming,” Blaser said. “But with luck and with care and preparation, it could be a small wave. It doesn’t have to be a tsunami. It could just be a little ripple. But that will be up to us, collectively.”</p>

        <p>We were one of the states that locked down hard and for the longest, and we’ve had a very slow reopening so I’m thinking there’s a good chance  we won’t get a second wave. They’ll probably be some case spikes and the reopening could be paused but not enough to warrant a new stay at home order and put the state back into lockdown mode.</p>
