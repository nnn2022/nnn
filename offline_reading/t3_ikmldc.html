    <strong>My new normal</strong>
    <p><p>In the past six months: </p>
<p>I've put together a wonderful burn-worthy dead-tree library and have augmented my metalworking workshop considerably. I eat food exclusively prepared by myself or my mother, and I have written a book based on a new orthography I have created for the purposes of transcribing copper chasing/repousse "books" that will, hopefully, survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>I have stopped participating in cultural things almost entirely and will never watch another sporting event unless it is a small place with people I know and/or would like a likelihood to theoretically care about (some sort of competitive local softball league, a good game of 3-cushion pool somewhere). The same can be said of movies, concerts, and so on, which I believe they are dangling as a kind of carrot, but which I am happy to do away with entirely,<em>—forever. kbye.—</em>, and have made a blood oath to my ancestors to do so.</p>
<p>In case the Socialists win, I have rebranded myself as an asexual desert 8er Ismaili paladin, which, as a white man, gives me <strong>six</strong> notches on the grievance scale (one for Muslim, one for Shia, one for Ismaili, one for 8er, one because I made 8er up entirely, and one for asexual), which might come in handy at some point when it comes to getting onto the right cattle car.</p>
<p>I know the new normal is supposed to be about masks and dots, but I am not finding it to be like that at all.</p></p>

        <p>I've decided to play golf. It's one of the few activities I can even do out in public. In my small extremely liberal leaning town it also seems to be the only place where people don't give a fuck about masks and think this is all bullshit. Trying to break 100 before there's a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I’ve gone back to golf the last few months too. I’m assisted to it again now and can’t stop myself from sneaking off to the driving range in the middle of the work day.</p>

        <p>Our golf course has quail families, the three closest of whom I now know, and they know me, because they get old hard biscuits, corn flakes, and suchlike. (Not enough to make them spoiled.) The middle family's babies just got their head noodle. The hummingbirds are all fat and maybe way more territorial and hierarchical than one might have guessed, given the abundance of hummingbird feeders around. The geese are gone for the moment but they will be back soon. The coyotes still have plenty of cotton tail and jacks to make friends with. Roadrunners continue to sound weird and eat birdbabies and eggs.</p>
