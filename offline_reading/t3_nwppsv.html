        <p>I love that these researchers insist they can take excess deaths and blame them exclusively on covid.</p>
<p>In my province, we had 900 covid deaths in 2020... But we had 1700+ overdose deaths. That was an increase in overdose deaths from about 1100 the year before.</p>
<p>This is just one example that shows the flaw of assuming you can use excess death data to exclusively find covid deaths.</p>
<p>Clearly the Lockdowns and their effect on mental health and the drug supply led to a massive increase in overdoses, and yet that doesn't have anything to do with covid infections directly.</p>

        <p>Did you actually read the source? I’m guessing not. It clearly states that the excess deaths against 2015-2019 in the US was 25%. But being responsible scientists they carefully adjusted for these for other factors and found that a more realistic number was 20% (which is what’s shown on this graph). </p>
<p>20% excess deaths in a year is not explained by things like worsening mental health and you’re in fantasy land if you think it is</p>

        <p>Do you have any proof to back that up?</p>
<p>Of course not...</p>
<p>This is a metadata analysis that is being used as an excuse to push a doomer agenda.</p>
<p>The reality is that nobody has properly accounted covid deaths or deaths from other causes.</p>
<p>In fact every time I see these claims, I'm reminded of the fact that we actually have more evidence for covid death over counts than for covid death undercounts.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of covid deaths in Ontario and Quebec attributed to care homes which the military released a report on... And low and behold... Those "covid deaths" were actually from starvation, thirst and loneliness.</p>
<p>So keep pushing your doomer narrative if it makes you feel better about abandoning all of your civil rights over an illness that killed 3 million when cancer killed 9 and heart disease 18 million over the same period.</p>

        <p>I am the one who is quoting proper sources and your are asking me for proof? Everyone on this thread is saying “well it’s probably medical malpractice” or “mental health” or “loneliness” anything else that doesn’t challenge your world view. </p>
<p>Yes we should be doing more to tackle heart disease and cancer but if wasn’t for lock downs and vaccines then COVID deaths could have been many times higher</p>

        <p>That's your assumption.</p>
<p>Sweden didn't go with national lock downs and their death rate was lower than the UK or USA.</p>
<p>Depression and loneliness have an immense impact on human health, modern science still doesn't know the full impact.</p>
<p>To assume that things would have been better is just that, an assumption.</p>
<p>How much healthier would everyone have been if there had been less fear and panic and more calm and reasoned explanation of what was going on? That's what we saw in Sweden and you can't discount that effect.</p>

        <p>First of all, the "expected deaths" are improperly calculated. For instance in America, the average death age is currently 78.54 years according to google.</p>
<p>Now I couldnt find precise birth-rates, but:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infoplease.com/us/population/live-births-and-birth-rates-year">https://www.infoplease.com/us/population/live-births-and-birth-rates-year</a></p>
<p>shows a rising trend in births in the years 1935-1945. This increase is not accounted for in your data. And Im sure I could find more reason why the % are innacurate if I actually would care to do so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More Importantly:</p>
<p>It completely dismisses any notion of other crucial factors on longetiv and mortality that happend 2020.</p>

        <p>No it really doesn’t dismiss other factors - it treats them seriously. And I wouldn’t try to claim every single one of these extra deaths is COVID but 20% is huge and to suggest anything other than COVID could be responsible - that anything else has changed by a sufficient degree is utter madness</p>

        <p>This shows the level of ignorance you have for life and death. You really shouldnt be talking about these things if you are so completely unaware. </p>

        <p>First, from the article: "Annual deaths have been rising in the US, Canada and Japan, so excess deaths based on the average are overestimates."</p>
<p>Second, breakdown of cause is still relevant. One example is a rapid rise in overdose deaths. Those need to be attributed to government lockdown, not covid.</p>
<p>Third, demographic information is relevant. The cold math of years of life lost and quality of life must be taken into consideration.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, a 5-20% increase in expected deaths will look like a small bump in terms of history. Its no global emergency, apocalypse, or great plague. </p>
<p>The lag effect damage to the economy, civil liberties, and overall health of the pipulation from government overreaction and mass hysteria will be an order of magnitude greater than the virus itself. </p>

        <p>Sorry, but you don't know me or what I did from a couple of paragraphs on Reddit. Nor can you prove how effective lockdowns have been at saving anyone. Governments continually fail to back up their policies with evidence, and there are far more examples and studies of the lack of effectiveness of lockdowns. Finally, I'm not excitedly crowing, I'm snuggly saying I told you so to anyone I can, because I've been consistent in this since day one. So there.</p>

        <p>Have you got any idea how big 20% excess deaths in a year is? If medical malpractice accounts for 10% of US deaths then to give an excess deaths of 20% then US Doctors would have be killing multiple times as many people as in the previous year. Come on dude, really?</p>

        <p>I'd have to go back and find a page before you'll believe the publicly-available information, I think, but here is the basic formula being used by the cdc and WHO to count covid deaths, and <em>only</em> for covid. </p>
<p>Excess deaths = total deaths 2020 - ((average total deaths 2010-2019) ÷ (average total population 2010- 2019))</p>
<p>This is a very legitimate looking formula, and would in fact be usable, but only if the total population remains static during that time frame. If the population is changing, it throws off the result, creating an inflated excess death count if the population was trending upward, and a deflated result if the population was trending downward. </p>
<p>A more honest way to define excess deaths would be something like:</p>
<p>(total deaths 2020÷total pop 2020) = mortality rate 2020</p>
<p>(Average deaths 2010-2019)÷(average pop 2010-2019) = average mortality rate</p>
<p>(Mortality rate 2020- average mortality rate = percentage of excess)</p>
<p>Percentage of excess × total population 2020 = excess deaths.</p>
<p>Now, that still wouldn't be the same as saying all those deaths are caused by covid, but it would at least get you a less misleading statistic.</p>
