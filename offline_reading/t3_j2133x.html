        <p>Sharing because I didn't see this here.  I've liked Dr. Bush's take on this from the get go.  </p>
<p>He touches a tiny bit on what people have discussed around "exosomes" while expanding on what that means for us.  He also discusses why viruses are actually critical to all life including the microbiome (which he differentiates from viruses being that they are "alive" and not just encapsulated genetic material).  </p>
<p>He presents a very different yet sobering take on viruses.  He also points out how Hydroxychloroquine being another anti-___ could encourage resistant strains of malaria and other protozoans to flourish.  This is less of a take on the C0rona thing than it is on our entire stance on microbes in general.  We have a pretty hostile war like relationship that isn't based on how things tend to interact systems-wise in nature. As others have noted we have censored anyone trying to encourage people to take care of their health holistically in response to this p@ndemic as well.  </p>
<p>I hope this is as helpful for others as it was for me.  He also presents data that encourages us to think of ourselves as needing these little critters we co-exist with because they perform so many functions we need yet we attack them with hand sanitizers, anti-biotics, etc and use herbicides/pesticides which are killing our living soil (which is dependent on microbial life to generate nutrients etc.  </p>
<p>I still personally think there is more to the whole R0na thing in that some of the symptoms as he pointed out in another talk almost resemble a poisoning like thing (paraphrasing here so not exactly what he said). I know someone whose sister got sick with something that is now causing her hair to fall out which does not make any sense to me as a flu.  I think they are twisting the flu numbers in with the R0na thing to distort data but obfuscating something else that is happening. I've got my obscure theories with no data to back them up but ... anyhow enjoy the talk.</p>
