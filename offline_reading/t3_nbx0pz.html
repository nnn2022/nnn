    <strong>I'm vaccinated but I won't be flashing my card around and won't ever sign up for a vaccine passport.</strong>
    <p><p>I got vaccinated not because I wanted to, but due to people I live with who were high risk I had to get it. Just so they wouldn't blame me for being a spreader or whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway I still don't believe that vaccinated and unvaccinated people should live separate lives. So you know what? If I go somewhere and they ask or "require" proof I got the vaccine I just won't go there. Even though I can literally show them proof I feel uncomfortable about it. Not just for me, but for anyone else who just wants to go somewhere and not be required to show their vaccinated.</p>
<p>People don't see the big picture but I do. These "small" additions from having to wear a mask to having to show you got vaccinated is just the start. If they were to be accepted as new rules to how we live our lives who's to say there won't be even more additions? I mean heck they literally at one point wanted us to wear two masks. TWO! If we allow these changes then there's no telling what they can continue to force onto us as long as we comply.</p>
<p>If you're healthy and don't get vaccinated you shouldn't be treated like you're some kind of freak. If you wear a mask because it makes you feel better fine go ahead! Don't just wear it because you're to worried about what other people will say. I've lived that life and let me tell you it's miserable as fuck.</p></p>

        <p>Not that I want to tell you how to live your life, but I might slightly disagree with you on one point. When they require that you show proof of vaccination, you could show them the proof, then tell them that you do not want to go there anymore due to what they are doing. That way they know you are not full of shit, it might help to better get the message across to some people. Then again, I realize that is a bit more confrontational, so I understand not wanting to pick a fight.</p>

        <p>The point is to not succumb to the force of showing medical proof of the vaccination. If she proves she has the vaccination, then says she won’t go there anymore, she indeed succumbed to exactly what this thread is fighting against— having to show proof of vaccination.</p>

        <p>Showing proof and then stating your refusal to do business with them shows them that they are losing money to their nonsense requirements. </p>
<p>We need to keep an eye on the difference between "the system" and eachother. Small or locally owned businesses and restaurants will listen when you vote with your dollar.</p>
<p>The airport, government services and large businesses / restaurants should be treated like the system - your logic makes sense there.</p>

        <p>Fair play. I am on the fence, and it's a difficult decision. I have a job which requires international travel and obviously they will enforce vaccine passports. I haven't left the country (UK) in 15 months.</p>
<p>My vaccine will be called in the next few weeks. It's insane that you have to make this decision... You can earn a living and be acceptable to the community but you must be a guinea pig. I think I will refuse, but respect your decision and good that you stand by people like me.</p>

        <p>Good shout. I wouldn't know where to start. Generally healthy, so don't go to the doctor. I did have 'Covid' tested positive about 6 months ago. I'm hoping that would help things. I think they will be strict on me getting the vaccine if I want to travel.</p>

        <p>Assume you will need the vaccine to do literally everything. Now, are you okay with accepting that tomorrow are is your brain panicking mildly at the thought and looking for a way out? Idk one but there’s time to find one. Don’t trust your doctors unless they are private aka extremely expensive and you’re one of only a handful of patients. That’s hardly anyone’s scenario. Start hunting, start researching. It’s gonna become join or die (or cheat)</p>

        <p>Are any of the vaccines MHRA approved over there yet? Or is it still whatever your equivalent of "Emergency Use Authorization" is? The argument could be made that coercing the vaccine without full MHRA approval constitutes making you an unwilling medical test subject, which violates the Nuremberg Code.</p>
<p>Also might wanna check and see what HSE says about it. Over here, OSHA has declared that if a vaccine is mandated as a condition of employment, then any adverse effects are reportable as workplace injuries, meaning the employer incurs all costs involved <em>and</em> takes a hit to their safety rating. Could definitely be worth seeing if HSE has made a similar declaration.</p>
