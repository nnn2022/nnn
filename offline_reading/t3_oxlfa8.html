    <strong>Sympathetic pro-vaxx physician hoping for some open discourse</strong>
    <p><p>I think the behavior and dishonesty of the media and most vaccinated individuals is causing more harm then good.  Your decisions to get the vaccine or not get the vaccine is yours and yours alone. You are not crazy, conspiratorial or a murderer cause you aren’t vaccinated, you simply made a choice based off what you felt was best for you.  You are also not a sheep, stupid or willfully ignorant if you are vaccinated, you simply made a choice based off what you felt was best for you </p>
<p>The reality is the vast majority of people who are or are not vaccinated have little to no knowledge on the topic. Most peoples opinions where already made up regardless of the science.  There are a few people on both sides who know what they are talking about and both have valid points, these people need to come together and help get to the truth of the situation, and these people also need to hold their own accountable </p>
<p>The few people on COVIDIOTS who know what they are saying need to be upfront with what we do and do not know, anyone making claims these vaccines have no side effects or that we know for sure the vaccines can decrease spread is lying.</p>
<p>The few people on NNN who know what they are saying need to be upfront as well. Anyone making claims this virus isn’t real or to deny the vaccines are decreasing death and symptoms in the vaccinated population is lying as well</p>
<p>Science and medicine are not politics, they are not up for debate. There is a right answer and as long as we divided we will never get out of this.  It genuinely terrifies me that we live in a world where scientific fact is not based on opinion and not data, it is more terrifying then the pandemic itself in my opinion </p>
<p>I know this topic is emotional and for a lot of people they will read what I wrote and assume I am a sheep or a shil and will put their fingers in their ears and refuse to listen, but for those of you who are open to discussion I am more then willing to talk infact I look forward too it</p>
<p>Edit:  I’m aware science is up for debate, it was poor wording on my part, science always changing. A better way to say this is science meant to be debated with more science not emotions or political ideology.  Poor wording I guess, also it’s weak argument and just a gotcha question</p>
<p>Shout out to styx and few others though who came at this to discuss and talk science not jump on my sentence structure</p></p>

        <p>Alright my wording was not ideal </p>
<p>Science and medicine are always influx and always changing and need to be debated </p>
<p>I see your point </p>
<p>What I meant is that emotions and science are not one in the same </p>
<p>An honest and open debate is needed and necessary, a dishonest debate is a problem </p>
<p>Those who blindly follow science without understanding it are wrong</p>
<p>Those who blindly refute science are wrong as well </p>
<p>The line in the sand for science and medicine should not correlated with the line in the sand that separates political parties, hopefully that makes more sense</p>

        <p>Sure.</p>
<p>But that’s the thing.</p>
<p>Science isn’t political and should always be up for debate. Yet interestingly enough everyone that wants to take the other side of the debate is labeled “far right” “trump supporters” “radical anti vaxxers”.</p>
<p>There are people all over the political spectrum that point to the clear science showing major issues with the vaccines. Yet there is an intentional mass media effort to make it appear to be political—this is to divide people.</p>

        <p>Agreed, but you can’t point to the flaws with the vaccine without point to it’s benefits, and by no means am I claiming you are doing this </p>
<p>The media is not the medical community, the government is not the medical community </p>
<p>Censoring and silencing those with alternative believes is and always is wrong and makes things worse </p>
<p>But if I’m willing to acknowledge they are doing this you should the very least acknowledge the reasons as to why they are doing this </p>
<p>Is it a cover up cause something much worse is happening? Or is it a coverup cause they feel that people calling attention to flaws in the vaccine will slow down the process of herd immunity </p>
<p>They are lying and being misleading but it doesn’t mean they are lying to cause harm </p>
<p>If you’re friend asks if they look fat you may say lie and say no, and you do this with good intentions </p>
<p>I feel that analogy doesn’t do my point justice but we will see</p>

        <p>“Science is not up for debate”. Like FFS. SCIENCE IS DEBATE. IT IS A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH YOU TEST THEORIES. YOU TEST THEM AND TEST THEM AND BEST CASE ALL YOU CAN EVER SAY IS THAT YOUR THEORY HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN WRONG. </p>

        <p>Agreed, but to discredit what we do know because some things are not 100% known is also dishonest. Science is never 100%, we use the scientific method to DISPROVE things not prove them. Nothing and I mean nothing not even the laws of gravity are 100%, any and all scientific “facts” can be proven wrong at any time. So to approach this with such a strict standard or excellence is not fair or realistic </p>
<p>By all means this is not ideal, I do not claim that we have the 10 year, 20 year of 100 year data to back up these vaccines, but we don’t have 10/20/100 years this unfortunately is a rage against time </p>
<p>For those of you who don’t feel the mRNA is researched enough you may be right, I personally think it is wonderful technology that may do a lot of good, but I make this claim knowing the longitudinal data is not out yet </p>
<p>But we have “old school vaccines” the J&amp;J is old tech with lots of decades of data behind it. By all means J&amp;J has more acute phase (aka side effects within a month of inoculation) side effects which to me is a sign of the mRNA working better </p>
<p>The real question the genuine deciding factor is if the vaccine stops spread, if it doesn’t this vaccine is useless. Besides high risk patients and the elderly</p>

        <p>Okay so I’ve had covid and as of 6 weeks ago have T-cell immunity. So, I’m not concerned with effectiveness (although we could get into effectiveness and I’d like to specifically draw your attention to Israel), and since there’s no upside for me, it better have a safety profile equivalent to a saline injection. It doesn’t. There’s only downside risk for me.</p>
<p>I also think it’s amazing technology. I have, truly, I believe read ALL (and I mean all) of the scientific literature on gene therapy over the past 20 years (and mRNA specifically over the past 10 years). Based on that, I’m not comfortable with the “vaccines”. Especially not for the covid vaccines which code for the spike protein antigen, which we now know leaves the deltoid, enters circulation and does god knows what else. </p>
<p>Also, J&amp;J is not old school. It’s gene therapy delivered through a viral vector. Never been brought to market before.</p>

<p>Can you point to a specific possibility? Or are we saying that because we don’t know we must assume all potential side effects </p>

        <p>I think this convo will have a few steps and I’m happy to go there </p>
<p>Infact you likely know more then I do </p>
<p>Agreed you had COVID your personal immunity is fine, i won’t argue you need it </p>
<p>My stance is if herd immunity is possible we need to make an effort, you had the virus, im fine with it. But vaccines are more then just personal Benefit it is a group activity. </p>
<p>I’d love to talk more about the risk you are worried about the spike protein leaving the deltoid? Is there science to say what it causes or could do? Or is there just a “we don’t know” component and you won’t take the risk?</p>
<p>Your right it’s not old school, but it’s similar sort of, but you clearly know what you are talking about. My point is it’s not mRNA, my point is it uses viral dna similar to all other vaccines </p>
<p>Agreed splicing the actual spike protein to adenovirus isn’t old tech, but I also don’t see a genuine reason as to why that would be an issue, I’m not doubting it I honestly haven’t researched that, I’d love to hear why the act of attaching the dna of the coronavirus to adenovirus has any more inherent risk besides your run of the mill risk of contracting either virus </p>
<p>Also I have people on here telling me I’m an idiot cause J&amp;J is mRNA at the very least help me inform those people </p>
<p>We may disagree on some things but I think we did just come to one thing we agree on</p>

<p>The scientific method was not used here. Nothing about what has been done with these "vaccines" is repeatable. There is no way to know if you had a control group in the first place because when they. The PCR test was horribly faulty to begin with.</p>
<p>They even said in the 6 month efficacy doc I cited in my other post "Participants with a COVID-19 medical history were excluded, though evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on laboratory testing of study-obtained samples was not an exclusion"</p>
<p>So they were potentially testing efficacy of a vaccine against people who were already immune to the disease? Spectacular data. Very repeatable.</p>
<p>What is this irrefutable science about which you speak? Go pray at the church of fauci. Your arguments do not hold water.</p>

        <p>Agreed sort of </p>
<p>Unless we have clones we won’t have genuine control groups if we are gonna use that term in the strictest sense </p>
<p>Pcr tests have flaws never once said they didn’t , but they are relatively reliably, they aren’t perfect but no one claimed they are and to exclude them cause they aren’t isn’t fair </p>
<p>Also I don’t think I said anything was irrefutable, in fact I’m pretty sure I even said Gravity can’t be guaranteed and that’s about as close to fact as science can get </p>
<p>Lastly I genuinely dislike fauci, and I think the “go pray fo fauci” comment is a bit of a straw man and mudslinging </p>

<p>The J&amp;J vaccine is an adenovirus, viral-vector vaccine which is absolutely new technology. There have only been two, non-covid ones ever approved in the EU and the US, and that was in 2019 and 2020. You really have to become informed on a topic if you want to have a serious discussion on it.</p>

        <p>I mean it wasn’t mRNA </p>
<p>When I said old tech I mean the ideas of using actual virus to ignite the immune response </p>
<p>I acknowledge the concept of splicing the actual m spike protein onto adenovirus is new, my point was it’s still using the concept of inoculation with acutely viral dna </p>
<p>I also don’t see connections to how it’s unsafe, I’m open to what you may know, but how I’ve rationalized it, is if you give a vaccine with viral dna your risk are the same risk of the virus. So yes j&amp;j may have double the risk as it has two viruses you are exposed too, but does the fact that it’s combined together make it inherently more risky? I’d need to do a deeper dive on the process then use to combine the two sequences </p>
<p>I was making a more broader point,  but I’ll give you the W on this one and I will come back better equipped later lol</p>

        <p>Well, then according to your logic the vaccines are useless as the CDC already claimed the vaccines have no effect on reducing the spread of the Delta variant.</p>

        <p>Jury is still out to be honest </p>
<p>I’m more then willing to admit the vaccine does not stop spread,  but as I said the jury is still out </p>
<p>What I will say is the areas with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing higher cases, these areas are in southern states, it’s summer and it’s hot in the south so it’s driving people inside, so the increased cases very much may be from that but it’s something to atleast consider </p>
<p>But as I said before my biggest thing is we know the vaccines decrease deaths and severity of symptoms</p>

        <p>Should you be equally afraid of the spike protein of the virus then?</p>
<p>My understanding is the spike protein is just protein so I’m not sure how it would be cytotoxic, but if it is then the virus is cytotoxic itself and had the same risk </p>
<p>Except the virus has all the other risks that come along with a covid infection</p>

        <p>I did talk about ade from a previous commenter hopefully you can find that for a more thorough explanation </p>
<p>But I’ll be honest it’s not something I’m super well versed on, I do acknowledge it is real and needs to be taken into account, and I will genuinely being deep diving this topic later as it’s one of the genuine good points to be hesitant </p>
<p>What I’ll say is if it was an issue we should be seeing vaccinated getting sicker and that’s not what I’m seeing and I see a lot of patients in several hospitals, my anecdote is still an anecdote but the National and international data concur with what I’m seeing. Could the National and international data be fudged and I’m just in an outlier population maybe, but that’s a tough sell </p>
<p>But I’ll happily admit I was wrong if it turns out is was</p>
<p>And too be honest of all the things I’m willing to admit I was wrong about this would be the one that would make me regret my stance the most </p>
<p>As for failed mRNA in the past that’s Because mRNA degenerates extremely quickly, it wasn’t till recently that we were able to create a lipid coating to protect it long enough to last in the body to trigger and immune response</p>

        <p>So should we go ahead and vaccinate everyone in the world before we complete long term testing or not? Go look up Dr Robert Malone because you seem confused about the mechanisms of ADE. Those effects will happen when the antibodies start to fade away, so it's sounding like 6 months or so after vaccination. This flu season gonna be lit!</p>

        <p>But as soon as you start mixing government and big pharma and media and government funded research and government owned patents... science and medicine very much becomes politics.</p>
<p>Right now they are inseparable.</p>
<p>The true scientists are being censored. the scientific process has not been observed.</p>
<p>Hell. The blind has been broken on the pfizer study. 15 vaccinated dead. 14 placebo dead. And still they push for full FDA approval?! Good luck finding table S4. If you can find it let me know. I've been searching high and low for the thing.</p>
<p>I'm active military. There is about to be a culling. They are going to mandate the vaccine. It looks like they are going to push full FDA approval through and that is grounds to mandate. Those of us that refuse... who knows what will happen. What this will end up meaning I can only speculate. But based on some rough guesswork I'd be willing to say only 5-10% walk. You now have a bunch of Americans who are pissed off they're not deploying or doing the things they signed up to do and are told they can get back to the cool shit if only they help a "vaccination effort". I guarantee you my entire staff is so indoctrinated they would accept any RFF (request for forces) like this gladly.  Again this is completely speculation. But we've already had guys from our battalion support some of the actual shot distribution.</p>
<p>I wish this shot (which they literally changed the definition of the word vaccine so it would apply) was going to solve everything. But those of us that can see a glimpse of the bigger picture know this was never about a virus, and (I think) we are starting to realize there's no going back to the way things were. </p>

        <p>I agree with you more then you may think</p>
<p>Science and politics are unfortunately linked and I think we both agree they shouldn’t be </p>
<p>Scientist who speak against the vaccine absolutely are being censored and I think it’s not only wrong but it’s making things worse, we need those people at the head of the table talking to the real scientists who are in favor of the vaccine so we can figure this out once and for all </p>
<p>Me and you are not the experts,  but is is unfair for you to discredit the scientist who believe the vaccines is working cause the some got censored </p>
<p>If we are talking science we listen to all of them, I’ve listened to dr Malone, I take what he says into account. You should do the same for the people on my side of the argument. </p>
<p>Our government over reaches all the time, the powers that be have made up their minds on the vaccines and by every metric the jury is still out. But if the jury is still out you must acknowledge it could turn out these vaccines are the answer. And at the moment for everyone Dr Malone there are 20 other well researched doctors who are in my camp </p>
<p>Are you claiming the phizer study shows it’s more harmful or that the vaccine has no benefit?  Also phizer is one of many vaccines, even if the deaths aren’t decreased we have to look into long term chronic side effects of those infected. I’d also need to to a deep dive into the patient population they used. The old and sick are the ones who usually die. The old and sick usually aren’t drug test dummies. I will admit I’d need to do a deeper dive before speak confidently on it </p>
<p>I will leave you with 2 broader things to think about </p>
<p>1) the government makes power grabs after a tragedy occurs, absolutely I think they will use this to take out rights, which is why I think getting vaccinated is important, if we can as a unit come together and get it done willingly they won’t have to mandate us to do it: at the very least you must admit that the people who are refusing it will be the excuse the government uses to mandate it. </p>
<p>2) as a vet you clearly are willing to put your life at risk to save others. So there is party of you that when lives are at stake you will sacrifice the need to be 100% certain. At the very least there is a chance getting this vaccine will lead to herd immunity and get us out of this mess, is it a guarantee? Absolutely not? Do I think as citizens we should take the risk? I do, the risk of the virus for the population drastically out weighs the risk of the vaccine in my opinion, I know there are things that could lead to my opinion being wrong but time is of the essence and I have to go off what we know now</p>

        <p>You are clever lol </p>
<p>With peace and love you seem like a good guy and just so you know I have no hard feelings and I am enjoying the conversation</p>
<p>Point 1, I don’t think we should get vaccinated simply because we are gonna be forced to do it, from my point of view I firmly believe these vaccines work so you need to atleast look at this from my point of view, which means for me, as someone who doesn’t want my rights ripped away from me I see a serious risk of that and it seems like they will sue the unvaccinated as an excuse and if the vaccines end up working all the push back was for not</p>
<p>Would you not agree that if the vaccine are safe and work, but 40% of the pop still refuses leading to the government mandating the vaccine, we would of been better off if we just willing got it?</p>
<p>Just assume they work Lmao I’m sure you won’t like doing that; but if you did I think at the very least you would get my point </p>
<p>And by the way I have data and research to support they work, a lot of the data you sight is more of poking a hole in my data </p>
<p>You don’t really have data to support your opinion. You just point out the weaknesses in mine but conveniently leave out the good parts of my data </p>
<p>2nd point, I think your bigger issue is mistrust in the government and the institutions at large more then mistrust in science, I think you should consider giving more charity to the scientific community at large not just a hand ful of people you agree with</p>
<p>I think we both would agree that proper analysis would be to listen to the scientist on both sides</p>

        <p>I agree with you more then you may think</p>
<p>Science and politics are unfortunately linked and I think we both agree they shouldn’t be </p>
<p>Scientist who speak against the vaccine absolutely are being censored and I think it’s not only wrong but it’s making things worse, we need those people at the head of the table talking to the real scientists who are in favor of the vaccine so we can figure this out once and for all </p>
<p>Me and you are not the experts,  but is is unfair for you to discredit the scientist who believe the vaccines is working cause the some got censored </p>
<p>If we are talking science we listen to all of them, I’ve listened to dr Malone, I take what he says into account. You should do the same for the people on my side of the argument. </p>
<p>Our government over reaches all the time, the powers that be have made up their minds on the vaccines and by every metric the jury is still out. But if the jury is still out you must acknowledge it could turn out these vaccines are the answer. And at the moment for everyone Dr Malone there are 20 other well researched doctors who are in my camp </p>
<p>Are you claiming the phizer study shows it’s more harmful or that the vaccine has no benefit?  Also phizer is one of many vaccines, even if the deaths aren’t decreased we have to look into long term chronic side effects of those infected. I’d also need to to a deep dive into the patient population they used. The old and sick are the ones who usually die. The old and sick usually aren’t drug test dummies. I will admit I’d need to do a deeper dive before speak confidently on it </p>
<p>I will leave you with 2 broader things to think about </p>
<p>1) the government makes power grabs after a tragedy occurs, absolutely I think they will use this to take out rights, which is why I think getting vaccinated is important, if we can as a unit come together and get it done willingly they won’t have to mandate us to do it: at the very least you must admit that the people who are refusing it will be the excuse the government uses to mandate it. </p>
<p>2) as a vet you clearly are willing to put your life at risk to save others. So there is party of you that when lives are at stake you will sacrifice the need to be 100% certain. At the very least there is a chance getting this vaccine will lead to herd immunity and get us out of this mess, is it a guarantee? Absolutely not? Do I think as citizens we should take the risk? I do, the risk of the virus for the population drastically out weighs the risk of the vaccine in my opinion, I know there are things that could lead to my opinion being wrong but time is of the essence and I have to go off what we know now</p>

        <p>"Anyone making claims this virus isn’t real or to deny the vaccines are decreasing death and symptoms in the vaccinated population is lying as well"  </p>
<p>The truth is, you don't really know. It might seem to be the case from weak initial data, more time and research will tell. The bureaucrats in charge of how data should be considered, collected, and disseminated have lied to us too many times that all trust has eroded. So far, the several highly qualified research doctors that have dissented (Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Michael Yeadon, Dr. Michael Levitt, Dr. Clare Craig, Dr. Bret Weinstein, etc.) have been de-platformed, mocked, and/or suppressed but as time goes on, they have been more correct in their assessments than the bureaucrats of the NIH, CDC, WHO and all the rest of the pharmaceutical-industrial complex.   </p>
<p>"Science and medicine are not politics, they are not up for debate. "   </p>
<p>Science and medicine should absolutely be up for debate, to say otherwise would prove ignorant of the scientific method and how we have advanced in the science we currently know. Only a small fraction of science is settled, the rest should be questioned and scrutinized. We have entered a moment in time where science has become a dogmatic religion and to question it is heresy. The process of how and what research should be funded is highly political to advance narratives. Some, maybe even most of our scientific community have become unknowingly corrupted by the adherence of a political system in hopes they are awarded research grants. </p>
<p>It terrifies me, as a scientist, that we live in a world where people think limited data results can be concluded as facts. Have we forgotten the most basic high school principles of the scientific method? Hardly any of the conclusions made about covid and the vaccine are facts, they have all been assumptions based on limited research and data. The fact that there are so many qualified dissenters that have been shut down by media outlets and in some cases vilified without allowing their concerns, questions, hypotheses to enter into the arena so that they can be researched, tested, and debated is alarming. It is the very thing that causes me to remain hesitant as it does not allow me to make a completely informed decision. So far, in my assumption, my reluctance has proven to be the right decision.  </p>
<p>I appreciate you reaching out. I commend you for your approach, it was the correct way to start a civil dialog.</p>

        <p>I agree science is up for debate, poor wording on my part, you are like the 5th person to make this point,  but they way you described it is how I feel as well</p>
<p>I think I should of left it at politics, I think we both would agree that most people have their mind made up and don’t actually look at the science</p>
<p>Those who’s beliefs align with mainstream science are likely just lucky and don’t actually understand the science, those who’s beliefs are against mainstream science likely don’t have alternative science to prove their point, I don’t know why I spent time writing that when we clearly agree, but year poor wording on my part</p>
<p>Yes very smart people much smarter then me are being silenced, I do not approve, I don’t no think it helps the discourse and will be the reason we get things wrong, we need those voices to help use avoid mistakes.  But there are a lot more very smart scientist who are in favor of the vaccine </p>
<p>I don’t think the fact that the media is covering it up means that the alternative thinks are right, I think it means the media has made up its minds and will not allow any alternative ideas out in fear it will slow down the process </p>
<p>Also most of the people you sited agree the vaccines work to some extent, most would agree it’s saving lives and lowering severity of symptoms, I will firmly admit when this is all said and done the things we get wrong the things we could of done better will be things these people have said, but it doesn’t mean that the vaccines aren’t wrong </p>
<p>Your hesitancy is valid, I have it too, the issue is we don’t have time for absolute certainty </p>
<p>If a fire fighter shows up to a burning building with no one inside they takes hours to assess if it’s safe to enter if they enter the building at all, if there is someone since the rules changes, they do their best with what they have to make the best decision. And at the moment we have to use what we have and start to get things moving </p>
<p>Not ideal, we will not get every thing right, there will be mistakes, but we can limit them and do what’s best for the overall population</p>

        <p>&rt; <em>It genuinely terrifies me that we live in a world where scientific fact is not based on opinion and not data</em></p>
<p>Is this what you meant to write? <em>Not</em> opinion and <em>not</em> data? From what I perceive, what is being presented to the public is opinion with the window dressing of a scientific veneer, with carefully selected data only deployed when it serves said narrative. </p>
<p><strong>Questions for the physician:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you have an awareness of the inherent conflict of interest between media and Pharma? There’s a LOT of Pfizer commercials sandwiched between shows on Fox, MSNBC, CNN, etc. Is the media incentivized to push the severity of this admittedly serious virus for clicks and ad buys?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your opinion of Big Pharma’s obvious profit motive of this vaccination initiative? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you think Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, would perceive today’s vaccination roll-out? The manufacturers refuse to share their “secret sauce” and vast gleaming new vaccine facilities in developing countries go unused. There’s a scarcity of shots that could be addressed through a global production effort. Why is IP secrecy more important than getting this supposed life-saving elixir to the whole of humanity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a physician, what is your history with pharmaceutical reps or sales agents? Have you ever been wined and dined? Have you been asked to push any particular pharmaceuticals on your patients?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the “science is not up for debate” then the shots are super, super, super, duper safe and I should get mine now. But wait, why are the manufacturers shielded from liability? Coca-Cola isn’t shielded from liability if their recent batch of cola bottles have poisonous toxins in it, but Big Pharma is blameless if my heart grows 3 sizes the day after the shot. If they’re safe, why not stand by their product?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why won’t the vaunted CDC count the majority of breakthrough cases, per their announcement May 1st? Should science be data-based, even if the data is not aligned with Big Pharma’s big dreams? Is the act of denying breakthrough cases are happening somehow “scientific?”</p>
</li>

        <p>Big Pharma is bunch of Money hungry cunts won’t ever argue against it </p>
<p>But if we were gonna get in the mind of money hungry cunts a vaccine that cures a disease is not where the big profits are, big money is medication that needs to be taken chronically </p>
<p>IP on these vaccines is immoral, full stop. And it’s clearly a case of profit over people, does not mean the vaccines don’t work though, just means big pharma wants to squeeze the most money out of it </p>
<p>The vaccine could work and pharma could be profit corrupt these things are exclusive </p>
<p>The days of being wined and dined are in the past, definitely was an issue back in the day, but laws are on the books to curb that, there are limits on how much can be spent, I think those laws are a bit more lax when it comes to medical devices but I’m not a surgeon so I don’t know that world. Now if as a physician you get paid to speak on their behalf then yes you could Easily be corrupted, but if was that guy I’d have millions and wouldn’t be here. Personally I’ve had a few free lunches from reps and that’s it</p>
<p>Your skepticism is valid, I have it too, but you don’t have to throw the baby out with the bath water </p>
<p>As for the liability thing, you atleast must acknowledge that is the main stream narrative is true the time is of the essence and corporations are not gonna move fast if they feel they have risk, by all means not ideal, but it’s a necessary evil. If you choose to disbelieve the mainstream you have a point but at the very least it is logical that you would be lax on liable laws if you wanted to be expedient </p>
<p>And as for what’s being said on the news being opinion in a science veil, I see your point, I think the reality is it’s science being overhyped and over sold due to an opinion. Because the msm has a narrative they take the science we have, especially what fits the pro vax argument and makes it seem more definite then it is, and they stifle the info that goes against their narrative </p>
<p>By all means we do not have all the answers and by all means I’d love to be able to wait 10 years to get those answers but if we don’t have 10 years then to some extent we must roll the dice, and from what I’ve seen the majority of the science is supporting the vaccines, not all the science the majority</p>

<p>Rush an unknown substance into the arms of every human on Earth</p>

<p>Actively silence information regarding alternative treatments</p>

<p>Taken any number of steps to preserve our way of life rather than gleefully keep reporting that we're in a "new normal" literally from the first day this shit started (why would they work so hard to qualify that if altering society wasn't their intent?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line, I will never get this vaccine because it's not a vaccine.  The virus hasn't been isolated therefore what they're injecting into people isn't even a real vaccine.  It is something else entirely and their urgency to force it into all of us is highly suspicious.  I will not relent and this hill I will die upon.  Our human rights are at stake here.</p>

<p>please look at the data out of Israel. they are on the verge of RE LOCKING DOWN in a month cause the vaxs have failed so miserably. they are giving third shots, vaxing the children &lt; 12, anything in an effort to stop vax failure and the vax will still fail around september. the number of serious cases, particularly in the vaxd, grows every day.</p>

        <p>You should look at the data yourself </p>
<p>Israel cases are lower with the vaccine then without </p>
<p>Are their break through cases? Absolutely, are the vaccines showing a shorter immune response then we hopped absolutely </p>
<p>But they still have less cases and less deaths then prior to the vaccine being rolled out </p>
<p>This is a fact, the only way it’s not a fact is if the numbers are being fudged, which I can’t prove they aren’t but every metric we have says Israel is having less deaths since the vaccine</p>

        <p>With the lack of long term studies and the fact that the vaccine makers are immune to liability, that's enough to make me say that I don't care how effective the vaccines are. Something shady is going on. Nobody on the pro-vaccine side has justified why the vaccine makes can't get sued if someone is injured by the vaccine. And FDA approval will mean nothing to me. J&amp;J Baby Powder along with Pfizer's Chantix were FDA approved, and it turned out years later they were giving people cancer. So why should I trust these same companies that are making the vaccines to be safe this time? Because people tell me I have to? No thanks.</p>

        <p>Poor wording on my behalf but I agree with your point </p>
<p>Science is always up for debate and it’s always changing </p>
<p>Your the second person to make this point </p>
<p>What I should of said is science is not up for debate cause you’re emotions don’t agree or your politics don’t agree </p>
<p>Science should be debated by more science </p>
<p>Someone who thinks science always right is an indoctrinated idiot, and someone who thinks science is always wrong is a similar indoctrinated idiot </p>

        <p>Agreed, yet there is another element in this debate: trust. I have never trusted Government and how can I “trust the science” when I obviously can’t trust the scientists?</p>
<p>Organisations like the WHO and CDC have been caught multiple times for fraud, corruption, lying and bowing down to Dictatorships like China. </p>
<p>And the Pharmaceutical Companies are known top Criminals and have some of the highest fines in history for faking results, fraud, blackmail etc.</p>
<p>So again, how trustworthy is the science, peer reviewing and research if we know we can’t trust the people conducting them?</p>
<p>A big part of society will simply never accept “vaccines” or to comply to the restrictions when they are carried out/produced/ordered by corrupted officials, bureaucrats, and scientists.</p>
<p>How do you factor in this fact?</p>

<p>The science and medical community at large are agreeable with this and at large are good people and not corrupt </p>
<p>Could their be some giant overarching scheme and we are all tricked?</p>
<p>I guess, but could this all be a dream and you are actually an unconscious comma victim living this reality out alone in your head?</p>
<p>Could we all actually be just a giant AI on some space aliens videos game and we are just creating a conscious experience around the prewritten story line for said mentioned video game?</p>
<p>I realize this is hyperbole, but if your best reason is just doubt you are opening yourself up to a lot of holes in your logic.</p>
<p>We have to put trust in other and institutions, we can think critically but is impossible to know everything so if you refute all things you are “told” you will inevitably refute a lot of things there in fact true </p>
<p>With that said I am living this, atleast in my small scale at my hospitals I can say that people who are vaccinated are doing better and are less likely to get the virus. I know my perspective is anecdotal but I have about as much real world experience with this virus as Humanly possible </p>
<p>I know you don’t know me and likely won’t trust me, but if you lived the life I lived I promise you would have more faith in this vaccine</p>

        <p>Something is making people sick, and whatever we are injecting into people arms is making them less sick </p>
<p>I am just a simple doctors who works in a hospital System in Florida, I don’t work in a lab that is studying the virus other vaccines so I ultimately can’t prove that </p>
<p>But you can’t prove it doesn’t exist my friend </p>
<p>What I can tell you is I’m seeing waves of people at a number I’ve never seen come in with respiratory symptoms, I see entires families coming in with the same illness. I can see whatever this is spreading in real time. </p>
<p>I also can see that my patients that are vaccinated are doing much better then those who aren’t and the majority of my patients at this point are unvaccinated </p>
<p>If it’s covid, if it’s the flu, if it’s 5G I really don’t care </p>
<p>I care about my patient I care about what’s saving lives </p>
<p>And what I can see first hand with my hospital system which covers a very large areas with tens of thousands of covid patients by now is there is something out there killing people and those who are vaccinated are dying less </p>
<p>And this is a sentiment almost all my colleagues would echo, I have friends from medical school all over America saying what I am saying </p>
<p>Your mistrust in the government is legit, your mistrust in big pharma is legit, your mistrust in the media is legit </p>
<p>But your mistrust in physicians and nurse practitioners and Surgeons is not, we took this job cause we care, we are not lying to you and we do know a thing or two about science</p>
<p>If this is all a big conspiracy then so be it we were all tricked, but if that’s the case none of this matters, no matter how much you think you may have it figured out, if the government is capable of such a large scale operation me and you are both fucked regardless of if we are vaccinated</p>

        <p>I think you are being a little unfair by not taking into account the situation </p>
<p>We are in the middle of a pandemic, I’d love a well planned double blind study, but the virus was already at large before we even realized it </p>
<p>I mean the cdc has the data if you trust them 99% of deaths are unvaccinated over the last month, 90% of those hospitalized </p>
<p>I’d assume that this data is a mass collection from the hospital systems themselves.  I can say I personally can Speak for 6 hospitals with over 1000 beds and those are our numbers. I’ve worked in 3 of those personally and can say anecdotally outside of literally going room to room that the vast majority of the patients all are unvaxxed </p>
<p>Do I see break through cases? Absolutely, probably more then most would think, but the break through cases do very well and usually are discharged a day or two after their admissions </p>
<p>I know the next biggest hospital system in my area just released there numbers at similar percentages </p>

        <p>Did I ever say strip someone liberty?</p>
<p>You are moving the goal post </p>
<p>By no means do I think this should be mandated </p>
<p>By no means do I think you shouldn’t be allowed to have your bodily autonomy </p>
<p>You clearly have thought this out and you have valid skepticism and you should be allowed to say no </p>
<p>My point is by the time those double blinded studies come out it will be too late, and the large majority of the data says the vaccines are safe and they work.</p>
<p>If we had the time I’d not get the vaccine either, but unfortunately we don’t </p>
<p>Vaccines are a group effort just as much as protection for the individuals </p>
<p>If I asked you to place a bet as to which the these two outcomes would lead to less deaths </p>
<p>Outcome 1
No vaccinated at all, we just let this virus burn through the population as long as it takes to mutated out of the human  vector</p>
<p>Option 2 
we all got vaccinated at the same time at the start of the pandemic </p>
<p>If you had to choose which one do you think is gonna have less death and severe illness </p>
<p>And btw I’m away this is a aggressive hypothetical</p>

        <p>You mention that your a doctor and care about your patients. Have you read the vaccine insert for the vaccines? Call me stupid but don't people go to the doctor's when they are sick? Do you consider a case as being sick? If so what method do you use for cases if you know testing can be false positive. Also as a doctor do you know the effect of giving the vaccine to someone who is infected or has-been? And 1 more question as these vaccines are new and there is no long term research how do you justify the risk reward of giving the vaccine, if you do give them that is with no long term data, that seems dangerous to me.</p>
<p>I have spoken to my private doctor and he is not advising people to get the vaccine as there is not enough research.  Personally I wouldn't want to inject a substance into a patients body if I didn't know what it is or its effects.</p>

        <p>I don’t claim there are no side effects </p>
<p>I always mention we are missing the longevity research and I can’t make claims for anything 10 years from now </p>
<p>But I also can’t make claims that the virus itself can’t have long term side effects </p>
<p>What I do know is the acute risk of the virus vastly outweigh the short term risk of the vaccine </p>
<p>For every patient who has a bad reaction of even death from the vaccine you have 1000 affected or dead from the vaccine, that’s enough for me to want my patients to get it </p>
<p>As for the idea that you can get that vaccine be fine the months after the vaccine then 10 years later develop something is so foreign to how the body works and interacts with its environment. Disease that presents 10-20 years down the road are from chronic exposures </p>
<p>You don’t get cirrhosis from drinking a beer, you get from drinking beer daily for years </p>
<p>Can I make a guarantee it won’t happen, absolutely not,  i don’t make that claim. For me the risk for the virus clearly outweighs the risk of the vaccine and the majority of physicians agree </p>
<p>I know docs who disagree so your private physicians is not alone and is not even a small minority, I’d say 1 in 50 docs maybe, but that a just my hunch I have no way to prove that </p>
<p>As for someone who’s had the virus getting the vaccine is lean towards them not needing the vaccine </p>
<p>Reinfection can happen, but the natural immune response seems to be efficient and seems to at the moment last atleast a year </p>
<p>If we were doing proper medicine I’d like to draw titers and if you have antibodies I’d say you don’t need it, and if you don’t have antibodies then I’d advise my patient to get the vaccine regardless of if they have been infected</p>

        <p>I disagree but fine I’ll let you have the point </p>
<p>I’m still seeing disease, I can care less what the pcr says </p>
<p>And it’s exponentially out of proportion to what it should be </p>
<p>Is this the worst flu strain we have had in a century and the pcr is marking it as covid?</p>
<p>Fine but it still is real, people are still dying, people are still getting sick </p>
<p>Any one who works in any hospital anywhere in the world will concur what I’m saying </p>
<p>Something is going on, and the patients that im seeing and my colleagues are seeing are real and valid </p>
<p>This is just not a normal years worth of cases of flu and pneumonia </p>
<p>I went from almost no covid patients in my hospital to 1/3 of all my beds taken by covid patients, and this took 3 weeks to get that high, that is not normal that is not a fluke.  the ER is discharging positive cases at even higher rate who are stable enough to avoid admission</p>
<p>Also all these patients clearly have the same disease process, fevers, hypoxia, bilateral ground glass opacities on imaging, elevated d-dimer, elevated ldh, elevated crp, elevated ferritin the pcr is just one piece of the puzzle </p>
<p>Are the outpatient asymptomatic patients all a lie. I don’t care, I’ll let you have that, but facts are facts there’s is something out there making mass people sick ona global scale </p>
<p>The pcr could not exist and the medical community would still be aware something is going on that’s abnormal</p>

        <p>I agree. Something out there is making people ill and it is indeed novel. Here is the fact. If you have lost your smell/taste or have bilateral ground glass appearance on chest film along with an elevated d-dimer, then your positive test is probably accurate. If you don't have any of those symptoms but have a positive test, then you likely do not have covid. This is why the emergency use for the test has been pulled. It can not differentiate between different viruses, at least not with any confidence. Most people in this world would not know there is anything strange going on if not for the news. We work in hospitals so we see it, but most would really have no clue. They'd think maybe a rough flu season. I ask everyone I know in my circle and not one person knows anyone who has been hospitalized of died of covid (hundreds of people). Where I work, I'd say at least 70% of the covid deaths were not covid at all. 90yr old lady comes in septic with a UTI and also has a positive covid test but without any opacities on chest film and has not lost taste or smell. Patient dies of sepsis...100% but gets called a covid death.  These are facts? No?</p>

        <p>Ehhh I think we agree on some points </p>
<p>As for the pcr not being able to distinguish between viruses it definitely does, we have been using viral pcr panels for years </p>
<p>The ones we use now at my hospital test for 30 plus viruses, yes at a time especially early on the test was only for covid so I guess it would be reasonable to say there was a better chance of false positives </p>
<p>I’d also like to say I see a lot of false negatives, especially the rapid screens, now it’s not every night but over course of a week we seem one or two </p>
<p>As for people in the real world not knowing I’d kind of agree </p>
<p>Depends where you live, some of these waves are undeniable, does everyone know someone who dies? Absolutely not, especially younger people with younger friends. Right now in Florida every body know several people who have contracted, this delta wave for us was something different, no denying that </p>
<p>As for deaths being falsified, I think 70% is a stretch, Maybe your hospital CMO is sponsored by cnn lmfao </p>
<p>I can say on my end we wete told at the beginning when filling a death certificate if someone had an active covid infection to put it on the death certificate, I’d assume to not have lability but I don’t know the inter working of my hospitals politics</p>
<p>What I can say is the majority of our covid deaths are clear covid deaths though, primarily cause most of our covid admits are here with covid symptoms, we do have old ladies with UTI and happen to be positive but that’s the minority </p>
<p>Even if half the deaths are false that’s still alot</p>

        <p>NO. God damn it. Karry Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test said that it absolutely can not be used as a diagnostic tool. It is not accurate, period. How can you argue with a nobel prize winning inventor of the test. You can not. You can try, but it is foolish. And, you are wrong. Most of the covid deaths were not covid, but I am done arguing. I see it and if you really are an MD, then you'd see it too. You must be a shill. Good bye.</p>

        <p>I’m not arguing </p>
<p>You are misinterpreting mullis </p>
<p>He stated the PCR is qualitative not quantitative, it identifies a nucleotide sequence unique to a virus it does not detect the virus itself </p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the pcr is incapable of distinguishing between viruses </p>
<p>If they can isolate a nucleotide sequence unique to the virus then it can I distinguish the viruses from others </p>
<p>Please reread his reseach not just a quote he made about HIV 25 years ago </p>
<p>Also quoting a guy in regards to a pandemic who died prior to the pandemic is not genuine, we don’t know what he would say today </p>
<p>Listen I don’t claim that what you are seeing is false, please don’t do the same to me </p>
<p>My covid death are from covid, if someone with heart failure dies of covid does the Heart failure play a role? Sure doesn’t mean COVID isn’t part of the cause </p>
<p>I’m literally the person who fills out the death certificates and I can tell you mine do not list covid unless it’s actually covid </p>
<p>Maybe the rest of my colleagues are lying but I am not, an it’s not fair of you to say I am </p>
<p>What exactly do you do in the Hospital that gives you the privelage to see the death certs?</p>

<p>I also have a recording of Fauci saying that any positive test with a cycle threshold above 35 is registering dead nucleotides and meaningless as far as a diagnosis goes.</p>

        <p>Running the pcr longer means you could be having some test positive on a substantially small piece of genetic material that may not be due to active infection </p>
<p>But there are plenty of cases where it’s cycled only a few times </p>

        <p>But trace amounts don't matter. "Positivity" in that case is meaningless.</p>
<p>It just serves to increase a scary "cases are skyrocketing!" number.</p>
<p>Your side is counting deaths differently from how deaths have ever been counted before, and then putting the numbers side by side as though they are the same.</p>
<p>This is Enron style accounting...</p>

<p>Want to wear a mask? Wear it.</p>
<p>Want the vaccine? Take it.</p>
<p>Want to lockdown? Lock down.</p>
<p>Want to shut your business? Shut it down.</p>
<p>But stop forcing this nonsense on the rest of us. YOU and YOUR SIDE is selfish, not us.</p>
<p>We ask nothing of anyone. We are the people who want the most freedom for people, simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Your side lies, censors, and uses propaganda &amp; fear to force its mandates through. Your side is "militant."</strong></p>

        <p>No, what you support is worse. You support mandates but you won't come out and say it because you want the pretense of not being an authoritarian fascist.</p>
<p>You support businesses that choose to implement the vaccine passport system. You say "it's their choice and they can do what they want." But that's the same as saying Big Tech can censor who they want even though our government is coercing them into censorship.</p>
<p>So you can say, "It's not the government censoring!" But it's disingenuous, because the coercion came from the government.</p>
<p>Same is true for the passport system. Our government (who does the bidding of pharmaceutical corporations) will simply increase taxes on businesses that don't implement the passport and reduce taxes on businesses who do. After that, they just tune the numbers until they get the compliance they want...</p>
<p>That's just government sidestepping the law. It's disingenuous, manipulative, and underhanded --- <em>just like you.</em></p>

        <p>You're "against mandates" but you support passive mandates through government coercion. You make a distinction but the end result is the same.</p>
<p>Both options are means to force people to take the Covid-19 vaccine. The latter one is how our government is doing it indirectly, so they, like you, can say, "We aren't mandating it. <em>We're just going to make it impossible for you to work or buy groceries.</em>"</p>
<p>You're just a weasel using weasel words. We're too smart, here, to fall for that.</p>
<p>If you think this vaccine is "a good idea" then take it. Have fun with it. It wasn't a good idea, though, for the <em>thousands of people who died from it</em> and the <em>hundreds of thousands of people who have suffered side effects from it</em>.</p>
<p>And the vaccine doesn't "work" or else vaccinated people wouldn't have gotten the "Delta variant" and wouldn't be spreading it.</p>

        <p>You supported passive coercion as soon as you said "you can't complain about businesses that choose to implement Covid-19 passports."</p>
<p>"Corruption of our institutions" isn't real just because I say it is? It's not me saying it. Take a look:</p>
<p>&rt;Pfizer has been a “habitual offender,” persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875889/#:~:text=Pfizer%20has%20been%20a%20%E2%80%9Chabitual,civil%20penalties%20and%20jury%20awards">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875889/#:\~:text=Pfizer%20has%20been%20a%20%E2%80%9Chabitual,civil%20penalties%20and%20jury%20awards</a></p>
<p>That's just one example, and it's from our own government website.</p>
<p>Also on our own government's website is Crutchfield's "<strong>Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert</strong>"</p>
<p>&rt;Some theorists argue that moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory. I take this argument one step further, arguing that if moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory, then its administration ought to be covert rather than overt. This is to say that it is morally preferable for compulsory moral bioenhancement to be administered without the recipients knowing that they are receiving the enhancement.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/</a></p>
<p>And more corruption? Why do you think politicians get million dollar speaking engagements at corporations after they leave office? Did you think it's because the words they have to say in 30 minutes are worth over 33 thousand dollars a minute? No, that is how corporations pay politicians for legislation while they are in office. The money is simply laundered through a "speaking engagement."</p>
<p>Your "facts" are irrelevant to me. This virus isn't a problem for me. My family got Covid-19 when it passed through my office in King county (once called "the Wuhan of America." It wasn't that big of a deal. I was out for a day. Got sick, got better. Just like any other seasonal illness.</p>
<p>And last week? Oh, we got "Delta variant" from a fully vaccinated father-in-law who came over to show off his new Porsche. He was coughing, sneezing, and snotting everywhere... How did he get it? From his fully-vaccinated wife who came back from a trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>But does it matter? We got a cold. A little bit of sniffles, a little bit of sore throat. One of my boys had a slight fever and had to go to sleep early one night. Boohoo.</p>
<p>You are radically changing society and crushing this nation with debt and authoritarian control over a damn cold/flu.</p>
<p>You come to our forum, the one place we're allowed to talk on Reddit -- and spew nonsense and TV talking points. What do you expect?</p>
<p>You claim to be a physician but we know more about this than you do. Go back to your TV talking points and virus fear. We don't want it here.</p>
<p>We want to live normally without your ridiculous and unnecessary hysterics.</p>

        <p>&rt;The few people on NNN who know what they are saying need to be upfront as well. Anyone making claims this virus isn’t real or to deny the vaccines are decreasing death and symptoms in the vaccinated population is lying as well</p>
<p>I and the other mods don't say stuff like "this virus isn't real" and I don't remember ever saying anything about the  vaccines not decreasing death either but if you can point to somewhere that we did, I'd love to take a look.</p>
<p>I think what is hard for people to grasp based on similar feedback I've heard is having the assumption that everything you see on the sub is put forth is assumed to be factual and not only that is it something that is consistent with the ideological vision of N3.</p>
<p>Using "the virus isn't real" as a practical example, are you suggesting that we shouldn't allow people to voice that opinion including censoring that belief in comments?  This level of moderation puts myself in position where I can be the arbiter of acceptable truth which leads to the kind of problems we saw with legacy media and big tech around the covid origin theories where they were censoring what now looks to be the truth (Wuhan lab origination).</p>
<p>As many times as I or others have countered obviously false statements like "viruses aren't real" there will always be some degree of genuine proponents of those ideas as well as an unknown number of accounts spreading these false ideas intentionally as a way of discrediting the actual truth that comes from the sub.</p>
<p>It's easy to draw the line in certain places such as the sillier stuff like vaccines cause magnetism but if we are talking about something that happens in the future I or anyone else cannot speak with any authority as to what will happen.</p>
<p>This has always been somewhere where random anonymous people can bring forth unsubstantiated theories and speculation and I fail to understand how people could somehow expect all of it to be true.  People should be skeptical of what they read in general but in particular on the internet as well as on this sub. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Science and medicine are not politics, they are not up for debate. </p>
<p>I'm going strongly disagree.  Science by it's very nature is up for debate and that is the basis of the scientific method but I concede your point that a laymen's argument has no credibility to be able to disagree with expert opinions.  What you fail to realize however is that our own personal health and safety is 100% within our personal purview so it doesn't matter what the consensus from experts says, nobody has that right over a free person's body.</p>
<p>We have gone down this road before where the scientific consensus at the time determined forced sterilization of what was considered "feeble minded" among other undesirable traits was necessary.  This should be a lesson about how violating individual sovereignty is an unethical compromise even when it seems beneficial to society overall.</p>
<p>Sorry, this got way too long.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>It's definitely not 'informed consent' when people like De Blasio are saying "If you want to work in restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, concert halls, any entertainment venue, get vaccinated or you won't be able to" (paraphrased, but that's just what he meant in yesterday's, at this point, fascist speech.</p>
<p>That could mean hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers suddenly can't go to work and, in particular, minority workers who have significantly lower vaccination numbers.</p>
<p>Regardless, in any democracy, a medical procedure should never be mandated to have a job, go shopping, eat out etc. or it is not a democracy.</p>
<p>As a lifelong Democrat, I have to say I am astounded at the sudden fascist thinking of so many Democrats, including the control freak in the White House.</p>
<p>As I said to my father yesterday, I never expected to become a Republican. But...here I am.</p>

        <p>Nope. Democrat, although he has voted Republican in the past. </p>
<p>He's shocked I've switched sides as I have always been left of left leaning but...even though he's vaccinated, he is now saying he will never get a booster shot and thinks vaccine mandates, masks etc are bullshit. He is also outraged governments would actually mandate vaccines to go to a restaurant, store etc.</p>
<p>I have a feeling at the next election he'll be voting Republican too :) (And honestly, I'm probably more Libertarian now, but that is currently a vote wasted so...)</p>
<p>For me though, in good conscience, I cannot ever again vote for a party that is taking away my freedom of speech (demanding censorship on social media and attempting to shut down organizations/people/scientists/doctors speaking against the government vaccine narrative), my freedom of movement, my freedom of choice and my freedom to decide what I do with my own body.</p>
<p>So...the Democrats can now go screw themselves :).</p>

        <p>All good questions </p>
<p>As for resistant strains, absolutely a risk and in all honesty if there were no vaccines we would not get vaccine resistant strains, which is why is important we all get on the same page, if we are divided on this it will all be for not. I make no claims the vaccines can get us out of this, but there is genuine chance they can and I think we need to keep that in mind when we decide whether we should or shouldn’t get vaccinated. We don’t have time, it is not ideal but this is the reality</p>
<p>ADE is a threat, and I will be Frank it is not a knowledge base I have, but what I can say is if the vaccine were facilitating the virus and making it worse we should be seeing  the vaccinated getting sicker then the unvaxxed as well as most of the infections should be from vaccinated folks, now my anecdotal evidence is that it’s unvaccinated people who are the lions share of infections and are sicker, I only work in the hospital and only know the population of the area I’m in so my personal experience should not be taken as fact, but it should be considered </p>
<p>Pathological priming is virus induced as well, it is a thing, people with underlying autoimmune disorders will have those disorders flare up or made worse by the virus and the vaccine, this is why we usually don’t offer vaccine to that patient population, this is why the rest of us should get vaccinated to help them avoid getting the virus and having a similar issue </p>
<p>I’m against vaccine passports, the government will always use tragedy to take out rights, I have no defense to this. But it does not make the tragedy any less real. They hiked the price of epipens, does that mean if you are having anaphylaxis out of protest you won’t pay the money? It’s unfortunate they will use this for evil, but the reason they can get away with it is cause we have no choice. It’s sad I agree </p>
<p>Vaccine longevity is yet to be know, likely will need a booster, similar to a lot of other vaccines, we also don’t know the longevity of natural immunity.  In my opinion the natural immunity likely is better in this virus, but I do think the vaccines will prove to be effective over a fair length of time, but I’m willing to eat crow on this one</p>
<p>As risk/reward in the young You likely had a point before this variant but this delta variant is now affecting kids more then before, I also think the side effects are over blown, their exists and are real, but the odds are low, driving in a car carries risk, infact all our daily activities Carry risk.  But as it currently stand I would say that someone 22 or younger who is not obese and has no other conditions would have almost no risk from the virus maybe less risk then the vaccine, also the side effects we are seeing in younger people is coming from the J&amp;J vaccine not the mRNA ones which is another point for mRNA in my opinion</p>

        <p>J&amp;J is an mRNA vaccine, which tells me you really need to learn more about all this.</p>
<p>You say the side effects are rare. Here's the thing, that which is very rare is for the side effect to be reported, and if it is reported for it to be accepted as a side effect of the vaccine. </p>
<p>I personally suffered a mini stroke and heart issues, finally went to the hospital, met someone with the same symptoms, we were both told it was nothing to with the vaccine by doctors, while the nurses admitted they were seeing many, many people with the same from the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Like I said, you need to learn about these things before you go shooting off your fool mouth.</p>
<p>How do you think the vaccines gets your cells to produce spike proteins? Send them an email?</p>
<p>No. It uses mRNA. The difference is it does it via a vector virus to get it into your cells, whereas Moderna/Pfizer use nanolipids to get the mRNA into your cells. The end result is the same, your own cells start spewing out the spike proteins; only the delivery method is different.</p>

        <p>Messenger RNA is how you tell the cell's DNA what to produce.</p>
<p>As just explained, there are 2 ways you can get it into the cell. The relatively common way is to use a fairly harmless virus that can infect your cells, but with the "message" (instructions) to create the spike proteins of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The new-fangled way is to use super tiny blobs of fat, nanolipids, which are so small and slippery they can pass through the cell wall (and the blood brain barrier, but that's another topic)</p>
<p>You don't understand any of this and are just doubling down on a pointless argument. As told to you before, the only difference is the delivery mechanism, both will make your own cells create the spike proteins of C19.</p>

<p>"Difference between Johnson &amp; Johnson and mRNA
Vaccine Technology 
– The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is based on viral vector technology that uses an inactivated harmless virus called the adenovirus, which would normally cause the common cold. The virus has been genetically modified to not cause any harm to the body and it is instructed to carry a portion of the genetic code of the virus called spike proteins that causes the coronavirus disease. The body then recognizes the spike proteins by instructing the cells to produce antibodies to fight off the virus.</p>
<p>Messenger RNA or mRNA vaccines are a new approach to vaccine development that unlike conventional vaccine technologies, contain the recipe for proteins that help the virus to infect cells. These proteins trigger immune cells and instruct our body to make antibodies. So, if the person gets infected with the virus, these antibodies will easily recognize the proteins on the virus and start fighting it off. Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are two of the earlier vaccine candidates to use mRNA technology."\
http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-johnson-johnson-and-mrna-vaccines/</p>
<p>The genetic "recipe" and the genetic "instructions" are the same damn thing - "Produce spike proteins"</p>
<p>It's just marketing to make them seem different. The biggest benefit of keeping the mRNA inside an actual virus is it doesn't require such low temperatures to keep it stable</p>

        <p>"The genetic information to code for the spike protein is added to the ChAdOx1 vector. The viral vector (ChAdOx1) acts like a capsule inside which it carries its most prized possession — genetic information to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The non-replicating vector will infect a single human cell, where it produces the antigen we want — the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein — to elicit an immune response."</p>
<p>https://thesharedmicroscope.com/2020/07/03/could-the-oxford-university-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-end-the-pandemic/</p>
<p>That's how the AZ vax works, using a virus to infect your cells to create the spike proteins.</p>
<p>You seem to be saying the J&amp;J is also a recombinant virus vector design, but does NOT create the spike proteins? Is that correct?</p>
<p>Because this page says they both do the same thing:</p>
<p>– Both AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidates use the same technology for their vaccine development, a non-replicating virus called the adenovirus which causes common cold in chimpanzees and contains the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein – the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. This is actually a weakened virus that is not capable enough to cause any harm to us.

        <p>Interacting with the DNA?</p>
<p>It's surprisingly difficult to find any real clear-cut explanation of exactly how J&amp;J works, not least because most such explanations are either adverts or the mainstream media shilling for them, so I repeat myself... What little I can find says they 2 viral vector types work the same:</p>
<p>A weak, harmless virus infects your cells with the recipe/code/instructions/message/RNA/mRNA/DNA/Darwinism/Whateverthefuck to create spike proteins.</p>
<p>The other 2 use tiny fat-bubbles to get the recipe/code/woteva into your cells, to create spike proteins.</p>
<p>The Sinovac type, which I had and reacted badly to, uses the actual virus after it's been almost killed with chemicals or heat (you cannot actually kill a virus as they're not alive but you get the idea)</p>
<p>Basically our disagreement comes down to does the J&amp;J get your own cells to create the spike proteins or not?</p>
<p>Again, all I can find is vague waffling or confirmation that is exactly what it does. For example this page:</p>
<p>"The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine delivers DNA to your cells to make the spike protein. An adenovirus acts as a delivery vehicle, carrying coronavirus genetic material (DNA). The adenovirus delivers the little piece of DNA to the cell that will then make the spike protein. </p>
<p>"Once the adenovirus gets inside your cell, the spike protein gets manufactured by your own cellular mechanisms," explains infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH."

        <p>If I were to get a natural infection then my full immune system would get to work, which would leave me with a much better immunity than any vaccine.</p>
<p>Vaccines bypass all the earlier stages and literally inject the antigen or antigen-creating agent directly into your body and bloodstream. That's why your immune system often over-reacts and creates autoimmune diseases (attacks your own body, forever).</p>
<p>Vaccines have their place, such as to contain an epidemic (localized). </p>
<p>Mass-vaccination using a "leaky" vaccine, during the height of a worldwide pandemic? Absolutely nuts.</p>

        <p>I believe in the concept of vaccines, but my eyes are wide open to the fact there have been many mistakes with them, and that they are not the Great Saviors of Humanity that they are made out to be.</p>
<p>They're a useful tool, and I think an inappropriate tool during a pandemic. To stop the spread of a small epidemic, sure, and if restricted to only the elderly or those most at risk they could work.</p>
<p>Mass vaxxing everyone, ignoring natural immunity or other health issues, just get a needle into every arm, at all costs? That's not science or medicine; that's something else.</p>
<p>I think it's to bring in the vaccine passport tracking system, where you need to prove you're an approved citizen to go anywhere, do anything. An approval they can cancel at any time.</p>

        <p>I mean we already have a passport system </p>
<p>Try and travel internationally and see what happens </p>
<p>I think they genuinely want to be done with the pandemic and they see the vaccines as the way out.</p>
<p>And at this moment in time it’s not mandated yet, can’t complain about private corps who may require a vaccine </p>
<p>There will be lots of countries nearing the 90% immunity rate soon, with a round of boosters for the elderly these vaccines will be put to the tests</p>

        <p>Your optimism is... nice.</p>
<p>Please watch this, it's quite short:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKNVEPnI4fY</p>
<p>International passports are for individual countries, national, you know, patriotism, nationality? </p>
<p>The New World Order/Great Reset/Agenda 30 etc people want a one-world 'government', made of the public-private elite. Such a digital ID would instantly be more than vaccine status. Again, watch the vid - they hadn't even introduced it and already adding driving license and criminal record to it.</p>
<p>These people want to rule the world. They want to bypass democracy and free speech, privacy etc. They can do that, because you can guarantee such 'passports' will rapidly become univeral, for any country, which means they will have to follow the rules of the WHO/Gates/UN etc.</p>
<p>You national passport will be entirely irrelevant. They will literally be able to control your movements within your own country, let alone international.</p>
<p>Please, wake up.</p>

<p>You can't tell us what we can and can't complain about. And your argument for "businesses can do what they want" is out the window because government has forced them to be closed, has forced them to require masks, etc.</p>
<p>So clearly businesses can't just do what they want...</p>

        <p>Why do you trust the old ones?</p>
<p>I feel your bigger issue is being told what to do.  Being disobedient is just as blind and being obedient </p>
<p>ADE stuff is one of the few genuine scientific reasons for hesitancy </p>
<p>But usually that happens 3-6 months after inoculation, the vaccine was in testing longer then that before releases so they would of been able to see this, ADE is not a new concept, it is something they should be looking for, I knew about ADE as a med student, if it’s happening they know and there are hiding it </p>
<p>And from my point of view clinically speaking we have had our vaccines out for over 6 months especially the elderly </p>
<p>I’d be seeing vaccinated people getting sicker and infected more often which I’m not </p>
<p>I’ll be honest and say if I was to go base of my persona experience I’d need another 6 months and probably I’d expect this winter wave to be the wave the ADE to show up </p>
<p>The virus itself now is terrifying though, like it really is, especially how contagious it is</p>
<p>It destroyed my population over the course of 3 weeks that’s bonkers s</p>

I don't much, as they use things like mercury and aluminium, but at least the risks are generally well-known.</p>

<p>I was just curious where you stood on it </p>
<p>So is it safe to say you may consider novavax once it’s out </p>
<p>Also your videos is misleading the virus comes in waves, if we vaccinate on the down trend of a wave we judge the vaccine by the next wave after vaccination </p>
<p>It seems like that videos is trying to say the viruses deaths were going down regardless which isn’t true or at the very least it’s not something you can prove </p>
<p>Cases rose and fell multiple times prior to the vaccine so a decline is cases Doesn’t mean they weren’t coming back</p>

        <p>Assuming you are honest, I need to point out that by stating an axiom that „denying the virus exists“ you are in fact anti-science.</p>
<p>Were it not Koch and Rivers who formed postulates to determine if a virus is causing a disease? By skipping this important step, you are stepping in the realm of religion, not science.</p>
<p>And to remain scientific, does Koch not require that every organism infected with a microbe gets sick?</p>
<p>Rivers rephrased that to either result in being sick OR produce antibodies.</p>
<p>Now, the government argues virus is real,  but also that asymptomatic spreading is real.</p>
<p>Does that not directly violate Koch? Unless we test all „pcr positive cases“ for antibodies, we do not know if Rivers conditions are met, either.</p>
<p>Which leaves us in a completely different possibility, that there is something a pcr test detects which sometimes -  but by far not always coincides with „covid symptoms“,  but since Koch/Rivers is not met, causality is not proven - hence it could be an exosome which is a consequence of other disease and sometimes is even found in healthy organisms.</p>
<p>Further, since most „covid deaths“ were in fact comorbidities, it is even more likely that the virus is not the cause. It is si ply present in unhealthy organisms with covid symptoms.</p>
<p>Respectfully, could you point to a fault in my reasoning, withoit getting dogmatic or introduce beliefs/statements which are not scientifically validated?</p>

        <p>I think where id push back is the assumption that we aren’t seeing correlations with the the PCR and anti-bodies </p>
<p>By all means the lack of anti-body testing where I work is lackluster, and I’d even argued that it’s lackluster on a global scale </p>
<p>So if you are saying until we have the titers done at such a large scale to match the vaccine and PCR numbers we can’t know for certain I’d respectfully disagree I think the small scale data is more then convincing </p>
<p>Are some cases testing positive for covid and infact are not sure, but I don’t see this being a large percentage </p>
<p>I’d love anti-body testing, I think it would show us a lot
Primarily how well natural vs vaccine mediated immunity is working. I mean for what it’s worth Natural vaccine likely is the most effective, if we get these antibodies role out I think we would be able to say convincingly someone who’s had the virus doesn’t need the vaccine </p>
<p>But none the less we do test for antibodies so we know the virus is real, if you want to argue what percentage of the cases are actually covid that’s fair,  but all you could argue would be a “maybe”, unless you have another reason as to what is going on with these patients </p>
<p>Regardless of what is causing the symptoms these rush of patients is real. Waves of patients all with the same symptoms, fevers sob hypoxia, bilateral pneumonia, drastically elevated inflammatory markers relatively low wbc counts.  The number of sick patients is way beyond the average</p>
<p>Ask anyone who works in a hospital and they will agree something is out there. This isn’t just your average years cases of flu and bacterial pneumonia</p>
<p>I went from no “covid” patients to 50 in 3 weeks, that’s 1/3 of my hospital and the 11 other hospitals within my system are seeeing the same numbers </p>
<p>Every one of my med school classmates are seeing these numbers across the country </p>
<p>If it’s not covid what is it? You don’t just have 1/3 of a hospitalized patients all get the same symptoms. All of them fever, elevated d-dimer, elevated crp, elevated ldh, elevated Ferritin, bilateral ground glass opacites, hypoxia, wheezing and a positive pcr </p>
<p>Do you atleast endorse the fact that something is causing a spike is these patients?</p>
<p>Also I don’t see how asymptomatic spread goes against the concept of viral spread </p>
<p>Personally I think if you are coughing you likely aren’t spreading this all that much. But just cause your symptoms are so mild you don’t really pay attention doesn’t mean you don’t have it</p>

<p>How did you set the diagnosis? What would you diagnosis be without pcr or antigen test? How many flu patients did you have compared other years?</p>

<p>Now we are getting somewhere. I do not have an answer, obviously, bit it is something you should be open to.</p>
<p>Idea: could it be simple vit D deficiency, accelerated by lockdowns? Have you tested you patiens for vit D levels? If not, should you start and see what the data is telling you?</p>

        <p>Yes we have data backed by anti-bodies </p>
<p>I want more </p>
<p>But it does exist, I’ve order antibody testing myself and I’ve had it ordered on me</p>
<p>I can with certainty tell you I have had a lab draw titers on me and was positive for them from the vaccine, if you want to argue this test is flagging positive for some other reason I’d happily hear you out </p>
<p>The cases are way more then any flu season, it is not even close, I’m talking by a factor of 10</p>
<p>If you made me diagnose it blind I’d say it was viral pneumonia, any doctors with a a half decent nose for Inpatient medicine would look at the labs minus the pcr and say it’s a viral pneumonia</p>
<p>Even if you want to argue it’s not covid, I can tell you that with 100% my anecdotal evidence which is about as expansive as you can from an anecdote that there is a wave of viral pneumonia Leading to acute respiratory failure at an alarming rate way beyond what I’ve seen or anyone of my colleagues has ever seen. This is something that every hospital worker I know would concur, maybe you could find a nurse or a tech to say otherwise but the vast majority and mean the vast like 99.99% of people working in the inpatient setting would agree with this statement </p>
<p>Low vitamin D does not cause viral pneumonia, it does not cause respiratory failure. low vitamin D make does correlate with poor outcomes with this disease, but that’s universal for all pathogens, this is why we give vitamin D, as well as vitamin C and zinc as well. There’s deficiencies don’t cause the disease but they could make the ability to fight it off worst</p>

        <p>The only thing you're wrong about is 35 cycles, lol.  It's 45 CYCLES and I can prove it:</p>
<p><strong>2020 Jan 17</strong></p>
<p>!! PCR TESTS TO 45 CYCLES !!</p>
<p>The WHO adopted a (PCR) test from German researchers and published testing protocols in mid-January. Those protocols could be adopted by other countries to produce their own tests or countries could use tests provided by the WHO.</p>
<p>Positivity at 45 cycles has about a 95% chance of registering a false positive. The correct cycle range is 20-25 cycles tops. Fauci admitted this, pre-Covid, and even during Covid Fauci is in an interview saying that . They increased the cycle threshold to generate false positives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/protocol-v2-1.pdf">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/protocol-v2-1.pdf</a></p>
<p>So there you have it... If you dig around you can find the interview with Fauci where he admits that any positive test above 35 cycles is "meaningless dead nucleotides."</p>
<p>There's another, older video where he says anything above 27 cycles is probably meaningless but it's harder to find and I unfortunately don't have the link. Remember, the other side censors as much of this as it can as well as rewriting history by changing old articles.</p>
<p>We are dealing with a sinister, nefarious operation...</p>

        <p>Remdesevir is trash in my opinion, it has a very small bit of proven efficacy and personally I’m not sold </p>
<p>Ivermectin is cheap so unfortunately there isn’t must push to get it tested, and a physician I think we should use any of our tools, and unfortunately only doctors are asking for these ivermectin studies, same goes for hydroxychloroquine </p>
<p>As for the hydroxychloroquine from what I’ve seen it doesn’t appear to help either and the data agrees but may have some benefit as a prophylactic </p>
<p>Regeneron and remdesevir have money behind them, it’s the sad truth,  but that’s why they got the push, but both those drugs do have data to say they have some effect, not ideal data but we are in the middle of a pandemic we don’t have the luxury of ideal </p>
<p>As for the pcr cycles that’s how pcr works, you need to reach a threshold of generic material so it will react with the reagent to creat enough florescence  to test positive </p>
<p>The less cycles you need the higher the concentration of genetic material you had on your sample, the more cycles it takes the smaller the genetic material in the original sample </p>
<p>But you cant create a positive test out of no where if your sample lacks the covid genetic material. </p>
<p>Now if your point is that running it 34 times may cause people to test positive that aren’t actively infected maybe, but at the very least the sample used had the genetic material in it, maybe the patient already cleared the virus and had minute levels left in their nostrils. Maybe the tech sneezed and she herself had covid and made the test positive</p>
<p>But if the pcr is positively it is before it detects the nucleotide chain it was made to detect, it won’t detect what’s not there </p>
<p>Also running a pcr 34 times is normal, anyone who works in a lab like I have will let you know that’s common practice, def could only have to run it 5 times but running it 34 times is not some ungodly high number </p>
<p>As for proving you it’s all a planned I cannot, if that’s your belief any and everything I could show you that’s data driven you could argue is fake or falsified </p>
<p>What I would say, in the world of conspiracy or in government corruption it is more likely they wait for tragedy to strike then take advantage of said tragedy for a power grab, then them actually planning it all out. It is more then possible this virus is real, this vaccine is working and the government is gonna use the pandemic to extends its strangle hold on the people, all 3 of these things can exist at the same time</p>

        <p>Youre making a massive false assumption about us, I suspect on purpose. Literally NOBODY is saying the virus doesnt exist. Now if you want to have a discussion about any other topic. surrounding the past 16 monts, you can DM me. You may think science can not be politicized, but you would be wrong. There is massive corruption in Pharma, Research, and even amongst physicians, and you obviously are not the least bit interested in history, or ypu would already know this.</p>

<p>There are definitely people actively Denying the virus </p>
<p>Not most of my comments but some </p>
<p>I firmly believe science can be politicized </p>
<p>I firmly think it’s wrong but absolutely it’s happening now</p>
<p>You have one side fear mongering and making power grabs while people are afraid </p>
<p>You have another side who is purposefully down playing this to grift to those who are skeptical</p>
<p>With that said you seem like someone who hates both Fox News and cnn equally lol I could be wrong though </p>
<p>Big pharm and the chase for profit is real and corrupt and doctors have been involved, it is a small minority but we are not perfect by any means </p>
<p>There are also doctors grifting to the anti-vax side to make cash as well</p>
<p>I appreciate you’re skepticism and I think it’s healthy but I hope it is equally distributed </p>
<p>Dr fauci and dr Malone should receive equally skepticisms </p>

<p>I can’t find their tag</p>
<p>Also a good portion of people argue the pcr is not accurate, i wont go as far as to say they deny the virus, but some think it is just the flu and a falsified pcr test </p>
<p>I acknowledge that people on my side are rude and talk down to people and I acknowledge a lot of them
Got the vaccine blind </p>
<p>You can acknowledge that you have some very conspiratorial people on your side, it’s not a knock against you but there do exist </p>

        <p>&rt;There are definitely people actively Denying the virus</p>
<p>"Denying the virus?"</p>
<p>You don't even speak in normal human terms. What people are saying is that the virus is harmless for the majority of people. By testing widespread populations using PCR tests with a high cycle threshold, and then counting any death within 60 days of a Covid-19 test - you're casting a wide net... You will misattribute deaths to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Look at it. Lets say Covid-19 supposedly kills 1 percent of the population.</p>
<p>But ask yourself... Is 1% of the population incredibly old (to where they will die of something regardless) and/or riddled with comorbidities? </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is the 1% that needs to worry. The really old people can't do much about it. Old people die. That's always been true, so we can't panic about it.</p>
<p>The unhealthy people? They made their choices.</p>
<p>You can't turn the world upside down because old people are dying, and you can't turn the world upside down because incredibly sick people are dying.</p>
<p>That would be "selfish."</p>
<p>Go jogging every day, eat healthy unprocessed foods. Get enough sleep. Consume no unhealthy substances, legal or otherwise. Done. Problem solved.</p>
<p>You can't force masks and Covid-19 passports because some people want to weigh 800 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>And if you care so much about health, let's shut down peddlers of death like Taco Bell, McDonalds, Dominoes Pizza, Lilttle Caesars, Coca-Cola, and every other company that uses advertising to spread obesity &amp; childhood diabetes VIRALLY.</strong></p>
<p>But no, your side declares those companies "essential" and even gives you free Krispy Kremes and drugs for taking the vaccines, lol.</p>
<p>Your side doesn't care about health. They just care about forcing people into vaccination.</p>

        <p>"I know what sick looks like, and not having symptoms is one of the symptoms!"</p>
<p>You're seeing more sickness in part because we have more people. 80 years ago there was a global population boom that last 20-25 years. In America population jumped from about 750,000 a year to over 3,000,000 people a year (!)... And this went on for over 20 years! Look it up.</p>
<p>In America we call them "Baby Boomers" but it was a global phenomenon. The thing is... Life expectancy is \~79 and now a lot of them are old. So it is inevitable that "Baby Boomers" become "Death Boomers." Meaning literally, you have to expect a "death boom" just because there are more old people.</p>
<p>And as far as it affecting young people -- look at the CDC provisional mortality statistics. How many people under 25 died from Covid-19 in 2020?  721.  Seven hundred twenty one. Read that again. We are a nation of over 331,000,000 people.  Leave these kids alone.</p>
<p>You said "being old and overweight doesn't mean they are not entitled to life."</p>
<p>Did I say that? No, what I said is it doesn't mean you can break our nation's economy and throw people into poverty and force ridiculous society destroying restrictions on us because a small fraction of people are dying -- people who are dying anyway.</p>
<p>This isn't about the virus and it never was.</p>
<p>"Chronic Covid-19 symptoms" is an exaggeration, and 99 times out of 100 the people claiming that are "whiner types" who look for excuses to get out of working. If it wasn't "long covid" it would be "fibromyalgia" or "chronic fatigue."</p>
<p>The number of "professional athletes" having chronic symptoms is so small it hardly exists, but you're using it as though it's a justification for anything. I should note, also, that most "professional athletes" aren't actually healthy. To be competitive you have to push the body to ridiculous extremes that can cause other problems, and many of them consume steroids or other legal supplements that could certainly cause other problems.</p>
<p>The world can go back to normal, and it should. Your side is dragging the rest of us down, simple as that.  It's breaking the national sociologically and economically.</p>
<p>That's the real goal, actually... So good job for being a part of that. I hope you're happy with what you've done to our country... to our planet.</p>

        <p>Plenty of people get this virus and never have symptoms and at worst it’s a mild cough or congestion </p>
<p>I never claimed that this virus makes everyone sick, I fully acknowledge this virus for most people Will amount to nothing, but some they will get very sick </p>
<p>I also never said this things inherently affects kids, you are right kids do great with the virus </p>
<p>You keep putting words in Mouth, at this point are you are making a fictitious person to argue against </p>
<p>My actual points. What I’m actually saying can’t be refuted by you so you put words in my mouth </p>
<p>And when I say I’m seeing more cases then before I’m not talking about volume of patient now compared to the 50s, I’m talking about now compared to recent history just in the last 18 months we are experiencing 10-20x more cases of viral pneumonia’s </p>
<p>So I can acknowledge people who state they have side effects from the vaccine but when I mention long COVID symptoms you call them “Whiney”</p>
<p>Do you hear yourself </p>
<p>Then add in “death boomer” </p>
<p>Just talking about the largest demographic of our population as if they are a statistic and not a life</p>
<p>You can be Better then this </p>
<p>You don’t mean what you are saying, I feel I’ve backed you into a corner and I’m sorry for that </p>
<p>I hope you take some time for introspection but at this point I think I’m causing you more distress then wisdom so I’m out</p>

        <p>Everyone is a statistic. You can't say "oh my god, old people are dying" and then turn the world upside down because of it because... That's what old people do. It has been true for all of time.</p>
<p>And you can't turn that into "you don't care about old people!"</p>
<p>It's just a fact. It is what it is. Old people don't live forever, and we usually don't use the fact that they to as an argument to force children into hurtful distancing and plastic school bubbles and masks.</p>
<p>I do mean what I'm saying, lol. </p>
<p>You're not causing me any "distress." You're just here advocating nonsense and I'm countering it with common sense.</p>
<p>When my points derail your agenda you withdraw and try to turn yourself into a victim. No, you're here trying to scare people and encourage vaccination. Vaccines already have enough encouragement, you aren't needed for that. Anyone who hasn't taken it yet doesn't want it... So yeah, you're like a pesky gnat at this point.</p>
<p>"Take the vaccine! Take it! Take it! It's good for you! Science says!" </p>
<p>Those of us who actually take care of ourselves don't need it and don't want it. It's simple as that.</p>
<p>And yes, "baby boomers" become "death boomers." The point isn't to make light of the situation --- the point is that if you have a burst of population growth then you have to expect a burst of deaths around 80 years later. That's just <em>normal</em>. You can't panic because more people are dying -- more people are dying because there are more old people!!!</p>
<p>So you're a physician.. Did they include math out of your education? lol</p>

        <p>I am a physician who has not taken the vaccine yet.  I have recommended it to people whom I believe to be at greatest risk.  I have pushed my patients to lose weight, up their vitamin D levels, exercise, etc. </p>
<p>I spend hours a day combing over research and data.  There is no doubt in my mind that the mRNA vaccine works.  It achieves its intended purpose in the short term.  </p>
<p>What you and I both know, however, as physicians, is that there are many examples in medicine where very bad effects of a medication were not known for years after it had been on the market.  mRNA technology is potentially the same.  The risk profile is still evolving.  As such, I consider it an experimental treatment.  As a doc, I have recommended that people enroll themselves in studies before, but only when the benefit clearly outweighed the risks.  </p>
<p>When we are talking about 80 year olds, the benefit outweighs the risk for the vaccines. But when we are talking about 8 year olds, I don't see it.  I don't really see it for 18 year olds.  And probably not even for 28 year olds.  Admittedly, I am on the fence myself.  At 48, with no comorbidities, my likely survival odds are still over 99%.  </p>
<p>I've made my choice to wait for more data, but I reserve the right to change my mind at any time.  I had hoped that Novovax or Covaxin would have been approved by now, because I would gladly take one of those.  But here we are. </p>
<p>I don't appreciate the propaganda, the media pressure, the obvious governmental manipulation of certain numbers, and the recent attempts to coerce people into taking part in the experiment.  Public health docs think every life saved is an equal life.  It isn't.  Saving a million 80+ year olds while putting even hundreds of kids at risk is just wrong.  Socially, there will be a lot of dissection about our priorities when this is all over.</p>

        <p>I agree with all of what you said </p>
<p>I’d push back on what is and isn’t a high risk population </p>
<p>Atleast from the inpatient setting anyone 50 and up but even more so those who are overweight are at risk </p>
<p>I’d say this new delta variant is effecting the younger pop, might be biased cause the elderly are vaccinated but personally I was not admitting this many 30 and 40 year olds </p>
<p>As a Florida physicians is is frightening to see how contagious this variant is. We went from almost no cases to 6x our previous peak from the winter </p>
<p>And what took 2 month then took 3 weeks, if the vaccine was not used it would be catastrophic here with our elderly population </p>
<p>Even though I do agree someone under 50 with no comorbidities and let’s be honest that’s the bulk of patients atleast in the states, unless you have a large pediatric population of course </p>
<p>Vaccines also work as a group activity though, it’s not just for the individual it’s for the group </p>
<p>If we can get to herd immunity and this virus mutates out of the human vector we won, might not even be possible but if we have a chance to save millions of lives on a global scale I say we take it </p>
<p>As to the long term side effects I think they are over blown, I firmly admit I can make no claims as to what the Side effects will be if any but the idea of having one or two small exposures without any acute side affects then 20 years later something happens is pretty foreign to how the body interacts with its environment </p>
<p>You get cirrhosis from drinking beer for lifetime not cause you drank one 6 pack when you were 21</p>
<p>So for me the risk is negligible compared to the reward of potentially herd immunity, but I’m willing to eat crow about that and I’ve never suggested someone who wasn’t high risk get it without telling them that the main reason for them to do it is to help decrease spread </p>
<p>Novavax Will be a game changer and these intranasal vaccines may be big help as well</p>

        <p>I'm curious about your experience inpatient with the younger folks.  Do you think that delta is actually worse than the original in terms of infection fatality rate or do you think the perception of it has changed because the faster spread means 3-6x as many infections per unit time, so it feels worse in the hospital because more young people are showing up all at once, but in reality it is likely not as bad from an IFR standpoint.  </p>
<p>The data out of England seem to suggest that it's actually less of an individual threat in terms of severity, but equal or more of a public health threat just because of transmissibility.   </p>
<p>Interestingly, for me in Kentucky (somehow we haven't gotten crushed with delta yet) the only folks I know in the hospital with delta (n=3, so not worth much) are all fully vaccinated at under 50.  This doesn't square with the national reports of only the unvaccinated being in the hospitals.  What's your experience on the ground?</p>

        <p>I can’t make a claim that it’s not volume that makes it seem worse for younger people </p>
<p>I’m still weeding that out, it very much feels like it’s worse but I’m not ignorant to the fact feeling aren’t facts </p>
<p>Also my patient population is shall I say “special” very poor health, very fond of meth, ya know good old Florida boy types so I see sick young people often without covid so there’s that. I’ve had 3 stemis under 35 this year alone </p>
<p>What I can say is the volume has overwhelmed us and that usually is when people die that shouldn’t </p>
<p>I can treat 5 icu COVID patient I can’t treat 15 I don’t have the resources </p>
<p>Our icu docs are making Sophie’s choice </p>
<p>If you end up in a rotaprone bed at my Hospital you likely won’t be in it long sadly </p>
<p>If I take a step back at the bigger picture I do agree that what the data will show from delta will be way more infections but lower rate of death to the individuals but I do think you will see hot spots with higher death numbers due to lack of infrastructure </p>
<p>Break through cases are real, and the media makes it seem like it’s not as much as it is </p>
<p>But they definitely do fair better, and most break through for me are elderly or immunocompromised </p>
<p>What’s the weather like in Kentucky here in Florida we hide from the heat so I think this is why we are spiking, I’d be willing to bet the north will get more delta come fall</p>

        <p>To be honest I could care less what this disease process is </p>
<p>What I know is I know something is out there </p>
<p>If you want say it’s the worst flu in a century by all means you can have that point but we need to acknowledge we have a aggressively contagious virus out there that’s killing people at a scary rate</p>
<p>I know what viral pneumonia is, if you took away the pcr and just left us with all our other tools physicians would still diagnose viral pneumonia </p>
<p>Fevers, hypoxia bilateral ground glass opacities, elevated crp, elevated d-Dimer, elevated Ferritin </p>
<p>A hospital does not go from no “covid” patients to 1/3 of the beds “COVID” in weeks </p>
<p>What ever it is, it is real</p>
<p>And from my first hand experience directly from the patients mouth the majority of them are unvaccinated, I make no claims that my experience is enough to correlate to the globe, but compared to most I’ve lived this virus more then almost any else has </p>
<p>Is hospitalists, ED staff, and ICUs that really know what’s going on</p>
<p>And we all agree at a 99% clip something is out there and the vaccine seems to be helping</p>

        <p>Look at what we have done to fight covid. The biggest weath transfer from bottom to top ever. Over 100mio new people close to famine. Millions of small business closed, big cooperations take over their place.</p>
<p>We name the virus sars cov 2, but its ansester is not sars cov 1, its RatG13 (that name is a pure marketing campain). </p>
<p>All media jumped on the 95% relative risk reduction number of pfizers own study. Pfizer that has a record of alter its studies for better results and paid doctors to lie for them. Yet we take their word to inject 100s of millions with their new jab. And we never talk about the absolute risk reduction number. And instead of vaccinate the vulnerable we want everyone vaccinated, even children, and they can do it without consent of their parents. We brainwash them that if they dont do it they are evil and kill grandma. And now that everyone has access to the vaccine and can protect himself if he want we blame the unvaccinated for everything.</p>
<p>There is something seriously wrong here. </p>
<p>The swine flu could have leaded to the same situation, but a few doctors showed it was bullshit - and the propaganda machine was not so strong as it is today. Btw we throw the vaccines for swine flu away because they were bad.</p>
<p>The WHO lied for china, changed the definition of a pandemic (else corona could not have been declared as pandemic!), changed the definition of heard immunity (meanwhile they switched it back ..). They wanted to run PCR tests on too high cycles. We then used the pcr rest results as a daily fear campain in the media. Its a pandemic of positive test results. (Imagine we would PCR test for the seasonal flu like we do now, we would be in a pandemic every year)</p>
<p>Look at demografic adjusted death statistics. Most countries are at the death level of 2012 or 2015. I dont remeber this years were so scary.</p>
<p>Something is absolutly wrong here.</p>
<p>Yes the vaccine looks like it reduces hospitalisation and deaths.</p>
<p>But after all this bullshit why would you trust the vaccine?</p>

        <p>How much does the vaccine reduce the spread? Yes it does but not in the extend polio or smallpox do. Besides that, not all polio vaccine campains where such a success. </p>
<p>But i didnt point to swine flu because of the vaccine, but because of the pushed narrative.</p>
<p>You dont go into a lot of points, the big point is trust, and that is lost. </p>
<p>And again the death rate is on level of 2012 or 2015 (demografic adjusted) that cant be the worst pandemic in modern times..</p>
<p>You say in the hospital you work it doesnt look good atm. So tell us whats happening? What you do to threat your patients? What you see in comon in your patients (in contrast to all the people who survive covid just fine and may not even realize they have it)</p>

        <p>I don’t know how well it reduces spread </p>
<p>And I’ll be the first to admit that for a young healthy person the biggest benefit is to reduce spread </p>
<p>We won’t know that for some time though, I also don’t think needing a booster means it can’t curb spread </p>
<p>I think it doesn’t curb spread quite a bit nut I’ll happily admit I was wrong if the data says otherwise </p>
<p>I think to compare total deaths to other years is valid and is something that doesn’t get mentioned but ultimately the only real comparison would be to compare 2020 with and without the virus, and this is and impossibility </p>
<p>My commons sense makes me thing that the measures we took to curb the spread would probably decrease deaths from other causes but you could argue it may increase deaths </p>
<p>I don’t see patients who are just fine, they don’t get admitted</p>
<p>Hospitalized patients have viral pneumonia, fevers, hypoxia, normal or barley elevated WBCs, elevated d-dimers, ferritin, ldh and other inflammatory markers, ground glass opacities on imaging </p>
<p>Any doc with have a brain would be able to diagnose this as viral pneumonia without a pcr </p>
<p>Treatment is honestly oxygen, steroids and breathing treatments are the next most effective </p>
<p>Most patients are given vitamin C/D/zincs and a lot will get remdesivir and regeneron at this point </p>
<p>Personally not sold on remdesivir or regeneron I think it’s oxygen or bust but I’m open to the idea </p>
<p>The big thing is the volume of hospitalized patients with these symptoms are way above average, and they come in waves and fast </p>
<p>This last delta wave we went from maybe 2-5% of our patients having covid to 35-40% over 3 weeks </p>
<p>That’s not normal at all. For the last week probably 1 in 4 patients showing up the out ER had COVID that’s a lot</p>

        <p>You specifically mentioned treatment and never mentioned two drugs that have the most evidence that they work?</p>
<p>You got what you deserve, I guess you are in fear of mentioning those useful drugs because all of the PSYOPS,  which is sad.</p>
<p>It's like we were talking about bacterial infections and you failed to mention antibiotics...</p>
<p>Read your post, you imply that all the treatments are "expensive drugs with little evidence of effectiveness and zinc"</p>

<p>As predicted ADE occurs after 8 months just like every other Coronavirus vaccine ever developed.</p>
<p>"COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials."</p>

        <p>When you analyze research and data you need to analyze it fairly and equally </p>
<p>Of course these vaccines were critically analyzed by a lot of very small people </p>
<p>And of course pitfall and side effects were discussed</p>
<p>What you will notice is the studies you send me to not show these vaccines cause ADE</p>
<p>They all are just asking a questions, a very good question, but ultimately all of these studies are a hypothesis absolutely no research showing these vaccines cause ADE</p>
<p>ADE is not a new concept, this is something the people developing these vaccines knew about, these vaccines were in trial for 9 months more then enough times for ADE to show up, so now you are forced to say “they are covering it up” .  Fine you can Have that point. On an international scale there is a cover up that affects billion </p>
<p>But now the people have been vaccinated for almost 9 months now. ADE takes 3-6</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be seeing vaccinated people getting sicker and getting infected </p>
<p>I am not, it’s unvaccinated who are sicker and who are the majority of our cases</p>
<p>Breakthrough cases defiantly happen but they are a minority</p>

<p>What next your gonna hate on penicillin because it didn’t double our lifespan?</p>
<p>Or maybe we cancel penicillin cause people have allergies and some even die?</p>
<p>Or maybe we cancel penicillin cause sometimes it doesn’t work, multi-drug resistance bacteria exist, some times the use of penicillin actually leads to more of these resistant bacteria?</p>
<p>But we don’t cause we can clearly see the lives penicillin has saved drastically out weigh the few lives that were negatively effected by penicillin?</p>

        <p>Science has been sacrificed by our health authorities and the media. Ive had to educate myself over the past year. Id say that the people who got the vaccine often are the ones least educated. As evidenced by their convincing argument to ‘just get the vaccine.’ For me I look at my current health, age, lack of co-morbidities and the fact I’ve had covid as enough reason to skip the vaccine. That outweighs the risk associated with taking the vaccine. Im not anti vax and I have lots of vaccines. Id consider the covid vaccine if I was over 55 or so.</p>

<p>I do find that people who are anti-covid vaccine and not absolutely anti-vax tend to Atleast make an effort to understand this, most of those who are getting vaccinated are not </p>
<p>If what you are telling about your health history you are right you personal benefit is almost none, I’m not sold your natural immunity will last forever but very well may last long enough to get through the pandemic and get herd immunity </p>
<p>What I will say is be careful with your knowledge and what you are saying, your defense against this vaccine is valid, but only for this vaccine. People will use what you are saying as defense against other vaccines. I hate the slippery slope analogy but it does ring true </p>
<p>All I ask is hold both peoples feet to the fire and stay honest, vaccinated and unvaccinated both need to be challenged</p>

        <p>Family Nurse Practitioner here,  maybe say it a little louder for those in the back……this whole pandemic has been roller coaster of chaos.   It’s very scary when “group think” and “opinions” are become the new normal for evidence base guidelines for medicine.</p>
<p>what’s disturbing is the that where threw the scientific method out the window and decided to start basing pandemic management on the most popular opinion to tyrant practices.  </p>
<p>Terrifying and disturbing is the lack of any actual development of basic clinical practice guidelines….i question whose determining these recommendation and on what bases?   In medicine, we have a system in placed called evidence based guidelines.  Evidence-based guidelines, also called clinical practice guidelines, "are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances" </p>
<p>Guidelines are developed by panels or groups of experienced individuals who carefully weigh syntheses of evidence and the strength of the evidence before developing recommendations..  These guidelines are graded on a letter scale of quality, validity, consistency of the evidence from research.  These are large panels consisting of several clinicians reviewing and discussing study results….but we have not had a single attempt to approach the pandemic in this manner…instead the white house has weekly COVID 19 briefing from 3 government employed clinicians who are projecting a political narrative.   The only time I seen anything remotely to a discussion about best practices for COVID was when congress had 2 congressional hearing from a couple critical care/internal medicine physicians about COVID last summer.   It was disheartening to learn about dexamethasone benefit for COVID as an option from a Congressional hearing.   The second hearing had Vanderbilt University head of critical care bring up the review of ivermectin as a possible treatment option citing studies done globally for a 4-5 month period presenting some interesting data that may be beneficial.  That was almost a year ago since that last hearing and were still at square one and it seems only 1 possible option available only—the vaccine.  Which research was done by paid employees of these pharmaceutical companies.   IT wouldn’t have been the first time that big pharm didn’t clearly give out all the details to the FDA about efficiency and safety…
And whatever happen to respecting a patient choice, even if i strongly believe the treatment is beneficial,  i have a duty to respect ur autonomy and decision with holding a grudge or thinking less of you….
So yes i stand by your post about its your right to decide if the vaccine is for u and also your right to decline without judgement or ridicule.   Somewhere in all of this, humanity forgot what makes us human…kindness, empathy, humbleness, and respect.   This is a scary point in history and medicine.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t agree more </p>
<p>I can say from my hospital system we have guidelines designed by our doctors, I’m blessed to work for one of the few large medical systems that promotes physician leadership </p>
<p>As you said it’s chaos, we are learning as we go, at the start of the pandemic we were intubating people relatively quickly out of fear that bipap may Aerosolize and come to find out months down the road the last thing we should being doing is a vent, it’s the absolute last resort and should only be used when someone is an inch away from death </p>
<p>Same goes from dex, we are told by the media and by government organization not to use it cause some garbage study from China said it didn’t help, luckily we have amazing icu docs making amazing decisions that did not fall for that concept</p>
<p>You think I’m blind to the fact that remdesivir and regeneron both non-generic drug that are exepensive and genuinely experimental are being used not questioned but the cheap generics aren’t? I’m not I see the flaws in the system </p>
<p>But seeing flaws does not me we must disbelieve everything else </p>
<p>Like you said this is chaos, and unfortunately because of the chaos we don’t have the luxury of waiting to 10 year studies and flawless guidelines </p>
<p>Overall both the trump and Biden administration have left the medical community flounder without any legit effort to support</p>
<p>When it comes to your health trust your health care providers not government officials with a 4 year degree in political science</p>

        <p>well said!!!  i work in a private practice with a experience and supportive family physician who thinks along the same lines as your ICU docs in managing COVID cases.   it’s nice to have a conversation with another clinician about this whole thing without judgement or becoming political…i guess i perplexed why it’s so quite in the medical community about these points?   it’s very surreal times to be working in medicine.</p>

        <p>It’s why we are in this mess </p>
<p>Vaccines and medicine has become team sports </p>
<p>I find that amongst physicians we have open discussions </p>
<p>I don’t know many doctors who don’t acknowledge the flaws and issues we have had </p>
<p>I think for most of them it’s dealing with patients that just don’t know, trying to tell someone their mother is about to die from covid and having the following response “covid isn’t real the 2nd amendment is” will make someone jaded </p>
<p>Now in my experience the conversation I have with patients and their families is relatively open, but I’m in a hospital so if you are talking or me it means you have covid and likely are more open to the idea </p>
<p>I firmly believe the vaccines work, I have hesitancy but I fear more that if we drag our feet we will never get out of this mess, but I know to name call or talk down to someone only drives them farther away </p>
<p>I think a lot of people with hesitancy will likely come around to the idea, especially as more vaccines come out and are available </p>
<p>There are anti-vax militants but that’s not the majority and I think as a doctor for me to treat someone with a reasonable question as if they are some loon will just drive them into the arms of the actual loons and radicalize them </p>
<p>Which is honesty my fear, where does the mistrust for the medical community end? my biggest issue with those in the community who are questioning the vaccine, is they don’t realize people are using their sound logic to back up some claims you would of never signed off on</p>
<p>I genuinely rarely find someone in health care who is belligerently telling patient to not get vaccinated ever,  but i do know some who conveniently leave out all the positive to the vaccines ya know?</p>

<p>LOL. <strong>Who is "militant?" The person who wants a right to choose what goes into their body or the person who is forcing an injection into them?</strong></p>
<p>Your account, your point of view, and everything you're saying is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Tricky,</p>
<p>I’ve been injured by two pharma products already. One gave me a lifelong illness, the othe was to treat that illness and ‘almost’ took my ability to walk. I’ve since learned to manage that illness without medication (very strict diet and cyclical fasting).</p>
<p>You know that medications, when used as prescribed, are responsible for enormous numbers of deaths each year. That doesn’t even touch other categories of medicine related death or illness (overdose, malpractice).</p>
<p>Tell me why someone like me would ever trust in Pharma again?</p>
<p>I respect other people’s decisions to get the jab, but I won’t be doing it. Protect yourself and let me live my life.</p>

        <p>I’m not asking you to trust pharma all the time, skepticism is healthy </p>
<p>It’s unfortunate what has happen to you, and yes all medication comes with risk, so does driving a car. We make risk/reward analysis and usually the fact we could save 100ks of lives by reach herd immunity is enough of a reward for me to get the vaccine </p>
<p>With your personal experience I may never be able to convince you the risk is very very low, but it is very very low</p>

        <p>Just want to let everyone know this doctor clearly has no idea what they are talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/072621-king-mejia-vaccine-hesitancy">The largest decrease in hesitancy between January and May by education group was in those with a high school education or less. Hesitancy held constant in the most educated group (those with a Ph.D.); by May Ph.D.’s were the most hesitant group.</a></p>
<p>In reality it's the people who are vaccinated that have ZERO knowledge on the topic.</p>
<p>They all seem to believe that there have been zero deaths caused by the vaccine.</p>
<p>They believe that the vaccines have been tested properly and are KNOWN to be safe.</p>
<p>They have zero knowledge of the past 40 years of coronavirus vaccine research.</p>
<p>Ignorance will not be bliss in this case as it sure seems like the neutralizing antibodies have now begun to wane and as predicted antibody dependent enhancement has begun in those who first got the vaccinations.</p>
<p>Delta variant?</p>
<p>Seems like a useful tool to deflect the blame away from the authorities who have constantly promised 95% effectiveness despite not even having a year's worth of data to make such bold claims.</p>
<p>This will indeed be interesting, and with how the vaccinated have been treating the unvaxxed I know that many of us will likely enjoy watching the chaos unfold.</p>

        <p>If all the information was available, along with unbiased study's and testing, years of data, truthfull numbers,  possible side effects and other info from reliable independent sorces, without monetary gain.. Hey sure even though there is never any guarantee, I  might be open to getting the vaxx... But there is to little info and 0 long term info.  Therefore I must protect myself as I have always done with everything in my life, and air on the side of caution untill I am fully informed.  I'm not anti-vax.... I'd just soon a few thousand rats and monkey's find potential problems with something before getting it injected into my body.  </p>
<p>And in the meantime I could really do without all the peer pressure to get the jab.  So thanks for your intelligent, common sense approach to wanting feedback.</p>
<p>Edit: after reading the conversations I just have a few questions, as stupid as they may be.. What if the vaccine ends up being worse than covid itself, and ends up killing the vast majority people who got it 3-5 years down the road? 
 What if instead of getting the vaxx, everyone had simply taken their chances with Covid and either never got sick. Or did, and built up a natural immunity with a 1% chance of death?
  Why does the vaccine theoretical worst case senario out weigh the no vaccine, worst case scenario by such a high margin?</p>

        <p>Cause we do have a lot of data</p>
<p>Do we have data for these exact vaccines 10-20 years from now? </p>
<p>We do don’t</p>
<p>I’d love if we did but we don’t have time </p>
<p>The number of sick and dying from the virus is a lot, this is not up for debate, if you want to debate the exact figures on the dooms day death clocks most news stations have that’s fine but regardless of the exact number I can tell your certainly it’s a lot. And the vaccine is working decreasing deaths and severe illness, this is not only via the cdc but what I’m seeing in out hospitals </p>
<p>I can also tell you certainly we do know a lot about these vaccine, on many metrics we know more about this vaccines then any prior vaccine. We have billions of doses world wide </p>
<p>The number of people inoculated at this point is so much higher then any vaccine required for approval. </p>
<p>As for longevity, ultimately the worst case scenario for the vaccine 5 years from now could be just as bad then the virus, considering they both are slim chances but equally I’d lean heavy toward the pro-vaccine side</p>
<p>And lastly the concept you could get a single dose or two doses of something and all of sudden get symptoms 5 years later is very foreign to how the body works </p>
<p>If you told me they want boosters shots monthly then maybe I could see chronic side effects, but If you get the vaccine the risks are the days right after the inoculation the idea of 10 year studies being needed as if that’s when most of the side effects happen is not how it usually works</p>

        <p>This is why I’m here primarily </p>
<p>The mistrust in your government or just large institution in general, is not only warranted it’s also correct. </p>
<p>There are absolutely some real sketchy things in regard to this pandemic </p>
<p>But what I see happening and what I fear is rational reasonable people like yourself will get isolated or push away by those who follow the mainstream narrative and throwing your right into the arms of the more conspiratorial folks.</p>
<p>My general rule of thumb is people take advantage of tragedy they don’t pre plan the tragedy </p>
<p>I think the fear and chaos is all that’s needed for a government to start taking rights in an effort to “protect us”</p>
<p>I think we can live in a reality where this virus is real and is a serious problem that can be fixed with vaccine, while simultaneously having the ruling class fear monger the very real pandemic to make power plays </p>
<p>The idea of vaccine passports terrifies me, but for me the vaccine passports and the efficacy of the vaccine Aren’t one in the same </p>
<p>What I see is the medical and scientific community at large carrying the weight of this pandemic on their back, while partisan politics is doing what they always do by getting us worked up, getting us to point the finger at each other while they run off with the bag</p>
<p>As long as the vaccinated and unvaccinated are at odds the elites are happy</p>

        <p>You are a hack.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>

        <p>Great post. What does IFR stand for?</p>
<p>Also, factor in the rate of spread: a highly deadly virus that barely spreads is less dangerous than the one that spreads rampantly but kills .01%.</p>
<p>The vaccine, scientifically, was never shown to prevent COVID spread, it only prevents symptoms and helps fight the infection. Politicians have ignored this largely.</p>

        <p>No. It makes you look like a liar. You didn't even know what the IFR is for the virus you are scared of. You claim to be a doctor but can't provide any proof for anything you have said. Yes 99.85% of the global population is 10 million but since the average death count per year globally is over 55 million...not really a big deal. What you are doing is fear mongering with emotional arguments. You definitely aren't the doctor you claim to be and if tih are...resign because I would be scared as fuck if your dumb ass was treating patients.</p>

        <p>Doc thank you for sharing. 
Is it true that the vax will make me less contagious?</p>

        <p>Sort of </p>
<p>Ultimately if you have an active infection you are contagious, the point of the vaccine is to prime your immune system to hopefully prevent the vaccine from being able to replicate and cause and acute infection </p>
<p>If the vaccine does fail and you are actively infected you are just as much as a risk of spreading it as anyone </p>
<p>I think this vaccine does decrease your odds of active infection but the data is still to be determined. </p>
<p>I also think this idea that asymptotic people can spread it is overblown, at the very least if your not coughing you are spreading it less. </p>
<p>When this is all said and done I think the vaccine will be proven to decrease spread, but this is something I think and I will fully admit I was wrong once more info comes out, but so far the data I have seen is promising</p>
