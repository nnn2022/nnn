    <strong>The doomers don't know what they have just done.</strong>
    <p><p>I think I know all of you. I think I know we are all good people that care about freedom, our family, friends and neighbors. I'm 40, conservative and have lived my life treating people how I would like to be treated. I've been there to fix their WIFI. I've been there to install a garden hose reel on their house. I have jumped at the opportunity to help out with a son or daughter when they needed me.<br>
That all just changed. I will never forgive them for what they have done.</p></p>

        <p>I can’t wait until a year or so from now when Biden supporters have had their honeymoon period and they realize what kind of country we have. They will be screaming about higher taxes and no jobs and no “normal” like they thought because they were so sure Biden “listens to scientists”. (Who told him to keep everything shut down.) </p>
<p>I will turn my back on them and give them no help.</p>

        <p>The higher taxes really crack me up,because a bunch of.... acquaintances on Facebook have been trying to gaslight people on that saying it's only the rich people who are going to have their taxes increased. Sweet,so when they pick up and leave for another country,who's going to eat those tax hikes then?</p>

        <p>Agreed. I've always been a tolerant person who helps in my community and in general. Always loving and supportive of people dont care the politics. This just became personal.

        <p>I am in also! And also because the tolerant left just censors us whenever they want.
I promise to work hard on minimalizing my taxes ( I live in The Netherlands and I pay income tax 52% on everything above 60K USD, sales tax is 21%) I am done paying for the liberals. I will set up my companies as the big tech! And I pledge to buy membership of conservative magazines and internet Media ! That I can do! And I will try to explain the facts and achievements of Trump to all my liberal friends and family. I will never forget how fake media treated Melania. Being nasty to her, his children and to Trump. As Churchill has said: do not tolerate intolerance....</p>

<p>Remember Bush v Clinton?  OMG everyone was saying Clinton was going to fuck everything up.  Instead he just fucked 1 intern.  :)  </p>
<p>I kid I kid....but honestly so many were saying it's DOOMTIME.</p>
<p>Same when Bush took over after a very close election with Gore.<br>
Same when McCain lost and we got our first black President.  </p>

        <p>I guess the difference is that this is not politics as usual. Sure republicans might have had concerns over Clinton or Obama in terms of fiscal policies etc but for the most part you as an individual were largely unaffected by the normal political games. Now fast forward to 2020 when I am in genuine fear of being arrested for traveling in my own country. Kids have had their childhood massively changed from the norm and we have set a really really scary precedent of control by the government with just about zero pushback.</p>

        <p>Come on man - it's only different because you're paying more attention this year and/or focused on some isolated things that are being magnified.  The only thing I see differently this election is how many people are really frustrated.  That's definitely higher.</p>
<p>&rt; I am in genuine fear of being arrested for traveling in my own country. </p>
<p>Why?  What's changed?  </p>
<p>Are you somehow focused on isolated incidents like the crowds shutting down traffic in Portland? and acting like that applies to the whole country? </p>
<p>Nothing has changed in the vast majority of the country.  Travel hasn't suddenly become more dangerous or arrest worthy.</p>
<p>&rt; Kids have had their childhood massively changed from the norm and we have set a really really scary precedent of control by the government with just about zero pushback.</p>
<p>Kids will be fine.</p>
<p>But you're right, the control issues are unprecedented and scary.  But we've known since forever they'll try to do that and it would be a serious mistake for them to try more measures.</p>

        <p>&rt; I am in genuine fear of being arrested for traveling in my own country.</p>
<p>&rt; Why?  What's changed?</p>
<p>Did you somehow miss the fact that, all over the world, countries are now tightly regulating where people can go?</p>
<p>Or did you not notice the recent trend of countries imposing increasingly severe fines and punishments for breaking those rules, including with regard to travel? </p>
<p>Maybe shit will work out, but if you don’t see the serious cause for worry, then you are willfully blind.</p>

        <p>For the most part, I do believe you on that. It probably won't be the end of the world if Biden gets in. But lately over these past few years, the left has been incredibly unhinged so the idea of them holding any amount of power at this point makes me a little uneasy.
Not to mention if they get away with blatant fraud,any American with a functioning brain will understand that their vote doesn't actually count for shit since the elites can just say"I don't like where this is going,let me fix that!"</p>

        <p>I agree. I have former friends who are major doomers, they absolutely adore lockdowns and restrictions. I have no intention of seeing or helping them again if this madness ever ends and I’m not sending them any Christmas or birthday gifts. Thanks to my decision, I’m already saving so much money and god knows I’ll need it when things inevitably get worse. If I’m ever allowed to leave Australia, I’m getting a one way plane ticket out of here.</p>

How can you be a good person as you claim then abandon it out of spite.   </p>
<p>People are now controlled by Fear, The Media Propaganda and blind trust in Authority.   They likely do not even notice that there acting against there own interests.   So treating them with a tribalistic nature is gonna make us look worse decreasing any public support we might have had.   Love Thy neighbour 
you’ll probably say that they don’t deserve it, maybe or maybe not.  But love isn’t about what we deserve, keep being the change you wanna see in the world?</p>

        <p>The whole reason we're in this mess to begin with is by expecting nations of millions and a world of billions to love and respect each other. Tribalism is in our bones, and we physically cannot care for more than our close friends and family. Not without that love snd respect growing shallow and hollow. We need to keep to our own tribes of shared interest, though it would be preferable to "agree to disagree" more peacefully.</p>

        <p>No, our "compassion" for each other. Millions of people will never have REAL compassion for each other, and the average citizen ain't buying the "all in this together" bullshit. But the average citizen is also too afraid to act because they lack a tribe to band together with.</p>
