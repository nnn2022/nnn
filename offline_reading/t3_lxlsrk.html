    <strong>No, not again please!</strong>
    <p><p>So last year on my birthday(march 13th, which was a friday)the PM of my country(hungary)announced that there  will be lockdowns and online schools.</p>
<p>I was really sad but everyone except me was happy. It lasted for 3 months.</p>
<p>Then in september we started school as normal(but with masks). It was pretty good and felt normal.</p>
<p>But then came today and at 11am they announced that there will be an all out lockdown for (((3 weeks))):</p>
<p>-no school
-masks both in and outdoors
-all non-essential buissenesses closed</p>
<p>I hated online learning and I don't want to return to it again but it seems I have to.</p>
<p>At least it wasn't announced on my birthday.</p></p>

        <p>Happy Birthday!!</p>
<p>I have a friend who has a birthday on September 11.  The first few years are weird, but then after that it gets kind of cool.  If that makes any sense.</p>

        <p>That could have been terrible 9/11 happening on your birthday, much worse than just the closing of schools and the start of a 3 month lockdown</p>

        <p>Why do you think Hungary is doing this? Are people there really that scared, or is it something else?  You would think that a country that with the courage to resist taking immigrants would be able to resist this too.</p>

        <p>I have no idea why but it's so wierd that there were just some mild lockdowns in fall but know it's a much bigger one. And the ppl I lknow are pretty scared for example my geography teacher got covid, survived, and still yells at us to put up our masks. So yeah people are pretty afraid here.</p>
