    <strong>Who is less humane: those who say “take the vaccine, you’re so selfish” or those who say “it’s your choice, there’s a lot of side effects”?</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccinated people need to CONSIDER the fact that there are DANGEROUS side effects to this vaccine!</p>
<p>Sure, grandma has the vaccine and you should get it to help her out…</p>
<p>BUT why don’t you also think about the ones being INJURED by the vaccines!?</p>
<p>SURE, you save some 70+ year old person, but at what expense!? </p>
<p>At the expense of some 32 year old’s ability to live after getting 3 different NEUROLOGICAL, CARDIOVASCULAR, etc. “side effects”?!</p>
<p>Utter HYPOCRISY!</p>
<p>Every coin has two sides. PLEASE CONSIDER BOTH SIDES. Please!</p></p>

        <p>Funny how they keep on saying "WHY DONT THEY TRUST THE VACCINE", yet the messaging from health experts has been atrocious, and the blatant censorship, they're not even trying to hide it.</p>
<p>Their actions are everything you should NOT do when trying to get someone to trust you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most people aren’t informed in the least.  It’s a disgrace, but that also includes vaccinators themselves</p>

        <p>Also, you can avoid COVID in other ways (hand-washing, anyone?) even if you don't get the vaccine, and if you do have it, you can avoid transmitting it to Grandmas by staying home until you're well.</p>

        <p>The vaccine push in my country has been so succesful that if I was to catch it now, it can only be from someone who is vaccinated. <br>
I can literally count on one hand the number of people I know who have declined to take it.</p>

        <p>What's amazing to me is that you have hundreds, if not thousands of leading scientists and doctors warning about the risks and they somehow dismiss them all. </p>
<p>Like these people think they are smarter than nobel prize winners and innovators of the very mRNA technology? The people who have everything to lose and nothing to gain are making the strongest stand against this while the proponents universally have a piece of the pie. Which is likely to be more disingenuous?</p>
<p>Yet these people who mostly have no expertise in data analysis, epidemiology, or statistics irrefutably refute with 100 percent certainty those who are putting their careers and reputation on the line and being persecuted for it. These people are even making the case that nobody, not even children should be exempted even if data clearly shows more risk of death from the vaccine and many countries won't even allow that.</p>
<p>The arrogance of that is mind boggling.
I just wonder how they will deal with it if, as it will likely be, that history shows they were wrong and share responsibility in what may well turn out to be genocide.</p>

        <p>The more I reflect on this, the more depressed I become at the fall of humanity. I feel in my spirit that there is a very dark, satanic evil coming over the whole world. I mean there are literally millions of people who would be fine with persecuting "anti-vaxxers" to the point of arrest and the hatred grows. </p>
<p>There are likely hundreds of thousands in the United States alone that would be fine with exterminating the vax-less if needed for the sake of humanity. They are completely convinced that they cannot be wrong.</p>

        <p>For we fight against spirits, my friend. Remember, as Christ was persecuted by his people, so shall we by ours. Stand tall in your faith or be crushed by the coming times. There are tons of people on the right side; just look at this sub! The protests around the world! Stay strong, be well!</p>
<p>Look towards the solution, not the problem! Towards light and not darkness! Have faith!</p>
