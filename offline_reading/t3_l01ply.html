    <strong>"But what about my scared boomer parents?!"</strong>
    <p><p>So I have been dating a woman for about a year now. It's gotten pretty serious and I've signaled that I would like to marry. Furthermore, we aren't really spring chickens anymore. We are both in our middle thirties and while I have kids from a previous marriage, she has expressed that she wants to have a kid or two. Well...there aren't that more shopping days left till Christmas, baby.</p>
<p>Well, I digress. We met in November of 2019. Well, when the pandemic hit, her parents will full on boomer doomer. They refused to go out to dinner. They refused to allow people in their home. The only time that I was ever allowed to see them was when we went to play golf and we had to all be social distancing. Last July we had them over for a "social distancing 4th of July picnic" where we ate barbecue and drank red wine in a 105 F garage, socially distanced, and when they came over they looked like they were in hazmat suits they had so many masks on. They stayed for a full 30 minutes. </p>
<p>They are both in their 70s but they aren't immunocompromised. They just got done with the first round of the Pfizer vaccine. </p>
<p>So, this weekend the girlfriend and I went and looked at engagement rings. I'm pretty magnanimous about these kind of things so I said, "Find what you like, look at what catches your eye, and once you make a decision we'll go from there." She found what setting she wanted and what cut/carat she wanted on the diamond. I took notes, said great, and went from there. </p>
<p>So I'm off today. After my jog I showered and dressed. She asked me where I was going and I said, "To the jeweler to go make a down payment." She then says that we are moving way too fast on this marriage idea and that she would like for me to meet with her parents more,  and perhaps even take a  trip to New York or a golfing trip to California,  before I purchase a ring and propose. </p>
<p>"Well, darling, they have only seen you about four times during 2020. They don't want to meet. They don't want to do anything in person. New York and California are completely shut down, nearly. So I am not sure how I am suppose to get to know your parents when they are in quarantine all the time." </p>
<p>She shrugged and said, "Well, maybe we can do this when the pandemic is over with? I want to enjoy it! I want to be engaged to you outside of a pandemic!" </p>
<p>I responded, "So, I have to put my life on hold - no, our lives on hold - until Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper come on CNN and tell your parents that it is safe for them to see the light of day again?" </p>
<p>I'm pretty much considering breaking off the relationship because of all this bullshit. I could have but she begged me not to leave.</p>
<p>I dunno, I've just fucking had it.</p></p>

        <p>You are not being unreasonable here. Your fiance needs to understand that you are not going to live by her parents' schedule if you get married. If they are doing this now they are going to do it in the future over other things.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry. I am slightly younger, early 30's, and my parents HATE my fiance, and are also doomers, but guess what? I'M the one who has to marry him, not them and I don't care. We are too old to worry about what the parents think, they may or may not be at the wedding, but past that when do you actually need to see and worry about them? Holidays for 30min? Not to come off as mean, but I think there are better prospects out there who will cherrish you more.</p>

        <p>Ugh I’m sorry. I hate the “let’s do this when this ends” Because will it ever end. But this is her first time getting married right so she prob wants everything to be magical and special. Getting engaged and not being able to celebrate with family and friends bc of pandemic prob puts a damper on things. I think you need to cool off and sit down and have a real convo. If you want kids and to be  together you can’t put your life on hold forever. Good luck. Covid has made everyone crazy</p>

        <p>If you actually loved her, you would wait.  Instead you are getting angry about a pandemic and making everything about you.   Breaking up isn’t a bad plan.  Good luck.</p>

        <p>I agree.  I realize what I said was not sugar coated.<br>
My worry is that she said she doesn’t want that ring on her finger right now.  That’s a red flag for me pandemic or not.  To have a successful marriage you have to be on the same page about all important things and that includes the timing of the engagement.  Why wouldn’t she want the ring on her finger with a date a year off?  It doesn’t sound like you are asking for the ceremony to be right away are you?  That’s what I would be thinking about.  </p>
<p>And I stand by what I said.  If she’s the one, then she’s worth waiting for.  She’s the one with the fertility issues not you.  If you can easily imagine starting over by finding someone else then that’s your answer.</p>

        <p>Yeah, she may have cold feet and it has nothing to do with the pandemic. Heck, couples who were truly in love at the time got married with barely a ceremony before the man went off to fight in WWII. They didn't care about the circumstances.</p>

        <p>We have no idea how long this pandemic is going to last. 
And this isn't so much about her. It's her parents. </p>
<p>So I should wait until a) her parents die or b) Anderson Cooper says that the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>With the way things are going in this nation I will be surprised if there is a United States left by the end of this year</p>
