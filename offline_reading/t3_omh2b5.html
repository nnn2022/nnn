    <strong>Another discreet step from Portugal</strong>
    <p><p>Framework for international friends. A few months ago we had an important football game in Portugal. Fans of the winning team held thunderous festivities in lisbon, without the expected security precautions, and the government was heavily criticized for having allowed the festivities.  It is not known for sure whether these festivities may have caused an acceleration of the wave we are experiencing now (not even the government would allow this association to be stablished, of course) but the subject has been much discussed since then.</p>
<p>Anyway, even during confinement, Portuguese legislation guarantees the right to citizens to carry out spontaneous or organized manifestations and also events of political nature, and the health authorities can only advise against its realization. Until now! Today the government announced that in these football festivities the right to manifest/celebrate was abused and as such they are going to change the law to restrict this freedom.  In other words, one of the fundamental rights of our legislation will be modified, the government will be able to choose who and under what conditions they can manifest, and in extension it will condition the right to assembly, one of the first freedoms to be removed in any dictatorship.</p>
<p>This in the same week that throughout Europe, increasingly intense demonstrations are starting to be seen against the restrictive measures that are being taken, as in France, Greece... coincidence?  does not seem to me.</p>
<p>Another day, another slow step towards the abyss...</p></p>
