    <strong>GF and I Caught Covid 19 (yes we got tested)</strong>
    <p><p>As the title reads, my gf and I caught Covid 19. </p>
<p>Because we live with my parents at this time, we spread it to my 40 yo mother (a nurse) and 50 yo father, as well as their 70 year old asthmatic friend. I felt terribly frightened because even though I was aware of this scamdemic, Covid is very real, and I couldn't bare the thought of hurting my loved ones... It's been 2 weeks in and we all feel great (thank God let it keep), well we feel sick but common cold sick. </p>
<p>I absolutely cannot believe how far this whole thing has come. The evil tyrannical power whores running 1st world countries are totally happy at how this plan is unfolding, yes a few hiccups (because of us, realists) but everything seems to be in check with Agenda 21. Please we need wake up! Pray that we do, and if you don't believe in a God put all your conscious energy towards manifesting what you wish. We all must inform the population. We are soo divided (by design) that we don't want to grow up and look inside OURSELVES and see that we too are the problem. Always pointing fingers, but never at ourselves. We must unite. Forget blue and red, left and right, and put forth Justness vs Tyranny. Leave social media, save money, buy gold and a firearm, learn you're rights and prepare. BIG BIG changes next 10 years. I pray they don't take my family's farm...</p>
<p>Mother Teresa said once "If we have no peace, it is because we forgot we belong to each other". And I think it fits well here. You cannot trust the media, only your neighbors.</p>
<p>Peace and love.</p>
<p>PS. REMEMBER CONTROLLED OPPOSITION AND THE HEGELIAN DIALECT (problem, reaction, solution)</p></p>

        <p>How did you find out you had Covid? Did it require a test?</p>
<p>Look I dont believe there is a virus. From different sources I heard virologist patitioned WHO to give them documents and samples of the isolated virus. They got a response saying they could not hand over such things because they didnt exist. If the virus has never been isolated what are we doing then?</p>
<p>This whole thing has been planned in advance. It's all a story they feed us. If you ask me we are experiencing the world's biggest screenplay where all governments are in on it. The whole leaking of a virus in China is all part of the narrative. Since China has been demonized by US for such a long time it makes sense to play peoples emotions by making them the cause of all this. It's just a play and both parties are in on it.</p>
<p>Common sense dictates that if a virus is soooo deadly it wouldnt take a test to determine if you had it. There is such a thing as flu season. And now that people have been isolated and weakened by staying indoors, not eating healthy it is no suprice to fall ill.</p>
<p>Dont let yourself be fooled by the histeria. Not to mention the PCR test was never made to diagnose a virus. So why are they using it in this matter if the creator adviced against it? Also 5G technology seems to negatively impact lungs. There was a technicians that worked on the telecom tower. He mentioned getting sick in the proximity of 3G - 4G  antenna's which are relatively weak signals compared to 5G which is 100x stronger. He was frightened what the consequences will be to be blasted by the waves 24/7.</p>
<p>It could just be that 5G is effecting your health. Covid 19 can be than blamed for your illness: a non-existing virus.</p>

        <p>We did take a PCR (positive). We live in the country and are away from towers. Terrible net here. We were working at a new commercial building and caught it from one of the tradesmen. 5g is a big no no in our household as well.</p>

        <p>Did you know that most routers support 5G WIFI? You might check your router to find out if its activated. 5G is not only used on towers. It will be implemented in most machines that connect to the net. It will soon be in every room or device you'll own. And how do you know so sure you cought it from a tradesman. No disrespect, but we humans have the tendency to fabricate a story to justify our preconseived notions</p>

        <p>Hey man. Please dont listen to the guy. There is absolutely nothing bad about 5g. Conspiracy theorists just took it to have something to complain about. Do your own research and dont let yourself get influenced by someone who doesnt have any expertise in the field.</p>
<p>The links he provided are from bitchute. Its a known echochamber for conspiracy theorists. You'll find stuff like holocaust denial on there wich should tell you that its not a good website for unbiased information.</p>

        <p>There only need to be a few puppetmasters. The rest are (ignorant) people following orders. Amongst these people are a few who know something isnt right but are to cowardly to say something in fear of losing their jobs or looking like a fool.</p>
<p>This pandamic has demonstrated that even the doctors and police go along with this shit because they got orders from above. The police is being turned into the GESTAPO right in front of our very own eyes. You know what their excuse for going along with using violance on innocent people who want to party or protest against tyranny? "We are just following orders". The ones who are vocal are terminated. Most people can be easily controlled by the use of shaming language, playing on their emotions, threats of fines or the loss of their jobs.</p>
<p>Many folks are indoctrinated to believe the mainstream media. Just look at how religions have successfully convinced millions that a sky daddy exists without proof. If people can be persuaded of that, mankind can be persuaded of anything. It's nothing but a believe system that is bought into. It becomes part of their identity which majority will fight anyone who theatens their sense of self.</p>

        <p>Who are those puppetmasters you people always talk about? Do you really think that the democratically elected leaders of the western world are all taking orders from a few 'puppetmasters'?</p>
<p>And whats with all the people who've actually had covid? (such as myself by the way). Are you suggesting that everyone who had to be hospitalized actually just had the normal flu? Also whats with everyone who is suffering from the long term consequences such as low stamina, short breath and more? Ive never had a flu that I suffered from for more than a week.</p>

        <p>All great questions! First of all I'd like to state that I'm a truth seeker, looking for ways to expand my understanding by being open to a multitude of point of views. I'm not here to convince you that my way of thinking is the right one. I, just like you are trying to make sense of this mess. One thing you should know is that we humans are born in a system which is compriced of other systems. Your world view, habits, knowledge and beliefs are molded by these systems. You are an accumulation of ideas you've copied from others. Therefore most of you is unoriginal. 
Take the pandamic for instance. You've been told there was an pandemic and accepted it because (most likely) you trusted the sources. But did you question the validity of the sources? Most people don't question it. All they need to be convinced is to be exposed to a message (propaganda) long enough that comes from people with a prestigious title or some sort of authority/fame. I you delve deep enough in human psychology you will find that a believe is a repeated thought you accepted as true. Repetition is key here. Keep repeating a lie and it wont be long for you to accept it as truth. 
This is the very reason why the media is exposing us 24/7 with the pandemic narrative. The more you hear about it, the more you begin to believe it.
If they stopped talking about covid, lifted the mask mandates and social distances, in a couple of days people will forget about this so called pandemic and revert to their normal lives like nothing ever happened. If you want something to stop: stop talking about it.
There is a reason why masks play an essential role in this deception. People need continual reminding of the pandamic. If there is no distinction between normal live and a pandemic people will just forget due to the lack of visible signs. People by nature have a short attention span.</p>
<p>Now to answer you questions</p>
<p>And whats with all the people who've actually had covid? (such as myself by the way). 
- Did you know that the PCR test is currently used in ways it was not intended for? The inventor (Kary Mullis) has mentioned the limits of the test. Searc h for his videos on YT and bit chute. If the inventor even said that it cant detect the presence of a virus, why are they using it still? My answer to that is simple. Because they knew that the tests would yield faulty results. Coca cola even tested positive. See https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/292952 There are many instances where fruits or other fluids tested positive. The test is bogus. A perfect tool to fake the statistics with and fool the masses that dont do their own research.</p>
<p>I dont know what you had. It might be a common flu or other factors like mass hysteria (self hypnosis) or exposure to 5G network that is known to cause some extreme harm to the body. See bit chute .com/video/zXCPl63vNdTm</p>
<p>Also comparing the orders the police follow today to the orders that the gestapo followed is downright disgusting.
- Do you know how the GESTAPO came to be? Did you really thing these men started of as killer cops? No they didnt, the were slowly conditioned to increase the amount of violance and dispicable acts they performed. Their limits were slowly expanded. There is a book written about it. In it these men were interviewed. One such man told that they were fearful and sickened by their acts, but they were forces to become these animals. Bit by bit, very slowly. Just like we are conditioned within a year to give up our right one by one. It's a slow process. Make no mistake, the police is slowly being groomed to become the next GESTAPO. It wil take some many months. But if this keeps going they will turn into stone cold killers. They've shown willingness to beat up defendless people https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mruhbr/and_this_one_will_make_you_mad/. A sign of compliance with tyrannical rules.
Some police are calling out that they are turning into the GESTAPO. See here: bit chute .com/video/SIAvOh4nOk0Z/</p>
