        <p>This recording gives you some insight into what is happening across Canada as each province's health authority operate lock-step, to silence any and all opposition.</p>
<p>This is not about science, it's not about health. It's always been about control, and Big Pharma's bottom line.</p>

        <p>Dude handled it like a boss. Good on him. </p>
<p>It's fucked up, because I actually have a screenshot of what the WHO had on their site that day, it stated [06/21/2021]:
&rt;<strong>Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.</strong>
There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

        <p>This is what narcissist gaslighting is. Especially the way that “woman” creature spoke. That language is designed to get an angry response out of someone on the receiving end.</p>

        <p>"Dr. Francis Christian, Clinical Professor of General Surgery at the University of Saskatchewan and a practising surgeon in Saskatoon. Dr. Christian was called into a meeting today, suspended from all teaching responsibilities effective immediately, and fired from his position with the University of Saskatchewan as of September 2021.</p>
<p>There is a recording of Dr. Christian’s meeting today between Dr. Christian and Dr. Preston Smith, the Dean of Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan, College of Medicine, Dr. Susan Shaw, the Chief Medical Officer of the Saskatchewan Health Authority, and Dr. Brian Ulmer, Head of the Department of Surgery at the Saskatchewan College of Medicine.</p>
<p>In addition, the Justice Centre will represent Dr. Christian in his defence of a complaint that was made against him and an investigation by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. The complaint objects to Dr. Christian having advocated for the informed consent of Covid vaccines for children.</p>
<p>Dr. Christian has been a surgeon for more than 20 years and began working in Saskatoon in 2007. He was appointed Director of the Surgical Humanities Program and Director of Quality and Patient Safety in 2018 and co-founded the Surgical Humanities Program. Dr. Christian is also the Editor of the Journal of The Surgical Humanities."</p>

        <p>They are definitely setting up for a mental health intervention.  It isn't out of the realm of possibility to say that this was leaked, or allowed to leak, by TPTB in order to send a strong message to other doctors. </p>
