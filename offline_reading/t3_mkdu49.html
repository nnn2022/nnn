    <strong>Not wearing a mask means a lot more than you may think.</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm going to try not to dox myself to heavily here, but I will be talking about personal information.</p>
<p>Back in April 2020 I had an injury that made me leave work. I'm a faculty manager at a sports Arena. I've thought the WuFlu was bullshit from day one. The first person I've heard talking about it was Alex Jones, followed by Steven Crowder. MSM took forever to pick the story up. </p>
<p>Anyhow, none of that is important. What is important is that when I came back 10 months later, everyone wore masks all the time. As I met some new people and reintroduced to the old, I let them know that I don't want to wear a mask, but if they want me to wear one around them I would. </p>
<p>Mask compliance dropped to nearly 0% when it could be tolerated (we still have to wear when we have the public or external contractors in order to avoid fines). However I now could see my employees faces and smiles as they figured out problems, and how they socialized better. </p>
<p>Given the size of our arena, we also rented out one of the pads for a test site. When I started these people had a 100% mask compliance going on. Didn't see a single face. Now I can look out my office window onto the pad and see them maskless more often than not, when they're not testing or administering vaccines. </p>
<p>This Wuhan Flu is a joke, and my government, the Canadian government is a joke as well. However if I've seen anything this past month, it's that something as simple as not wearing a mask, can break the spell and encourage others without issue. </p>
<p>You can be the change you want to see. So be it.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask in months.  I live in a pretty rural area (midwest US near canada) and nobody here wears masks, its truly amazing to see people rise above the Covid shitshow and put it behind them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, when I go to a store near my parents place (suburban/urban), I would be the only person in the entire store (prob 200+ people) without a mask.  I don't see myself as a "rogue" or a "hero against the establishment" or anything like that, I just believe that my God-given freedom to decide what I wear on my face shouldn't be controlled by anyone but myself.  But how is it that NOT A SINGLE PERSON has a pair of balls big enough to break free.  Hell, I see countless people walking around town with their faces covered (in the park, on the street, etc.).  It's like they don't care anymore, it seems as though they just cave in and accept that their freedoms are getting ripped out of their hands without a fight.  Many people still don't realize freedom is what its all about.  </p>
<p>In many ways, I have great hope for humanity.  I see people waking up and thinking critically about what's going on in the world.  But in many ways I also fear that sincere ignorance is pushing us deeper into the trap.  When will people realize it is not person vs person, it is the people vs the elites?  How much longer must we be complicit and hand over our freedoms?</p>

        <p>I gotta wear masks, I'm already sus as it is. In my social circle I'm already known as that "schizophrenic conspiracy lizard people nutjob".</p>
<p>I'm not a very liked person as I'm not very nice as it is and I'm always getting angry and vent endlessly about the tyrannical government. And I feel that if I stopped wearing a mask completely as a protest against the dictatorship people will think i finally done fucking lost my mind and I'll become even a worse pariah.</p>
<p>I just wish I could properly release my anger at our lords up the ladder, but I might be the only No New Normal protestor in miles</p>

        <p>It's frustrating to see people sincerely being ignorant to facts.  You aren't crazy, you are a healthy critical thinker questioning life and your surroundings, as humans were created to do.  Unfortunately many people seem to have lost this trait in recent years.  Some people can't be told the truth.  They must be <strong>shown</strong> the truth.</p>

        <p>Maybe the better approach would be to ditch the venting in favor of taking action (here, by not wearing the mask). </p>
<p>Btw, unless you highly value your venting for its own sake, you may want to consider doing some research into effective communication and persuasion. You could be absolutely, <em>verifiably</em> right about something - but if you shove it down people’s throats, they’re still never going to listen to you or take you seriously. </p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>

        <p>Amen. I'm always the one in my group that gets friends and strangers to unmask. Hell my in laws just told me that they went to home depot and took their mask off that made me so happy. They refuse to get the gene therapy and they're in their mid 60s.</p>

        <p>Good for you dude. For us it may not seem like a big deal but most people simply lack the personal strength to make the decision that they’d rather not wear a mask. </p>
<p>Those people need us to set an example and make them feel comfortable taking their mask off.</p>
<p>Of course they’re STILL FUCKING SHEEP but it’s much better that you be their Shepard as their friend instead of the psychopaths who write the news.</p>
