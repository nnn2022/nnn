    <strong>I’ve recently reactived my Facebook to Red Pill the masses.</strong>
    <p><p>I haven’t posted on my Facebook in a while. I recently reactived it (and by reactived it I mean redownloaded it) to gage the reaction from my friends. It’s for the most part a Copy Paste job from what I post on Reddit. However I’m not really concerned with what Reddit thinks. I use Reddit to gage “Agreement” aka Like activity. </p>
<p>I’m concerned with what the people WHOM I know in real life think. I’m not after Likes like I am on Reddit. I’m after discussion. </p>
<p>Of course I’ll have my Left Wing friends comment. And of course they get the most silent likes. But I have noticed that I have been getting more likes lately with what I post from friends I don’t normally see active on Facebook. So that tells me I am reaching people. Those silent browsers who just browse and don’t comment. </p>
<p>Now of course my Left Wing friends debate me the most. And just like Reddit they pick apart most of what I say. It’s my most important points that they don’t pick apart is what I find really interesting. They’ll either not respond or just completely ignore it. </p>
<p>After all on Facebook I have my real name and identity attached. So I have no problem saying what I say here on there. Since that is what I believe to be factually correct. </p>
<p>One of my Left Wing Friends whom I have been debating with a lot on Facebook recently admitted that things are feeling a “little dystopian”. Only on Facebook would I get that admission. Left Wing Reddit would never admit that. They would double down. Now he also believes Fraud Fauci to. But the fact that he even admitted things are feeling dystopian is a big win in my book. It tells me I am making convincing arguments. </p>
<p>I’m making this post because Cuomo announced he wants Bars and Restaurants to do a Vaccine only admission. People on Reddit who have the unfortunate circumstances of living in New York State like I do reactive your Facebook! Engage with your friends and family! We have to stop King Cuomo! We can’t do that on Reddit since Reddit is a Democrat Hive Mind Circle Jerk. We have to organize the resistance to these Orwellian Policies on Facebook! That’s why the Regime is targeting Facebook. It’s not Twitter, it’s not Reddit. It’s real people WHO YOU KNOW! </p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to speak your mind! It may get you banned. (It’s gotten me banned many times). Don’t let them silence us!</p></p>

        <p>I live in Ny. I’ve been alienating myself since I realized two weeks to flatten the curve was a lie. Some people do respond well tho and I think they are waking up. My older relatives think I’m selfish and ignorant tho.</p>

        <p>I live here and the Facebook thing hasn’t really been working out for me.  Lol.  Yeah, I’m a bit extreme I think.  I just won’t go places that demand the piece of shit thing.  Anyone who’s into it, is a shmuck.</p>
