    <strong>Signal Messenger may be compromised - relevant because many of us use it daily on the assumption it is a safe way of communicating and organising for rally’s etc.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m aware this may at first appear outside of the main topic of this sub, but I feel this is relevant given many people believe Signal is a safe, secure and encrypted way of communicating away from the prying eyes of authorities for general day to day chat and more importantly here, discussions that may be not so supportive of the governments or their views. </p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not saying with 100% certainty that I “know for a fact” that it is compromised, but I am urging you to have a look at some of the articles and issues that have been raised publicly (which have been met with hostile response, but very little substance in rebuttal) that I have started to compile in a new sub r/forkingsignal and draw your own conclusions. At best there is some serious question marks over it’s head which should be enough reason to use it with caution.</p>
<p>I’m sure most of you have enough day to day Opsec to not say anything on Signal you wouldn’t say in a “plain text unencrypted SMS” and just live by the assumption that someone is always watching - but here’s the heads up and remember this post when it all comes out in the not so distant future that Signal was a honeypot to monitor everything from actual crime through to thought crimes. </p>
<p>I remember when I was in year 3 at school back in 1988 when the teachers told us about how in Nazi Germany, the SS would sometimes tap into peoples phones and listen to their private conversations and the entire room gasped in disbelief that a government would do that, even during a time of war.</p>
<p>How ironic that today, even the most common person has come to assume (actually, know)  this is happening to each and every one of us as a matter of routine. </p>
<p>If you care about your communications being safe and private, I will post some suggestions in follow up comments here - but please do yourself a favour, have a little look at the links in the posts in the sub r/forkingsignal and have a read - and come to your own conclusions after taking that information in. The earlier posts are particularly damning.</p></p>

        <p>Suggestions for alternatives to Signal: </p>
<p>For those of you who organise rally’s and other activism activities, here are some alternatives that are possibly a little bit safer. </p>
<p>SignalJW is a fork that is available as a download from GitHub and at the very least, it retains some of the security features that Signal has stripped away recently. </p>
<p>However, I believe the compromise is on the server side of Signal, which means any version of Signal that hasn’t been vetted client side and/or uses the signal servers has the same security risks. </p>
<p>Basically, Moxie (signal) doesn’t allow signal forks to use the Signal servers which means they can’t communicate with other legacy Signal users - but he strangely allows some (like the JW fork) and stopped others that were more secure (like the Libresignal fork). The question again is why? </p>
<p>The possible alternatives are other apps, but I don’t know that the Signal client (the phone app) is compromised as such, it’s only when it passes through the Signal servers that it becomes compromised - so the alternative for those of you who organise activists would be to set up your own Signal server using the source code available and have your users join your own version of Signal specially set up for these types of comms. Added bonus is you can properly vett people in your network.</p>

        <p>The last company to claim dominance over Signal was Cellebrite and their hardware/software not able to do what they claimed.  I call bullshit.</p>
