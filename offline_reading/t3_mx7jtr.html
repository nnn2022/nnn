    <strong>Anybody else heard of Agenda 21/2030?</strong>

<p>Also here's their opening statement, the conference happened in 1992:</p>
<p>1.1. Humanity stands at a defining moment in history. We are confronted with a perpetuation of disparities between and within nations, a worsening of poverty, hunger, ill health and illiteracy, and the continuing deterioration of the ecosystems on which we depend for our well-being. However, integration of environment and development concerns and greater attention to them will lead to the fulfilment of basic needs, improved living standards for all, better protected and managed ecosystems and a safer, more prosperous future. No nation can achieve this on its own; but together we can - in a global partnership for sustainable development.</p>
<p>They are not only the cause of these problems, but they are giving us the solutions to stop these problems. Seems pretty ridiculous to me and incredibly sinister. I feel like I'm watching a movie right now with the things going on in the world and their "solutions" for the future.</p></p>
