        <p>This is all down to Bill Gates trying to inject us with microchips = Conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Billions of people being injected with a vaccine that skipped the standard safety protocols, and is causing multiple complications and side effects. Causing the government to change law to mandate taking the shot, which is already being outmutated by the virus which is now allowing vaccinated people to transmit to other vaccinated people who may still be hospitalised or die = Welcome to summer 2021.</p>

        <p>Plot Twist: They want the vaccine to make healthy immunocompromised so they can flip the script and say vaccinated people need to stay home. Heck they are already telling us to put masks back on.</p>

        <p>I've developed new mental health issues I never had before Covid. I haven't gotten tested yet, but I am almost 100% positive I am dealing with anxiety and depression. Yet that's totally fine because at least we aren't spreading germs? WTF</p>

        <p>A whole lot of nice people also still have this idea that people in power are basically just like them. The reasoning goes like this: I'm not perfect, but I'm not a monster. I'd never deliberately harm another person and I don't know anyone who would.</p>
<p>Therefore: the various governors who decided to put COVID patients into nursing homes, directly causing the deaths of thousands, which pushed up death rates and helped justify lockdowns and everything that's come about since, MUST HAVE just been stupid or misinformed. They would never have done that on purpose for those reasons. No one would ever suppress discussion about inexpensive safe existing drugs that appear to greatly reduce deaths, or flat out prohibit prescribing them, because that would directly harm or even kill people. Must just be they were stupid or misinformed.</p>
<p>I have a relative who has become quite red-pilled, but she can't bring herself to believe what I believe - yes, they knew, and they did it on purpose. Because it serves their purpose of power and/or money. And if she or I or YOU have to die, that's a risk they're willing to take. </p>
<p>Even without everything I've learned about the vaccines that made me decide not to get one, just seeing who is pushing it is honestly the only information I needed. I also have noticed recently that they've realized the normal messengers aren't effective on many of us, and have shifted to getting people they believe we trust to act as messengers.</p>
