    <strong>I have never been an antivaxxer until now.</strong>
    <p><p>I have never had a flu vaccine, but I have had all the others as required per law (the ones needed for public school). So traditionally, I’ve been pretty pro science and medicine. Not pro science as in, “Hey, look what Dr.X just said!”, but pro science as in “Hey, those trials and studies that were independently tested worldwide helped to demonstrate the efficacy and safety profile of the drug!”. The same kind of pro science that focuses on potential issues and doesn’t downplay them. The kind of system that does what it can to find out if the conclusion is accurate and then tests said conclusion until proven otherwise. See, science is a system of changing facts and information. Not a definitive thing that isn’t allowed to be questioned. </p>
<p>Actually, as a matter of fact, questions are encouraged by any real scientist. We are human after all, and we don’t know everything. Never has one scientist, or group of them, had the authority to solely dictate fact from fiction. Only time and rigorous experimentation can determine that. A fact is a fact however, and that fact is that these vaccines have never been put through the rigorous testing needed. They haven’t been studied for years, like they should be. In contrast, the vaccines I received as a child were around years before I was even born. That’s not to say that they are without flaw or risk. It just shows that there is no precedent set for this vaccine. Its a new type that isn’t like the traditional ones, and it hasn’t even been out for half a year. I’m not against actual science,I’m just against the thing the people have mistook for science.</p></p>

        <p>Was it 2 or 3 years ago when Reddit was suddenly all about making fun of antivaxxers?</p>
<p>I remember making a comment about how strange it was (and it was probably made on a now banned subreddit like t_d) because antivaxxers were and are a small little subset of nutty people - kind of like flat-earthers.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this was a conspiracy, or part of a conspiracy, but golly gee was that a convenient little bit of programming. Now everyone (even people who didnt care or didnt know) associate "being anti-mRNA therapy and the associated propaganda apparatus" = "you want kids to get Polio"</p>

        <p>This is the same stance I have. As a software developer usually the 1st iteration of any work has a ton of bugs. I am ok waiting a few years until they work out all the bugs, and I can see the long term effects of the vaccine. I eat healthy and exercise regularly, I'll take my chances with covid over these vaccines for now.</p>

So we’re other chemicals and medical treatments.</p>

        <p>So I took the fucking thing, but I am still of the mind that it’s a persons choice. I am legit horrified at how many people are going down this road of the government literally sticking needles in people against their will, or depriving you access to society because you’re have a different perspective on bodily integrity.</p>

<p>I even had yellow fever and two other vaccines before traveling to Africa, and I never ever questioned mandatory vaccines for children.</p>

<p>I would still have the yellow fever vaccine any day again in the same scenario, yet I am now labeled anti-vax (lol).</p>

        <p>The established vaccines are also vaccines, not "let's see what happens when we re-program your DNA but call it a vaccine".</p>
<p>Vaccines have historically been a weakened or dead virus. This is RNA that causes your body to manufacture the protein spike found on a virus. Huge difference.</p>

        <p>I applaud you. I am of the opinion that if any rational person actually studies vaccines, they’d come to the same conclusion and would never dream of injecting their innocent children.</p>
<p>You might have to, you know, look outside of the sources and studies that have been funded by the very entities that stand to make billions off of them. </p>
<p>I don’t know why it’s so hard for so many people to wrap their heads around the very real fact that the government/CDC/hhs ain’t here to protect you. All you are is a big dollar sign. 95% of the fda approved products would be recalled if it was about your health.</p>

        <p>I agree. I do not need to research all vaccines to notice the scheme... I haven't really looked into vaccination data before this covid shit show.  Once I realized all the manipulation, lies and censorship happening, I made the decision to not ever accept any drugs for myself or my future family without doing some independent decentralized research. Honestly, I am now always starting my analyze with the fact that those vaccine are cancer and will only change my choice under unquestionable facts. Which probably won't ever happen. So yea, I'm 100% anti vax. I couldn't care less what people think of me or my opinion. I have looked at ingredients on some of those. WTF.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you've said about the COVID-19 vaccines and how horrible a precedent it sets. For all we know, these COVID vaccines could be slowly sterilizing people over the course of several years, yet we won't know anything about it until long-term data emerges about the vaccines. Meanwhile, people are willing to "get the jab" as quickly as they can, without hesitation, and for stupid, temporary things, like cash incentives and food.</p>
<p>With that being said, contrary to what Reddit affirms, opposing THESE vaccines in particulat does not necessarily make you an anti-vaxxer. I, for instance, acknowledge the safety and protection that a vaccine DONE RIGHT and NOT RUSHED can provide for people who take them, but these COVID vaccines are far from "not rushed." The fact of the matter is that it is simply too early to make these substantial, all-encompassing claims about the safety of COVID vaccines, given how short of a time they have been tested and used for thus far. </p>
<p>The worst you could call yourself is concerned of the long-term consequences of a still experimental vaccine, something that may come off as paranoia to some, but is far better and safer than the alternative of haphazardly plunging the needle into your veins and risking your health over frivolous things.</p>

        <p>The CDC doesn't have any long term studies comparing the general health outcomes of vaxxed vs. unvaxxed kids.</p>
<p>The pilot one I've seen with some 200 or so participating children painted a picture that definitely looked like they caused health problems.</p>
<p>If they knew they helped and we're harmless they would have collected this data for nearly a century now. The fact thay they haven't tells you something.</p>

        <p>In principle, I've opposed forced/coerced vaccination no matter the "public health" benefit since at least my teenage years. I do support voluntary vaccination, but as I don't trust the governments and corporations who develop vaccines or their mooks who admister them, I won't get vaccinated or have romantic/sexual relations with anyone who is vaccinated. Barring the childhood vaccinations we had no choice in, of course. I try not to think about those. In practice, that means I've been a hardcore anti-vaxxer who wants to deny everyone the right to vaccination ever since the Russians brainwashed me just last year.</p>

        <p>I dont consider myself an "antivaxxer" at all. I've had my tetanus shots, my MMR, all the big ones. I think the people worried about "mecury" and "formaldehyde" are pure unadulterated nutters who heard a word they didnt understand and got spooked because middle school chemistry was hard. I think people worrying about MrNA changing their DNA probably failed biology hardcore in school.</p>
<p>I'm only "against" this particular one. and not even so much as "against" it, just agaisnt it being forced until its been long-term tested. Next year? when we've seen long term results? when we know what the risk and side effects are, and what the factors are that contribute to those risks? I'd consider it. Right now, we still dont know or have proven a thing. </p>
<p>I'm not antivaxx, i'm anti junk science.</p>

        <p>You're good. I just ask because I'm terrified of the sentiments that a waaayyyy larger group than I ever would've guessed are in support of. Taking peoples rights away and socially bullying them over an experimental medical treatment. Science being turned into something of a cult.</p>
<p>I knew there was always some people who were easily manipulated by propaganda, and the potential to turn them on their fellow citizens was there. What threw me back was just how many don't see any problem in it. Even people who seem very intelligent and loving. So I'm trying to see how widespread this thinking is. Thanks for clearing it up and I have another small reason to hold some faith in humanity still.</p>

        <p>same. nothing wrong with science if treatments are proven safe. ive had vaccines but im not putting experimental vaccines in me no matter how much pressure there is to do it. you aren't anti vax, you simply are resistant to the media gaslighting you and making you feel insane for not wanting to be a literal lab rat</p>

        <p>Vaccines at one point were good and important. Modern day vaccines have been about money and desensitization for a long time now. The flu shot trying to "predict" what strains will be most prevalent is complete bogus. Anything that they are giving out for free should be a huge red flag. Taking a vaccine for an eradicated disease like polio is also a joke. I'm all for ACTUAL vaccines when they are necessary for protection, not this cash grab, population control, gene therapy drug to save us from a scary 99.98% survival rate virus.</p>
