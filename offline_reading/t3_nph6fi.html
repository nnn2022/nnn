    <strong>If you win a vaccine sweepstakes you have no right to anonymity</strong>
    <p><p>If you happen to be one of the “lucky” who wins one of the million dollar lottery jackpots (a ticket, for which, can only be obtained by choosing to get the vaxx) your name and likeness will be broadcast publicly. That’s just a part of the overall deal you’ve agree to, but the official reason for why it has to be done like has stood out to me as BS from the very start. </p>
<p>The official reason is that if you don’t collect your winnings in public and they don’t identify you to the entire then people would be left to wonder if the lottery organizers were favoring their friends and family/giving the prizes out to people they know. In other words, it might have been rigged.</p>
<p>That they even took the time to tell us this struck me as odd and unnecessary. Did anybody really have a fear of this or was it even something that’s so likely to happen there needed to be an official policy in place to thwart it?</p>
<p>I never assumed the winners were going to be anonymous, because that doesn’t fulfill the ultimate purpose which is to make more people get the vaccine. I mean, that’s pretty much the universally accepted agenda behind stuff like the lotteries is it not? I think we can all agree on that. </p>
<p>And what serves that agenda best? Not having some nameless, faceless person collect their vaccine prize. What serves their agenda is having the public see some smiling, happy person get rewarded in a way we all would want to experience. It makes it real, it’s relatable, and it reminds us, “Hey, this could have been me!” </p>
<p>To that end the fact that the first public winner to be thrust into the spotlight was as “perfect” as they come (really pretty girl next door type who was on her way to buy a new car when she got the news she’d won a million dollars and would no longer have to worry about car troubles) almost sounds like something they’d be more likely rig than cheating so the prize goes out to their friends and family. </p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not saying anything was actually rigged. The suggestion never even crossed my mind. But I don’t have a clue who is in charge of these vaccine lotto contests but I would assume the people behind them are those who are already in a position of money and power. And we don’t have some ingrained distrust of public lotteries or collectively suspect lotteries of being rigged in general so it seems like they’re going out of their way to explain something no one is even asking about in the first place.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I thought the girl who won was a little too perfect as well. She was also the right age, wasn't she? Perfect to get younger people to get the vaccine. Now I am wondering what would happen if a kid under 18 won? Normally chilldren cannot enter lotteries.</p>

        <p>I had this same thought- money laundering. They showed their hand with the stimulus money. If they were smart they would have made 100% of it go to the people, but they’re scrambling and fumbling the ball, lucky for us.</p>
