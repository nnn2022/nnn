    <strong>Don't Let Your Guard Down</strong>
    <p><p>Here in the UK they're slowly easing restrictions (masks and social distancing still required in shops though and other general nonsense), and glimmers of hope and normality are starting to appear. But we've seen this happen before, right after first lockdown. Soon as the warm weather hits the cases and deaths drop (funny that, almost as if more people die in Winter every year or something!) and the government rolls back some of the bullshit. People are going to flaunt the rules anyway to enjoy the sun so might as well take away the restrictions, wouldn't want to give them a taste of free will and rebellion now would we! How magnanimous of them! They're not so bad! Fucking Boris is alright, ain't he, lads? Genuine bloke! I'D GO FOR A PINT WITH HIM.</p>
<p>DO NOT trust the fuckers. I could be dead wrong but my gut tells me this is only temporary. After the past year can you blame me? They fucking know they can do this whenever they like now. Covid isn't going anywhere, and if the Fauci ouchies are as bad and useless as we think they are then we're even more fucked. Herd immunity is never going to be achieved if we carry on locking down the country every time the weather turns cold or a couple new cases appear.</p>
<p>Masks aren't going anywhere, either, guarantee it. They're an easy way to virtue-signal and show off how much of a fuck you TOTALLY give about other people, and have even become fashion accessories to some people. They fucking like wearing them! They've become normalized, which is what we all fucking feared would happen in the first place. We have been ten steps ahead of the fucking curve this entire time and we've been mocked and scoffed at for it. Well fuck you with a flagpole, I hope you're satisfied with yourselves.</p>
<p>Wanna know the real kicker? The fuckstains who have been howling for lockdowns and restrictions aren't even affected by any of it. They don't see their family and friends! They have no lives! They don't go to the cinema or the pub, that's why they simplify all of our valid arguments and concerns down to "WAAH, I WANNA GO SINK A FEW PINTS WITH THE BOYS"! To them that is literally all we want because they have zero fucking clue how the real world functions or the intricacies of human relationships; they've spent their lives glued to a computer chair watching their peers go out and enjoy themselves and they're fucking bitter about it.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. It's part of the Pavlovian conditioning... Give a little then take it away.</p>
<p>They can't let us get too used to relative normalcy, it'll be yanked away sooner than most expect - a new group to blame being the reason.</p>

        <p>I saw that video Saturday of some Brits chasing the police out of a park.  It gave me some hope.</p>

        <p>Oh, definitely. I just hope people don't get complacent and let their guards down. This shit is far from over.</p>

        <p>American here and your third paragraph is spot on.  All the things we predicted, that people got mad at us for predicting, are now happening... and the people who got mad at us for predicting these things, are likely also the ones supporting them, also as predicted.</p>
<p>It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.</p>
