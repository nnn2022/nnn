    <strong>Covid is ruining my life. I am trying so hard to remain optimistic and not let it affect me but quite honestly I’m exhausted</strong>
    <p><p>I live in California so as you all know my life has been hell and continues to be hell even tho plenty of places are staring to go back to normal. </p>
<p>I haven’t been to a bar or restaurant in a year. I refuse to go out and try and socialize while wearing masks. I know that’s my choice and I could if I wanted to just put on a mask and go out but it just feels strange. </p>
<p>This is my really situation, I want to leave California but I’m not entirely sure I can do that without taking a huge leap of faith into the unknown. Here are the reasons: I have a good job working for a very big corporation. They are currently paying for grad school. So far they invested around $10 on my education. The rule is I have to stay with the company for 1 year after I graduate or else I have to pay back the money. So quitting would mean owing $10k which I don’t have. Sure I could probably find a job with a sign on bonus that should equal out to that amount and that would be great but here’s the second problem. Being placed under quarantine for over a year really put a toll on my finances. A combination of having to get everything delivered and paying for the crazy fees, to developing a mild case of anxiety which I mitigated by online shopping. I added around an extra 30k to my credit card debt putting me in a situation where my credit card fees were more expensive than my rent. After talking to an attorney he suggested bankruptcy, which I ended up pursuing. So while now I’m debt free which feels amazing, I am afraid to leave my current apartment of fear that I won’t be able to rent anywhere else. Let alone in another state. </p>
<p>2020 was rough, i know my problems aren’t as bad as other people’s situation. But this stuff is subjective my worst is completely different than someone else’s worst. </p>
<p>Anyway, I’m just venting because I feel stuck and trapped literally and metaphorically. I try so hard to keep being positive and focus on myself and my mental health. I look at things fad objectively as possible and try to see everyone’s point of view. But guys this is getting very tough with the science coming out on vaccines and masks all pointing to this being a hoax. </p>
<p>Is this a test of mental strength, to see if I can remain calm and focused while the world fights over nothing. I just don’t know anymore. </p>
<p>Thank you all for listening. Wish everyone a happy and healthy life, don’t forget at the end of the day we all have to love eachother for things to go back to the real Normal.</p></p>

        <p>It’s just not in me to give up. Currently to win this fight we have to stay sane. Mental health is the most important factor at the moment. Once they take your sanity you give up control. </p>
<p>I guess the one positive is that through all of this I have learned how to remain calm under high levels of stress. I’m at the point where I can pretty much remain calm under most circumstances. It’s the anger and rage that I’m having a harder time with. How can I love and understand the people who are destroying what it means to be human. </p>
<p>I have always been a very social person. I used travel often and meet the most wonderful people from all over the world. I love human connection. I have been cut off from that for over a year now. I’m can feel my spark slowly fading and making me numb. If I can feel it I know others have to as well. That is what makes me angry. Theres nothing better than making eye contact with another person and for a split second knowing we are connected. That’s gone from my life now. I can’t remember the last time I socialized or had a conversation that wasn’t related to Covid or politics or my job.</p>

        <p>Just gonna throw out there that you can buy a mobile home/trailer for less than ten grand. Some of them are way cheaper. It doesn't have to be permanent, but it's a cheap roof over your head til you build back your credit. You could even just rent one in a park. Low income neighborhoods aren't fussy about credit. I grew up living in them and it's not as scary and crime ridden as people imagine. My friend bought a run down home with a fenced in yard for under 30 grand. It was a pos and in a questionable neighborhood, but he converted the inside into a beautiful, tiny apt while he worked on everything else. 
Best of luck to you. When you can't take anymore, go ahead and move yourself to a more free state. The relief you feel will override any anxiety you have.</p>

        <p>There comes a time where you have to weigh the risks and make a decision: do you stay and risk withering away into a shell of a human, or do you skim your bank account, sell some stuff, pack your bags and move to Florida?</p>

        <p>Start taking up new hobbies and learn strategies to de-stress such as exercising and health eating. I myself enjoy gardening quite a bit and just spent the last weekend outside in the sun planting a few flower beds. No mainstream news outside constantly telling me to be scared out of my mind. It felt normal.</p>
