    <strong>Because We’ve Been Made Simultaneously Narcissistic And To Hate Ourselves...</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>We think of ourselves as biohazardous germ sausages</li>
<li>We believe we are contaminated with white guilt and privilege, and are oppressing others</li>
<li>We follow rules blindly to avoid punishments for crimes we haven’t considered, let alone committed</li>
<li>We believe we are responsible for the destruction of the planet and the exploitation of its resources</li>
<li>We virtue-signal to prove our human decency, in the hope of paternal forgiveness</li>
<li>We actively participate in activities and regulations that are harmful and self-destructive to our psyches and bodies</li>
<li>We project our guilt and self-loathing onto others, accusing them of our own (thought) crimes</li>
<li>We believe our mistreatment at the hands of our leaders is deserved, even “tough love”</li>
<li>We cede our autonomy and look to governments and authority figures to guide us, show us the way, but</li>
<li>We never suspect our elites of being the truly corrupt ones</li>
</ol>
<p>How completely our elites understand, dismantle and exploit our fragile, manipulable psychology! This is the primary purpose of think tanks. The deliberate psychological undermining of its citizens towards an agreed agendum.</p>
<p>Don’t be neurotic and depressed - get angry. Externalise that anger and direct it at he true source of our ills.</p></p>

        <p>I respectfully disagree, not that there isn't validity to your post but from a perspective that there is no "we" anymore, which is the source of the problem. </p>
<p>For TPTB to successfully execute their agenda's, it was imperative that they divide us into singular entities and diminish that "collective" so they break us down and rebuild us in accordance to their template, which a integral element is apathy. </p>
<p>Personally, I don't think many people feel any sense of guilt these days. perhaps at one time, but they have sanitized this emotion. As an example, I have known people of all economic statures who have donated to various causes, and although some did this out of the goodness of their hearts, most did it to elevate themselves so they can merely claim their unrequited generosity. </p>
<p>The whole world has turned into nothing more than a #metoo and # mefirst campaign full of self pity and therefore people are completely incapable of identifying and therefore addressing injustices that occur to other people. Even those that seeming do, the great majority is motivated by some egocentric agenda. </p>
<p>Bottom line is people don't give a shit about each other becasue we have been conditioned to think only of ourselves as the sole means to achieve some form of  personal identity. </p>
<p>The corporation itself, not as an entity but more of an idea, has been a  powerful tool for them.. A faceless society without any accountability for it's actions. How symbolic or representative to that principle the mask wearing of today is. </p>
<p>The real truth is if we are too ever conquer our imminent self destruction we need  a collective, this "I" crap is what's killing  us.</p>
<p>As always, just some food for thought!</p>

        <p>As always, excellent (counter)points. Selfishness and division are certainly rampantly prevalent these days, but it still seems easy to corral us into fearful groupings when necessary.</p>
<p>When I refer to the “we” I think I’m talking about the majority of (since I can only talk from my own experience and circle of knowledge, generally white) people for whom propaganda works and is in fact designed. Do we accept that propaganda works on the majority of people? Based on no available data, I certainly do. If it does, then fear, guilt (and, yes, good ole trauma) are the lynchpins.</p>
<p>The majority who have been led to believe they are directly responsible for climate catastrophe, racism, white privilege, COVID spreads, the breakdown of the family etc. Anything demoralising and destabilising (ala Bezmenov) can be triggered if the subject is sufficiently weakened and pathologised.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, I certainly align with the idea that propaganda is alive and thriving, and as always, proving to be quite a success for them. Therefore, i completely agree with what you have asserted, however, I believe their greatest accomplishment was by getting the individual to focus those emotions exclusively towards themselves, with the exception of guilt, which i adamantly  believe they managed to virtually eradicate  from our playbook. I think guilt has been replaced by the perception of others towards us, so we actually don't feel guilty, but our responses, that may be interpreted as guilt, is really just a response that we are told is the correct one.</p>
<p>I mean really, they have made us feel guilty for feeling guilty, neutralizing that emotion altogether leading to a self serving and hostile mindset.</p>
<p>I could very well be wrong here, but i see people acting out a script as opposed to actually experiencing the emotion(s) itself. </p>
<p>Even with fear and trauma, i see the trend whereby people experienced these emotions by merely hearing or seeing these events at a safe distance, but are now completely indifferent unless it impacts them in some direct capacity. To me this is also a result of stripping us of our empathy.</p>
<p>I'm not sure people feel any responsibility or accountability for anything, again just reacting in the manner dictated by the script they have handed out. </p>
<p>I think this is where we differ slightly, and i believe  we both agree in principle, however, i believe they have been bombarding us for so long now, that people actually feel very little inherently, and need to be told what and how to feel. Granted, fear will always be a potent weapon, just becasue the script of fearing our own mortality never seems to grow old. </p>
<p>And yes we have been weakened and beaten down to the point where we are now in perfect form to be totally subjugated but it's becasue we feel very little other than hate, anger, disdain or condemnation for anyone else. </p>
<p>This applies to all of the dark sides that reside in us, they are cultivating and nurturing it, feeding our self serving self indulgent side while squeezing out the goodness that we also possess. Not to be religious but it's like the story of Adam and Eve and the temptation compelling Eve to surrender to her urges.</p>
