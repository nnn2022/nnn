    <strong>You Have Absolutely No Right To Complain (Yes, You, Too, Fellow NNN Contributor)</strong>
    <p><p>It doesn't matter what kind of mental gymnastics you use to justify wearing your muzzle while it's still practically optional in 90% of places. </p>
<p>I have heard them all. <em>Oh, but where I live... What state are you in? In my state... But I will starve... They won't let me buy food... I'll get fired... They will call the cops... I don't want to make a scene...</em> </p>
<p>I have NEVER, NOT ONCE worn the muzzle and I have not starved, gotten fired, made a scene, or had cops called on me. </p>
<p>The only thing I have done is to not shop at fucking Costco anymore. </p>
<p>90% of stores will not even say anything if you're not wearing the muzzle. Once in a blue moon an employee may ask if I need a mask, and I politely say: No, thank you. And that's the end of it. </p>
<p>Those who will ask to put on a muzzle and want to play the mask police do not deserve my money. I don't argue with them. I just boycott them. So far that's only Costco. They have lost my business. It's that simple. </p>
<p>If you are wearing the muzzle, FOR ANY FUCKING EXCUSE, you are complicit in the destruction of our lives. </p>
<p>Because of you spineless cowards who aren't even willing to test the <em>terrifying</em> idea of walking into a store muzzle-less, they will soon write it into law, and soon it'll become a crime punishable by jail to not wear the muzzle. </p>
<p>You have no right to b.itch and whine about lockdowns, curfews, and any other violations of our rights when you are voluntarily wearing that muzzle and think you'll get shot if you walk into a store without it. </p>
<p>You will have no right to be upset when they haul your children off to jail because one of their 3 muzzles slipped below their nose... </p>
<p>Go ahead and come up with any number of excuses you want as if I haven't heard them all, or... if you have the slightest amount of dignity, try it ONE GOD DAMN TIME and go to the grocery store without your muzzle and see for yourself what I'm talking about before it's too late...</p></p>

        <p>Guilty. I always wear a mask to walk in and it finds a way of slipping off my face but it’s still a symbol of compliance. Feels like its not worth the headache but it really is worth it to be the change you want to see.</p>

        <p>I agree. Yes, a person only wearing a muzzle because they feel like they "have to" despite them realizing this is BS is a bit better than a person who agrees with it since they're still at least mentally on our side, but still, there's no excuse. You ALWAYS have a choice. I understand not wanting confrontation, and in a sane world, there would be none. But still, you've got to fight and not give up.</p>

        <p>I wear a rolled up bandanna while in certain areas at work, lest I be snitched out and fired. I’ve already been talked to twice about it, no need to tempt fate. It was like suddenly when Fauci said masks were good then everyone went ballistic and suddenly we were issued single use painters masks. So, I came up with a better idea and started using a bandanna. No one says anything despite this being “the most deadly pandemic EVER”. </p>
<p>But, anywhere outside that? Fuck no! You want me to where a mask inside? Guess you ain’t getting my money!</p>

        <p>I could have a better job right now but the place I work doesn't make me wear a mask. Sure I could make more, but I would probably deal with much more bullshit. When the masks stop becoming a thing, I'll start looking. If this somehow ends up going on forever, oh well.</p>

        <p>Dude you can't go about trying to know other people's situation.</p>
<p>It's a great fantasy. I try really hard to not wear it when I can. But not all of us have the ability every time we go somewhere. The inconvenience of losing a specific retailer over it and having to drive twice as far if not farther due to a physical barre from the premises just isn't worth it.</p>

        <p>I actually agree entirely, I was just trying to illustrate how much of a tall order it is. Even ignoring the difficulties with having places to shop, two different people walking maskless into a store will face different levels of opposition. I am far more likely to be physically threatened by others than the average individual and while I'm glad OP can just suffer the effects of not being able to go to Costco, going maskless 100% just to not be "complicit" for me will inevitably mean I'll have to get my ass kicked or worse. I hate this attitude that even being among the small percentage of people who have been outspoken about all this since the beginning that I'm complicit for not putting my head on the chopping block. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>Yes your point does apply to America and most European countries. When talking about the authoritarian despotic hellholes it’s arrest if you’re lucky. I live in America as well and am avoiding the submission rag at all costs, it’s too much for me at this point and my line has been drawn in the sand. I do not want it to be made into law because of sheeple sheepishly shuffling along doing what they’re told.</p>

I've ditched the fucker at most places, some are the kind of place that they'd lose their mind on me and they're the only game in town for those products. It's safe to play the game if your intentions aren't to see the end anyways. But I'm fully aware of the implications and I'll bitch if I want.</p>

        <p>I don’t want the working man to have to spend any extra energy on me, so i wear a mask. World ended on nov 6th 2020 anyway. Its over. But i admire your stance at the same time.</p>

        <p>You’re not doing it out of a place of righteousness for the “working man” who would be choosing to spend their time badgering you when they probably don’t want to be wearing one either. You’re doing it out of social conformity which is a strong force I admit but don’t lie to yourself</p>

        <p>When u need money so bad that I have to work for a big Corp, middle managers take advantage of something like this to upset/fire workers they dont like. At the very least, the working man has to do more work for the same pay, again. And they themselves have to wear a mask all day. The fact is that your target, walmart, and cvs own the world and they are certainly pushing masks as hard as they can. Im a non-conformist. I’m guessing u never had to work for a big corp. You are conforming by acting as if a world without democracy is any world at all.</p>
