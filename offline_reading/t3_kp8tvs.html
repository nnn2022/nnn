    <strong>People with masks are behaving like assholes due to the anonymity it provides them</strong>
    <p><p>Just like on the internet, these people feel protected by the anonymity the mask provides. I saw a post asking about a link of a TV or radio program that did the same with the audience and they behaved like sadist.</p>
<p>What do you all think? Should we ask them to tell us the same without the mask to see if they are so brave when they remove them?</p></p>

        <p>I think it’s helped people get away with a lot more criminal activity, don’t have any data to back that claim but it seems common sense to me. Much harder to recognize someone, can justify more violent behavior. Certainly riots/violence on the street, but I’d imagine robbing stores would be super easy now because it’s expected to be unidentifiable nowadays</p>

        <p>I was thinking more about the mask Karens that we see so often in this sub. Could their behavior have something to do with they fact that their faces are not visible and they perceive it as having less personal repercussions, like is the case with internet nicknames?</p>

        <p>I think with anything just having less (potential) consequences will change how we rationalize our ultimate actions/behavior</p>
<p>Not sure how you’re tying it into Reddit exactly, maybe if they have posts of themselves with masks on only, I’ve never posted my face and assume most users haven’t. </p>
<p>Or their real life behavior influencing online behavior? Pretty sure I lost your point lol</p>

        <p>You realize that doctor's and nurses have been wearing masks for years, even doubled up with no problems. You realize there's videos of doctors wearing masks for hours and then using a meter to test how much co2 is in their body. You realize how false and stupid you sound right. Keep denying science.</p>

        <p>Masks do not significantly reduce viral spread, as multiple population studies have shown, including one of the largest from Denmark.</p>
<p>Cloth masks may even be worse than nothing due to bacterial growth on the warm, wet fabric and the moisture trapping airborne particulates.</p>

The different nature of the masks and shields makes the direction of these jets difficult to be predicted, but the directionality of these jets should be a main design consideration for these covers. They all showed an intense backward jet for heavy breathing and coughing conditions. It is important to be aware of this jet, to avoid a false sense of security that may arise when standing to the side of, or behind, a person wearing a surgical, or handmade mask, or shield</a></p>

        <p>&rt;I saw that video when he first made it. The idiocy of that video is that when people talk about co2 poisoning it is accumulative. You will not detect it in one sitting as he is trying to demonstrate. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Here is some evidence mask don't work and in fact could be harmful.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>Fauci said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> .</p>
<p>Also from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>

<p>Here is something you might find interesting:</p>
<p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*.

<p>This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>“First, in the section titled ‘Whole Genome Sequencing,’ we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>
