    <strong>The REAL Science</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of people asking for scientific evidence that supports our positions on lockdowns, masks, and "social distancing".  I am going to share some of the most compelling evidence I've seen since this bullshit began.  If a mod wants to sticky this so we can have a centralized place to share evidence, that would also be good.</p>
<h1>LOCKDOWNS</h1>
<p><strong>Great Barrington Declaration</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">https://gbdeclaration.org/</a></p>
<p>Note: The Great Barrington Declaration is probably the best starting point, especially for doomers who want something authoritative sounding.  The Great Barrington Declaration is a stated opposition to lockdowns that was written by three of the top medical scientists in the world: Jay Battacharya of Stanford, Martin Kulldorf of Harvard, and Sunetra Gupta of Oxford.  It has also includes dozens of verified signatories who possess advanced degrees in biological/medical sciences.</p>

<h1>MASKS</h1>
<p><strong>Interview with Michael Osterholm</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CglBhn0znM&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CglBhn0znM&amp;t</a></p>
<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>
<p><strong>Danish mask study</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</a></p>
<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</a></p>
<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>

<h1>COVID NOT THAT DANGEROUS</h1>
<p><strong>Article about 1,300 inmates getting infected (virtually none of them died)</strong></p>

<p><strong>21% of New York sample positive for antibodies</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html</a></p>
<p><strong>20% of Chicago sample positive for antibodies</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-antibody-testing-chicago-rate-northwestern-20201009-jxzpyewzlrcgnny2fyflupqdcq-story.html">https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-antibody-testing-chicago-rate-northwestern-20201009-jxzpyewzlrcgnny2fyflupqdcq-story.html</a></p>
<p>Note: These antibody positivity rates allow us to make reasonable inferences about the total number of people who've been infected in the entire US.  20% of the total population is about 66 million people.  318,000 deaths out of 66 million infections is about a 0.5% fatality rate.  And that is probably the upper bound on the fatality rate.</p>
<p><strong>50% of Tokyo sample positive for antibodies</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1</a></p>
<p>Note: This might be the single best study for our side.  It disproves basically every single narrative put forward by the doomer cult.  First, Japan had no lockdowns.  Yet they have one of the lowest COVID mortality rates in the entire world.  Doomers always responded by saying that Japan's results were due to Japanese adherence to masks and social distancing.  This study blows that theory out of the water.  50% of the study's sample got infected within a few months of the study start.  So either the Japanese don't wear masks/social distance as much as doomers say OR masks/social distancing are useless.  And guess what?  Not a single person who got infected died or was hospitalized.  That's a 0% hospitalization and death rate, in case you were wondering.  I cannot overstate how important this study is in terms of destroying the entire doomer narrative.</p>

<p>Note: Another extremely important article.  Basically shows that the majority of COVID deaths were essentially natural causes.</p>

        <p>They do when information and statistics change over time. Like say a piece from April stating that 80% of infections are asymptomatic. That's no longer true. It's anywhere between 50-70. You just don't want to use information that the cult followers can easily refute as not true.</p>

        <p>And not all of those info are sure things. The tokyo has not been verified by peers which means it's not trustworthy enough an the chicago 20% article was made by a man who studied gymnastics and done mostly politic article so he probably didn't have enough scientific knowledge to understand a full scientific article. Also lockdown work just watch the stat of France (where I live) from March to june a full lockdown was in place and the result is a big reduction of covid infection but from November to mid-December a half lockdown (anyone could still work and go to school) the number of infection was globally higher and the infection wave has not passed. And yes: mask are not comfortable but reduce infection rate due to the fact that if you have covid but no big symptoms have appeared you will infect less due to air and particule in your breath will be mostly stopped by the mask, lockdown is bad because of depression induced by solitude and the damage to the economy but it's one reason to wan't this virus out as soon as possible so we can go back to normal.</p>

        <p>Data doesn't become "outdated".  It's just data.  It is what it is.  The inferences and conclusions drawn from data are what may become outdated.  But having gone through all this information myself, I can say with total confidence that none of the major inferences and conclusions drawn from this data are outdated.  Obviously, the doomers will claim it's outdated.  And they will post a flurry of crap articles/studies purporting to demonstrate their claim.  But when you actually scrutinize their sources, you quickly find that their citations do not correspond to their claims.  Because they are hoping that you will just read the title of the article/study and give up.  And most people do.  Fortunately, my educational background is in math/science, so I do not feel intimidated by their citations.  I go right in, read them, and refute them.  Doomers do not like it when I do this.</p>

        <p>The thing about doomers claims and points of view is its re-enforced with media repetition. There may be no clear evidence or studies to back up what they are saying but when the mainstream media says the same things undisputed, there's no arguing with that. And that's where the fight is being lost for us. The fact that people wouldn't dare think they are being manipulated by the media. And of course, we are conspiracy theorist nutjobs for even suggesting it. It's just ammo for more virtue signalling.</p>

They are literally about exactly what information you are looking for, it's not off hand comments hidden in 6 page papers about a different topic.

        <p>Have you considered the fact that just because it's extremely profitable to some in the short term, doesn't make it a conspiracy? Powerful people and governments always use opportunities to their advantage. That being said, there is no consolidation of control at all, let alone a drastic one, let alone into "smaller and smaller groups", whatever that even means. Maybe get out of your conspiracy bubble and you can see how absurdly ridiculous you look making such asinine, baseless claims.</p>

        <p>I don't even live in an English speaking country, let alone watch any mainstream western media. And yes, you are crazy to believe the nonsense that you believe. You are also crazy to not believe the reality of what is happening in literally every country in the world. The size of the conspiracy that would have to be true for what you believe to be accurate is preposterous.</p>

        <p>Seriously dude, what are you talking about with this conspiracy nonsense? What global government? You honestly think there's a conspiracy between literally every single government in the entire world to make Covid something it isn't? To destroy their economies? To make it less likely for them to stay in power if they don't deal with it responsibly? Do you <em>ever</em> think about anything you say at all, or just parrot conspiracy talking points that fit your political narrative? Embarrassing, man. Seriously embarrassing. You have a brain, please try to use it.</p>

        <p>https://apnews.com/article/us-coronavirus-deaths-top-3-million-e2bc856b6ec45563b84ee2e87ae8d5e7</p>
<p>&rt; This is the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths expected to top 3 million for the first time — due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; Final mortality data for this year will not be available for months. But preliminary numbers suggest that the United States is on track to see more than 3.2 million deaths this year, or at least 400,000 more than in 2019.</p>
<p>&rt; U.S. deaths increase most years, so some annual rise in fatalities is expected. But the 2020 numbers amount to a jump of about 15%, and could go higher once all the deaths from this month are counted.</p>
<p>&rt; That would mark the largest single-year percentage leap since 1918, when tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died in World War I and hundreds of thousands of Americans died in a flu pandemic. Deaths rose 46% that year, compared with 1917.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm</p>
<p>&rt; As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States; however, this might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality.</p>
<p>&rt; Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25–44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons.</p>

        <p>Certainly you've heard of mask mouth - it's not just straight gasses you're exhaling.  And, yes, it does trap exhaled air.  That's why you can't mask an infant.  They die in 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Breathing in your own air is making you so much more intelligent, keep it up.  In fact, why don't you wear two masks - double the virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>No you can’t mask an infant because they might choke not because of the ‘trapped air’. That’s like saying I need to open the windows in my house because I’m scared of suffocating. They’re not air tight (unless you’re dumb enough to make a mask out of plastic or something).</p>

<p>LOLOLOL What the fuck are you talking about?? That's not at all true. Are you kidding me? I was sitting across from a baby that couldn't have been more than a year old on the subway today for at least 20 mins, and he had no problem wearing a mask. Surgeons have been wearing masks for decades with zero issues. Are you seriously so stupid that you think wearing a mask is virtue signaling? How are you honestly this idiotic? It's amazing. Simply amazing. Yours was one of the dumbest comments I have ever responded to.</p>

        <p>Medical Science has declared that for the good of the nation, you must place a large ball in your mouth to stop you from talking, as this is how the disease of stupidity spreads.  Oh, and wear these special mittens to stop you from typing.  It's for your own safety because the government cares about you.</p>
<p>Oh, and you should also strap a mask to your butt, since you seem to be doing an awful lot of talking out of it.</p>
<p>Surgeons don't wear masks to protect themselves from disease. It's to stop spit, snot, and hairs from dropping in open wounds.  They're also in specially pressured rooms with extra oxygen pumped in.  They also change their masks frequently and follow protocols you are not following. </p>
<p>What that parent did to the child is abuse.  And look it up, a newborn will die in 10 minutes if you mask them up.  The smaller the child, the greater they are effected.</p>

        <p>I'll have to look through my bookmarks.   It might have been a doctor that was interviewed on the Highwire.  (I'm still celebrating Christmas Eve right now.) It was death in 10 minutes for newborns and death on 20 minutes or less if under the age of one.  They were also explaining about all the things your body has to do to compensate for wearing the mask, like elevating your adrenaline levels, and how bad it was for children. </p>
<p>Even the CDC, through all their propaganda b.s., still repeats several times that infants and todlers age two and under could suffocate from masks.</p>
<p>I doubt reddit allows links to Highwire - but if you surf to their site, you should be able to find it.</p>

<p>You being human, are toxic. Therefore, new rule, we need to to stop breathing entirely,  ok?  The masks just aren't effective enough at stopping the spread.  In fact, they arisolize the particles even more, increasing COVID-19's reach.  So, no more breathing, ok?  </p>

        <p>Yeah, it's great in the cold weather. Keeps my face warm. Not for the virus, obviously, that would be pretty unnecessary outside moving at 20km/hr. Of course, you're too stupid to even consider that there could possibly be another reason. Hrm... think about that, and apply the lesson to other parts of your life. Maybe something will click.</p>

        <p>The government says you need an emergency medical procedure as your head is just way too far up your own butt.  (They want your head to be just a little bit up your butt, but not so far you can't listen to their instructions. ) Though, suppose if you're going to wear a mask at all times, people would never see your face, anyway, so what's the difference. I bet you're so ugly,  you're doing us a favor.  Carry on.</p>

        <p>Why do you think anyone gives a shit what the government says about it? Get your head out of your ass dude, fuck the government who has failed miserably to deal with this pandemic, I care what experts think, which is very clear that masks work and should be worn in every situation where you're around other people, specifically indoors, plus social distancing, and a complete lockdown for at least a month so stop the spread. Idiots like you are only prolonging the pandemic like fucking morons. Being a fucking ignorant dick who doesn't even understand a god damned thing about anything isn't helping, you fucking ignorant child.</p>

        <p>Oh, yes, the "experts".  But only the ones you approve of.  I see.  You need this, don't you?  Without the ability to virtue signal, people may notce you're not actually virtuous. Don't worry, we can see right through you,  so no need to bother.  You should strap that mask tighter to your face.  Maybe put on some googles, too.</p>

        <p>It is. Look at the Danish mask study, for example. The claim in this post is that it found wearing a mask doesn’t make any difference, but that isn’t what the study found. The study only found that recommending wearing a mask didn’t make a significant difference, although it did make a slight difference. Those are very different conclusions. It didn’t study people who always wore a mask versus people who never wore a mask, it measured people who were told they should wear a mask and people who weren’t told they should wear a mask.</p>

        <p>No. It's still not misinformation its factual sources that can be backed up. There are a huge number of links. You take from them what you want. We should all be open to looking at the bigger picture and not kicking off with someone for not wearing a mask if they chose not too. This virus has a huge survival rate and we are still allowing the government to mandate stuff that has little positive impact on health but a massive detrimental impact on both mental health and peoples livelihoods.</p>
<p>The amount of people under 55 who have died from this thing is MINISCULE.</p>
<p>the impact of all these policies is MASSIVE.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’m aware of what your sad one word answer means, but as I pointed out that doesn’t make any sense, because you haven’t actually read the study I was talking about.</p>

        <p>But you clearly haven’t, or you would have to agree that the study was mischaracterized in the comment that accompanied the link in the post, and it does not at all say that wearing a mask isn’t effective. But all you have said is “I know you are, but what am I?” Like a child.</p>

        <p>For fuck sake man.</p>
<p>I have read all the links in depth. You have not. There are a massive amount of points in each. The one you keep going back to is the Danish study.</p>
<p>Here. Seeing as though you cant read</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.</p>
<p>This, along with all the other points, in every link in the OP are the opposite of the tripe you are spouting.</p>
<p>I'm done now. Please take time to read the points you are arguing about.</p>
<p>All of the links are really good, in depth and may make you think for yourself if you approach
them with an open mind.</p>
<p>Like I say, honestly have a good christmas. If you reply, I will read it, but I wont reply. Take it easy</p>

        <p>As I’ve been saying, since you clearly can’t comprehend what you are reading; <em>recommendation to wear masks</em>. Not actually <em>wearing</em> a mask. This study <em>only</em> looked at the <em>recommendation</em> to voluntarily wear a mask. My point stands, about the article and this entire post.</p>

        <p>You realize the deaths didn't  cause the hardship, right Simple Jack? It was the worthless draconian measures inappropriately instituted by panicked politicians. Every measure from masks to lockdowns failed at every level in every single country.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? “The deaths didn’t cause the hardships”.... do you think about things before you type them? You don’t junk 300,000+ Americans dying didn’t cause any hardships? You don’t think hundreds of thousands more deaths wouldn’t cause hardships? Let alone the hardships caused by symptoms in people who didn’t die. How are you so incredibly narrow minded? </p>
<p>And the claim that every measure failed in every country is a blatant lie. That’s objectively not true. Masks didn’t work in countries that didn’t enforce masks because people didn’t wear masks. Masks worked great in countries that mandated masks and make people wear masks. That’s objectively true. Just because your shitty government didn’t do anything useful doesn’t mean there isn’t useful things that can be done, and have been done by other countries. Do you just refuse to do actual research at all, and just mindlessly parrot propaganda without even a brief moment of consideration?</p>

        <p>This is hilariously pathetic. You're literally calling yourself stupid, while showing that you're stupid, in a thread that is based completely on stupidity. This is the most meta thread I have ever been part of. I wonder how many dozens of times you will misuse the word "ditto" before you realize you're a complete idiot?</p>

        <p>I am not an anti masker you guys suck this evidence is false! You guys anger me to no end. Covid is deadly for young and old people, with weaker immune systems. COVID is dangerous for them, and by distancing we are protecting them. I know you guys think you are heros for going against the 1 THING we asked you to do, but you are not.

        <p>There's literally nothing to rebut, you're just saying irrelevant garbage. I never called you alt-right. You used the entirely fictional "alt-left" as if it means anything (which it doesn't). You attempt as "logic" is also a hilariously obvious logical fallacy, since nowhere did I imply in any way that you are only what you call yourself. Keep trying though, I imagine you at least need the spelling practice.</p>

        <p>Mofo, you’re calling people losers yet you proceed to say that, “Your[e] just dumb alt-left libtard[s]” ????? I’m not gonna take a stance, but that’s why nobody takes you kids in this sub seriously. My god, it’s so cringe how you people are literally confidently stupid. You can have the research of Einstein but could still come off as stupid. But it’s ok, there’s a little arrow pointing down, you can tap that and whine.</p>

        <p>Can you say something other than libtard? Your brain is literally the consistency of porridge and it’s so funny because imagine how a random like me reading this feels. It’s actually pity because you act like you’re in the right but you couldn’t be bothered to speak proper English. Sheit, I would be a libtard any day if it meant not being whatever the hell you are. And the fact that you’re literally an adult is what scares me. My god, I don’t even lose hope seeing a tiktok teen getting poisoned from drinking bottles of NyQuil and instead lose hope seeing threads like this with people like you.

<p>I drive and I get a flu shot. The driving is much higher mortality than the flu, but the driving has to be done in society. The flu shot is also to prevent transmission in the community which might be beyond your comprehension.</p>

        <p>Yes, breathe deep of your own waste.  It's so much healthier. In fact, why even exhale at all?  If you could just stop breathing, that'd be great, ok?</p>

        <p>Did you read this? It clearly says that <em>fewer</em> people are dying compared to expected average deaths from a variety of non-Covid causes, and generally. So how is the lockdown, which has never been a real lockdown let’s face it, more deadly than the virus which has killed thousands of Canadians? Smh Like every article this post has at the top, your claim is pure misinformation.</p>

        <p>I’m literally trying to figure out a way to find uncensored searching for years. It’s only gotten worse and worse. Is Reddit our only hope? Do we need the dark web TOR Browser. It drives me crazy that information is openly being censored. What about the ppl who don’t know the truth about vaccines and are looking for answers from both sides to make their own decision? It’s Impossible now</p>

        <p>First, none of these articles actually say what OP is claiming they say. He has completely mischaracterized every study he posted actually says. This entire post is dangerous misinformation. Second, you didn’t just link a CDC page and have it taken down. What’s the truth? What else did you post with it? I’ll bet some nice misinformation that mischaracterizes what the CDC link is actually talking about.</p>

<p>" <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7428442/">One study</a> found coronavirus RNA, or genetic material, in sewage samples taken on Dec. 18, 2019, in the cities of Milan and Turin. Another found that a patient in Paris who was treated in an intensive care unit in December 2019 had COVID-19, <a href="https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-france-patient-zero-december.html">Live Science previously reported</a>. Another analysis <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42669767/Satellite_Images_Baidu_COVID19_manuscript_DASH.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y">from Harvard University</a> looked at satellite images and found that traffic at hospitals in Wuhan and online searches for COVID-19 symptoms were elevated compared with normal starting in the late summer and early fall of 2019. That suggested that the coronavirus may have been attacking us long before we knew its name.</p>
<p>To further clarify the early movements of the virus, a group of researchers analyzed blood samples from people in Italy who were enrolled in a prospective lung cancer screening trial between September 2019 and March 2020. They looked for <a href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html">antibodies</a> specific to the receptor binding domain (RBD) — the dock on the coronavirus' spike protein that it uses to latch onto and invade human cells. </p>
<p>They found that 111 of these 959 people, all asymptomatic at the time their blood was drawn, had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood at the time it was taken, meaning that about 11.6% of the entire group had been infected with the virus before March. Specifically, the researchers found coronavirus antibodies in 23 patients who gave samples in September and in 27 who gave samples in October. They also found that 53.2% of these cases were participants from Lombardy.</p>
<p>"Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 circulated in Italy earlier than the first official COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in Lombardy, even long before the first official reports from the Chinese authorities, casting new light on the onset and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic," the authors wrote in the study.   </p>
<p>These studies bury the official narrative of it originating from a bat in China in January.</p>

        <p>Can confirm I personally had COVID19 Symptoms in November 2019 as did my wife.  I was in the Hospital and she had what was the Nastiest Flu like bug she ever had.</p>
<p>It swept through the school she worked at too. </p>

        <p>oh damn. Canada? These studies were made in EU so, good to know it was global even then. </p>
<p>The official narrative is full of holes. Most people who had the "flu" last year agree symptomes were far more severe then normally. I am 100% sure this was Covid all along, just no one was testing for it back then since it wasnt even a concept in global psyche.... the idea that we can pinpoint the source like China did is movie stuff logic. </p>

        <p>Same here, I had it in October of 2019. Went to urgent care with a cough, fever, loss of taste and smell, and upset stomach that all came on overnight. They told me, and I quote, “yeah, we’ve been seeing this a lot lately. It’s not the flu or bronchitis, we don’t really know <em>what</em> it is.”
Sent me home with Z-Pak, and I ended up extremely sick for about two months.
It sucked, but I also have a history of getting severe bronchitis pretty much every single winter growing up for 8+ years, even going into pneumonia a couple times. So I’m definitely susceptible to respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>Incidentally I worked at a school when I contracted it as well.</p>

        <p>Crazy that doctors and medical professionals have been wearing masks for 100 years and still operating on people and not falling over dead.</p>
<p>We should demand that no masks can be worn during surgeries.  If you can't wear one to the grocery store without damage, how do they do 8 hour days with one?  It must be clouding their judgement on the operating table, right?</p>

        <p><strong>COVID DEATHS BEING INFLATED</strong></p>
<p>Here's <strong>Dr. Fauci</strong> himself saying that PCR tests are sometimes being ran for too many cycles, leading to false positives: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=260">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=260</a></p>
<p><strong>EVIDENCE THAT HERD IMMUNITY IS ALREADY HERE</strong></p>
<p>From the prestigious British Medical Journal: "When a population has people with pre-existing immunity, as the T cell studies may be indicating is the case, the herd immunity threshold based on an R0 of 2.5 can be reduced from 60% of a population getting infected right down to 10%, depending on the quantity and distribution of pre-existing immunity among people." <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563">https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563</a></p>
<p>"There is growing evidence that T-cell immunity allows populations to reach herd immunity once only 10-20% are infected with SARS-CoV-2. This would explain why a highly transmissible virus in densely populated areas peaked at 10-20% infected regardless of lockdowns or masks." <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1292873236716433416.html">https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1292873236716433416.html</a></p>

<p>I think that is the second greatest mental block for these people  (Outside of the fear,of course)  almost an entire year has been sank into unnecessary theatre and they won't stop it because that would mean admitting they tucked up on a major scale.</p>

        <p>But lots of people are dead.. in order for your position to be true, a lot of other fringe beliefs have to be true as well - the combination of all of those things being true is super unlikely..</p>
<p>Is Occam’s razor a conspiracy? Simpler is probably true. All these ideas like inflated covid deaths and politicized lockdowns seem to be aligning in your mind, the more things that are required to align for your position to be true the less likely truth is.</p>

        <p>Seriously, thankyou for this. I would love to sit down and compile information together but in way too busy at the moment. I did make a post a few weeks back about how it would be great to see some well informative sticky posts instead of just clicking on a discussion and seeing shills posting a lot of mis info intentionally to put people off joining. So to see this is awesome. Put only a great start.. could we not work together to compile more info and we could have a whole wall of sticky posts. </p>
<p>Arguments backed up with references, just like how I was banned from R/contra virus today for posting a link to the official CDC website. </p>
<p>... but on the other hand, maybe that would just speed up the inevitable deletion of the sub? I mean we all know how pizzagate and pedogate subs just got deleted after gaining significant followings, </p>
<p>All I know is it’s nice feeling that I’m not the only person in the world falling for this crystal clear grade A, wagyu horse snit.</p>

        <p>Not to co-opt this thread, but I wanted to throw out a bit of information and research regarding the various vaccines surrounding COVID. Not all the vaccines being developed are the same or use the same methods. I'm very pro-vaccine, but I'm not lining up to get the Pfizer vaccine as nothing is known about potential long-term effects (I recognize that there's a low probability of significant adverse events, but for young/healthy me, there's also little to no benefit of getting the vaccine as I'd have a very, very insignificant probability of death if I got COVID). I'd personally get the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine as it's a tried-and-true method, but I'm not considering getting any of the others.</p>
<p>Except for a Chinese company, all are using the spike protein for their vaccine. Thus, these all rely on the assumption that the spike protein won’t change or mutate significantly. We have no evidence for or against spike protein mutation, though reinfection rates are relatively low. Are those who have already been exposed going to be vaccinated given reinfection is low? If they are, why are we even vaccinating with this method since there’s obviously a reasonable risk of mutation or evidence that the body can’t mount a sustained immune response? </p>
<p>See comments for research.</p>

        <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong>—adenovirus vector for spike protein, this adenovirus infects chimpanzees and cannot replicate in humans, it only injects the cellular material into cells and it doesn’t code for machinery to rebuild itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEVER BEEN APPROVED BEFORE. NO CURRENTLY APPROVED ADENOVIRUS RECOMBINANT VACCINES IN HUMANS.</strong></li>
<li>The vaccine for adenovirus (a “live” vaccine) is not currently approved for the general public, so why are we using a vector for which the vector itself is not approved for vaccination?</li>
<li>The adenovirus vaccine is a “live” vaccine, meaning it is a functional adenovirus.</li>
<li>If we can’t use a functional adenovirus to vaccinate against adenovirus, why are we using it to vaccinate for other things?</li>
<li>Unlike retroviruses, adenoviruses don’t integrate into the host cell genome. The goal behind this type of vaccine is that the adenovirus will have the DNA for the spike protein. When the adenovirus infects the cell, as it would normally, the DNA is changed into mRNA which is made into protein. The (spike) protein then becomes antigenic without having exposure to the virulent strains of adenovirus or coronavirus.</li>
<li>Adenovirus commonly infects mucosal cells and is a leading cause of viral pharyngitis and conjunctivitis (pink eye). It can rarely cause necrotizing pneumonia. There is no treatment, aside from symptomatic.</li>
<li>Infection by the adenovirus is necessary for this vaccine to work. Some individuals may already have immunity to the strain of adenovirus being used as a vector.</li>
<li>The adenovirus has a vaccine that is not available for the general public. It is given to military recruits as they may be at higher risk for infection.</li>
<li>The safety and effectiveness of this vaccine have not been studied in the general population or in people with weakened immune systems, and it is not approved for use outside of the military. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adenovirus/about/prevention-treatment.html/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Currently, adenovirus vectors are being tested as subunit vaccine systems for numerous infectious agents ranging from malaria to HIV-1. <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&amp;tableId=tbl2&amp;pii=S1525-0016%2804%2901342-5">Source</a>. Additionally, they are being explored as vaccines against a multitude of tumor-associated antigens. <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(04)01342-5">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Symptoms caused by chimpanzee-derived adenoviruses that are currently being explored for vaccine development remain ill-defined. <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(04)01342-5">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Chimpanzee-derived viruses could potentially be contaminated with yet to be identified pathogens that could propagate unnoticed in parallel with the adenoviral vectors in tissue culture. Considering that animal viruses, especially those from species closely related to humans, such as chimpanzees, have the potential to cross into humans as is well documented for simian immunodeficiency virus, the use of chimpanzee-origin adenoviral vectors generated by exclusive propagation in mammalian cell lines would present an unacceptable risk for humans. <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(04)01342-5">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Generation of vaccine vectors from molecular clones on the other hand eliminates the peril of hidden contaminants from the original isolates.</li>
<li>Intranasal application of adenoviral vectors carries the potential risk of inadvertent transfer of vector into the nervous system. Reports have shown that upon intranasal application of adenovirus into mice the virus can infect the central nervous system. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12941918/">Source</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Johnson&amp;Johnson/Janssen Pharma</strong>—adenovirus vector for spike protein, assumption that the spike protein won’t change or mutate significantly, infects human cells and can replicate, used a similar setup for the Ebola Vaccine (approved in July 2020 in EUROPE)</p>
<ul>
<li>See above.</li>
<li>The only other vaccine that currently exists that uses this replicating adenovirus is the Ebola vaccine from the same manufacturer.</li>
<li>Europe approves everything—ask the thalidomide babies. The first phase of testing was in January 2015. This was granted accelerated assessment in September 2019 and then approved in July 2020. They were allowed to market this prior to approval because they were able to demonstrate that it is not possible to conduct a randomized controlled study that might generate comprehensive clinical data on the efficacy of the new Ebola vaccine even after authorization. <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-vaccine-prevention-ebola-virus-disease-recommended-approval-european-union">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Efficacy for humans is not yet known as the efficacy has been extrapolated from animal studies. <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-vaccine-prevention-ebola-virus-disease-recommended-approval-european-union">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Ebola is a far more serious virus across the board. More serious viruses have a much steeper cost-benefit ratio which makes such methods more favorable. Any chance of it working is worth the long-term risks, because realistically, these patients won’t live to have long-term risks otherwise.</li>

<p><strong>Sputnik</strong>—adenovirus vaccine for spike protein, Russian company</p>
<ul>
<li>See above for adenovirus info.</li>
<li>Questionable coming from a Russian company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sinovac/Sinopharm</strong>—inactivated virus, Chinese company</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried and true method. HepA, Influenza shot, Polio shot, and Rabies are all inactivated virus vaccines.</li>
<li>Possibility of reactivation to a virulent strain if the person is exposed to a virulent strain during the immunization period.</li>
<li>Questionable coming from a Chinese company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Novavox and Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline</strong> —protein subunit vaccine with spike protein and adjuvant booster</p>
<ul>
<li>The safest of all of the vaccines. HepB, HPV, and FluBlok vaccines all use this.</li>
<li>Just a protein introduced into the body with an adjuvant that enables the immune system to better recognize that it’s foreign.</li>
</ul>
<p>(3/3)</p>
<p>This is unsubstantiated, but my own personal theory on why several companies are using mRNA and adenoviral-vector vaccines rather than the more tried and true (inactivated virus, attenuated virus, capsular protein/subunit) is that they are using COVID and the emergency authorization to get their foot in the door with approving this type of vaccine. Then as they develop other vaccines using this MO, they will use the prior COVID vaccine authorization as justification for why those vaccines should be released without as much scrutiny as if it had been the first of its kind.</p>

        <p><strong>Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna</strong>—mRNA for spike protein encased in lipids, Clinical trial data is limited – more long-term studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of RNA vaccines. Safety: a better understanding of vaccine adverse effects is needed</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEVER BEEN APPROVED BEFORE. NO CURRENTLY APPROVED mRNA VACCINES IN HUMANS.</strong> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-its-a-big-deal-if-the-first-covid-vaccine-is-genetic/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>mRNA modifications not only affect translation but can also act as markers to provide landing platforms for proteins or stimulate other regulatory processes like mRNA degradation or localization. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014007/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>The complete role of mRNA is not well understood, so we really don’t know if using these types of vectors systemically will result in long-term adverse effects.</li>
<li>mRNA is a non-infectious, non-integrating platform, there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Highly efficient mRNA transfection reagents based on cationic lipids or polymers, such as TransIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio LLC) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), but they often show limited in vivo efficacy or a high level of toxicity (N.P. and D.W., unpublished observations). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">Source</a>.</li>
<li>The mechanisms of mRNA escape into the cytoplasm are incompletely understood, not only for artificial liposomes but also for naturally occurring exosomes. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943717/">Source</a>. Again, we don’t fully understand mRNA mechanisms. Because we have such a limited understanding of mRNA mechanisms, should we be utilizing this approach for systemic vaccination?</li>
<li>Over 50 clinical trials are listed on clinicaltrials.gov for RNA vaccines in a number of cancers, including blood cancers, melanoma, glioblastoma (brain cancer), and prostate cancer. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Clinical trials have been carried out or are ongoing on mRNA vaccines for influenza, cytomegalovirus, HIV-1, rabies, and Zika virus. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Rabies mRNA vaccine completed a Phase I trial that showed intradermal vaccination created immunity for one year. 78% reported systemic adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. This was shown to be ineffective when injected intramuscularly (no sustained titers). The trial took place over 3 years. No long term complications reported (were they tracked or followed?) <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31665-3/fulltext">Source</a>.</li>
<li>An early study reported that immunization with 10 μg of naked self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding RSV fusion (F), influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA), or louping ill virus pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) proteins resulted in antibody responses and partial protection from lethal viral challenges in mice. Immune responses induced after vaccination with nonreplicative mRNAs have been weaker than responses after plasmid immunization. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11294672/">Source</a>.<ul>
<li>Lethality was decreased, but symptomatic infection was not considered.</li>
<li>Long term effects and safety was not discussed, as this was done in mice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Completed HIV trial using mRNA primed dendritic cells (not a pure mRNA vaccine) in HIV infected adults showed no efficacy in prevention. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836975/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>They took dendritic cells (a type of immune cell that presents antigens or virulent markers/proteins to the immune cells that can kill) from the patients and exposed them to HIV mRNA. They then replaced those dendritic cells back into the patients. The idea is that the primed dendritic cells will do a better job of presenting and activating the aggressive immune cells. The aggressive immune cells can then better target infected cells, decreasing viral load, and disease burden.</li>
<li>There are several issues with comparing this type of research to the Coronavirus vaccine. For one, this is immunotherapy, not prevention. Additionally, this uses isolated dendritic cells from the patient, a method which will not be employed by the Rona vaccine. Lastly, HIV is a far more serious virus across the board. More serious viruses have a much steeper cost-benefit ratio which makes such methods more favorable. Any chance of it working is worth the long-term risks, because realistically, these patients won’t live to have long-term risks otherwise.</li>
<li>See also: Completed HIV trial using mRNA primed dendritic cells (NOT A PURE mRNA VACCINE) in HIV infected adults showed a transient elevation in HIV-1 antigen response and no long-lasting efficacy in controlling HIV. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752409/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>See also: Completed HIV trial using mRNA primed dendritic cells as immunotherapy in already infected adults (only 10) showed no efficacy in improving CD4 or CD8 T cell counts. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521661609008341?casa_token=o_Bk4JBMpsUAAAAA:pY39YwNEPiO3fttqpSUviRdRbm6BJfMUo08gW27sZONz9XCDP7HjQYN30V_eZQHSVZxhsWoN6A">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Another study in humans evaluated a CMV pp65 mRNA-loaded dendritic cell vaccination in healthy human volunteers and allogeneic stem cell recipients and reported induction or expansion of CMV-specific cellular immune responses. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25050468/">Source</a>.</li>
<li>Dendritic cell vaccine. See above.</li>
<li>Four CMV-naive healthy volunteers and three patients who underwent allo-HSCT were included in the current study. Trial size was 7 people.</li>
<li>Volunteers remained negative for CMV, but it’s unclear if they were ever exposed during follow up.</li>

        <p>MASKS: Michael's argument about masks have been an issue that people have talked about for a while, a properly fitting mask is hard to find as well as harder to make. As such it has been pushed aside in favor of more effective options like vaccines and social distancing. His metaphor for wearing a leaking mask is inherently flawed, you won't be getting only one person sick when not wearing (or not properly wearing) a mask. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208744v1.full.pdf">Study about how the CDC's</a><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208744v1.full.pdf"> mask size is wrong for most of the population</a></p>
<p>I'd suggest thinking of it as a large group of people using the crosswalk, and you're driving a semi vs a pickup. One is going to injure and probably kill more than the other. And that's not even mentioning the disproportion of the metaphor itself. </p>
<p>INFLATED DEATHS: this has been also a topic talked about a lot by scientists and politicians, awhile ago I remember a country was yelling at the rest of the world because people were only counting "pure deaths" while they were counting all covid related deaths arguing that when the numbers go down people will develop a false sense of security and more people will die. Also because one person does something doesn't mean the rest of the world does too, that's a <em>hasty generalization</em> fallacy. <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/08/russia-is-boasting-about-low-coronavirus-deaths-the-numbers-are-deceiving-a70220">Link to Moscow apparently only counting "pure covid deaths"</a> </p>
<p>COVID NOT THAT DANGEROUS: Your first link shows the amount you understand what you are researching rather than just picking things that confirm your cognitive bias... A big part of covid death is prior conditions, this is why the older you get covid becomes more dangerous. This is why asthmatics and smokers have died at an increased rate compared to those who don't (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm#:~:text=Among%20178%20">link to CDC report about this topic</a>). And no people haven't been dying at the same rate compared to prior years (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-chart-us-death-figures-2020/fact-check-chart-does-not-present-accurate-us-deaths-figure-for-2020-idUSKBN2872MV">A Reuters</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-chart-us-death-figures-2020/fact-check-chart-does-not-present-accurate-us-deaths-figure-for-2020-idUSKBN2872MV"> article fact-checking</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-chart-us-death-figures-2020/fact-check-chart-does-not-present-accurate-us-deaths-figure-for-2020-idUSKBN2872MV"> an</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-chart-us-death-figures-2020/fact-check-chart-does-not-present-accurate-us-deaths-figure-for-2020-idUSKBN2872MV"> old Facebook</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-chart-us-death-figures-2020/fact-check-chart-does-not-present-accurate-us-deaths-figure-for-2020-idUSKBN2872MV"> meme</a>), I assume we will be able to see the official numbers by the end of 2021. Conclusion: if you are healthy enough to survive prison you'll probably be fine. | the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b">cite for the article</a> literally states that it has been challenged</p>
<p>&rt;"However, the modelling by Oxford’s Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group has been challenged by other scientists. They have pointed out that the study presents possible scenarios — based on assumptions about the nature of the virus, its virulence and its arrival from China — that contradict those supported by most epidemiologists."</p>
<p>This also doesn't include the fact that the UK has decent healthcare, along with a healthier, on average, population (when compared to the US). As the CDC said that things like obesity and heart disease increase your chance of fatality by a lot. </p>
<p>VACCINES: William doesn't know how vaccines work apparently, I wouldn't listen to his mad rambles just because he can write on Forbes. Anyway, the way he describes the covid vaccine is true, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits/facts.html">the current vaccines only prevent symptoms.</a> While that isn't preferable, the high effectivity meant that lawmakers decided it was better than nothing. Its safe to assume that there are vaccines in the research stage that are made to reduce transmission rather than just symptoms. But the reduction of symptoms should have a noticeable effect on death, and if not the permanent damage that it causes. His information is old so I'll provide more <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-publication-results-landmark">up to date stats</a>. As this is 3 months later I won't fault Will, but you on the other hand... not so lucky. </p>
<p>I guess you might not have needed to make resource papers in middle school or high school so I'll give you a<a href="https://libguides.library.cityu.edu.hk/research/pick-the-best-sources"> rundown on good source picking</a>. Accuracy is pretty self-explanatory, don't listen to an article that has more spelling errors than a 5th grader's, on meth, homework. Authority: don't let a politician tell you how to run your hospital and the other way around. Objectivity: don't pick from sources that obviously make money from it, also "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it." Upton Sinclair. Currency: make sure the articles aren't old or using information that would be outdated. Coverage: does it cover the topic enough to suit your needs? </p>
<p>LOCKDOWNS: I don't understand lockdowns nor macro or microeconomics to be able to provide an opinion. Nor can I do good enough research to treat it justly. I admit for lockdowns I accept whatever the scientific authorities have decided is correct. But on the surface, it makes sense that if fewer people are around each other, fewer people will get sick. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And if I get downvoted to hell, you guys at least gotta give me the kudos for the time I spent. More than op apparently, this took me at least an hour or so to write and proofread. I don't regret it, but I could've been more efficient with my research (I ran across a lot of dead ends, along with habitually trying to find "gotchya" moments.).</p>

<p>Real information about mask wearing, not mischaracterized studies that don't even look at mask wearing.</p>
<p>NEJM even had a second article that specifically was written to counter the fact that people like OP are using the May article posted in this to suggest NEJM is against mask wearing. "We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.... We did state in the article that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments." https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2020836</p>
<p>"Epidemiologic investigations conducted around the world — especially in Asian countries that became accustomed to population-wide masking during the 2003 SARS pandemic — have suggested that there is a strong relationship between public masking and pandemic control. Recent data from Boston demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infections decreased among health care workers after universal masking was implemented in municipal hospitals in late March." https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913</p>

        <p>Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: </p>
<ul>
<li>Symptomatic at a rate of 18%</li>
<li>Asymptomatic at a rate of 0.7%</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Estimated mean household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) was significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001), although there were few studies in the latter group. These findings are consistent with other household studies (28,70) reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission.</p>

        <p>The authors of the New England Journal of Medicine’s mask study wrote a letter to the editor saying that the quote you used under that link should not be used as a push to not wear masks. The link for the letter is at the top of the article if anyone wants to read it.</p>
<p>&rt; We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong> It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not.4
We did state in the article that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments.</p>

        <p>All this information is fine and dandy but, what about all of the modern health professionals that are speaking to the contrary? Do y'all realize we have better methods and technology now than we did then? Just wear a mask ladies, it's not that difficult.</p>

        <p>It used to be that all the village idiots were separated. They were contained within their communities, diluted and harmless. The internet though, allows all the village idiots to gather and talk things out. Look here, all the village idiots r/NoNewNormal , all in one place. Spreading disinformation, biased news sources, and general bullshit. They spit in the face of science and logic. They care only about themselves and ignore anything that doesnt align with their position. So downvote me to oblivion, oh village idiots.</p>

        <p>I am not an anti masker you guys suck this evidence is false! You guys anger me to no end. Covid is deadly for young and old people, with weaker immune systems. COVID is dangerous for them, and by distancing we are protecting them. I know you guys think you are heros for going against the 1 THING we asked you to do, but you are not. You are the problem, you are responsible for the deaths of thousands, and you guys aren’t respected by anybody with an IQ above room temperature. Good day.</p>

        <p>The antibody reports you list disingenuously ignore the short term antibody reduction we experience.   I had COVID (positive PCR , positive IgM / IgG [healthcare worker])   in late march early april.    every week I receive a pcr,  and every month I have my antibodies run again.    Funny thing,   IgM as expected were a minimum at about 3-4 weeks post.   The IgG however reached a minimum threshold (undetectable) at about 4 months.   Given the titers at \~3months I was no longer immune.</p>
<p>I don't expect this sub to post counter evidence,  and oh how I'd love for covid to not be the problem it is.  But I guess you haven't seen what it does to people.   I so wish we could drag people like you through the ICU ward and ERs where we are over inundated with covid patients and perhaps you'd think different.  Unfortunately, we have laws against risking the lives of people just because they refuse to recognize the risk they are posing to their friends, family, loved ones, and society in general.    </p>
<p>Why aren't any of these sources linking to things counter to your cognitively dissonant beliefs?  *shrug*</p>

        <p>Kinda hard to stay in the basement when I have to pick up all the people who are having trouble breathing. So is the life of the EMT.  But what do I know, bruh.  I realize none of you are intelligent enough to recognize this is you're fault.  Minds are much to weak to handle the realization you are responsible for the contuation of this which has killed more Americans than WWII.   You're pathetic.  But worry not.  If you call, we, us front line workers, will be there and not judging and trying to make sure you survive as best we can, even if due to your own stupidity.</p>

        <p>.   I don't want the applause. I don't want the recognition.  This isn't about what I do. This is about the people who make the job I do more important.  If you want us healthcare workers to stop having something to brag about, maybe you should work on minimizing the transmission of this virus.  </p>
<p>Cos that's the only reason we're worth the praise we receive right now.  Ironically. It is people like you than ensure we get this laudation.  I don't need to suck myself off, mate, plenty of people in line to do it for me. People appreciate me and my work, but I'd be happy if we went back out if that limelight and being the least recognized  medical field by the public.  But as long as this pandemic is ravaging our country, we'll be right here, called a hero, for just doing my job.   Thanks, I guess.  Now stop.</p>

        <p>Every one of these is being misrepresented. Michael Osterholm does not say “masks are useless”, he says we should be wearing <em>higher quality</em> N95 masks. The Danish mask study does not show that wearing a mask does not protect the wearer, it shows that <em>recommending</em> wearing a mask is not effective. I can go on and on for every single article and video you posted. This is nothing but disgusting anti-science misinformation. Shame on you for politicizing a fucking pandemic. You’re a gross human being and I hope you catch Covid and suffer immensely for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>Your mask study is worthless. I don’t think anyone is suggesting that cotton masks will be very effective in stopping incoming virus (aka active filtering like you’d see in a properly sealing n95 or p100). The argument is that masks help restrict outgoing water droplets that may pass the virus to other people. </p>
<p>From your research link on masks:</p>
<p>&rt; Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.</p>
<p>I’m happy to admit the negative impacts of lockdowns. People need to socialize and we don’t really see proof that spread is happening in stores. However, we should not be posting anti masks shit the same way people post anti vaxx shit. </p>
<p>Do you have any other thoughts or are you comfortable admitting your linked articles on masks are bullshit?</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, breathe deep of your own waste.  So much healthier.  Hey, why even exhale at all?  If you could just stop breathing, that'd be great, ok?  That's the true ultimate sign of virtue.</p>

It represents fringe scientific opinion, and its signatories are largely fabricated: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-herd-immunity-great-barrington-declaration-scientists-signatures-fake-names-b912778.html">"Dr. Fakename" and "Dr Johnny Fartpants"</a>. The declaration represents the <em>ideology</em> of three scientists with extreme political beliefs; it's not science.</p>
<p>A document closer to representing scientific consensus would be the <a href="https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/">John Snow Memorandum</a>, which was published by a medical journal instead of libertarian think tank, and which actually verifies its signatories.</p>
<p>The rest of the link spam is <em>cherry picking,</em> finding bits of "evidence" here and there to support a certain ideology (anti-mask, anti-vaccine, freedumb conspiracy theorists) , instead of looking at what the evidence at as a whole suggests regarding COVID-19.</p>
<p>Case in point: the scientific article that the OP describes as "the single best study for our side" <strong>isn't even peer reviewed</strong>. Nobody here cares about scientific evidence; all of you are grasping at straws to support your ideology.</p>

        <p>I pointed out that your NoNewNormal "starting point" is by a libertarian think tank, and that your "best study for our side" isn't peer reviewed. </p>

        <p>The masks are (to my understanding) intended to limit transmission, not to protect the wearer. Your studies seem to confirm that the wearer is not protected by a mask. Why are you omitting and or cherry picking to avoid the dozens of studies showing that masks reduce transmission?</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll get flamed or deleted for citing the CDC here, but this seems like a pretty good collection of studies that disagree with yours on this topic.</p>
<p>You list what you claim to be "the highest quality study on masks" but in the statement of limitations on that study they state: "Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others."</p>
<p>EDIT: Are people not reading the takeaway of the study?
&rt;   "The findings, however, <strong>should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2</strong> infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the study period, authorities did not recommend face mask use outside hospital settings and mask use was rare in community settings (22). This means that study participants' exposure was overwhelmingly to persons not wearing masks."</p>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>~~What makes you believe this study is the highest quality study?~~</p>
<p>~~Can someone explain what I'm missing? Thanks~~</p>
<p>EDIT: Others have pointed out this is an RCT study.</p>

        <p>I would say the higher evidence of masks not working is the data of countries (who had already wide spread of the virus, im not speaking about countries with few transmission to begin with) where masks were made mandatory. I can't find any example where introducing masks actually lowered the transmission, in most cases actually happened the opposite and cases raised after it, or had no effect at all.</p>
<p>This website has links to some articles as well as some graphs about countries cases vs when masks were made mandatory: https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>

        <p>It's the highest quality study from 2020 because it's the only RCT study taken on masks and SARS-CoV-2. RCT studies are the best quality because they're taken in real life, rather than a laboratory or an observational study. Hope that cleared it up!</p>

        <p>I have also heard that masks reduce the amount of droplets that leave one’s mouth and nose.  Not that it’s 100% effective, but that it <em>helps</em> in reducing transmission.  </p>
<p>That being said, I believe the lockdowns are doing more harm than good.</p>
