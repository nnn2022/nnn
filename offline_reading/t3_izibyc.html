        <p>I remember reading about some temple in Mexico somewhere, where they found evidence of desecration and murdered priests coinciding with a prolonged drought. The priests were supposed to be guaranteeing rain, so nothing saved them when nature told them to get fucked and the public's trust evaporated.</p>

<p>And that's what's so goddamned dangerous. People wrongly equate science with the academic elite when they are NOT the same thing, at all. It's just this perverted authoritarian interpretation of science that's fucking everything up.</p>
<p>Like, it's easy for most people to learn enough math to be able to derive most of the laws of nature we know about ourselves, especially acting collectively through the internet. We really ought to instead of relying solely on them. </p>
<p>Most people don't even know that academics aren't the only ones who publish scientific papers. Literally <em>anyone</em> can get a paper published if they can get it past peer review, and it's that way on purpose, because science belongs to everyone, not just ivory tower dipshits who rule the land from the CDC main headquarters. The world record for youngest people to publish a paper is actually a third-grade class who did a study on honeybees one semester. Their paper includes their own graphs which they drew in fucking <em>~~crayon~~ colored pencil</em> for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Science isn't what people should lose faith in, it's pro-lockdown assholes ruining it for everybody.</p>

<p>Really, I think a lot of the opposite is going on - people are purposefully abusing what science is supposed to be to steelman the opinions of "experts" they happen to like. as in "Hurrr, you can't argue or try to prove The Settled Science wrong, now submit to my political agenda."</p>

        <p>Both happens, and it's important to remember that idiots really do lie and misrepresent the nature of science to discredit it just as much as people exploit the authority of science to get their way. People are skeevy, evil motherfuckers at heart.</p>
<p>And like it or not, authoritarians aren't always wrong about the science behind their ideas, it's the ethics they completely fail to comprehend. Like, even if everything they claimed about the coronavirus was true, it *still* wouldn't justify lockdowns or mask orders because their solutions to the very real problems they claim science found are completely unethical.</p>

        <p>Well, fuck that, we don't have to let them. We can take science back into our own hands where it belongs. We can check each other and stop dipshits from justifying believing whatever insane bullshit they want to (I'm looking at you flat-earthers) and use the scientific method on our own. We don't really need them.</p>

        <p>The scary thing is that the scientist/doctors aren't much different to the authoritarians. My obgyn has told me that there is severe long term damage connected to this virus. I'm no doctor, but I can't understand how they could possibly know that when this virus is so new? My breakdown in humanity has come from seeing the doctors, people who we're supposed to be able to trust, following along with the politicians.</p>

        <p>The loss of polite social discourse, where a person can point out the exact aspects of an issue they don't agree without someone setting their house on fire.</p>
<p>I do believe it started with the live audience sitcom 'burn' line in the seventies, and progressed from there. The idiot character would quip their catch phrase, the audience would go "woooooo' and cheer, and all conversation concerning what the quippy character didn't approve would stop. Everyone got shoved into little character boxes, with checks in the boxes that described their personality.</p>
<p>The entertainment industry has made cardboard cutouts of us all. I support some tried and true vacs, but not one whipped out by tiny little dictators on the fly, so I must be anti-vax, right?</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure the only reason they're around is the cheap booze. Every Applebee's has a depressing ass bar that does incredible drink specials, like $1 margaritas. Or endless appetizers with drinks. Or $1 martinis. Sure it's all garbage but it's still a "bar experience" on the incredible cheap.</p>
<p>If you actually go to Applebee's sober for the food, and like bring your family, you're insane. You might as well just buy frozen food from Walmart, it'll be cheaper and warmer.</p>

        <p>If they start imprisoning people for not getting a vaccine many people will go underground.</p>
<p>Hell in Ohio a woman was tased by a resource officer while a school figure stood by watching because she wasn't wearing mask/wouldn't leave. They start manhandling her so she resists. After some time he tased her.</p>
<p>For not wearing a mask, outdoors, six feet from the rest of the spectators....instead he wrestled her and tased her while his own mask fell off and he breathed his dangerous breath all over her face.</p>

        <p>I really really really hope this doesn't happen. It's my biggest fear currently. I would think maybe (hopefully) many big-wig types would protest this as well. </p>
<p>Would there be a potential for fake credentials? Or certain concerts/sports events, or at least restaurants and bars that would not comply and allow unvaccinated? Private airports? </p>
<p>This is a fucking nightmare. We need more people to be vocal against this crap so we can stop this shit before it gets anymore out of control. Currently the doomers seem to be the most vocal. I'm hoping that a silent majority is growing and we can very soon put a stop to this scamdemic "new normal" bullshit.</p>

        <p>No it’s fine I was involved with meth and drug use pretty heavy. Was pretty much homeless staying wherever making ends meet selling stolen tools and antiques. So I ended up doing 18 months for burglary charges for stealing an antique wood stove and various random items out of a storage unit. Not my finest hour in life but I don’t believe I’m a bad person... but yeah I was incarcerated back in March and the whole prison went in lockdown with limited movement and such it sucked because we did a lot more time in 23/1 which means locked up with your cellie 23 hours of the day 1 hour out to shower and use the phone. No fun but they eased up on that after 2 months.</p>

        <p>Well that sounds....yeah, no fun. Hope your cellie was tolerable enough. I'm glad you're out now, especially now. I have some bones to pick with the prison system, especially in regards to drug-related offenses, and that could be taken multiple ways. No, you aren't a bad person. My asshole neighbors are on meth, and I tend to speak disparagingly about them, but I know their drug use really has little to do with what assholes they are. You just got mixed up in some bad shit, and you have your reasons. No judgement there. Take care of yourself, whatever that means for you. Sounds like you're doing pretty alright so far. :) At least as alright as anyone nowadays.</p>
