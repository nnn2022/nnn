    <strong>Is Public Covid Response a Mass Delusion?</strong>
    <p><p>In the 1990s there was an epidemic of supposed satanic abuse scandals, principally in the English-speaking world. Most of these allegations were found to be completely without foundation: they were figments of the imagination of local people, social workers and police. Throughout history, there have been numerous examples of mass delusion, from the Orang Minyak panic of Malaysia in 2012 (an 'oily man' prowling in his underwear looking for virgins), to the outbreaks of mass dancing, such as the one in Aachen in 1374.</p>
<p>Reading the news, looking at Reddit and my Facebook feed, and hearing people talk in the media, it strikes me that we are in the midst of a similar delusion. It is simply <em>not possible</em> to look at the actual evidence and not understand that Covid has been massively over-hyped, and that our response to it is completely disproportionate.</p>
<p>It seems to have many of the hallmarks of mass delusion. Rather than petering out, it seems to be gathering energy. The fewer the numbers of people in hospital, the more vehement people are in denouncing those who do not play the game. Sceptics have become an out-group to be hated and feared in equal measure.</p>
<p>Wikipedia describes the satanic abuse scandals as 'moral panics'. Stanley Cohen describes the stages of moral panic as:</p>
<pre><code>1. Someone, something or a group are defined as a threat to social norms or community interests
2. The threat is then depicted in a simple and recognizable symbol/form by the media
3. The portrayal of this symbol rouses public concern
4. There is a response from authorities and policy makers
5. The moral panic over the issue results in social changes within the community
</code></pre>
<p>Does this sound familiar? I am not sure that this helps us much, but hopefully it helps those of us who feel alienated from people at the moment if we can see this for what it is: a sickness in society.</p></p>

        <p>Shoddy statistics cause mass panic that creates real statistics that is used to further shoddy statistics and cause mass panic.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that if we had done nothing, that life would have gone on without major change, even with this slightly more deadly flu than normal.</p>

        <p>The term is moral panic, as it comes along with a holier-than-thou defense from the public and a reason to fear/disenfranchise others who might be 'dangerous'.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just like the 'rainbow parties' that had every soccer mom horrified now we have 'covid parties' that will corrupt and kill little jimmy... except it was debunked, and that part wasnt in the news.</p>

        <p>A viral video that happened in 2012 that ended up will all sorts of people that had a little too much screen time suddenly up in arms over some supposed African Warlord. The quickest video to go viral ever or something. The "activists" who went viral with it seemed to be full and passionate about their limited and obscure knowledge of African affairs, much like the passionate maskers today.</p>

<p>I'm finding that there are two types of people in the world. People who generally question things, and people who just go along with what any authority tells them. (I'm not saying one is superior to the other, I think both have their own pros and cons in different situations)</p>

        <p>While I'm certain there's some agenda pushing, I don't think that's everything.  Nearly everyone I've spoken to in my life about this virus is pretty concerned about it.  I'd say at least 80%.  To believe that governors and people in the media are all aware of the reality of the situation and are only pushing an agenda is to believe that these people are all smarter than your average person, and that's something I definitely don't believe.</p>
<p>I think right <em>now</em> you see a lot of doubling-down by governors to cover their asses now that it's becoming apparent that we over-reacted, but I think fear had won most of these people over at the beginning.</p>

<p>I think you're in denial, man. These governors are master manipulators, and I say this as someone raised by master manipulators. Maybe I see it because I was abused and have grown to recognize the signs, but they are employing every classic tactic of psychological abuse and gaslighting in the book, in an attempt to maintain control and to also punish and torment people, and to get what they want. This is not accidental. A lot of these people may <em>seem</em> stupid (and in some ways, I'd say they are stupid), but they know what they are doing. They are gunning for something, and there is an endgame to this that we don't know the details of, so we can only speculate.</p>

        <p>To me, it's obvious that people are being conditioned to become obedient to "the experts" and to "follow science."  The masks are a form of operant conditioning, a way of constantly reminding people that they're in danger and that only obedience to the priestly class of unelected officials will make them safe.</p>
<p>As this obedience becomes the New Normal, other demands will follow.  Once the State gains a new power of peoples' lives, it's never relinquished.  Contact tracing will become mandatory, one day our phones will simply enable it and we won't be able to turn it off.  And with that apparatus in place, they'll use it to combat all sorts of other threats to public health.  Of course, by this point the term "public health" will have been radically re-defined.</p>

        <p>I agree with u/bobcatgoldthwait. I think a majority of the people are genuinely concerned and that includes governors. What's obvious is the media wants to spin this situation as negatively as they possibly can. Very few people control a majority of everything we see on TV and read on the mainstream Internet. In case you missed Russiagate, the wagons certainly got circled for that effort and now it's more of the same. I don't know what the motivation is. Is it clicks or is it unseating bad orange man or some combo of both or something to do with international business interests etc? I don't know and don't really care. Either way it's pretty vile stuff. Politicians react to the propaganda the same way everyday people do.</p>

        <p>The media has turned this into a moral panic and mass hysteria as we have seen many times throughout history.  The difference this time is that social media and the internet have amplified the panic to a level I don't think we have seen before.</p>
<p>The public has the ability to vocalize their hysteria online in a way we haven't really had before during past panic cycles.  The politicians and local officials have given in to the demands of this vocal minority in a way that would have been unimaginable even a year ago, causing who knows how much damage to our economy and way of life.</p>
<p>It is in the for-profit media's best interest to keep the fear going as long as possible.  It felt like the hysteria was subsiding for a while after the BLM protests but the media has ratcheted the fearmongering up tenfold again and it feels like we're starting the cycle over. </p>
<p>I don't see how this ends when every person can just pull up Reddit or Twitter and be bombarded with fearmongering and hysterics every day.</p>

<p>The one key difference is that there is enough civility left in society that the out-group (people that didn't GAF about witches and were thus witches, or people that didn't want to dance all day, respectively) are not at a physical threat of violence. Yet.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've had the perplexing experience of writing up a large post complete with citations from the most reputable sources I can find and explaining it, and then had people scream at me that I'm wrong.

        <p>Agree w/ this.</p>
<p>It's quite easy to find questionable things in the predictive model that influenced international policy decisions, differences in the WHO's guidance Vs how that guidance has devolved into social-media-friendly bite-size slogans, data on asymptomatic transmission,etc...</p>
<p>Yet any good news on the main 'rona sub or political subs is downvoted, and the MaskSkepticism sub especially gets flooded with "wow you're dumb" comments.</p>

        <p>The MaskSkepticism sub has been brigaded. At this point I think mods should just throw all the bad faith users out and make it private or something.</p>
<p>I don't even go into the main corona sub because it's pure agenda-driven trash.</p>
<p>I'm doing some research on social media propaganda right now and reading <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/pandemics-propaganda-how-chinese-state-media-creates-and-propagates-ccp-coronavirus-narratives/">this paper</a> about Chinese propaganda right now, which is pretty interesting. </p>
<p>Might do an effort post in here and LDS if I can find any meaningful information to share. But I would also say that's basically preaching to the choir and nobody who should see it probably will.</p>

        <p>Nada. Came back to my desk after food, to find a "You've been permanently banned" message. I messaged back asking why, but that's all I can do I guess.</p>
<p>First world problem though. As you've said, so much of all of this is preaching to the choir online. Not too troubled with not being internet-popular enough, because at the very least I've encouraged some IRL people to be <em>less</em> compliant (<em>as much as they were comfortable with</em>) and we're not dead. Friend of mine met his new GF after asking for advice on how to navigate meeting people under lockdown :)</p>

        <p>Nietzsche was right, and it's coming to a fever pitch. God may have been killed but people haven't meaningfully evolved past religious/magical thinking, they have just replaced religion with science and priests with scientists. You can see it in their language: they believe in science. You can see it in how they react to criticism or conflicting evidence: it's exactly like talking to a Christian about why the bible is false. Some of them come back with complex apologisms, and many others with pure insults (Westboro Baptist church)</p>

        <p>I absolutely believe the reaction is a mass delusion, it has all the hallmarks of it as OP describes. When you look at how irrational and emotion based the safety theater is, it's difficult to reach any other conclusion.</p>
<p>The real risk was to nursing home residents, but in the process of shutting down the world we left those homes porous and unaided. While we had vast field hospitals, a navy ship, NYC nursing homes were ignored, under supplied and understaffed. A nursing home near me actually had 'help wanted' signs posted out front of their building in April! While a few miles away Cuomo was doing his infamous daily briefings.</p>
<p>If we had done nothing but taken strict precautions in nursing homes, I guarantee we would have seen fewer deaths, particularly when you consider lockdown secondary effect deaths. But instead it turned into this crazed hysteria that very quickly became politicized, to boot.</p>
<p>I'm a mild conspiracy theorist but no one has been able to supply an adequate explanation for what's going on, even dipping into alternative/ conspiracy narratives. Yes big pharma will profit. Yes we are steadily heading toward a police state. Yes the rich are getting richer. But these are nothing new, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to me is this is a mass hysteria/ delusion event that due to being politicized has been fed and drawn out aggressively by the media and social media. I could not count the otherwise brilliant, stable people in my circle who have absolutely lost their marbles. I'm talking people with multiple STEM degrees and who up to this point were statistic based skeptics, but when it came to covid they lost their minds. If that's not hysteria and mass delusion, I don't know what is.</p>

<p>A person may seem "intelligent", especially because they have degrees, doctorates, whatever. But having a degree doesn't make you intelligent.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. I was trying to think if I had experienced anything similar to this in my life. Though obviously not as pervasive in its effects on daily life, I remember Y2K being all over the news and in everyone's conversations. I was rummaging through drawers in my office at work and found a product marketed as "Y2K Ready". I laughed. It makes me want to get out my camera and take photos of things like people driving around alone in their cars with masks and gloves on. This is history in the making.</p>

        <p>Yes, absolutely. It's mass hysteria on a worldwide scale. </p>
<p>I went to the grocery store today. Had a mask on because it's mandatory. I accidentally walked too close to a lady (and it was her own fault, she was waving people to go ahead of her but I guess that didn't include me - like I'm a mind reader?) and she just went off on me in front of everyone, yelling "6 feet! 6 feet! social distancing!". I said "it was an accident, but thanks for over-reacting" and she just flipped out at that, going on and on about how I didn't care about her health (which honestly I don't, haha). Anyway, I just kept thinking it was like she was possessed. I told my son that I felt sorry for her because she is living in this delusion of fear and it's incredible that she has no rational thought about this virus at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's what I saw when I looked in her eyes - utter delusion and hysteria.</p>

        <p>Yes.  Even if this virus can cause respiratory, myocardial, renal and circulatory complications, all viruses can do this not just COVID.  I haven’t proved it yet but my gut is telling me that this is all a government orchestrated hoax funded by George Soros just like Antifa.  Soros has been playing his end game trump card which appears to involve mass indoctrination and obedience to consolidate power.  I was digging around on Youtube and corroborated some of my findings.  Its all one big scheme.  None of it is real.</p>
