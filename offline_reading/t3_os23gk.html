<title>For the past couple weeks now I've been working with the NHS as part of their #GrabAJab campaign and going door to door to try and convince those suffering from vaccine hesitancy to get a jab!! Well, I never knew how DISRESPECTFUL and RUDE people could be...!!</title>

    <strong>For the past couple weeks now I've been working with the NHS as part of their #GrabAJab campaign and going door to door to try and convince those suffering from vaccine hesitancy to get a jab!! Well, I never knew how DISRESPECTFUL and RUDE people could be...!!</strong>
    <p><p>I've had so many doors slammed in my face that I'm beginning to get the feeling that people aren't just hesitant to get the jab but that they might not want it all...? I've been spit on, screamed at, shoved, and even had knives pulled on me when we tried to enter their homes! Every time I sense someone is particularly hesitant I jam my foot in the door to act as a wedge; it works and we're able to keep the conversation going but my foot is really starting to swell up and ache after having had so many doors crushed into it.</p>
<p>What's more, I twisted my ankle chasing down one person who was really hesitant. "Stop! We're only trying to help!" I yelled after him as my colleagues tackled him to the ground and rubbed his face in the asphalt. "Stop resisting!" I squealed as the needle skidded off his flailing shoulder blade and bounced off my colleague's face-shield. Finally he stopped squirming enough for me to adminster the JAB but it took me and my colleagues holding him down for around nine and a half minutes for him to calm down!!</p>
<p>Honestly, the way I've been treated these past couple weeks has really left me bereft of sympathy for these anti-vaxxers and my faith in humanity is at an all time low.</p></p>
