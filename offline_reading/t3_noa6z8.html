    <strong>How many of you originally planned to take the vaccine, but woke up to the dangers before you did?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just curious to see how many people have backed out of their plans of taking the vaccine. I personally don't take vaccines. I'm the type that just relies on my own immune system. And this vaccine wouldn't have been any different from that rule.</p>
<p>That was my initial thought process. Then I stumbled upon some posts that talked about the problems with this "vaccine" and from there, I fell down into this rabbit hole.</p></p>

        <p>I was never going to take it. Every aspect of covid has been lied about, and the brainwashing going on is insane. People are so scared and so indoctrinated that they're taking an experimental injection from corrupt and criminal pharmaceutical companies for a virus the vast majority of people aren't at risk of dying from.</p>

        <p>I was going to take it, because I’ve had all my immunizations growing up. I thought I would be “doing my part”. My girlfriend woke me up from all this. I’m glad that it lead me here, and I took a deep dive into the rabbit hole</p>

        <p>When they demanded people with antibodies get the vaccine and wanted vaccinated wearing masks was the red flag it wasn’t about the virus.</p>
<p>Then I learned the real numbers and that they suppressed treatment in order to get the roll out I was completely in the duck that category of people</p>

        <p>Even for the measles and Hepatitis vaccine/boosters, you could normally do an antibody test (as proposed in the old yellow WHO vaccine pass) to see if you still have them. If the test came back positive, your doctor would then write an entry into the pass and sign it and you were deemed as immunized against measles. I don't know at which point all prior medical knowledge of the last 30 years went overboard.</p>

        <p>I started the process trying to find out if the Covid vaccines were safe for a woman with severe autoimmune disease and history of anaphylaxis and to choose WHICH ONE. When I saw the censorship [see my post submissions and one of the first here] that got me asking questions. I worried about the experimental nature of things but once I found out how mRNA worked I was disgusted too.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t going to take it as I have friends who explained why its a bad idea and could potentially kill you—namely antibody dependent enhancement and pathological priming. It will still be a little while before people start dying off en masse from this (12-18 months)—whenever they decide to release another virus, perhaps the high death count will be credited to the virus itself when really it is due to the vaccine and only people with the vaccine are seriously affected. My prediction anyway...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_misinformation#Antibody-dependent_enhancementIt's">It's</a> called "Pathogenic priming", also known as Antibody Mediated Enhanced Disease which is another way of saying antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. You got it confused with "pathological lying". Easy mistake to make. </p>
<p>The classic example is that of the vaccine developed against the Respiratory Syncytial Virus in the 1960's. Children who got it, got sick after they got exposed to RSV. However, this was caught early on in trials in the 1960s, resulting in the vaccine being pulled. No cases of ADE have occurred with any of the Covid19 vaccines. </p>
<p>The articles usually cited when Pathogenic Priming is brought up in an argument against vaccines are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32292901/What">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32292901/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32292901/What">What</a> people don't understand is that what the articles are saying is that, if you decide to just use your own body's immune system, you're more likely to have Pathogenic Priming occurring if you catch it a second time. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210106/Are-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies-associated-with-disease-enhancement.aspxWhen">When</a> someone brings up the term cytokine storm, you need to realize that's why people should be afraid of the virus, not the vaccines.</p>

        <p>This is more where i was coming from, despite realizing so much of What has been going on around us is sketchy and over reaching...  and perhaps downright sinister!! thought my age group would have til end of summer at least then all of the sudden it was joe biden shock and awe and voila it was my turn.  I still had planned to wait and see....  that has turned into a huge hell no!  For 2 years at the very least...  likely never now.    i guess im grateful it was accelerated and sprung on us so fast - it had me on alert!</p>

        <p>The vaccines (and COVID itself) were developed by Pharma from roughly 2010-19.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Pharma is claiming that they developed the vaccines in literally two days (in the case of Moderna) or a few hours (in the case of Pfizer) in January 2020. I really don't understand why they're making those claims. I would think it would seem less suspicious if they claimed they started working on the vaccines in January 2020 and finished in July 2020.</p>

        <p>Yeah and super sketchy ceo. CEO Stéphane Bancel has been criticized for hampering progress at Moderna because of his ego, his need to assert control and his impatience with setbacks. He has allegedly sent abusive emails and reprimanded and fired employees on the spot after failed experiments. Bancel sought employee retention techniques from the human resources departments of Facebook, Google, and Netflix. Before joining Moderna, Bancel worked in sales and did not have much of a career in the scientific fields.[11] Despite never having worked with RNA before, Bancel "is listed as a co-inventor on more than 100 of Moderna's early patent applications, unusual for a CEO who is not a PhD scientist".[11] He has been described by a former colleague as having a "warrior personality".[52]</p>

        <p>It was never going to happen for me. I don't even take the flu shot. As soon as I heard about a new kind of vaccine-mRNA, I dived right into the research and learned that coronavirus vaccines cause ADE. I learned that mRNA is very close to CRISPR tech, and while scientists can get CRISPR to technically work, they also cause more problems.</p>

        <p>As soon as they were talking about a vaccine I knew I wasn’t going to take it because of grad school work drug development (not vaccines) and know how long and hard the clinical trial process is. I was never going to take something rushed especially when I could calculate my risk of dying from covid and my presumption that I’d already had it. (But my family got it anyway “to travel”)</p>

        <p>Personally I knew from the start that I would never let them put anything in my body (test swab or needle)... but I have a close friend who was on the fence about it, and felt pressure from our community and ended up caving in. She had a seizure right afterwards (never had one before in her life) and was rushed to the ER. She said while she was in the hospital she kept thinking of me and how she should have stayed strong through the pressure. Thank god she's alive.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why but I have noticed I had cold only twice as a child up until four years back. Then I got cold almost twice a year even when I work as a freelancer and have no social contact except living with family who brought the infection in their public dealings. Those four years, we had too much cold in my family. All members. Is the air pollution a cause or something being done to the air or people getting vaccinated ... makes no sense.

I know i recently did some air quality testing here and was shocked at how much mold spores and bacteria is in the air. But then again, the body responding to that means your immune system works and is actively trying to repel something I’d figure.</p>

        <p>I am certain air is being made poisonous, not just pollutants but microbes or whatever experiments are being done in labs. I have strange neurological symptoms in my body for which there is no explanation and they started in July 2017, just before rains (flu season), after a cold. I even had something in 2012 which was diagnosed as dengue but is freakingky similar to covid. All my issues since 2012 are so similar to covid long haulers’ that I am beginning to think this has been going on for some time. Only now this has “succeeded” to this level. I wish we could teach that truth.</p>

        <p>I've been having what seems to be an allergy to... pollen... dust... cats... who knows what... all year round. But then I've pet the cats and for weeks on end I didn’t have anything, I've had the same thing in the winter where there’s no pollen, and for dust ive went to places where it makes no sense for dust to affect me. So I figure it wasn't an allergy. But ive only had it since late 2020...</p>

        <p>That’s why. I haven’t really been out in streets much since 2020 except for less than 20 minutes at a time. But spend time on my porch (next to a park, so plenty of dust and pollen too), but no more cold. So technically I am still breathing outside air (polluted/pollen) but no people contact. I don’t think my country vaccinates for flu, but something is happening to people. I am not able to put a finger. But it has changed in the past five years. God, I used to travel on public transport everyday and never did I get a cold.</p>

        <p>Same here. I still feel like all this mask stuff is making people breathe in dirty air that gets stuck on the surface of it, and that we're losing the natural immunity to all kinds of things from it. Like we've always been a social creature. We never really avoided each other like this. Even in a war or anything. We were never kept away from each other like this. This is a new and dangerous way of doing things, and it makes no sense to the overall human psyche or health it seems. This is like killing a pigeon with a nuclear bomb. It doesn’t just affect the pigeon.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what immunity means anymore. Is not falling sick healthy or responding to cold is healthy! I have weird neuro symptoms and pain every day from whatever that attacked me and I was asymptomatic for covid with Ct 17. My father is a very active man with no issues and he got hospitalised!

        <p>It really is. I think within the next few years a LOT is going to come out. It won’t be through "disclosure" but through random yous and mees whistleblowing.
I’m sorry to hear about your experiences... So far we're doing sort of okay here but my brain and heart hurts when I go in public and see all the sheeple. It drives me nuts.</p>

        <p>Good to hear you are okay. Hope that stays as long as this fiasco lasts. But I worry this is just the beginning of sinister things. Random people getting random autoimmune issues. I am the most active person in my entire family despite my issues and nobody has suffered what I did in 2012 and ensuing years and I was the kind that never fell sick. So I am scared for what vaccines and covid or whatever that is (no longer believe viruses are a biological entity, despite my zoological background) can do to random people. And if they don’t stop here ... what next. I am counting on India’s population size and lack of digitisation (thank whatever for that) to positively become a deterrent to mandatory vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>True! Also did you notice that what the media showed in China and India at first is completely different than the rest of the world? Sometimes it feels to me like they used a true bio weapon there and a weaker version here with fearmongering peppered in between.</p>

        <p>Anything they can do! I have known people in my days who defended gene therapy like anything. I got out of science because of this unethical nature of research, but those people are now in research, in malaria and cancer and what not. I know how fine a line this is, and how most scientists don’t see it or happily cross it in the name of humanity (when it is mostly their own career that they are interested in!). The way vaccines have been mandated since they started is proof that they hide vicious evil intent behind the flawed “greater good” trope. Btw, some cities in India have started vaccine card systems for those workers who deal with groceries. Not for the elite, but for the poor marginalised masses! Brilliant way of institutionalising eugenics and experimentation on vulnerable populations. The mass migration of workers was not sympathezied with but rich people must fly! “Third world countries” and “consumers” in the west produce people and pollution while these big CEOs can afford yatchs and global conferences and airlines year round without even a molecule of greenhouse gases!</p>
<p>I hate this so much I don’t know how can people not see what this is! What all this has been since “globalisation”!</p>

        <p>Oh wow... I know. It’s super obvious to us, and I really don’t get how people can somehow fail to see it. You’d figure they'd take the easy obvious way to explain things, but instead they believe the fake narrative over and over. Sometimes I feel like a lot of people are beyond redemption.</p>

        <p>I was totally going to get it.. I’ve got all my other vaccines. I don’t usually get the flu vaccine though. Not sure what started it, but I think it may have been the immunity that the mfrs have, and the fact that none of these covid vaccines are really fully vetted that made me think twice. Now seeing how rabid people are acting and all the virtue signalling, along with all these newly minted billionaires pushing this shot/perpetual boosters, I can’t see myself getting it. I don’t think covid is a hoax, I know people can get really sick, but I’m not going to potentially harm myself for “the greater good” or “because it’s the right thing to do”</p>

        <p>I briefly considered taking it. I thought maybe if enough adults got it they would stop the push to vaccinate children. It became clear that wasn't going to happen. Also all the terrible side effects popping up and the extreme lengths they started going to to try to convince people to take it shaded me out.</p>

        <p>I always was skeptical of the government, especially the news media but I never considered myself a anti vaccine sort of person and still do but once I started to see some world leaders call for a "temporary" world government to manage this pandemic and afterward trying to push the "Great Reset" I immediately became suspicious. Event 201 sealed the suspicion for me. </p>
<p>Immediately after when they started to push this vaccine, I felt uncomfortable with how they just rushed it because it usually takes about 7-8 years to make a safe vaccine but this coronavirus vaccine was created in less than a year.. Now they are trying to manipulate people into taking the shot by offering them million dollar lottery tickets and certain privileges? I'm sorry but that's suspicious. </p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong but I predict that this vaccine will be required in order to participate in society.</p>

        <p>I was planning to wait a while and see potential effects, and likely eventually take it. 
I’ve since been awoken to the massive corruption at every level and will never get it, and am now questioning every other vaccine. I’m glad my gut instinct protected me.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t following Covid after my family was infected and recovered. But then I started hearing about variants and how they are so smart in choosing demography in phases. That was the red flag. So when vaccines started, I got my research done. Sadly my parents had got one dose (I tried reasoning but the variant story wasn’t going that strong then). Then media hyped it and my parents understood my point. So didn’t take the second dose.</p>

        <p>No, I was paying attention way before they had a "vaccine" ready. This whole thing was fake as hell and obviously so to anyone paying even a little attention. When Bill Gates was involved and talking about a mandatory vaccine complete with a chip, everyone should have hell noed right then.</p>

        <p>I've also never taken any vaccine, so I never would've taken it. BUT I will say that if I had planned on taking it, the countless posts about side effects would've stopped me.</p>

        <p>I was not the least bit interested in the vaccine. Then in January my normally healthy husband had a bad case of covid and double pneumonia. He was hospitalized for 10 days and was nearly put on a ventilator. After coming way closer to losing him than we were comfortable with, I felt we had to look into getting vaccinated - but I was only open to J&amp;J. Then it came out and got yanked almost immediately. Now we’re back to square one. </p>
<p>It’s so confusing. We’re hearing that antibodies are probably life long, but then I also hear credible stories of people who were told they had antibodies and within a couple of weeks had a second, worse case of covid. I figure the safest thing we can do for now is nothing.</p>

        <p>I was considering it, but they turned me off with aggressive campaigns to get people to take it—lotteries, free donuts, etc. I don't like to feel intimidated or coerced into doing anything. If anything, it made me not want to take it more.</p>

        <p>I work in IT for a company that owns and operates nursing homes in Texas &amp; Kansas, so we were some of the first to be offered the “vaccine”. It made us feel special, being able to get it so early. But, this also gave us less time to research it and so many coworkers &amp; our residents getting it led to more peer pressure that I fear it is a huge chunk and more are “vaxxed” than the national average. I luckily did and so refused and I believe we are at about 50% “vaxxed” but maybe more.</p>
<p>To make it worse, we were also given the ability to get friends and families vaxxed earlier, as well. I tried to convince people but just gave up and decided if they want it and are willing to risk their life, so be it. I helped get some people the “jab” early, blood is on my hands now.</p>

        <p>Early on when people asked me at work I said I'd take the vaccine.  As time went on I became less enthused to the point where I am today.  Now I wonder when I go to the doctor if he's going to be a dick about the vaccine.  For me it's been a 180 over maybe a week or two.</p>

        <p>The whole thing never made sense to me, that's why I was skeptical about the vaccines. I thought the Sweden approach to reach herd immunity made total sense, but the entire media was shitting on it 24/7 like it was lunacy, from there something didn't sit right on me, plus the credibility of the CDC/WHO went down the drain when they claimed the virus was not airborne.</p>

        <p>As the vaccines were being developed I was open to it. But by the winter, I had already realized that this covid thing was being used as a power grab and shit wasn't right. Final nail in the coffin was when vaccine passports started to look like a reality. That was when I knew I would never take it. </p>
<p>But to answer the question, I was never "planning to get it", I've just become more and more opposed to it.</p>
