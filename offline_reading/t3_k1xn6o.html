    <strong>What is COVID really?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you think it came from a lab, is just a normal oubtreak disease, or is a already existing disease that is being marketed as deadly using bad PCR tests?</p></p>

        <p>New slightly stronger strain of the common flu. I doubt it was designed in a lab (it is possible though), but individualds with great power instanly saw they can take big advantage out of it. Produce fear, introduce dystopian measures such as lockdowns and wearing masks (which have no significance in actually stopping any highly contagious mild respiratory virus and would have been laughed at just last year), bribe the media and well known doctors (Frauduci) and sit back and watch the circus unravel. Congratulations, you have succesfully destroyed your economic competion and got even more filthy rich. In the process you robbed people out of their childhood, education and social life, but who cares right?</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs nothing.. Covid is a HOAX</p>
<p>Covid test are bull shit and not even designed to find a virus. People get the common cold or the flu and think ‚Äúoh shit I have Covid‚Äù take a test and gives them a false positive, so they believe it‚Äôs real.  <br>
It‚Äôs nothing but BS to scare people and get away with these lockdowns and stupid restrictions.   </p>
<p>Trust me, if Covid was real I‚Äôd have it, hell I‚Äôd probably have it more than once by now. I live in Japan and an English teacher here. I go to 17 schools per week and around 1,000‚Äôs of kids each day all touching me, coughing and sneezing around me. Not one child has been sick since March. Heck, haven‚Äôt even seen kids with the flu since then.</p>

        <p>How to you explain the total loss of taste and smell? I had Covid for 3 weeks in September and lost all sense of smell/taste ... and now in November my smell is still only at 50%. 
I think it‚Äôs another strain of the common cold, perhaps more serious for those with underlying conditions. But no where near as serious as the msm leads people to think.</p>

        <p>I had it and barely lost my taste and smell. It would fade in and out throughout the day. It‚Äôs back 100%, and that only lasted a few days. You‚Äôve never woken up with a bad cold, or allergies, or hell even anxious or hungover and you couldn‚Äôt taste shit? It happens. It‚Äôs naturally occurring. Some people get it worse. That‚Äôs life. COVID is a hoax.</p>

        <p>My mum experienced very weird alterations of taste and smell when she had a very strong cold. I guess that's a weird symptoms of some viral illnesses including covid. Also other people have reported a sudden loss of taste as a consequence of whatever viral infection. Virus can do weird things yeah</p>

        <p>So you believe Covid doesn‚Äôt exist and live in Japan, where people have been wearing masks and social distancing well before COVID (SARS) and whose citizens actually care about the collective good of society. Come over to a deep red state and teach the kids there. Guaranteed you would have gotten it by now. Judging by how much you believe a lockdown is infringing on your rights I doubt you would be able to handle whatever version of the virus you got. What a snowflake.</p>

        <p>Seriously? Have you been to Japan?! I been living here 20 years now, no one has ever been ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù well before Covidü§£ We never even heard of social distancing until this BS CV19 crap. 
Try social distancing here in Japan, it‚Äôs impossible. There are to many people in a small country. People are always busy and in a rush here. No one ever social distances nor cares. You should see the trains here daily, packed full like sardines in a can.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome over to a deep red state‚Äù - LOL  I live in a country right next door to China, with millions of Chinese visiting here all the time. I haven‚Äôt worn a mask since March and out in crowds daily. What makes you think I‚Äôd get it over in the states where you have more land, spread out far and people aren‚Äôt as close together? üòÇ  Your problem is you trust the media to much over there who‚Äôs counting anything as Covid to raise the numbers and scare the public.

        <p>I go to Japan every year barring this year for the last 4 years. I see people wearing masks all the time. How many people are walking about massless around Japan? I don‚Äôt doubt you but when I am in Tokyo people are always following local guidance and protocol. The Japanese are the least individualistic society I have ever seen. I don‚Äôt watch my media but good try. I am reading news every day though and manage to stay informed.</p>

        <p>Japanese wear mask when they are sick or have allergies. Also when the Chinese pollution or yellow sand blows over. 
In the past, they didn‚Äôt wear mask all the time. Just now for ‚ÄúConvid‚Äù
But many still don‚Äôt and living life normal.</p>

        <p>It is a deadly virus to those over 60 and with minor pre-existing conditions who also have depleted C, D and Zinc levels.</p>
<p>That said... its impact for those under 60 has been severely overblown.</p>

        <p>I believe it was a coronavirus among animals that was being studied in a Chinese lab. I think somehow that is how it got into the human sector, but it was accidental. </p>
<p>China wanted to hype it up for some reason that I haven‚Äôt worked out. Possibly as a distraction for something else that happened and they wanted to keep quiet. I say this because of how fast they got back to normal (I‚Äôm certain that happened because they didn‚Äôt need the distraction anymore and so they stopped caring if people got tested)</p>
<p>I think it is a severe cold, because other corona viruses are colds. However, just like colds, flu bugs, or other pathogens, a compromised person is going to suffer a lot more, and their pre-existing condition possibly affected to the point of death.</p>
<p>I also believe the media caused a panic that governments and other groups especially globalists/Nwo immediately noticed and took advantage of. </p>
<p>The vaccine isn‚Äôt real. It is something else and I‚Äôm scared to learn what. What will actually happen is everyone will be vaccinated, then testing will stop. After that, anyone that gets flu-like symptoms will be assumed to have flu or a bad cold. Almost nobody will get tested for those because almost nobody did before.</p>

        <p>We'll never know where it came from. I think it's clear that it's not a bioweapon but that's no reason to discount the idea that it came out of a lab. My pet theory is that, perversely, they were researching viruses that could jump to humans in that Wuhan Virology Institute, and it accidently got out either by someone not following safety precautions and getting infected themselves, or by some unscrupulous technicians selling lab animals to the local live animal market.</p>

        <p>Definitely something new. Don't know any flu or cold that completely takes away your sence of taste the way Covid does. I Don't totally buy into the lab theory but wouldn't be super suprised. Personally I think it's just a new disease that's pretty on par with the flu as far as severity but alot more contagious. My guess is the whole idea of "don't let a good crisis go to waste."</p>

        <p>Not something new. Total loss of taste and smell has been a symptom of coronaviruses for well on 30 years according to the medical book my parents bought for 'continuing learning' via Johns Hopkins Hospital where they worked back then.</p>
<p>It is a RARE symptom, the usual is some impairment of taste and smell but not a total loss.</p>

        <p>As someone who has had Covid-the total loss of taste and smell was awful and nothing like anything I‚Äôve ever encountered before. It‚Äôs NOT like ‚Äújust having a stuffy nose‚Äù‚Äîand mine unfortunately still hasn‚Äôt lly returned. During the fight of my infection, I could have been in a porta potty and smelled zero.  Even strong chemicals-nothing. Couldn‚Äôt smell smoke in case of a fire...it sucked. Eating lost its pleasure. The loss of taste and smell is a very prevalent symptom of this new coronavirus but still doesn‚Äôt mean Covid is a serious disease. 
  (For some people it may be but for most healthy people it‚Äôs a goddamn cold). So tired of 99% of people I know believing the lies and feeling like the only sane rational person.</p>

        <p>Ya I agree, when I said something new I meant more so that it's not the "flu" we see every year. I've seen people claim it is the flu which it's definitely not, although most symptoms are pretty much the same. it's either a "new" coronavirus or we atleast don't see it very often in the US, but like you said Coronaviruses as a whole aren't totally new. </p>
<p>I'm mostly just speaking from experience though. I know quite a bit of people who had it including myself. The taste thing really is wired though. One of my roommates who had it, lost complete taste for about a month but he didn't have any other symptoms.</p>

        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's a different experience. Losing your taste from the flu is usually because you have a stuffy nose, so you can't smell which makes it harder to taste. I can't really speak to your experience of course so I could be wrong. But I had a roommate with Covid with literally no other symptoms. No fever, no stuffy nose, just complete lack of taste. Like you could poor hot sauce on his tounge and he could not taste a thing or sense that it was hot, almost like the nerves in his tounge went of vacation. Lasted for about a month with no other symptoms. I know a few other people who also have had similar experiences since Covid started but literally never heard of a seasonal illness doing that until now.</p>

        <p>I think it's just a normal virus, but if it <em>had</em> been tweaked in a lab and escaped, that would explain the panic. I don't think it'd matter if it really wasn't especially dangerous and had never been intended to be, the idea of a GM virus alone and the uncertainty would do it. Could line up with how fast there's this shiny new kind of vaccine for it, if both had been part of an experiment in developing such vaccines, a US/China collaboration say. If I had to pick a favourite conspiracy it'd be the one that covid-as-we-usually-know-it wasn't the only version that escaped. Some of the variation in severity is surprising -I know, it's just the result of massive numbers of anecdotal cases that aren't representative, but bear with the tinfoil-, and the Australian government were -at least, so it appeared- so fast to jump to 'strain of super-covid!' and take really draconian measures. Then there's that mink strain where it wasn't totally clear how the conclusions it was so different were made. Tinfoil for fun, though!</p>

        <p>Maybe it's worse than a cold but when you look at how they count covid deaths, how inaccurate the tests are, and how mortality in some diseases has gone down exactly the same amount as covid deaths... it's clear it as at a minimum half as deadly and common as the media says. Every few years there's a slightly deadlier flu, hospitals fill up, we have even had 2 week school closures (actually just 2 weeks). This shit now is a big political and corporate power grab. Don't need conspiracy theories, although I don't doubt they could be true. The reality of people lying and profiting is right before our eyes.</p>

        <p>If it started in Wuhan at or near the wet market, and if it's related to that bat coronavirus, it seems obvious it came from a lab.</p>
<p>Of all the places in the world, all the animal markets, it emerges there? A market within a few kms of one of the only labs in the world that research bat coronaviruses and their potential to drive a human pandemic (or possibly the sole lab)?</p>
