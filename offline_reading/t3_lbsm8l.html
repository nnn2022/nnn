        <p>Rich people lovin the new normal. Don’t have to deal with all the plebes anymore! </p>
<p>Seriously the classism going on here is pretty gross. I liked society a lot better when poor people were allowed to go out and show their faces in public.</p>

        <p>&rt; we can double mask, especially if you don’t have a mask with at least 2  layers of tightly woven different fabrics. I have a two-layer polyester  mask that I like wearing, but now I wear a surgical mask under it in  order to add a different fabric and another layer of protection. And if  I’m headed into a store or other indoor place with people outside of my  household, then I’ll add a face shield or goggles. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; So, although this week’s news is mixed, none of it is unexpected.  Sometimes we wish the clocks would strike 13, and the dystopia we have  lived through will be questioned and erased. <strong>However, as my daughter and  I experienced a movie in a theater again this weekend, perhaps  providing us with glimpses into our future, I realized that just like  post-9/11, we never returned to Sept. 10. But we did evolve to a new  normal. And it was fine.</strong> Indeed, we have reasons for optimism.</p>

        <p>I think people need to make note of this part of the article...</p>
<p>&rt; What can we do to prevent surges from these new variants?</p>
<p>&rt; First, we can vaccinate as many as possible and as quickly as possible. Vaccination will reduce transmission, which will reduce further mutations. Since the vaccines thus far appear to be effective against the new variants, even if somewhat diminished, vaccine is likely to reduce transmission as well as severe disease among those infected with the variants. Similar to influenza, even when a season’s vaccine is not a great match against the circulating variants, vaccine most often reduces transmission and provides some levels of protection, especially against severe disease.</p>
<p>&rt; Second, to prevent surges with the new variants, we need to double down on non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., masking, distancing, hand hygiene and ventilation (especially important during these winter months).</p>
<p>&rt; And I mean literally a double down; we can double mask, especially if you don’t have a mask with at least 2 layers of tightly woven different fabrics. I have a two-layer polyester mask that I like wearing, but now I wear a surgical mask under it in order to add a different fabric and another layer of protection. And if I’m headed into a store or other indoor place with people outside of my household, then I’ll add a face shield or goggles.</p>
<p>&rt; The third action step — and this is a major concern — is the U.S. needs to conduct genetic sequencing on far more COVID-19 viruses than we are now. This isn’t a matter of building the plane while flying it; we are basically flying blind. The U.S. sequences about 0.3% of all samples. By contrast, Australia and New Zealand sequence about half of all samples, and a number of other countries, such as the U.K., Denmark, Iceland, and Taiwan, test between 10% – 20% of all samples.</p>
<p>&rt; Denmark provides an interesting example. They experienced a surge earlier this winter, and for the last month, their cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been dropping. They would normally be reopening the country. However, they’re in as strict a lockdown as they were in March. Even though last winter they were one of the first countries to reopen schools (reopening elementary schools after only three weeks), those schools are closed now.</p>
<p>&rt; Why? Because their genetic sequencing of COVID-19 viral samples is showing an alarming increase in frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant, of nearly a doubling per week, to now about 8% of all cases. Because they recognize the growth is exponential, they realize now is the time to keep lockdown measures in place, in order to prevent a major surge and to buy time while aggressively vaccinating the public.</p>
<p>&rt; The Danish prime minister wrote an excellent Facebook post in mid-January, explaining why they were taking such aggressive steps, despite dropping numbers of overall cases. She gave the example of a stadium filling up with water, starting with one drop per minute, and increasing by a doubling of the drops every minute (1, then 2, then 4, then 8 drops each of the first 4 minutes). At that rate, the stadium will fill up in 44 minutes, but it will seem almost empty for the first 42 minutes. She explained that the more contagious variants are just like the drops of water, spreading silently and exponentially. By the time a surge in hospitalizations is detected, it is often too late to flatten the curve.</p>

        <p>Isn't it interesting how they keep, very blatantly, telling us exactly what they want us to do like vaccines and perma-masks, then tell us things will never go back to normal anyway?</p>
