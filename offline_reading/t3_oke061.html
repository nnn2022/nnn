        <p>That sub isn’t really conservative. I cringe every time I see someone praising some shill, fake conservative senator</p>

        <p>/r/Conservative has been subverted for years now. Any one who advocates for actual Conservatism (not that phony NeoCon crap) gets banned.</p>

        <p>People hate Trump. Which is fine. I'm not sure if he was planted or a mistake. Don't care either way. I saw both sides hate on him. I saw his side use him for re-election and then turnaround and bash him. I saw the media for who they are. I was awoken. I saw that my vote doesn't matter. My political beliefs do not matter. They use the extremist on each side to push their agenda. It's all for show. Unless the world decides to wake up and fight back. Well soon their won't be enough to even try. If only people could look past these stupid distractions they throw in front of us. (Even I'm guilty from time to time of falling for). Will we see the bigger picture. Thinking anything the government touches turns to shit? You think that's incompetence or is that what they actually wanted to happen. Why are all these world leaders dying. You think the government really wants you to take the vaccine to save you? Lol. You really think the liberal media and liberal president wants to save the holdouts who are apparently conservative? Lol. Why are they trying so hard in the minority community? When was the last time the government wanted to actually save them? Please, by all means show me a example. I tried looking myself.</p>
