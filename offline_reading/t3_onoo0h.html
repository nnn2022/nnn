    <strong>Amazing first day back in the office. No vaccine conversations or anything to do with covid. Only smiles and collaborative atmosphere.</strong>
    <p><p>I am extremely relieved about my experience of first going back to work. I had been allowed to return to office for a few months now, however, avoided it as long as I could because I feared a dystopia of being asked about vaccine status, seeing people constantly in masks and afraid to come up to one another. </p>
<p>Well, today was the exact opposite. I loved seeing smiling faces and being around people in a collaborative atmosphere and not once anybody asking me about my vaccine status, or anyone else for that matter. When we all left to work from home in March 2020, several people around the office were hysterical and already doing masks before it was really discussed in public society. It was a relief to see nobody acting this way today. In fact a big group of us even went out to happy hour after work, no masks. What a great day.</p></p>

        <p>Yes for sure! There’s something different, in a good way, about how normal people who aren’t afraid of bare faces are able to approach each other and have more meaningful, intimate conversation than before all of this.</p>

        <p>That is great! </p>
<p>Similar circumstance here. I've been back at work for a few weeks now. The tables in breakroom get wiped down with disinfectant more than ever before (honestly, they needed it!) and a chunk of folks are still working from home. </p>
<p>A mask here, a mask there. People ask if I'm "a shaker" before putting out their hand. But things are pretty dang close to old-normal. </p>
<p>The folks who seem most worried are older and might have other conditions. They just keep their own social distance and wave instead of shaking hands. No one bothers them about it and they don't bother anybody else. </p>
<p>We're all to busy trying to do our actual jobs!</p>

        <p>While that is possible, someone in upper management openly stated in a company meeting a couple of months ago he is not vaxed and has no interest in getting it. From what I saw since then nobody had treated him differently. It gives me some hope and not everywhere is as dystopian as the Internet may make it seem</p>

        <p>Nice! Yeah my company's full of "woke" eggheads so it's probably not representative of any norm. It seems unlikely to me that they'll end up pushing the issue, either, given there's high turnover and we were already mostly remote workers before the Wu Flu.</p>

        <p>I went back into my office for the first time since March 2020 for our board meeting this past Friday and it was really nice to see my team. I do feel fortunate that my partners and I are conservative minded people that believe everyone should be allowed to make their own choice. We don’t criticize anyone nor require anyone to do anything aside from respect each other’s boundaries. I am officially returning the first week of August and while working from home had a ton conveniences I am looking forward to being able to have some normal interaction with good minded people.</p>

        <p>Curious what your office "policy" was prior to coming back? </p>
<p>We are scheduled to come back in a month and need to declare vaccine status. Those not vaxxed will have to wear masks. I have a feeling they (we) will be treated as lepers and made to work in the corner.</p>
<p>I previously had covid, recovered fine, am in my 20s and exercise regularly. I see zero personal upside to getting the vaccine (after all, shouldn't this be a personal choice?) but I'm worried about career impacts. Your back to office story is reassuring.</p>

        <p>Hey, the policy is just to do masks if we are in a meeting room with others. Management doesn’t have authority to ask us about our status despite California “rules” about it. I thought that as soon as I was around a group of people I would be asked whether I was or not. You may have luck since you’ve already had the virus. I hope for you that you get treated with respect and your work environment isn’t negative towards others like you</p>
