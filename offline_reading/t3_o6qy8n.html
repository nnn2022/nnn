        <p>FDA still recommends children get the vaccine because the benefits outweigh the risks.  In other words, if your kid dies of myocarditis, their sacrifice for the profits of Pfizer and Moderna is appreciated by the shareholders.</p>
<p>They've made it obvious that people are only useful to them  as sacrifices.</p>

        <p>Interesting that many other health organizations are still promoting the vaccination of children, when the WHO posted not to vaccinate kids against Covid. The text on the webpage was then changed to say they can't make recommendations on that matter.</p>

        <p>The "greater good" can justify the most extreme assault on individuals, including the ultimate sacrifice.  Funnily enough, elites who decide tend not to suffer the consequences of those "greater good" policies.</p>
<p>You argue both on the merits of the individual and group rights or you're simply a totalitarian hiding behind morality (while usually employing state force to prevent dissenting opinions on what the policies should look like and what the greater good actually is).</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by "suppressed" but if it's "removed from social media" it's because they cost thousands of lives. It's for the same reason that if a popular and respected child educator, for some reason, told children to eat any wild mushrooms they find it should be taken down.</p>

        <p>Yes, the CDC. You can look up the risk of death due to COVID for your age and health group, and compare it against the deaths reported to VAERS. </p>
<p>This is why the WHO does not recommend vaccines for anyone under 19. The risk/reward ratio changes as you get older and with more comorbidities. </p>
<p>I would take the vaccine if I was 65+ or if I was in poor health. Young healthy people are better off risking natural infection - and building natural immunity in the rare case they are infected.</p>

        <p>&rt; the deaths reported to VAERS</p>
<p>Deaths being reported to VAERS don't mean they're caused by the vaccine. Most people have no way of telling whether the vaccine caused anything that occurred afterwards.</p>
<p>If 1% of the stuff reported to VAERS was actually caused by the vaccine, it would be gargantuan news. When a low double digit number of people got rare blood clots from millions who were vaccinated, the CDC suspended use of the vaccine and it was covered enormously all around the world.</p>
<p>That's just not the way VAERS works.</p>

<p>Do you really not see why an opt in reporting of symptoms in a system as complex as the human body with no control group done overwhelmingly by people with no experience or qualifications on the topic is totally insufficient grounds for establishing causality?</p>

<p>You don't think there's a difference in accuracy between medical experts saying what caused a death versus laymen with no way for the system to feed back to them personally? We know the vaccines don't cause such symptoms listed by VAERS because they have been studied immensely and approved by dozens of governments. Unless a serious side effect is enormously rare, like those blood clots, it will show up in the mountain of testing the vaccine goes through.</p>

<p>You lose that bet. The difference is, if patients are being systemically misdiagnosed with diseases they don't have, that can be found out and those responsible punished.</p>
<p>With politicians, there is nothing remotely equivalent.</p>
<p>&rt; COVID should only be listed as cause of death if the virus actually caused the death. I.e. “but for a COVID-19 infection, this patient would be alive.”</p>
<p>That's how it works.</p>

<p>They're still undergone an enormous amount of safety and effectiveness testing.</p>
<p>&rt; We have no data for the long-term impacts of the vaccines.</p>
<p>The only way we could have such data is by waiting decades for something with no known mechanism to happen.
Unless people are going to refuse the vaccine to a disease that is killing millions and would kill tens of millions every few years without it, there is nothing to be done besides taking the minute risk.</p>
<p>&rt; Canada is reporting a higher instance rate of adverse reactions (0.026) than VAERS and only healthcare providers can submit reports.</p>
<p>I looked <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=504892E8786F7A8D867B7FA9BDBD">here</a> and the rate is 0.082% compared to 0.026%. I was way off with the 99% it seems, at least for reactions in general. Nonetheless, it does differ majorly from Canada's reporting system.</p>

<p>So the system is self-correcting, at least to a degree, so why would you doubt the official numbers?</p>
<p>How is contributed different to cause in this context?</p>
<p>Number 3 you have some ground to stand on. Even so, it's not gene therapy. No country has concluded anything dangerous about the vaccine beyond what the FDA has indicated, and unless you were to delay every innovative medication for decades, there is no way to test for long term risks. There is substantial theoretical knowledge associated with Biological cause and effect; do you hear any experts on the immune system or similar warning about the risks of not testing new treatments over the long term?</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid">This chart</a> has people in the 20s at zero times to ten times the chance of death from Covid. Even if it's far closer to the former, as adverse reactions are mostly things like fatigue and muscle pain, you're much better off getting vaccinated.</p>

<p>Of course it's not alone; in any vaguely functioning system there will be errors in both directions. You have no reason to think they're generally inflated.</p>
<p>&rt; It normally takes around 7 years to approve a vaccine. That seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Vaccine approval time is not based on any waiting period for side effects; there are many stages of testing, all of which take much less time than seven years. It would be sheer coincidence if that were the optimum time to wait.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have for this? If this were true, where are the Democratic politicians complaining about it? Trump tried to, sure, but there's zero indication he succeeded.</p>
<p>&rt; John Hopkins has a tool where you can calculate your specific risk of death.</p>
<p>Can I access this tool? What does it say your risk of death from the vaccine is?</p>
<p>&rt; the vaccine is more dangerous than the FDA originally recognized</p>
<p>This is true, but it's still much safer than Covid. The FDA chancing its stance is a sign that things are working as they should be.</p>

In either case, the vaccine is orders of magnitude more risky for me than Covid. https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/new-online-covid-19-mortality-risk-calculator-could-help-determine-who-should-get-vaccines-first.html</p>
<p>The vaccine may be safer than Covid for someone who is 65+ with health conditions. For most regular healthy people, risking a Covid infection is significantly safer.</p>

        <p>&rt; There is a financial incentive to report a death as caused by Covid.</p>
<p>The money is for Covid infections, not deaths.</p>
<p>&rt; “Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years and involving a combination of public and private involvement.” - https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation</p>
<p>Is this meant to contradict me?</p>
<p>&rt; Operation Warp Speed is not a secret.</p>
<p>I asked for evidence that "this process was subject to Trump’s political interference"; that Operation Warp Speed existed does not establish that.</p>
<p>&rt; My risk of dying from COVID is 0.000023%. VAERS reports a death rate of 0.0017% . . . Canada Public Health Agency reports a “serious adverse event” rate of 0.005%.</p>
<p>Do you really not see the flawed comparison here? VAERS doesn't establish causality and the vaccine adverse reaction risk is for everyone, not just your specific demographic.</p>

        <p>Hospitals were incentivized to inflate both COVID cases and deaths. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/</a></p>
<p>Yes, you said testing a vaccine takes "much less time than seven years". Yet. The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, claims the process typically takes 10 - 15 years. </p>
<p>Operation Warp Speed is Trump's policy. Politicians exert influence through laws and government programs. Trump created a program to accelerate the approval process for COVID-19 vaccines. That is influence/power. </p>
<p>I agree the comparison is flawed. Unfortunately, there is no readily available information breaking down VAERs deaths by age or health status. However, my risk from the vaccine is <strong>orders of magnitude</strong> higher than my chance of dying due to COVID. The vaccines would need to be hundreds of times more dangerous for the elderly than for young people for my risk analysis to shift in favour of taking a vaccine.</p>

        <p>There was nothing in that link about inflating deaths.</p>
<p>&rt; The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, claims the process typically takes 10 - 15 years.</p>
<p>I guarantee you "the process" they're talking about is not a many year test, but vaccine development. Vaccines are tested sequentially many times during that process.</p>
<p>You wrote</p>
<p>&rt; this process was subject to Trump’s political interference with Operation Warp-speed - which allowed vaccine corporations to bypass safety regulations.</p>
<p>Trump creating the operation does not mean safety regulations were bypassed.</p>
<p>VAERS makes it very clear you shouldn't use it's reports as indication of causality. The stat you give based on it is not your risk from the vaccine, but someone's risk of something reported to VAERS. There's mountains of stuff in there that has almost no chance of being caused by the vaccine; most of it's just things that happened by coincidence around the time the person got vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Man, how do you have such unyielding faith in the honesty of governments and corporations? </p>
<p>The article is about inflating deaths. Third paragraph in: "How can anyone not believe that increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths may create an avenue for states to receive a larger portion of federal dollars. Already some states are complaining that they are not getting enough of the CARES Act dollars because they are having significantly more proportional COVID-19 deaths."</p>
<p>This is like lobbying. There is no "evidence" that a politician is influenced by lobbying money - but the incentive structure is obvious for anyone paying attention. You must expect humans to act rationally and maximize their own self-interest. That is the basis of modern law making. </p>
<p>Of course Operation Warp Speed is bypassing regulations - that was the entire point of the program. To speed up the process of vaccine approval for rapid distribution. <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/10/7/21504134/trump-covid-19-vaccine-operation-warp-speed-debate">Vox</a> offers a good breakdown of the program. From the article:  “I think it undermines the FDA every day, undermines the NIH ... FDA should be the clear arbiter of the regulatory process and how things become prioritized,” the pharma executive said. “It’s created a lot of confusion and complexity, and I’m not sure what it’s achieved.”</p>
<p>The stated goals of the program as well as industry insiders agree that Operation Warp Speed allow vaccine manufacturers to bypass the FDA's normal regulatory framework. </p>
<p>You can ignore VAERs data. My argument is equally supported by Canadian data - which must be submitted by a health care provider. The Canadian system is not subject to the same concerns as VAERs - so you may need to reconsider your talking points.</p>

        <p>I hope they find out a lot and study the science. My issues are as follows. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They are scientifically finding more out about it, so clearly don't know everything there is to know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never interfere with someone's freedom to take it. But do not force me to do anything just because others want to. Leave me out of it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I take issue with children being a part of all of this. The science shows they are more than likely to drown, die in a car accident and many others. Or even more likely to commit suicide if they are are 14 than to die of covid by a far margin.</p>
