    <strong>r/covidvaccinated is terrifying</strong>
    <p><p>It's a horror show. I'm not suggesting going over there to be a dingus, but just take a look at what these people are posting.</p>
<p>It's incredible. I do feel kinda bad for them honestly. Yes they are idiots, but they're still humans suffering.</p>
<p>The strangest part to me is that after they list their litany of symptoms from the shot, they end with "...but I'm <em>not</em>  an antivaxer!" or better yet "but I'd still get it!"</p>
<p>I foresee a future where there is a whole sub-group of the society that woke up after their first shot and now have regrets.</p></p>

        <p>I've been reading that sub for 3 months. Every. Single. Night.</p>
<p>I told my wife that if this is truly the "killshot", it would eventually show up in that sub.</p>
<p>The first month on that sub was the biggest, "Yay for Science" convention you have ever seen. I was patient. I kept reading.</p>
<p>Slowly, the complaints started to trickle in. I was banned shortly thereafter but I kept reading.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of that, the tipping point occurred. It became an outpost of, "Hey, just want to say that I'm so happy and thankful to have gotten my vaccine but has anybody noticed_____(fill in the blank). One after another, I couldn't believe what I was reading. I would come running into the bedroom to my wife and read her post after post. It was Stephen King material and still is.</p>
<p>Now, it's a complete shitshow of pro-vaxxers, pissed off people, concerned people, anxious people and injured people. When they banned me, I replied back to the moderators that this is exactly what would happen in a very short time. It's bittersweet to have been so right. I don't feel any sympathy for the vaccinated, but I know that there is about to be a tremendous impact on countless children all over America because their mom or dad or both are half the human they were a few short months ago.</p>
<p>We are officially in the storm now people. One read of that sub will verify that for anyone with discernment.</p>

        <p>Glad to know I’m not the only one who reads that sub to kill time every night, it’s like a car crash you can’t look away from. </p>
<p>The best is when ppl are actually worried if they DON’T get crazy debilitating side effects. “I’m concerned my shot isn’t working, should I get a third one now? Is it ok if take Tylenol to bring down my 103 fever I’ve had for 3 weeks straight or will that make the vaccine useless?” </p>
<p>I got banned for simply asking what other vaccine in our lives has ever had side effects like this? Seriously, I can’t think of one that has caused me or anyone I know to get nonstop fevers, never mind all the weird neurological and gastro issues these ppl are having. </p>
<p>Wtf is wrong with them thinking this can possibly be normal? Maybe they’re realizing they fucked up and are in full denial mode now?</p>

        <p>The craziest people are the ones that already have extreme medical anxiety, like they are scared of getting a headache.</p>
<p>Now, this shot has truly made them sick and it's not "in their head". And they are losing their minds. The damage from the shot so far is inestimable. There are millions living a personal medical nightmare now, for no reason other than their ignorance or laziness.</p>

        <p>I wonder if it wasn’t so politicized would they have done more research and not gotten it. It seems like the main reason a lot of them did was to stick it to the “anti-vaxxer crazy trumpers” and that’s why they’re so proud and quick to dismiss any legitimate concerns ppl have. </p>
<p>They’re only capable of seeing things in black and white, left or right, and can’t comprehend that there’s actually a huge amount of regular, educated ppl who are also skeptical of the whole thing. They just wanted a seat at the cool kids lunch table and the news told them this is how they get it. </p>
<p>The latest thing to disturb me on that sub is the posts from parents asking where they can sign their kid up for the vaccine ASAP. I even saw 1 where they were trying to sneak their under 16 child into being able to get it, and asking in a round about way how to go about forging documents to do it. So messed up.</p>

        <p>That is terrifying. That is my hill to die on with this thing. If they start talking about kids being vaccinated for school, etc. No way in hell. If people let these vaxx passports go through, they’ll have free rein to shoot us and our children up with whatever they want, whenever they want, forever and ever, amen.</p>

        <p>The typical post there is something like:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>OP: First off, I want everyone in the world to know that I am NOT anti-vax and get every vaccine that is offered to me. I just got the second shot of Moderna two weeks ago and my lymph nodes have been swelling and have a burning sensation ever since. I've been nauseous every day for the past week and have a 103 degree fever for a week and a half before finally going to the ER. They did blood tests and everything came back normal but I've started to bleed from my eyes and blood blisters have started to appear on my arms and legs. Still glad I got the shot rather than COVID!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And inevitably the first reply is, "I'm going through the same thing, HaVe yOu TrIeD tAkInG TyLeNoL oR iBuPrOfEn?!"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Someone just described experiencing all the symptoms of leukemia and everyone on there thinks popping a couple of Tylenols or Aleves will clear everything up!</p>

They literally talk about being rushed to the hospital and how they can barely walk anymore, but they’re so happy they were able to do their part by getting the vax and so thankful they won’t (maybe) get COVID now.

        <p>Right? None of it makes any sense. It’s like they want to be seen as super heroic, but getting yourself paralyzed and almost dying doesn’t seem all that heroic to me. “Hey guys, got my first shot and was paralyzed for 2 months and my skin peeled off but hot damn I can’t wait for my second shot! Everyone should get it.”  Blows my mind.</p>

        <p>Lately, every time I've checked out that sub, I've found several cases of people still suffering side effects over two weeks afterwards. Ironically, I wouldn't have known that long-haul vax side effects occur if not for that sub. It further shows just how biased the media is. Even then, you'd only get support or not banned if you don't show any signs of wrongspeak or wrongthink.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. There's a reason that every mainstream vaccine subreddit now uses a bot that automatically bans anyone with any comment history (regardless of context) from any anti-lockdown subreddit, including this subreddit, r/CoVaxSkeptical and r/LockdownSkepticism.</p>
<p>In response, I've created the following exerpt as a tool to warn family, friends, or anyone you care about. I designed it specifically to (hopefully) not get banned off Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Youtube, as most social media already implemented rules to censor, penalize and ban any vaccine dissent (even just reasonable skepticism.)</p>

<p><strong>The following text is lifted directly from the CDC, updated on April 23, 2021:</strong></p>
<p><em>"People with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions. People from this group were eligible for enrollment in some of the clinical trials. More information about vaccine clinical trials can be found below."</em> <strong>Source is directly quoted from CDC.gov here:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html</p>
<p>This may explain why we're seeing countless autoimmune nightmare horror stories each and every day, even lasting up to months on end. <em>"Given that autoimmune diseases are often rare and may not be easily diagnosed with blood tests, imaging, and other standard tests, clinicians who aren’t familiar with these illnesses can find them perplexing."</em> <strong>Source is directly quoted from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov here:</strong> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114837/</p>

        <p>I’m not even gonna attempt to look at that subreddit. It sounds like a collection of brainwashed sociopaths. They just want to be accepted and fit in. It’s like when kids change their entire personality to fit in with the “cool kids” getting all the attention.</p>
