    <strong>Authoritarian conditioning and education</strong>
    <p><p>A millennial's opinion on public schools/education:</p>
<p>Through out my life and experience with education my opinion of public education and college is that it conditions young people to accept authoritarianism. I have experienced this phenomenon in both public school and college. I was lucky to be exposed to the Constitution, Magna Carta, and the Bill of Rights at a young age and thankfully I had some capacity to understand these rights even as a child. Every experience I've had where I've gotten "in trouble" the first thing the school administration did (middle school through college) was try to convince me that I have no rights and pressure me to confess my guilt (on their terms regardless of the actual circumstances) so they could decide my punishment. Basically, the administration is on a default guilty until proven innocent and they do their utmost to deny you, the individual, a right to defend yourself against whatever accusation. In fact they do more than deny the existence of individual rights, they work to circumvent the legal process and use every opportunity to coerce a person into accepting whatever punishment is deemed appropriate regardless of whether a person is guilty of what they are accused of. They pressure people into accepting their fate because the powers at be cannot or should not be challenged. Now I admit I was (and still am) a little shit that tests boundaries but that is beside the point. They use the power of the institution to make children/young adults feel like insignificant specs in a system where the only choice is to comply or be ostracized. My point is that this conditioning at a young age carries with people and even defines them in adulthood. In my opinion this can partially explain the massive numbers of braindead mobs that can be summoned for whatever "cause" that captures perceived public opinion in the moment. It also explains why the people that make up these mobs have no conviction and are so easily manipulated. It's not about the cause at the end of the day it's about fitting in. No doubt the psychology of crowds plays a roll in this but the conditioning most of us have experienced could explain why there hasn't been a strong cohesive movement in this modern era like we've seen with civil rights in the 60's for example. No one actually believes in what they are gathering for it's just about the feeling of inclusion.</p>
<p>My two cents.</p></p>
