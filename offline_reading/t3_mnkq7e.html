    <strong>I hate how I can't feel the way I feel about this whole thing, or people don't understand how I feel or worse when people say what I am feeling is NORMAL!</strong>
    <p><p>Is it really NORMAL to feel trapped and or controlled?   </p>
<p>That either you follow the restrictions when you go out or stay home? What kind of life is that? "It's just a mask!" People tell me that all the time. "It's normal to feel that way!" Is it really normal to feel when you wake up just despair and fear over this whole pandemic? I am exhausted all the time and how is it with vaccines out we are seeing little end to this when more areas are "getting a rise in cases" or "going into lockdown". Or the latest fearmongering that the news is trying to say Covid is now targeting young people. JUST STOP IT! PLEASE! ENOUGH! I am so just fucking sick of all of this. Even if you avoid the news you can't even go anywhere without seeing people wear masks and them trying to tell you to wear one. Or that you aren't allowed to shop there if you don't have one. Getting anxious if anyone gets near me and worrying if they overreact because I didn't "watch where I was going and that I was violating their space". I can't even say how I feel in subreddits that deal with mental health because they say I am an Anti-Masker and that I am harming other people with my words! It's just ugh this whole thing is such a mess and I am just so done with it. I don't know how people are just okay with this possibly continuing into 2022 or say "well there is nothing we can do about it". Sorry guys I am just really starting to feel this whole thing hit me harder and harder the longer it goes on. I can't even see a therapist about it because I just fear they will try to get me to accept that this is our way of life now.</p></p>

        <p>No, its not normal. We have to wake as many people up to this absolute fraud. UN WHO all these NGOs are not on our side despite what your professors teach. It’s tobacco science.  They just make some shitty research paper up and that’s “the science”. Don’t forget who are paying these ‘researchers’. Corruption is rampant. Gotta have everyone in prison smart cities by 2030.</p>

        <p>Right now, your feelings are perfectly normal. These are the feelings of somebody who's space was invaded by bad forces, in this case: the government and media and their hysteria.</p>
<p>This will pass, too. As I recommended to others, look up the waves hysteria of the past, after 9/11, around the Gulf war in '91, Vietnam, McCarthy. Unfortunately, its exactly in these times when not conforming 100% becomes a burden, but it is people who do not conform, who form the barrier where the wave eventually runs out of steam and breaks. Conform only as much as necessary, voice unemotional and rational opposition, shrug/tell/flip off toxic people, ignore the news, prepare for the time after. The COVID doomers are as wrong as the prophets of jackbooted tyranny.</p>

        <p>So, you don't think that this is used to usher in the resrt which will leave us all with no freedoms or choice? I'm not sure this will ever pass.</p>

        <p>There will be changes to society and institutions. However, everyone who ever tried to change things into a certain direction or towards a specific goal failed miserably. And so will Mr. "I want to be a Bond villain" Schwab. The PATRIOT Act, for example, had negative consequences for American freedoms, but it is far from what doomsday prophets had feared. Same is true for the consequences of the financial crisis or 2008.</p>
<p>The real danger lies in the complacency after the fact. People are usually just happy that the crisis is over and things get better, but they fail to follow up on it. This is why governments manage to accumulate power over time. The fear of Trump was a great example for this, because it was the Republican party that created the national security super-apparatus  and it was the Democratic party that normalized the death list of a US president and upheld executive orders and laws issued by the Bush administration. Both watched in horror when these powers got into the hands of a "mad man". Turned out: he just wanted to do business and Rosie O'Donnell was not killed by a drone.</p>
<p>If you want to fight for your freedom, a gun in your hand won't do you any good. Unless you manage to organize your ability to project violence at the same level in terms of organization and resources, its just a fantasy. Follow up and demand that the executive orders get cancelled and that laws get repealed. Let the government fight for its power again and again. Especially in the US, you have so much influence as a citizen on local, county, state and federal level, but from an outside perspective, nobody uses these rights and possibilities. Instead people comply, become non-political or dig up a trench to "fight the government".</p>
<p>As a final thought, when you compare the situation today to the literary dystopias like 1984, Brave New World and others, you'll notice that today there is a bit of everything. Exercising power by violence is not sustainable and thus not the mean of choice and not used that often. Power today is more subtle and does not need jackboots to propagate it. In a way, you are already unfree, and you don't see it, because the constitution and most of the political discourse uses the language of times long gone, while important changes slip by. Patents on living organisms, private mass-surveillance, corporate consolidation, AI-based judicial decisions, automatic fines, international treaties without public discussion, stuff like that.</p>
