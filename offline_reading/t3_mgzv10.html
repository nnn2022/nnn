        <p>&rt;Of course there are areas where we had difficulties in getting down to the raw data, and there are many good reasons for that. In China, like in many other countries, there are restrictions on privacy laws that forbid the sharing of data, including private details to outsiders in particular. Where we did not have full access to the overall data, this has been put as a recommendation for future studies. So the idea is that, because we didnâ€™t have time or because certain authorisation needs to be given before we could get access to the data, all that could be done in the second phase of studies.</p>
<p>This is the person who led the "investigation" into the origins of the virus in Wuhan. </p>
<p>Recall, it took over a <em>year</em> before the WHO had people on the ground investigating in Wuhan.  A year!  And then a year later they come out with that tripe.</p>
<p>Like, come on.</p>
<p>Who's believing this garbage?  How are people still falling for this??  These people are obviously corrupt and lying to us.  How are people still buying this nonsense!?!?</p>
