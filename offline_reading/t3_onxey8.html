        <p>I'm pregnant, I've been sick over what to do with schooling, and that's the route I've decided to take. Luckily in my state you don't need a teachers cert, for public, or nonpublic homeschooling, as long as you have religious exemption for nonpublic.</p>

        <p>I believe there are co-ops for public homeschooling here, no certificate needed for public, but nonpublic is trickier. To file for religious exemption you can only teach your own children, if you have a degree/certificate you can teach other kids.</p>

        <p>I've seen several comments on here about homeschooling lately, you're not alone. I was homeschooled and enjoyed it. My parents did a sort of Montessori method (although that word wasn't really around at the time) where I could pick things I was interested in and we'd learn about them in depth. There was a company that mailed out an end-of-year test each year to make sure I was keeping up with my grade level, but you can probably do everything online now.</p>
<p>I recommend finding a local group with some like-minded parents if you can. I always had other homeschooled kids to play with and places to go for field trips, plus we did sports together like baseball, tennis, swimming lessons etc. Where I lived (Texas) I think they recently passed a law that homeschooled kids can participate in UIL athletics with the public school kids, there might be other states that do it too. </p>
<p>I always figured I'd just send my future kids to public school, but after the way things have shifted in the past couple years, that will never happen.</p>

        <p>Once you add sports or music to the homeschooling practice you really bring it together. The main complaint against it seems to be that the kids won’t get to socialize, but if they do group activities then they’re set</p>

        <p>That's better than most people. But there is a thing which binds people that is hidden in plain site from everyone, and that is the use of the legal person entity created by the birth certificate. To participate in their domain, to enjoy "free-doms" and be a subject to the laws of their nation, you need one of those. The kicker is it's entirely voluntary (although they trick you into thinking it's a necessity of life), and only adults can legitimately consent. If you do not want your children to have to suffer what the future holds for voluntary subjects I suggest you research into this and inform them exactly what civil life entails. This is also the message of Christ; to leave the gentile nations, not be yoked with unbelievers, and seek God's kingdom. If you'd like to know more hit me up.</p>

        <p>My wife IS a professional teacher. She's leaving the profession to stay home and school our children. It was her experience within the public schools that brought us to the conclusion that A) they were indoctrination centers for a worldview we abhor and B) they weren't doing a very good job educating kids.  </p>
<p>She went into teaching with a master's in early childhood education and came out 5 years later with a firm belief that the public school system is broken beyond repair where we live and we won't be subjecting our kids to it.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure how someone gets that much education and still thinks that “godless” is in anyway an indication of someone’s ability to educate your child. Education is about learning, religion is about faith. They are entirely different things. I am sad that a child will be indoctrinated with that kind of belief system when home schooled.</p>

        <p>If you were at a public event where you could ask medical officials questions, and you asked “how many Amish people have died from diseases that could have been prevented from vaccinations” I bet you they would be very angry and uncomfortable for being put on the spot like that.</p>
<p>Vaccines work of course, it’s not like it’s all lies. Polio was almost wiped out. When my grandparents were kids, it wasn’t unusual to know someone that was disabled by polio. Vaccinations came in and now polio is almost like the Black Plague.</p>

        <p>Polio was basically wiped out before the vaccine, same with measles, chicken pox and all childhood diseases. Polio became an epidemic because of idiot doctors removing the vital tonsils that are the only place in the body that creates antibodies for polio.  Vaccines NEVER wiped out any disease. They were ALL released after the diseases was almost gone.</p>

        <p>I've lived around Amish most of my life. It is a cult and the fact they some of these people are idolizing them is ridiculous. You guys are all about free thinking and free will but you want to join the group that doesn't allow either of that? The Amish literally shun you and remove you from their community if you even question one of their beliefs. That is not freedom.</p>

        <p>But you are left alone. The only slightly legitimate complaint you have is the vaccine passports, but that doesn't apply to traveling in the USA. You will always be able to go where ever you want here but if you're going to someone else's country you will need to abide by their rules which is where the vaccine passport comes into play. You will be unable to travel outside the country but you're free to do whatever in the country. Is that not enough?</p>

        <p>Discouraging fact about the Amish, their population is diminishing faster than arctic ice and their gene pool is getting to be about as big as an ice tray. The Amish are good people, well mannered in public, but they practice familial marriage. It's not rare for 1st cousins to marry and make children in Amish communities, but that kind of practice leads quickly to a multitude of various severe mental health issues. Autism, down syndrome and other mental illnesses are only growing in the Amish population with time. But, this is just coming from an 'English' Midwesterner, so what do I know.</p>

        <p>Religious reasons. Long story short they don't use anything new that has no use/isn't better than what they had before. Don't use tech for the sake of it being tech.</p>
<p>Buttons aren't inherently better than wrapping clothes. Hence no buttons/zippers. Cars aren't normally better than horses and buggies, hence no cars. No need for electric power, fireplaces do just fine (and are useful)</p>
<p>There are exceptions, they will have work trucks because they haul more. They do take vaccines if they're at risk (tetanus is almost universal, many groups go full mmr/etc) cellphones exist for work, but you aren't allowed to call your girlfriend for the latest gossip.</p>
<p>Each group has their own rules and how far they'll go. But the idea is to lead a simple life, with self reliance in service to God, nothing more.</p>
<p>It sounds like a great life tbh. (Me personally skipping the religious part, no I don't want to be a hippie either) but it too has a whole host of issues.</p>

        <p>Except that congenital rubella syndrome happens in the Amish. Pregnant women with rubella especially in the first trimester can give birth to children with retardation, deafness, and other life long severe issues.... it would be nice if the MMR was three separate shots as it is given in other countries. It would be easier to convince some groups to get one or two rather than all three at once.</p>

        <p>The Amish were a mostly isolated and insular community until recently. They rarely interacted outside their circle. That is why they were less vulnerable to alot of the big viruses of the 20th century that circulated in the general population. That being said they have been infected with Covid and we probably don't have the real numbers on infections and deaths from the community because most Amish shun modern medical intervention.<br>

<p>this is pre-COVID btw (2017)</p>
<p><em>Amish children were hospitalized for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) at significantly higher rates than other children, researchers found.</em> </p>
<p><em>“Most, but not all, of this increased risk was driven by differences in vaccination coverage,” authors wrote in the study “Vaccine Preventable Diseases Requiring Hospitalization” (Williamson G, et al. Pediatrics. Aug. 2, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-0298).</em>   </p>
<p><em>Researchers studied Penn State Children’s Hospital’s medical records for children under 18 who were diagnosed with a VPD from 2005-’15. Children were classified as Plain (Amish and Mennonite) or non-Plain, although when looking at rates, researchers did not have enough data to include the Mennonite population.</em> </p>
<p><em>Roughly 92% of the Plain children in the study were unvaccinated compared to 17% of the non-Plain children. During the study period, 215 children were hospitalized with 221 VPDs.</em> </p>
<p><em>About 93% of these children were unvaccinated or immunocompromised, except for those with pneumococcal infections, according to the research. While 81% of the hospitalized children were non-Plain, Amish children were hospitalized for VPD at more than twice their rate.</em></p>

        <p>Gladly! Vaccines are wonderful technologies, that are developed over long periods of time and have helped to reduce hospitalizations in the populations that take them. Experimental gene therapy (pre-COVID definition), that's not approved, produced by sketchy companies that have never had an approved drug, pushed incredibly hard by the government, and are totally pointless for the vast majority of the population might not be as good. Hope that clears things up for you :)</p>

        <p>Oh boy, I’m not sure which Facebook page you pulled that from, but mRNA vaccines are NOT gene therapy, contrary to what many “health experts” on this sub say about it. Covid vaccines were developed by companies, but are still approved independently by each country. </p>
<p>You’ve also completed ignored the original comment, so I’ll hazard a guess to say you have no argument against it.  Cheers.</p>

        <p>Wow this is a small minded worldview. Do you think Amish sit in their houses all day not doing anything? I see Amish people in my community almost daily. They shop where we do, they come into town for appointments or the like, and every weekend there's a half dozen that come to run stalls at farmer's markets. They also do fantastic construction work, I hired a few to build a chicken coop on my old property, thing will be there longer than my house. They aren't weird reclusive shut ins, maybe you should do some research before saying bigoted things</p>

        <p>Very good indeed! I wonder if Europeans during the time of Plague would have thought, “oh if only we have something that could give us immunity over this terrible illness...impossible right.” </p>
<p>The picture is an obvious hyperbole. Black death, arguably the worst pandemic in history, still didn’t wipe out the Europeans. Still a big fucking deal and killed lots of people though. No population has been completely wiped out by a sickness, but that doesn’t mean no sicknesses matter.</p>

        <p>You realize that the Black Death happened in the 14th century and after 600 years we have better medical technologies as well as living conditions right? Like, dare we fathom, antibiotics and vaccines? The death rate back then for the black death was about 50%, but now it’s about 10%. Because of, oh no, modern technological advances? But no, we should reject treatment and return to our old ways of life, not taking antibiotics and not getting vaccines, dying like real men.</p>

        <p>Yeah, because back in the 14th century we didn’t have antibiotics. People at that time still believed that letting leeches such your blood or putting lead on your face is good for you. Modern technology generally helps people live longer, like, oh no, vaccines? 
Also, not sure where you got your covid death rate stat from? I reckon you’ve put the % wrong? It’s a one-digit percentage.</p>

        <p>Have you ever went to the hospital? Taken antibiotics? Applied sunscreen? Worn sunglasses? Put on layers when you’re cold? These are all examples of technology interfering with natural selection, and so are vaccines. Don’t pick and choose what you want to receive from natural selection. Your heritage has likely survived due to these interventions more than once in the past.</p>

        <p>Back in March, at least one Amish community reached herd immunity all on their own, no jab needed. </p>

        <p>This is stupid in the opposite direction. Herd immunity isn’t some magic hand wave thing. </p>
<p>You know how there were outbreaks of measles and vaccine preventable diseases even in the US recently?</p>
<p>A “herd” is relative. If your entire Amish community/“herd” is not immunized, yeah, the outside population protects you to an extent, but catching it will still result in spread. </p>
<p>That’s why we see higher rates of VPD in Amish communities compared to general populations.</p>

        <p>Unless they take the covid “vaccine” then they never get herd immunity because it doesn’t stop transmissions 😂</p>
