    <strong>How do you convince someone to lay off on strictly enforcing mask wearing?</strong>
    <p><p>A bit of context here. So I coach soccer to 12-13 year old girls and have a fun time doing so. Last fall, I was the head coach and we went through the entire season where never once did I tell any of my girls to mask up. The girls never wore masks during practices or the games and it was totally fine. None of their parents complained to me or said I was being Covid unsafe. There were no incidents either- I never got Covid and neither did the players. </p>
<p>This season, I’m not coaching and my former assistant coach is now the head coach. She is strictly enforcing mask wearing at all times, during practices and the games. I tried to show her sources and statistics about kids being less susceptible to Covid and much lower transmission rates from outdoor activities. She wouldn’t listen and literally said mask wearing is the “new normal” and “morally right” just like how everyone should wear shoes when they’re walking outside. What’s even more disheartening is that she does even more “Covid unsafe” stuff than I do such as going to house parties, bars, clubs etc. Nothing wrong about that, but it just shows she’s obviously enforcing mask wearing out of this twisted view of self-virtue. </p>
<p>Am I making too big of a deal out of this? What is something you all recommend I do to try and convince her to stop strictly enforcing mask wearing on my former team? A lot of these young girls, I’ve coached for years and hate seeing permanently masked up.</p>
<p>EDIT: for some reference, the state I live in does not enforce outdoor mask wearing. The soccer league we participate in also doesn’t enforce it, they only recommend players wear one when they’re all sitting together on the sidelines during a game</p></p>

<p>She's not afraid of covid. If she was, she'd be inside. She's afraid of disobeying. It's important to see the difference. She doesn't care about stats.  She doesn't care that kids are safe.  She only wants to follow the "moral path".  </p>
<p>You can't change her mind on that.</p>

        <p>The state I live in doesn’t have a mask mandate for outside. In addition, the soccer league we coach in also doesn’t have a mask mandate either. They said the only time the players are ENCOURAGED to wear masks is when they’re all together on the sidelines during a game.</p>

<p>You don't have to wear one.  Don't.  Explain to the girls why or why not.   I don't know your rules, but usually a coach can't fire an assistant for not breaking a rule.</p>

        <p>It seems either one of the players will have to refuse, which is unlikely as pre teen girls are not known to be particularly rebellious to authority figures, or, more likely, one of the not completely delusional parents will have to threaten to yank their daughter from the team.</p>

<p>In which particular universe are pre-teen girls not rebellious?  I would like to go there.   They are rebellious when they can do it in groups, it's simply that few like to start it.   (OMG mom, the dye washes out, and it matches my vape pen!)</p>

        <p>just follow the guidelines/policies on mask wearing. if you are not violating the guidelines/policies, and you're being pressured to break the guidelines/policies, then just tell them to focus their concerns to the administration and your bosses.</p>

<p>a persons personal behavior outside of work does not have to conform to their behavior at work. I can dress professionally, and develop tools to violate personal freedoms, but dress like a slob at home/clubs and develop tools that combat the tools I develop. When in a position, that is in authority, you have a responsibility to perform your duties in accordance to what is required.</p>
<p>&rt; Am I making too big of a deal out of this? </p>

<p>&rt;What is something you all  recommend I do to try and convince her to stop strictly enforcing mask  wearing on my former team?</p>
<p>find the rules about what is required. If there is no rules that explicitly require masks, then you will have to challenge how she is 'abusing' her authority.</p>

        <p>makes sense there's no enforcement for outdoor sports....</p>
<p>while i don't personally endorse relaxing of mask regulations, even for sports, i would assume you could check with the league/school/organization that oversees the sports to see what your options are. If you want to push it, in a less official way, you might be able to contat the parents to get their feedback about it.</p>
<p>if you don't have the support of all the parents and/or the overseeing commitee, then you might be making a bigger deal about an issue that is more just a you thing.</p>

        <p>You don’t endorse allowing children to have a brief reprieve from being stifled by symbols of pestilence even during athletic contests, which are meant to be some of children’s most joyous times? That is utterly superstitious and delusional thinking. You know many children do not even express the receptor to which sars-cov-2 binds, that outdoor transmission of viruses if it happens at all occurs on razor thin margins, and that all randomized controlled studies investigating whether masks mitigate the severity of a respiratory epidemic have been null? So even with all three of those things being true, you still want these poor children to have to behave in such an insane manner?</p>
<p>There is a primordial circiuit within your brain that has been activated which controls magical thinking, and in this case, the belief that a symbolic act of masking can extinguish a pestilence. You are conducting a religious rite. It is your human right to conduct for yourself, but stop insisting others do so, especially children.</p>
