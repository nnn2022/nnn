    <strong>Vaccine hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>I would ask on other subs but it seems everytime you criticize anything to do with the narrative then you're a conspiracy theorist science denier etc, so I'm posting here to hopefully reach out someone that is pro restriction pro vaccine etc</p>
<p>1) In the UK we have vaccinated nearly 50% of the population at 30million, this includes 99% of the vulnerable people which we was told from the start once the vulnerable are vaccinated we can return to normal, now the sponsored scientists are saying we need the whole population vaccinated because of strains, but strains will also be about if a virus mutates daily so with that logic we can never return to normal and never travel to a different country?</p>
<p>2) Why are you guys so quick to take the vaccine? There are many scientists and doctors from around the world saying it's dangerous but just because the mainstream ones are telling you it's fine therefore everything is okay? Don't you have any issues with the fact that a certain billionaire who wants to depopulate the world is heavily sponsoring these vaccines? Surely that's quite hypocritical? If someone wants the world to depopulate then the more people die the better? Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></p>

<p>People are caught up the hysteria and refuse or don't care to think for themselves. "Scientists" and governments will continue to move the goalposts for a return to normal because it benefits them. That won't stop until people realize this is all unnecessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think I buy that this is some kind of controlled depopulation thing, but I also fail to understand why I should get a rushed vaccine where long term side effects or even effectiveness is unknown for a disease that has no chance of killing me.</p>
