        <p>Given that this virus is spread by aerosols, one of the following must be true:</p>
<p>1) <em>Masks do not impact breathing.</em> This means that they also have no effect on viral transmission.</p>
<p>2) <em>Masks do have an effect on viral transmission.</em> This means that they do impact breathing.</p>
<p>3) <em>Masks do impact breathing and have no effect on viral transmission.</em> This is not a contradiction.  Masks can impact ordinary fluid flow without necessarily trapping the virus. The exhaled CO2 is eventually exchanged (together with viral particles), it just takes slightly longer. Eventually the CO2 inside the mask and the regular air outside the mask will reach equilibrium. (This statement is the one that is the most likely, based on real world data)</p>
<p>When some NPC says "wear a mask, it doesn't make a difference (to breathing)" what they are really saying is that they believe that masks don't work to reduce viral spread.</p>

        <p>C'mon man a simple google search will tell you that <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/06/26/particle-sizes/">the COVID virus is about 30 times larger than a molecule of CO2</a>.  The respiratory microdroplets that carry most of the virus are 10-100x larger than the COVID virus.</p>

        <p>https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>
<p>&rt;* A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A large randomized controlled trial with close to 8000 participants, published in October 2020 in PLOS One, found that face masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.” <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240287">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A February 2021 review by the European CDC found no significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical and medical face masks in the community. Furthermore, the European CDC advised against the use of FFP2/N95 respirators by the general public. <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A November 2020 Cochrane review found that face masks did not reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em> A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were </em><em>penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use.</em>* <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591">Source</a></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">mask policy update</a> was due not to new evidence but <a href="https://archive.ph/YVJ0Y">“political lobbying”</a></strong>: “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent).</p>
<p>&rt;    * There is increasing evidence that the novel coronavirus is transmitted, at least in indoor settings, not only by droplets but also by smaller aerosols. However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, cloth masks cannot filter out aerosols (see <a href="https://videopress.com/v/4egEyh2b">video analysis</a>): <strong>over 90% of aerosols <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">penetrate or bypass</a> the mask and fill a medium-sized room within minutes.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    * During the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/">made no difference</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;    * To date, the <strong>only randomized controlled trial (RCT) on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found no statistically significant benefit</strong> (see above). However, three major journals <a href="https://swprs.org/the-suppressed-danish-mask-study/">refused to publish</a> this study, delaying its publication by several months.</p>
<p>&rt;    * An analysis by the US CDC found that <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4">85% of people</a> infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always” (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%)</strong>. Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>German researchers found that even an N95/FFP2 mask mandate had <a href="https://twitter.com/DaFeid/status/1371448332875399168">no influence</a> on the coronavirus infection rate.</strong> Austrian researchers found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a facemask mandate in Austria had no influence on the infection rate. </p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>In the US state of Kansas, the 90 counties without mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates</strong> than the 15 counties with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/more-deception-kdhe-hid-data-to-justify-mask-mandate/">tried to manipulate</a> the official statistics and data presentation.</p>
<p>&rt;    * Contrary to common belief, studies in hospitals <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">found that</a> the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf">didn’t reduce</a> post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</p>
<p>&rt;    * German scientists found that in and on <strong>N95 (FFP2) masks</strong>, the novel coronavirus remains infectious for <a href="https://fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/forschung/forschungsprojekte/moeglichkeiten-und-grenzen-der-eigenverantwortlichen-wiederverwendung-von-ffp2-masken-im-privatgebrauch/index.php">several days</a>, <strong>much longer than on most other materials</strong>, thus <strong>significantly increasing the risk of infection</strong> by touching or reusing such masks.</p>

        <p>Well, The CDC meta-analysis study looked at influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI’s) not covid. It said in the face mask section: “Most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group”. Many studies have limitations, such as these, which is a big shame. It still shows that in preventing influenza, other methods are needed alongside face masks. Most people just don’t have experience using face masks and keeping them sterile.</p>
<p>Here’s a fun fact: a simulation study containing actual covid numbers found significant benefits in 80% of people masking vs a lockdown for all. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13553.pdf (A bit flawed but shows when masks are used correctly, they are effective)</p>
<p>One editorial (https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-7448 ) along the danish study said: “We must first emphasize that this trial does not address the first question about transmission in communities where most people wear masks and does not disprove the effectiveness of widespread mask wearing”.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>“The study examined the effect of recommending mask use, not the effect of actually wearing them. Adherence to public health recommendations is always imperfect, as it was in this study, and can differ dramatically in communities with different attitudes toward such recommendations”.</p>
<p>It further added that: </p>
<p>“This trial provides an important piece of randomized evidence as we puzzle over a contentious public health issue: the degree of personal protection that a mask wearer can expect in a setting where public health social distancing measures are in effect but other people are not wearing masks”. </p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>“The DANMASK-19 findings reinforce the importance of social distancing and hygiene measures and suggest that masks likely need to be worn by most if not all people to reduce community infection rates, which in turn will protect individuals”. </p>
<p>In conclusion, a “Important piece of the puzzle” when it comes to mask wearing, but not conclusive evidence against it. </p>
<p>The third study on the pilgrims stated in conclusion: “This trial was unable to provide conclusive evidence on facemask efficacy against viral respiratory infections most likely due to poor adherence to protocol”. </p>
<p>Funnily enough, this study was cited in the CDC meta-analysis further proving that study not conclusive. Also not conducted with covid. </p>
<p>Speaking of influenza, a study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2#Sec3 ) found that:</p>
<p>“Surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission”.</p>
<p>That same study concluded:</p>
<p>“Our findings indicate that surgical masks can efficaciously reduce the emission of influenza virus particles into the environment in respiratory droplets, but not in aerosols”. </p>
<p>The ECDC report did not recommend non-medical face masks for healthcare settings. It did however state that: “<em>Medical</em> face masks are considered to provide protection against infections transmitted by droplets”. </p>
<p>It stated that “The evidence regarding the effectiveness of medical face masks for the prevention of COVID-19 in the community is compatible with a small to moderate protective effect, but there are still significant uncertainties about the size of this effect. Evidence for the effectiveness of non-medical face masks, face shields/visors and respirators in the community is scarce and of very low certainty”. </p>
<p>Basically, wearing a mask correctly provides benefits. Even more benefits when the majority of people wear them. Again, most people just don’t use them right. Respirators and face shields don’t seem to have much effectiveness in the community. </p>
<p>Cloth masks aren’t nearly as effective as medical masks. That has been indicated by basically every single study. </p>
<p>The Cochrane review proclaimed this: ”Our confidence in these results is generally low for the subjective outcomes related to respiratory illness, but moderate for the more precisely defined laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, related to masks and N95/P2 respirators. The results might change when further evidence becomes available. Relatively low numbers of people followed the guidance about wearing masks or about hand hygiene, which may have affected the results of the studies”. </p>
<p>So not a very convincing conclusion. </p>
<p>The two professors later added: “Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection status they don't know”. </p>
<p>Most of your sources are tackling cloth masks, not surgical ones. Cloth masks don’t work as well or maybe not at all. The BMJ study you linked (twice) actually proved this: </p>
<p>“Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%”. </p>
<p>Why would SWPRS not include the full quote? I am sensing some bias here. Medical masks were actually fairly effective in those results.</p>
<p>One professional gave their expert opinion. It may be true, but generally, studies with lots of other scientists are a bit more trustworthy. The opinion seems to reflect scientific evidence, but we still need more data. </p>
<p>The WHO published a bit of a flawed study. Which is understandable, because almost every single study especially in community and healthcare settings is flawed on this topic. That is a very big problem when it comes to this debate. SWPRS seems to really think their studies are not flawed, but when it comes to evidence supporting the contrary, “No, just either discredit it (very easy) or just don’t mention it and hope people don’t check our sources”. There’s just too many variables when it comes to human behavior with masks. And a lot of variables when it comes to interpretation of ILI and influenza studies compared to studies involving covid. </p>
<p>“Various sources” are maybe not the most trustworthy. Right now, it is still up for speculation, whether the mask mandates were actually pushed by lobbyists, though it is very possible. Unverifiable information. </p>
<p>This “video analysis” is really not convincing evidence. I mean, it’s just a random guy vaping with different masks. So many things could affect the very unscientific results that he showed. </p>
<p>Again, the study was the same and advised against cloth masks, with medical masks having a reported 44% penetration rate. Cloth masks aren’t very effective. Medical ones are. </p>
<p>The 1917 pandemic? This is 100+ year old face mask technology, you’d think we have better masks nowadays. And even then, the article says people cut holes to their very inefficient 100 year old cloth masks making them absolutely useless. </p>
<p>Ah yes, the suppressed danish study which didn’t even take into account the effect of wearing masks, only recommending their usage (see above). I could very well see how this could mislead a lot of people. And it unfortunately has. Not a surprise that these big 3 journals didn’t want to publish it. </p>
<p>The CDC study had a huge p-value of 0.86 and a small sample size. The control group wore more masks. Statistically a very small difference, but a difference still worth noting. </p>
<p>And who are these “German researchers”? The actual source: A unverified twitter account posting a graph from the news site Tagesschau (there is a little icon on the bottom right). Once again, like the danish study, the graph only takes into account the mask <em>mandate</em>, not actually using them. </p>
<p>On the topic of mask mandates, a study (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818) found that ~200 000 cases were averted because of a mask mandate between March 31 and May 22nd, 2020 in 15 states and the District of Columbia. In the first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points. Not saying this study is perfect by any means, but still evidence of mask mandates having a impact. </p>
<p>Once again, just the mask mandates being measured in the article about Kansas. Some places just have more infections. Some places do not adhere to the mask mandates as well as others. Some places just generally don’t practice enough good hand hygiene and social distancing. </p>
<p>The fairly old studies measured bacterial wounds in the OR. Not covid. Not even close to covid. Hospitals have other precautions when it comes to regulating bacteria and viruses, such as positive pressure rooms, and they may be more effective than face masks. Just a few things that make this fact pretty irrelevant. </p>
<p>The German scientists demonstrated exactly why you shouldn’t reuse or touch a mask. That is basic practice when using a mask properly. I really don’t see how this is evidence against the use of face masks. A mask doesn’t neutralize covid, which isn’t a surprise. </p>
<p>So in summary, use a mask properly. Wearing a mask isn’t a replacement for social distancing or hand hygiene. But when lots of people wear them correctly, it can slow down a pandemic. </p>
<p>This is not definitive evidence against the effectiveness of proper wearing of medical face masks.</p>
<p>(This comment is just a few gripes about these arguments. Not claiming to be an expert. Just a another guy on the internet. Take this with a few grains of salt, but I still hope you appreciate my arguments, considering they make together a very long comment).</p>

        <p>I believe that what I said was this:</p>
<p>"Masks can impact ordinary fluid flow without necessarily trapping the virus. The exhaled CO2 is eventually exchanged (together with viral particles), it just takes slightly longer. Eventually the CO2 inside the mask and the regular air outside the mask will reach equilibrium."</p>
<p>So yes, both the CO2 and the virus are trapped inside for a while by the mask. The CO2 escapes and so does the virus, and is replaced by new CO2. This would mean that the mask would impact breathing (as you are breathing in CO2, but not viral transmission (as most of the virus escapes anyway)</p>
<p>Particle size is irrelevant</p>

        <p>All you did was say the size of the particles, which is, again, irrelevant to the discussion (other than that the aerosolized particles are more than small enough to fit through the mask). </p>
<p>Go ahead and argue against point 3. Even if we completely ruled in out, that leaves point 1 or point 2. </p>
<p>Any one of those 3 points above being the case would be a good enough reason to not have mask mandates</p>

        <p>Good lord you're a living breathing embodiment of the dunning-kruger effect. You clearly have no formal scientific education but seem to think that by your own intuition you've arrived at an accurate understanding of how virus particles interact with gases/filtration. It's remarkable. Nothing you said has any basis in actual science so I don't know how I'd even begin to refute it. It would be like trying to refute the Harry Potter universe</p>

        <p>I don't claim to know any of this with certainty. I presented that as ONE OF THREE possible options. </p>
<p>BTW - I feel the same way about lockdowns and masks that you feel about what I said - that lockdowns and masks have no basis in reality and that refuting them is like arguing against something completely false.

        <p>Please explain how masks can prevent an aerosolized virus from escaping when the aerosols are smaller than the holes in the mask, without impacting breathing. It's either one or the other. IT CAN'T BE BOTH. </p>

<p>By the way, "The Science" once told us that smoking wasn't hazardous to our health, that DDT was a good idea, that asbestos was a miracle substance, and that eugenics was an acceptable course of action. Clearly "The Science" doesn't always get it right</p>

        <p>No. What I'm arguing, basically, is that a mosquito can fly through a chain link fence. </p>
<p>Of course the fruit can fit in a mesh bag, if that fruit is oranges. If the fruit is blueberries, it'll fall through the holes in the mesh.</p>

<p>But most of the air your exhale doesn't go through the mask, it goes around it. Demonstrated by people in cold weather and with vapes. </p>
<p>And if it's bullshit, why during the recent heatwave in the Pacific northwest did the health authorities say not to wear masks even in close quarters with others? </p>
<p>Because it impairs your breathing, and breathing is a way of cooling the body. 
Or are the experts wrong now? I can never keep it straight. </p>

<p>Sorry, what kind of work do you do? I routinely lift heavy things for work am not obese, and without a mask have no trouble, oh and I can walk upstairs no problem. Must be nice to have a cushy job where everyone else does hard work so you can criticize them for wanting to breathe. </p>

I started to panic because I didn't want to cough in front of anyone. I started to look for an aisle with no one in it to cough. I lifted the mask for a second and it immediately went away. It came back when I put the mask back on. I thought there were chemicals on it from the manufacturing process or something. I bet CO2 was what was going on.</p>

        <p>The difference between cloth masks and real filter masks is huge. I did some painting in my garage last weekend and wore an R95 mask. Within 20 mins I had to take a break because I badly needed air.</p>

        <p>More of a cardio issue.</p>
<p>I can wear n/k95 all day at work without issue in environments that are much nastier than just a painting area.</p>
<p>The people at work that have issues wearing the masks also can't walk by the ice cream isle without breathing heavy.</p>

        <p>When the prepping movement was going on, I bought some Israeli gas masks. Covid has taught me I will never be able to breathe through that if I needed it. That's why the military has to train with them. And I have asthma. They used to sell forced air adapters for them, but I haven't been able to find them.</p>

        <p>You bring up a good point about training. I've heard of athletes training in masks deliberately to build their endurance so the blood starts carrying more oxygen. If that works for them then wearing masks is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

        <p>The only thing that this shows is that the environment directly inside of the mask is filled with CO2, which you would expect. This doesn't mean what you're breathing in is all CO2, since there are gaps in the fabric which allow air to pass through.</p>
<p>That said, I know what it feels like to do physical activity while wearing a mask like this. For me personally, it does make me feel like I can't breathe properly and creates a constant state of low-level anxiety.</p>

        <p>~1000 ppm of CO2 is not dangerous. Even 8000 is still fairly safe and not life-threatening. 5000 ppm is the OSHA  permissible limit for 8 hours. 10 000 ppm may cause drowsiness. 50 000 ppm is where things start to get really dangerous. Just really basic facts here, took only a few seconds of googling.</p>

        <p>How much stale air can that mask even trap though.  The tiniest part of his last breath is trapped in the mask, where does the rest of the air come from for his next breath... It comes from outside the mask.  The same thing happens inside your lungs, there's always some air left behind after you exhale.  This "test" is pretty goofy.</p>
