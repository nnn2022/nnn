    <strong>A personal interaction outside of the store the other day flipped my switch... And I'm feeling great.</strong>
    <p><p>I want to preface this by saying that I've been going mask free in the places that didn't care since the beginning (I am outside of Seattle, so no, it's not that easy around here). That said, I run a business, and the places I frequent during the day for supplies all "require masks" and have even seen people get confronted and denied. Myself, I've always been the "get it done" kind of guy, so any unnecessary disruption is wasted time, and I have shit to do. Throw the Bandana on, and do business, it's the "least" I can do, right?</p>
<p>So Wednesday, I was in my local hardware store, and they are well equipped, the best selection of "get it done" hardware anywhere around. They have had a strict Mask policy since July when the governor decided to be a king and mandate the BS. Early on they played the entire line (literally), limiting occupancy, even had masks for free at the door so that there was no way around it. Since, because the summer made things more lax, they have just had a sign outside saying face coverings required, with the box of free garbage just inside. Everybody I have seen has obeyed, american flag gaiters and all... My black loose fitting Bandana and all.... Fast forward, I am leaving to check out, and the guy in line in front of me has no face covering, just a confident vibe about him, I give him a nod when I get to the next register over. I ended up getting checked out first, so I waited for him outside. I asked him if he ever gets bothered, and he said "Fuck Nooooo". He went on for about ten minutes about all the BS that we discuss here, and it was fucking awesome.</p>
<p>I kinda had a moment. Meeting somebody in person who shared our views to the tee, and wasn't afraid to let his opinion rip, changed me. "If he can do it, so can I"... I haven't worn a fucking covering since, and it's been wicked for an overall confidence boost, fucking empowering.... Which is pretty sad, since its just being normal.</p>
<p>Since then it's been very easy to rationalize what's going on, like "Covid-19" being a definition for the combination of the common-cold, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 corona viruses being tested by a method that can't tell them apart from each other, causing the Covid-19 hysteria (over the common cold). </p>
<p>Take the garbage off your face, #FaceUp, and watch people look at you like a god. This is your life, not your master's. Own it.</p></p>

        <p>Ugh you’re so lucky! I guess I actually live in the town of “Ruston”, a rich suburb of north Tacoma. I’m surprised to hear you say that about Seattle though, I visit my doctor there every 3 months and not one person outside is maskless. Even wearing your mask under your nose here is a crime against humanity! My 6 year old told me that she didn’t want to wear a mask anymore in November, i told her I’d never force her. No one has said a thing to me. Maybe the fear is in my own head.</p>

        <p>I dont know but I guess in my day to day I just try to ignore what other people do. When I talk to people one on one they seem split in how they feel. I think people are split on the mask thing. I dont wear it nor do my children and I'm kinda hood so if anyone says anything I'm not afraid to put them in their place. I have heard stupid comments at the park like "the kids wear their mask at preschool." Well that's wrong too children need oxyen for their growing brains. It boggles my mind how this is not seen as an issue. Immune systems work. Some people are more concerned with fitting in than thinking for themselves. I do not associate with those kind makes for a better life.</p>
