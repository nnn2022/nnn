        <p>Do you not understand that standard vaccines go through years of testing before being approved? </p>
<p>My turn to ask a question... why do you blindly trust big pharma and the government?</p>
<p>It's amazing to me that people are suddenly so trusting of the pharmaceutical companies. Especially Pfizer:<br>
- Pfizer received the biggest fine in U.S. history as part of a $2.3 Billion plea deal with federal prosecutors for mis-promoting medicines (Bextra, Celebrex) and paying kickbacks to compliant doctors. Pfizer pleaded guilty to mis-branding the painkiller Bextra by promoting the drug for uses for which it was not approved.<br>
- In the 1990s, Pfizer was involved in defective heart valves that lead to the deaths of more than 100 people. Pfizer had deliberately misled regulators about the hazards. The company agreed to pay $10.75 Million to settle justice department charges for misleading regulators.<br>
- Pfizer paid more than $60 Million to settle a lawsuit over Rezulin, a diabetes medication that caused patients to die from acute liver failure.<br>
- In the UK, Pfizer has been fined nearly €90 Million for overcharging the NHS, the National Health Service. Pfizxer charged the taxpayer an additional €48 Million per year for what should have cost €2 million per year.<br>
- Pfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that it had bribed doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.<br>
- In 2011, a jury found Pfizer committed racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug Neurontin. Pfizer agreed to pay $142.1 Million to settle the charges.<br>
- Pfizer disclosed that it had paid nearly nearly 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals some $20 Million for speaking on Pfizer’s behalf.<br>
- In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had reached a $45 Million settlement with Pfizer to resolve charges that its subsidiaries had bribed overseas doctors and other healthcare professionals to increase foreign sales.<br>
- Pfizer was sued in a U.S. federal court for using Nigerian children as human guinea pigs, without the childrens’ parents’ consent. Pfizer paid $75 Million to settle in Nigerian court for using an experimental antibiotic, Trovan, on the children. The company paid an additional undisclosed amount in the U.S. to settle charges here. Pfizer had violated international law, including the Nuremberg Convention established after WWII, due to Nazi experiments on unwilling prisoners.<br>
- Amid widespread criticism of gouging poor countries for drugs, Pfizer pledged to give $50 million for an AIDS drug to South Africa. Later, however, Pfizer failed to honor that promise.<br>

        <p>I think the reasoning is less about fear of the actual vaccine, but the precedent that aggressively compelling people to get a vaccine and tying regaining freedoms to getting it. The messaging behind this vaccine has been so unbelievably terrible that it should cause any rational person to at least question what is going on. The obsession that people have with the vaccine is illogical and makes the whole thing feel nefarious. And then when you take into consideration that the people screaming the loudest about getting the vaccine are the same people who have aggressively pushed for the disastrous, unscientific, and objectively wrong policies like lockdowns and mask mandates, why would any rational person now trust these people's judgement? When 2 weeks to flatten the curve turns into lock yourself in your house for a year and half, force your children to wear masks to school, and bankrupt the country with trillions of dollars of printed money, until there are zero cases, how does a rational person think that just get a vaccine won't turn into if you don't get this vaccine and its annual boosters you aren't allowed to participate in society. For many, giving in now, just puts us on a path that will lead to a dark place.</p>

        <p>This. </p>
<p>It's not the vaccine itself, it's that it's the final submission to all the brainwashing, propaganda and downright lies that have come before it. </p>
<p>In my eyes, taking it is like saying I accept that all this was totally justified and worth the after effects that are conveniently swept under the rug. </p>
<p>It's accepting the new ridiculous paradigm of sick until proven innocent, the hyprocricy of concentrating on one issue while ignoring all others, and everything that made life worth while being labelled dangerous and selfish. </p>
<p>It's accepting that both government and unelected "experts" who profit the most from the restrictions, have the right to dictate what we can and cannot do from one day to the next, and even what we are allowed to hear about in regards to their decisions.</p>

        <p>There is, for now. As long as it stays that way, I think most of the "anti- science, vax, mask" people don't care. It's not anti anything, just pro-choice. Which includes reproductive choice as well, whether you agree or not is a separate discussion.</p>

        <p>I'm extremely emetophobic, so a 10-15% chance of vomiting for days is far worse to me than a 0.05% chance for my age group to die of covid.  I've already nearly killed myself twice to prevent vomiting, so the vax is a greater mortal threat to me than covid by 200%.</p>
<p>I am concerned there will be some mid-to late term side effects.   Human history has shown we've fucked up a lot on rushed solutions to our problems.  It's hubris to dismiss the chance of it happening again.  Even has recently as 1997ish we had the Dengue fever vaccine that worked just swimmingly in trials and killed 600 children with hemorrhagic dengue when implimented and had to be stopped.</p>

<p>I am saying these things are experimental. New side effects are being reported all the time. </p>
<p>I am saying COVID ain't that deadly. Yes, it will kill an obese 90 year-old chain smoker with asthma. </p>
<p>Yes, we need a vaccine for this illness. No, I don't think it's ready for mainstream deployment.</p>
<p>Add to my uncertainties -- look at how hard <em>everyone</em> is pushing for us to get it. Second class citizenship, celebrity endorsements, calls to have us ostracized from communities, our speech being censored from the web and mainstream media. <strong>It's creepy.</strong></p>

        <p>This experimental injection has already killed more people, in the few months that it's been distributed, then every other vaccine combined. 
All those other vaccines took years of study and animal testing before they were tried on a small group of humans and then distributed amoung the groups of the larger population that needed them. They used a weaker version of whatever they were vaccinating against to make those other vaccines. None of that has happened with these shots. </p>
<p>This is technology that has never been used to make a vaccine being delivered by at least one company that has never made a vaccine and has no other products at the moment. Moderna. </p>
<p>I will never take this shot. It is not a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm concerned about side effects. The technology (mRNA) actually isn't that new, but it's the first time it's seen mainstream use on humans. </p>
<p>I've heard people suffer from worsened tinnitus after getting the vaccine, I've heard of people who died after taking the vaccine, etc. </p>
<p>There's also plenty of people who have gotten the vaccine and had nothing happen to them. </p>
<p>I just don't want to get it at the current point in time. If we make it past flu season without everyone vaccinated suddenly dropping dead from some unforeseen complication I might get it. But until then I am hesitant.</p>

I don't fear it, the C19, I've survived a year through the worst.
I don't trust it, the vac, it's not tested or passed for use.
I thinks it's dangerous, my brother has had a stroke the morning after his first pf jab.
I think its risky x2, my neighbour died immediately after his az jab.</p>

        <p>I've had Covid19, had very mild symptoms and don't take medication I don't need. I'm careful of what I put into my body.</p>
<p>From all the research I've done, for my age and health profile it just isn't worth the risk. These are mostly new technologies, they've not been fully evaluated or tested. For most of them the phase 3 trials won't be over till early 2023. Maybe if I was vulnerable or at risk I'd possibly risk it but I don't need it.</p>
<p>None of the vaccines prevent transmission, the vast majority of people aren't at any risk from Covid and the drugs are experimental. I find myself equally fascinated as to why so many people actually want the vaccines?</p>
