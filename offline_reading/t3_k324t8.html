    <strong>A Life Lesson from a Doomer Mom</strong>
    <p><p>My state, Ohio, is not getting any better. And unfortunately I live in one of the very few blue counties in the state. Masks are everywhere. To give you an idea, it’s not uncommon to see small children in not just masks, but in face shields on top of wearing a mask. COVID Fearmonger is that bad overhere. It seems like as time goes on, the restrictions get worse and worse.</p>
<p>Last week it was confirmed by my school’s dommer Super Intendant that we were to go full remote yet again and my swimming practices couldn’t run at full capacity anymore. After I’ve received this information, I immediately cried. School and being around other people was the only thing keeping me happy. Now, I always have an empty feeling in my gut. </p>
<p>It was a few days after the announcement and my mom picked me up from my swim practice. She asked how I thought about the new changes, and I gave her the truth. Big mistake. She then gives me a lecture about how COVID-19 is good for my development as a teenager since it teaches me how to adapt to undesirable situations and that COVID restrictions are a great life lesson promoting tolerance. I was in shock when I heard this. How has my mom not waken up yet? How is being cooped up in my room isolated promoting positive development? To avoid further ruining my relationship with my mom, I quickly changed the subject. </p>
<p>No wonder Ohio is in the position it is in if my mom’s mindset is common among Ohioans. But thankfully, it seems as days go on, more and more people are realizing the truth to these lockdowns and masks. It’s not about the virus; it’s about control. Hopefully one day my mom realize that.</p></p>

        <p>Here is your first life lesson that you know better what you need than most adults. My heart just breaks for you to have to deal with this in your teenage years. You are very mature for your age - hopefully this hysteria will end soon. :/</p>

        <p>Also in Ohio, but I'm in my mid twenties. I live around 30 minutes to an hour south of Columbus, so most people in my neck of the woods are done with this crap, but I'm sorry to hear that you aren't so lucky. With the vaccine coming soon, hopefully people will stop being such doomers then!</p>

        <p>I think you've already learnt this lesson but will say it anyway: your parents aren't always right; they're just people like everyone else with their own flaws, vulnerabilities, holdups and prejudices.</p>
<p>Don't fall into the trap of thinking they are some perfect paragon of virtue or role model, sure they may well be loving, caring and have positive aspects you should aspire to emulate but they have negative traits as well that you should avoid integrating into your own personality.</p>

        <p>I live in Maryland, right in the Baltimore region. Same shit down here and the cult is awful. My friends screech about people being massless. Quite frankly they want to not work and rely on the government to pay them to be on a sofa. I’ll never understand, how people would be so blind to losing freedom. But they wanted it this way and they’ll gladly shit on everyone who doesn’t listen to them. It’s a struggle and I do know how it feels.</p>

        <p>I live in a suburb near Cleveland. Everyone wears a mask over here. I don’t think I’ve ever saw anyone not wear a mask since the mandate was in place. I was once denied entry in a gun store of all places because I forgot to bring a mask.</p>

        <p>There is something to be said for learning to face adversity, but there is also something to be said when people are running off of a cliff like lemmings, and creating extreme artificial adversity where none need actually exist, or at least could be a lot better if people weren't acting so panicked.</p>
<p>But we are at root social creatures, and to have this mass quarantine being forced upon us from above, by people in positions of power and responsibility listening ONLY to technocrats and billionaires, and not to half of their own constituents, is really infuriating. The one thing that helps most to get through this kind of challenge - human contact and physical connection - is being taken from us, by threats.</p>
<p>I have no answers, only sympathy.</p>

        <p>Your mom is right-this is a great lesson.  Read every statistic and fact you can and don’t get your information shoveled to you by false news outlets.  Think for yourself.  Then talk about it.</p>
<p>I would suggest reading <a href="https://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/thoreau/civil.html">Civil Disobedience</a>.  It’s about standing up to the tyranny of government and not waiting for your fellow citizens to do it for you.  Mostly in the context of slavery but the spirit still applies.</p>
