    <strong>Some ghoulish tactics being used to push injections from the looks of it</strong>
    <p><p>Saw a heavily trending post recently on a meme page (where you see propaganda snuck daily) the gist being -I'm in my early 20s, just lost my parent to Covid. Almost couldn't go on- and the way it's done, I can readily infer its purpose.  I check the poster's history out of curiosity and see that it's a new account created this year with just 4-5 posts prior, all of them being content marketing for the same brand. The worst part is feeling at a loss to call the authenticity of something like this into question (and even if true, does not change that it's manipulative), while knowing full well its purpose is to force intrusive procedures onto everyone including yourself and your own family.</p></p>

        <p>Not really hard to understand mate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These experimental vaccines all skipped animal trials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are rushed to market. Usually it's 7 to 55 years for a vaccine to get to market. These got there in 9 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently there are over 4000 COVID vaccine deaths per the CDC VAERs. They are backlogged by months and traditionally it's been under reported by 10 to 100x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The industry that wants our trust is the same one to bring us the opiod epidemic, knowingly sold HIV infected blood to Asia and Latin America, pays hundreds of millions to billions in damages every year for injury and death caused by their products, Phizer being the largest single payout in 2009 at 2.3 billion. The other available company in the US, Moderna, has never brought a vaccine to market before. This industry is constantly in court for falsifying, altering, and destroying clinical trial data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is very profitable for the industry on #4</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand it perfectly. You want to be the animal in the animal trials, have a nice time.</p>

        <p>They did simultaneous animal and Phase 1 human trials.  </p>
<p>This vaccine is based on the work the NIH was funding until 2017, wherein they were developing a GENERALIZED coronavirus vaccine (cure to the common cold).  They were able to pick up where they left off and make these more specific mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Over 4000 people have died, who also had received the shot.  None died from the shot (barring the J&amp;J/AZ blood clot issue).  Old folks got vaccinated first, did we not expect some to die??  CDC is EXTRA SAFE and examines EACH death to ensure that these deaths are not an adverse reaction the the vaccination.  And guess what!?!!!!!???  They’ve shown no causal link!</p>
<p>You’re 1. wrong, 2. wrong, 3. wrong, and 4. Big Pharma sucks, let’s legislate away from corporatist oligarchy, yes, but broad criticisms are hardly relevant, and 5. Again, nothing to do with this specific vaccine....</p>

        <p>Please show me a passing animal trial for Moderna (who have never brought a vaccine to market before), Phizer, J&amp;J, or Astrazenca for COVID. </p>
<p>You don't reformulate and then not do animal trials or phase I and phase two human trials. Not to mention there are no passing animal or human trials regarding your generalized common cold vaccine. Once again, you will not be able to produce them, and even if you could, once you reformulate, its a moot point.</p>
<p>So unless you can show me COVID animal trials, which you cant. not wrong on 1.</p>
<p>regarding number 2. Again, the old common cold vaccine never came close to passing trials. Then it was reformulated for COVID. Reformulation always starts with new animal trials. </p>
<p>So I'm totally right on number 2.</p>
<p>The CDC is a hot mess and have mismanaged the VAERS since its inception. Odd that 4000 people who got the shot and died, its not the shot, yet get tested with a shitty inaccurate PCR test and test positive then in the next 30 days die of a heart attack, stroke, motorcycle accident (not kidding), and its definitely the Rona!</p>
<p>In regards to #3, I am wrong, its absolutely MUCH more that 4000 considering the VAERS historically under reports at 10 to 100x</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As long as we are not legislating from corporatists oligarchy towards a marxist oligarchy then we agree on 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course profits have to do with almost everything regarding these vaccines. Odd that J&amp;J and Astrazeneca were non profit and they were the ones pulled. Moderna and Phizer are all about the profits. the NIH ,which is lead by Fauci, has over 100 medical patents, which some are being applied to these "vaccines"</p>

        <p>“Immunization of non-human primates (rhesus macaques) with BNT162b2, a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, resulted in strong anti-viral effects against an infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge.”</p>
<pre><code> “BNT162b2 immunization prevented lung infection in 100% of the SARS-CoV-2 challenged rhesus macaques, with no viral RNA detected in the lower respiratory tract of immunized and challenged animals. The BNT162b2 vaccination also cleared the nose of detectable viral RNA in 100% of the SARS-CoV-2 challenged rhesus macaques within 3 days after the infection
</code></pre>
<p>The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate induced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in rhesus macaques, pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies in mice, and strong, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice and macaques
NEW YORK &amp; MAINZ, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced preliminary preclinical data in mouse and non-human primate models from their BNT162b2 mRNA-based vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. In a non-human primate preclinical study, immunization with the BNT162b2, a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) candidate, protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The manuscript describing these preclinical data is available on a preprint server at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.280818v1 and is concurrently undergoing scientific peer-review for potential publication.”</p>
<p>Do you need it any more spelled out?  Oh, and guess how the peer review is going????  That’s right, better than initials.  Pfizer&amp;Moderna are as safe as they come.</p>

        <p>Here’s an article from March 2020 when they’re were doing the SIMULTANEOUS STAGE I HUMAN AND ANIMAL TESTING. </p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01092-3</p>
<p>They exist.  They did them.  They went great, and we moved on.  You’re stuck in conspiracy-land where nothing has to make sense.  </p>
<p>They made these off of 50 years of research, you wing-nut.  </p>

        <p>If you actually read your article one of the main critics is the data on the trials was not released.</p>
<p>There 👏are 👏no 👏 completed 👏 animal 👏 trials.</p>
<p>Once again PROVE ME WRONG and so me a completed animal trial for a COVID Vaccine showing both safety and efficacy. </p>
<p>It's going to be a looooooong night hunting for something that doesn't exist </p>
<p>That makes you the wing nut mate. </p>
<p>If they completed animal and human trials this wouldn't even be that hard. You would point me towards the FDA permanent license for them. </p>
<p>So you can show me the permnenat FDA license or you can show me a completed animal trial where safety and efficacy were proven.</p>
<p>But you can't. All you got is an article that weakens your position.</p>
<p>And once again you are showing data for the common cold vaccine. That didn't pass trials and that isnt licensed.</p>
<p>This is how it works. You come up with the formula. Animal trials. These fail always round 1. Reformulate. Animal Trials. If by miracle you show efficacy and safety in your second round of animal trials you go to human phase I. This rarely passes the first time. The. You reformulate. Because you reformulated, guess what? Back to animal trials. Then to human if phase I if that passed. Then to human phase two if you are lucky. Then if you have safety and efficacy the FDA grants you a license. You then don't release it to the entire world. A small oiic release. Then if that goes well out of the lab environment then it becomes widely available.</p>
<p>These do not have a successful animal trial proving safety and efficacy. They only have a kinda of sort rushed half assed phase 1 human trial. Half assed because you don't go to phase 1 without a successful animal trial, and you don't rush it.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong, worth it it COVID had an infected mortality rate of 5% where with killed the old and the young in equal numbers </p>
<p>It's 99.7% survivable. Far more if you are not at your life expectancy or beyond. Also the CDC TODAY just updated their data. The average person who dies of COVID has FOUR comorbibities.</p>
<p>Donyoy know how unhealthy you are if you have 4 comorbibities? An example, you are obese, have cancer, type two diabetic, with emphysema.</p>
<p>The only person stuck in conspiracy land is you.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, science takes time? Ya got me.  The initial trials are the only ones.  Like. That’s still months of research, and the peer review is months more.   </p>
<p>They’re doing the work, and the product (not J&amp;J/Az) is sound science.  Again, that they’ve been doing these thing for OVER AND OVER for years.  The “reformulations” don’t necessitate 50 or even 1 years worth of new research.  They’re know factors!!  As we work with them more, our turnaround will improve.  Just like there are annual flu shots.  Doesn’t take 7-50 years to make those each time, it’s almost like CORONAVIRUSES are super fucking common and we saw this coming a mile away!!  Our smashing good luck that the real pandemic hit right after some nationalistic government-dismantling fuckwads had a hold on our response systems (what remained after 2017).</p>
