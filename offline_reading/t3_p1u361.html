    <strong>Feeling really trapped</strong>
    <p><p>Left my last job a few months ago for many reasons, this is the first period I’ve been unemployed in almost 5 years, I have several job opportunities and one with great pay but they’re all asking if I’m vaccinated and I don’t really know what to do. I’m in New England so most of the higher paying jobs require vaccination, I’ve started a small side business but it’s been difficult to break into the market so I’m really strapped for cash.</p>
<p>Not sure what my best option is here, wanted to hear some thoughts</p></p>

        <p>Owning your own business is honestly the best way out. Not just to avoid the vaccine but to avoid most of the problems of working for others. I have started several businesses. They are always tough in the beginning but get better after a few years. Think very carefully in the beginning about whether or not your business model is sustainable and only start something with high profit margins in case of any unforeseen difficulties. Keep in mind where the economy is heading because every downturn has both problems and opportunities. Maybe consider buying cryptocurrency. It may peak in the next two months....</p>

        <p>There will be a period of time when life is going to be difficult for you.  In time, the effects of these vaccines will become more well known. Elections will happen and bad guys will get thrown out (to be replaced by more bad guys but with a different agenda, one that probably doesn't include coercive vaccination and passports.)</p>
<p>If you can hold out long enough, you will be rewarded with your health. We are already seeing vaccinated people come down with a bad respiratory virus in the middle of summer. Just think how bad it's going to be in the fall &amp; winter. (!)</p>
<p>You may be able to band together with other unvaccinated, to pool resources... Or maybe you have a sympathetic vaccinated friend or family member.</p>
<p>This is a very difficult situation and I'm sorry you're going through it. </p>
<p>I'm not a religious guy, but this whole thing sure feels like a "test." I firmly believe that those of us who are able to resist, by any means necessary, will be rewarded on the other side as we keep our health.</p>
<p>Remember when Biden said, "If we don't do something now, every hospital bed will be filled with Alzheimers patients in 15 years!" That was at the end of May.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, the FDA passed the first new Alzheimers drug in 18 years. Not a single person on the panel voted to approve it, and 3 stepped down in protest. (!)</p>
<p>Now look at pharmaceutical sales and you'll notice that not only are they selling vaccines, they are making a fortune from drugs that just so happen to treat side effects from vaccines.</p>
<p>Put all this together and I think these vaccines are our greatest threat...  But in the short term, dodging the coercion is going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>Stay strong, and always remember that humans before us went through much, much harder times... So that ability to survive is within you, or else you wouldn't be here.</p>
