    <p><p>TLDR: We now know why \~50% of FDA employees are C19 anti-vaxxers - they have seen how corrupt the 'approval" process actually is!  </p>
<p>"Approval" Date: 7 June 2021  </p>
<p>BigPharma Co: Biogen</p>
<p>Drug: Aduhelm</p>
<p>Disease: Alzheimer's</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Wall Street Reaction: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-rule-controversial-biogen-alzheimers-drug-2021-06-07/">U.S. approval of Biogen Alzheimer's drug sends shares soaring, hailed as 'big day" for patients</a></p>
<p>FDA Decision: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease">FDA’s Decision to Approve New Treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease</a>  </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Accelerated Approval</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The FDA instituted its Accelerated Approval Program to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet medical need.  Approval is based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint (in this case reduction of amyloid plaque in the brain).  A surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. The use of a surrogate endpoint can considerably shorten the time required prior to receiving FDA approval.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Drug companies are required to conduct post-approval studies to verify the anticipated clinical benefit. These studies are known as phase 4 confirmatory trials. If the confirmatory trial does not verify the drug’s anticipated clinical benefit, FDA has regulatory procedures in place that could lead to removing the drug from the market. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>The Devastation of Alzheimer’s Disease</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;With all this said, we are extremely aware of the gradual and cumulative devastation that Alzheimer’s disease causes, as patients lose their memory and cognitive functioning over time. In late-stage disease, people can no longer hold a conversation or respond to their environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer’s disease lives four to eight years after diagnosis, but some patients can live up to 20 years with the disease. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The need for treatments is urgent: right now, more than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease and this number is expected to grow as the population ages. Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Although the Aduhelm data are complicated with respect to its clinical benefits, FDA has determined that there is substantial evidence that Aduhelm reduces amyloid beta plaques in the brain and that the reduction in these plaques is reasonably likely to predict important benefits to patients.  As a result of FDA’s approval of Aduhelm, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have an important and critical new treatment to help combat this disease.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;FDA will continue to monitor Aduhelm as it reaches the market and ultimately the patient’s bedside. Additionally, FDA is requiring Biogen to conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit. If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market. But hopefully, we will see further evidence of benefit in the clinical trial and as greater numbers of people receive Aduhelm. As an agency, we will also continue to work to foster drug development for this catastrophic disease.</p>
<h1>What ACTUALLY happened:</h1>
<p>Credentials of the 3  Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee members:</p>
<p>a)   <strong>Dr. Aaron Kesselheim</strong> -  Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Program on Regulation, Therapeutics, and Law [Director] (FDA CV: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/138647/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/138647/download</a>)</p>
<p>He published a paper in March 2021 in which he and two other members (who did not quit) exposed the flaws in the drug and questioned the self-reported data supplied by Biogen.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2778191">Evaluation of Aducanumab for Alzheimer Disease Scientific Evidence and Regulatory Review Involving Efficacy, Safety, and Futility</a></p>
<p>b) <strong>Dr. David Knopman</strong> - Neurologist at Mayo Clinic (FDA CV: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/115341/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/115341/download</a>)   </p>
<p>c) <strong>Dr. Joel Perlmutter</strong> - Neurologist at  Washington University in St. Louis  (FDA CV: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/96384/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/96384/download</a>)</p>
<h1>KICKER: The drug was approved despite ZERO of the 11 Advisory Committee members voting to approve it. TEN members REJECTED its approval and ONE (Knopman) was recused as he had publicly disclosed his view on the drug.</h1>
<p>As the NPR reported, (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/11/1005567149/3-experts-have-resigned-from-an-fda-committee-over-alzheimers-drug-approval">LINK</a>)</p>
<p>&rt; The FDA acknowledged the controversy and attention the drug's approval has garnered. The agency "concluded that the benefits of Aduhelm for patients with Alzheimer's disease outweighed the risks of the therapy," Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement this week.   </p>
<p>Those wanting to read Kesselheim's "I Am Burning All Bridges" resignation e-mail, here it is: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3jKN4GWYAUGj9U.png">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3jKN4GWYAUGj9U.png</a>  </p>
<p>Nature reports that this decision is going to set the research community 10-20 years. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01546-2">Nature: Landmark Alzheimer’s drug approval confounds research community</a>  </p>

        <p>Whilst I am 100% anti-vaxx and have spent no time looking at the number of vaxxes that are not approved, I can think of Sanofi-Pasteur's Dengvaxia dengue fever vaxx that caused deaths in the Philippines between 2017 and 2018. The country ended the trials and sent many people to jail.</p>

        <p>Yeah there's lots, you generally don't hear about them, but they either aren't effective enough or there are serious rare side effects. Most of the time something makes it through three years of trials because it's pretty good. Lots of things show very little promise in human subjects and are discontinued after year 1</p>

        <p>I mean hey - I am all for 'fast tracking' experimental medicine if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patient outcomes for the illness are terrible and have no real treatment (Alzheimer's)</li>
<li>They don't have plans to force the medication on people in order for them to live their daily lives. Keep it voluntary, and inform of the risks - if you were diagnosed with Alzheimer's (for example) and starting to decline, you would want as many options as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I don't believe that these companies ever do real science when studying their own drugs for FDA approval. I think that sadly, science has become so corrupted with profit that bias is built into these studies by design, and covered up where possible to try to get the best outcome for the company. That is the issue. And then these studies are being published in journals where real science also is published, so the two get conflated. It is so complicated unraveling it all would take longer than understanding the papers themselves...</p>
