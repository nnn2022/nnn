    <strong>How does everyone cope knowing what’s happening?</strong>
    <p><p>I know that many are suffering due to restrictions, myself included, but the added layer of feeling isolated in objectivity further establishes the sense of isolation.</p>
<p>I have continually been a person of empirical evidence to reinforce my views and like many of you it’s becoming unbearable knowing that so many are refusing to even entertain an objective fact.</p>
<p>I was in such a good place before this and now it feels like I’m drowning knowing that life has essentially peaked.</p>
<p>If anyone has any advice on just finding even a glimmer of hope going forward, I would definitely appreciate your help.</p></p>

        <p>I heard this story in a buddhist talk before, I think it applies to this.</p>
<p>"A farmer and his son had a beloved stallion who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild mares back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out, “Your horse has returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the mares and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The villagers cried, “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all the able-bodied boys for the army. They did not take the farmer’s son, still recovering from his injury. Friends shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck!” To which the farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>The moral of this story, is, of course, that no event, in and of itself, can truly be judged as good or bad, lucky or unlucky, fortunate or unfortunate, but that only time will tell the whole story. Additionally, no one really lives long enough to find out the ‘whole story,’ so it could be considered a great waste of time to judge minor inconveniences as misfortunes or to invest tons of energy into things that look outstanding on the surface, but may not pay off in the end.</p>
<p>The wiser thing, then, is to live life in moderation, keeping as even a temperament as possible, taking all things in stride, whether they originally appear to be ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Life is much more comfortable and comforting if we merely accept what we’re given and make the best of our life circumstances. Rather than always having to pass judgement on things and declare them as good or bad, it would be better to just sit back and say, “It will be interesting to see what happens.”"</p>

        <p>i recommend sitting 5 mins every morning and night, really helps keep me centered.  dont have to DO anything, just sit in silence, maybe think of some positive things or pray (in your mind), if you believe in god.  the point is the silence and not being caught up in your thoughts.</p>

        <p>I can start with community since that was a reference but the left is quicker to excommunicate than the right for frivolous actions yet hypocritical when it comes to their morals.  The hyperbolic side of the left, cancel culture, has transformed the base of social capital from sturdy to fragile which is reinforced furthermore by a book titled "Bowling Alone" by Robert Putnam.  </p>
<p>They even sabotage themselves by excommunicating their own due to past actions/comments that are dug up usually by their opposition knowing the target will be either exiled or forced to resign rather than letting them explain their side or at least accept the fact that people change as do the times.  </p>
<p>Yet while all of this is happening, those to judge are also ridden in their own hypocrisy.  Biden was the major proposer in coining the term "Superpredators" and also legislation towards them and almost all of the democrats were anti gay marriage at some point.  </p>
<p>That's not to say that Republicans don't have their own issues because they are certainly just as guilty in the realm of bureaucratic BS.  </p>
<p>With that said, the Democrats are further expanding government reach and taking away greater freedoms than the Republicans right now so it's a choice of the enemy you know versus the enemy you don't.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ... well first of all i have no idea what half of that means, so im probably not the right guy to debate with, but i'll try my best. I think there are a few points in there that i agree with. But i dont think that for example the cancel culture is caused by the left in particular, sure they might have played a major role in it, but it didnt just come from them.</p>
<p>My real problem with the right is how, in my mind, people like Trump are gaining, by blaming everything on the democrats. By using fox news for example, he can create a web of lies which lots of people are falling for.</p>
<p>And plus, i think the left have more good things to it as well, the left are a lot more focused on problems like climate change, which i personally see as pretty much the biggest problem at the moment. While lots of right wing people are climate change deniers.</p>
<p>Lastly i think that a lot of people in this sub have got their imformation through half an hour of googling, although im sure that there are a few truthful things here too which have actually been thoroughly researched.</p>
<p>So all in all, i think the right aren't all bad, and the left are certainly not perfect, but they have a lot of things that i agree with, which is why they're my favourite choice. So yeah... thats my opinion.</p>

        <p>So I'll preface this with a few things:<br>
1. I have never voted for Trump</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am an avid environmentalist and agree with you on climate change </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree that some people in this sub (much like any other) fall in line with the TLDR headline aggregators</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But here is where we may differ.  Climate change, equality, police reform...all areas I can get behind but right now we are living in a very dangerous time when it comes to your rights as a human.</p>
<p>The Democratic party which are known as "liberals" are pushing "illiberal democracy" and justifying it through seemingly benevolent ideals.  Emergency powers in the name of preserving peace and equality have consecutively resulted in an overreach of power.</p>
<p>This has happened a number of times throughout the world and the WHO even warned of the rise of this type of power in the name of safety from the pandemic.  </p>
<p>We're allowing factual things to be censored in the name of "disinformation," curfews and lockdowns to be enforced through violence, a "vaccine" to be essentially forced into our bodies when it doesn't have full FDA approval nor has been properly tested, and willingly not questioning anything because for the first time we trust in the government to be altruistic and benevolent?</p>
