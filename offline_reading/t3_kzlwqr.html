    <strong>I think 'COVID-19 asymptomatics' are an invention to spread fear.</strong>
    <p><p>We all know PCR tests can't tell shit about your 'COVID-19-POSITIVE' status. People who had a cold one month ago may be tested positive because of residues of a dead virus still lying in there.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a chance you could be pre-symptomatic, but these tests still can't tell you that for sure.</p>
<p>And besides, am I the only one who thinks it's a catastrophic long-term stance to assume everybody in sight <em>may be</em> pre-symptomatic?</p></p>

        <p>Yes. We’ve completely replaced the word “heathy”. Asymptomatic is another world for HEALTHY! And now all the sudden everyone is suspect when we change the language. Healthy people breathing oxygen is now killing everyone. Convincing healthy people that they are sick or a threat to others. It’s criminal what we’ve done.</p>

        <p>No, it's much more simple than that.</p>
<p>Covid-19 is the "Cold", it's the disease brought on by the SARS-Cov-2 virus.</p>
<p>When a PCR test tests "positive", it simply is recognizing "parts" (any part of the RNA) of the virus, and that results in a positive. That's why you can test positive, yet be asymptomatic. Because even if you have SARS-Cov-2 in your system, it doesn't mean you have Covid-19.</p>
<p>The "ScIeNCe™" is saying that because you have anything in your system that can remotely be confused with SARS-Cov-2, you're completely able to pass it on to another individual (whether or not their system would even react to it)...  When in reality, years of real science say it's very unlikely you pass a respiratory virus to other individuals if you're asymptomatic.</p>
<p>It's SAFETY FIRST!!!! to the most extreme end of the spectrum, and it's on purpose.... For obvious reasons.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic transmission is the reason why everything has been so overblown. If only symptomatic people are spreading the virus, then the guidance given to the general public is much more simple; if you feel sick stay home. The fearmongering over asymptomatic spread is why we have mask mandates and arbitrary restrictions on capacity limits and what is and isn’t “essential.”</p>

        <p>It's likely this thing called post viral fatigue syndrome. It's really rare and has been found to happen after other viruses such as flu. But the rare case is enough to cause a panic, apparently.</p>

        <p>Meta-analysis showed that a truly asymptomatic but PCR positive person only had a 0.7% chance of transmitting the virus to someone living in their own household. These people just aren’t contributing significantly to the spread.</p>

        <p>You nailed it on the head.  The only justifiable rationale for using such a sensitive test is to detect covid in the pre-symptomatic stage.  But the economic fall out and hysteria and personal repercussions to all the people who test positive but are not infectious but are told to isolate anyway and then have contract tracing done based on who they had contact with in the last 14 days far outweighs the benefits.  It outweighs the benefits by so much that only insane people or people with an agenda woulda continue to do and encourage it.</p>

        <p>I think so too. Really, the asymptomatic claims are the most insidious of all. If not for that, people that feel sick either stay home or go to the hospital. With the 2 week asymptomatic claim, everyone treats everyone else as a potential super spreader and it causes all the lockdowns, closures, and people power tripping towards one another</p>

        <p>The term asymptomatic is used to eradicate the dichotomy between the healthy and the sick such that the media and politicians can maintain control and restrictions over people's lives. You are expected to act as though you could be sick even when you know you are healthy. As far as the state is concerned, there is no moment in time when you are healthy and therefore must abide by their wonderful restrictions that strip you of your humanity.</p>

        <p>The two people where I work that know they had it (I've brought them up before), got tested because they "felt tired". They self-quarantined for ten days. When they got back, they told us that they just felt tired and slept more than usual. That's it.</p>
<p>I'm a cook. I'm 41 years old. I wake up tired. For me, being tired wouldn't be a 'symptom', even if it was a 'symptom', because I'm always tired. I may have had it, and been 'asymptomatic', simply because I didn't recognize the symptoms as being from the coof.</p>

        <p>Look, I'm sure most people who spread covid think they're asymptomatic while they're spreading it. Either because they are, or because they coughed once that day and assumed it was because of allergies, or felt tired and assumed it was because of not enough sleep. The kind of symptoms that you notice for one second and then forget about because they don't really disrupt your life. </p>
<p>But in the absence of testing that's accurate, free, and able to be done constantly, none of which we have, it just makes no sense for everyone to act like "oh no what if I'm sick" when they feel fine. It just makes people neurotic. What makes sense is for people to make risk decisions based on their own vulnerability to dying of covid, since you generally have a better idea of whether you have diabetes or lung disease than of whether that scratchy throat is due to the Rona or to dry winter air.</p>

        <p>&rt;  People who had a cold one month ago may be tested positive </p>
<p>Cans of Coca-Cola have tested positive. </p>
<p>I think the whole asymptomatic and "aerosol" spreading concept is an explanation of an observed fact.  You have a random testing of people with no symptoms.  Some test positive.  You contact trace those people and gosh, guess what, some of them test positive with no symptoms either.  Asymptomatic spread is the only way to explain that.</p>
<p>Or a test with a significant false positive rate such as might happen with a PCR test using cycle rate of 40-50.  But it can't be that.</p>
