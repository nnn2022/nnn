    <strong>Are you an extremist?</strong>
    <p><p>Have you found yourself questioning the mainstream narrative lately? Perhaps you've found that a disingenuous approach to life is unsatisfactory? Maybe you feel isolated for paying too much attention.</p>
<p>I have bad news for you: you may be an extremist.</p>
<p>Please don't panic yet! It's okay! Take deep breathes and keep reading.</p>
<p>Below is a detailed explanation of extremism in 2021 which you can use as a personal test. The explanation will include the many actions that extremists take to undermine society as a whole. The explanation will start at the top of the extremism hole, and will slowly descend into the depths of depravity and horror which radicals pride themselves on. If you identify with any of the actions, ideologies, or practices explained in this test, please fully explain yourself in the comments to repent and receive necessary criticism and re-education.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the internal focal points of extremists. There are three major internal focal points with many subcategories.</p>
<p>-Body-</p>
<p>Extremists take care of their bodies on a borderline maniacal scale. They hold themselves to "high standards" of "health and happiness". They reject the logical soundness of health at every size, citing stats such as "42.5%" and "72%". Do not look up these percentages in relation to slurs such as "obese" and "overweight" as this may lead to radicalization. Extremists can commonly be identified by supposedly athletic activities such as:</p>
<p>-weightlifting</p>
<p>-cardio</p>
<p>-sports</p>
<p>-calisthenics</p>
<p>-HIIT</p>
<p>-General fitness</p>
<p>Extremists' obsession with physical appearance also extends into toxic diet culture. Warning signs include:</p>
<p>-Ketogenic diets</p>
<p>-Carnivore diets</p>
<p>-Fasting for "health" or "spirituality</p>
<p>-Veganism</p>
<p>-Paleo diets</p>
<p>-Abstinence from "junk" food</p>
<p>-CICO</p>
<p>-Portion control</p>
<p>Extremists also have a penchant for drawing others into their circles of toxic body behaviors. Such as forming workout groups or encouraging friends to have healthier sleep schedules. Be aware at all times of possible indoctrination attempts.</p>
<p>-mind- </p>
<p>The second internal focal point of extremists is the mind. Extremists pride themselves on their extremely degraded brains. They regularly advocate for "expansion of knowledge" and tend to avoid recommended media brain cleanings. Points of concern include:</p>
<p>-Reading</p>
<p>-Limiting social media</p>
<p>-Refusing drugs</p>
<p>-Learning trades, sciences, schools of thought, and "intellectual pursuits"</p>
<p>-Curiosity</p>
<p>-Thinking "critically"</p>
<p>-Spirit-</p>
<p>Extremists are also heavily concerned with their spiritual health. It is important to note that not all extremists are spiritually inclined, however, many who claim to be "non-spiritual" or "atheist" (normal) will still find solace in archaic practices such as stoicism, mindfulness, philosophy, yoga, or other such trivial pursuits. Religion is a large red flag. It is important to watch for extremists who study religions and religious figures such as Jesus, Krishna, or Buddha for "wisdom". Extremists who are spiritually potent are especially dangerous and should be avoided lest they spread dogmatic thinking such as "love thy neighbor".</p>
<p>Now, as a good, state-fearing socialite, you may be thinking "will it ever end!". I know that the horrific, savage practices of extremists are hard to even read about, but it is important to know signs in order to correctly identify and report radicalism. The internal practices lead to a larger disdain and dissent for modern society through the propagation of dangerous beliefs. The following list is of known terrorist movements with brief descriptions.</p>
<p>-Advocates for freedom: More like freedumb. These are the people who wear two masks instead of three when indoors. They've refused the 70th booster shot and are prolonging our return to normal. Before their comments are removed, they protest over "free speech" and "the 1st amendment". Their cries for the adoption of individual thinking are extremely threatening.</p>
<p>-Naturalists: Naturalists attempt to avoid the good, state mandated nutrition which has allowed our society to thrive and grow larger. Not only do they endlessly quest for "organic" food, they also avoid completely safe and efficient chemicals in sunscreen, soap, deodorant, tap water, and fast food among others. Naturalists claim that their bodies can take care of them, which our fact checkers have determined to be mostly false.</p>
<p>-Financial Independence: Does anyone else feel the need to barf? Advocates for financial independence do absurd things such as saving money, investing, and learning about fiscal responsibility. They attempt to posit that even though they haven't bought the Iphone27XXX, they "aren't actually poor or a hobo thank you very much" (Fact check: Entirely False). Even worse are the disgusting beings who are okay with the idea of being poor or even homeless because they don't place importance on "bs materialism". Wtf.</p>
<p>-Anti-consumerists: Anti-consumerists are like financial independents except they just hate society instead. They refuse to support the economy through buying necessary products such as the new Karl Marx funko pop. They hate advertisement, and generally wish to be 'left to live their own life'. Can you imagine??????</p>
<p>-Sexual Purists: These are the lowest of the low degenerate extremists. This group adamantly refuses to support their own sexual health and instead do crazy things such as masturbating in reasonable amounts or not at all. They claim that porn is "an addiction", "sexist", or "generally disastrous for human health". They display faulty evidence through cringey meme attempts such as this one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n01zo94Fl9Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n01zo94Fl9Y</a> (TW: Biased and anti-society). They dispute proven studies on prostate cancer causation through abstinence from masturbation, and try to even state that celibacy is beneficial for health in many ways. They congregate in infested communities such as r/NoFap and r/Semenretention to spread false, anecdotal "evidence" in an attempt to completely debase our values. Avoid these scum at all cost.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That about wraps it up for the extremism test. Are you an extremist? Did I miss any extremist groups? Repent for your sins or highlight other dangerous groups in the comments.</p></p>
