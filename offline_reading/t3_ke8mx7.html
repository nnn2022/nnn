    <strong>How? [Serious]</strong>
    <p><p>Hi. I wholeheartedly believe the Coronavirus pandemic is a real non-human caused or exaggerated pandemic. Before I get downvoted I’d actually really like to have a civil discussion on your viewpoints to clarify things for me. </p>
<p>Browsing the posts in this sub, I’ve seen that the consensus (and I could be wrong about this) is that the governments of the world are in some way influencing the virus or exaggerating its effect, for the purpose of gaining more control over us.</p>
<p>My question to all of you is How? In or see for governments to pull this off, it would require the active consent and participation of every major political power and even smaller countries governments too, which to me seems inconceivable. </p>
<p>If you have any questions for me I’ll happily answer them.</p>
<p>For the record, I won’t be responding nor caring about any comments directly insulting me. It’s unhelpful to the discussion and while you may think you gain cool points it mostly makes you look stupid.</p></p>

        <p>It is human-caused, not in the sense that the virus is lab-made and governments knew from the start they'd come up with the most destructive responses ever (they didn't: headlines were anti-lockdown as recently as April). It's human-caused in the sense that, despite knowing pandemics occur with regularity and of the risk of coronaviruses for decades now (SARS and MERS...), governments chose to do <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>Worse than nothing. In fact, preparations they made - minimal - were steamrolled by this new lockdown orthodoxy. We all become lunatics in summer, because 'The Science' changed one day in spring. That was a willful, human decision made in ignorance and panic, sustained by PR and behavioural psychologists. The millions who will die due to it - ask the World Food Programme... - will not die naturally, but due to human malpratice, malice, and error.</p>

        <p>Yes. It would take cooperation of just about all of the modern world. 
The big corporations and banks that buy influence in the news and government have stakes in virtually every country.</p>
<p>The banks of the world are just about all connected. The oil and vaccine industries can both be traced back to a small amount of people.(see Bill Gates being connected to just about all vaccines)</p>

        <p>The first rule of power is to not be known. There are less than 100 people that in effect rule the entire world. </p>
<p>You can buy a $1000.00 plate of food to eat in the same room with a presidential candidate. How much influence does that $1000.00 get you?</p>
<p>A politician will take $25,000 from one guy who wants to paint the courthouse blue. 3 days later he will accept $50,000 from another guy who wants to paint the courthouse red.</p>
<p>The people who rule the world have enough money to inflluence from the top down..it doesn't require cooperation from thousands.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is a scapegoat. I even doubt, he, Buffet, or Bezos are the richest men in the world.  Most likely we don't know who they are.</p>

        <p>I can rather easily show that this is all exaggerated. Don't believe me? Look at this:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/VoidSurf1/status/1313781479172964357</p>
<p>If you want to know what deaths were like after August, you can see that here:</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/</p>
<p>You may yet have some additional challenges or questions. I can answer them. Go ahead, try me.</p>
<p>So why are the governments doing this? How are they all coordinating? I don't know for sure, but they simply <strong>are</strong> doing it. I just showed you. Anything else is speculation, and I do speculate, but who really knows? Probably nobody will ever know for sure.</p>

        <p>The elites don’t need to convince everyone to actively lie. They simply have to get everyone to believe in “the science” and then everyone follows suit thinking they are doing the right thing. As for the politicians, who knows exactly how they operate but it’s obvious they know it is bullshit by the way they act. Every single one of these tyrannical politicians ignores their own lockdown rules. They are supposedly the ones with the most access to the most accurate and up-to-date information about the virus. If they truly thought this was a deadly pandemic, why would they ignore the rules that are supposedly going to be the only thing that can stop the virus from killing them and their families?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the non-aggressive response! I didn’t really know what to expect. So you’re saying there is an elite group of people controlling these governmental figures to make this happen? I have the same question then. How? It would take an unimaginable effort to orchestrate the election of about all of the political leaders of the world, including large governmental sections such as congress or parliament.</p>

        <p>I'm not a big believer in one-ruling-cabal-type theories, but the thinking is simple: politicians rely on corporate, NGO, and media investment to a) get elected, b) carry out policies, and c) get positive public attention. Corporations, NGOs, and media are largely owned and operated by the world's three thousand or so billionaires. The 'choice' the public get is therefore pre-filtered and information we receive selective. So, the three thousand or so billionaires are calling all the shots. We shoot, but it's like the guy who fires the starting pistol at a race: all eyes are on him, there's a lot of fanfare, but no-one thinks he owns the race track or chooses the competitors.</p>
<p>It's easy to jump to 'one ruling cabal' theories because the number of billionaires is so small. I don't believe in them because the number of people <em>around</em> those billionaires executing their influence is very large, and there are multiple centres of intrigue: the billionaires, their stakeholders, and public officials. These don't always agree and sometimes they spar. But it is a very small club, and you aren't in it.</p>

        <p>I’m of similar mind, not necessarily believing in the theory of the world governments conspiring and coordinating together. My belief is that they end up in concert mainly because they influence each other and they copy each other, and also the primary corporations at the top of the chain control them so much, because of their money they can control the media and politics the way they want, and those corporations tend to all want the same things even if they aren’t conspiring together.</p>

        <p>It's easier to understand when you look back in history and see it was a slow creep to get to where they are now. It starts with controlling the money supply in Europe and making people like Churchill spend way too much so he has to borrow money from you. Little stuff like that. Federal Reserve being implemented in the US made them control the US money supply, meaning they began controlling the politicians one by one.</p>

        <p>look into the World Bank, IMF and the term "quantitative easing". Remember that deficit is not the same as debt. The reason why this is happening everywhere is because of centralized banking. It really has very little to do with the actual virus. (which does exist). This is just the opportune disaster needed to further the agenda of the mega wealthy, and no i am not talking about Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. I am talking about much wealthier people than them.

        <p>Power and money corrupt those who obtain it. When an opportunity presents itself for those with power and money to gain even more, they take it. I don't know all the fine details but it's getting harder to believe this is <em>not</em> coordinated.</p>
<p>Think about it. Remember it was just two weeks to slow the spread? Yet every store spent considerable money on plastic barriers and signs. Why would they do that for something that was supposed to last two weeks? The people at the top have known since the beginning this would be longterm, but they knew the general population would never agree to it if they knew the truth, so instead they dangle a carrot in front of all of us, and then blame us when we don't "behave."</p>
<p>I grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household. When this all began, I remember distinctly feeling like I was a child again, in the corner, terrified. This is abuse, plain and simple.</p>

        <p>I've never trusted conspiracy theories and never thought the government was out to get or control us. I guess I was naive. I thought people were being ridiculous about guns here in the US. They thought school shootings were fabricated to take our guns and it made me sick to my stomach to watch them make fun of school shooting survivors when they pleaded for gun reform. And I really hated the Trump worshipping some people were doing. </p>
<p>Then covid hit and nothing made sense anymore. The media was blatantly sensationalizing everything. Masks don't work. Masks do work. Masks are mandatory. Stay six feet apart. Stay ten feet apart. Wear masks inside your homes. Just two weeks to slow the spread into stay home until we get a vaccine into here's a rushed, never before safe enough for the public mRNA vaccine into the vaccine isn't going to change anything. Etc etc. So I started understanding why people believe conspiracy theories and how they may not even be wrong. </p>
<p>If you want to see how the whole world could fabricate something like this for the "greater good", watch Utopia. There is a UK one that was great and also a new, American one. I didn't even know these shows existed until after I was already over this covid shit.</p>

        <p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/12/15/the-covid-19-data-is-a-travesty/">The data is definitely exaggerated. </a> In many more ways too. I'm not really super into conspiracy theories but some people have a loooottt of money. And this whole thing seems to be beneficial to the rich. Like how you can order from amazon but small businesses are forced to close?</p>
