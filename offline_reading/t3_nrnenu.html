    <strong>Are there any ‘liberal,’ ‘leftist,’ ‘hippie,’ or ‘granola’ folks on this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m just wondering.</p>
<p>These are my origins (now I definitely lean right).  I don’t resonate anymore with those groups I used to roll with.   I haven’t really talked with them (politically) since before 2015.  </p>
<p>But what’s sad is that so many of them have good intentions (vaccinate for herd immunity), but terrible discernment/execution. </p>
<p>Remember that recent post on here “Liberals in 2011” vs “Liberals in 2021”? </p>
<p>Yeah, I was that first group.  Everyone was anti-GMO and Monsanto.  When I asked what GMO was a friend told me “they want to OWN life [itself].”   So right there tells you how strongly they felt about natural systems/ leaving nature alone.  No ‘playing god.’</p>
<p>I don’t know what tf happened to that friend group since then.  Since I don’t go on social media I almost don’t want to know.</p>
<p>Certainly wouldn’t consider myself “left” anymore, but I still love nature.  </p>
<p>Edit:  I’ve evolved beyond the political right/left divide.  We all share the same enemies.  At least to those who are awake.  Screw labels.</p></p>

        <p>Radical hippy here.  Been to many pride events.  Been to burning man a few times. Backpacked  Europe and Thailand. Been to Africa.  .</p>
<p>I've had friends circles on the left and friend circles on the right nine managed to enjoy the Venn diagram in the middle for many decades.   </p>
<p>I don't recognize anybody anymore and honestly at this point I believe humanity's got whatever the f<strong><em> coming to them.  I really don't believe we deserve any of the s</em></strong> we  take for granted anymore.   </p>
<p>I was once the peace love and happiness kind of guys and now I'm the grab my rifle and get the f*** off my property kind. </p>

        <p>I hear you, I'm much the same but I still believe in peace ✌ and gratefulness. I think part of this is to generate so much fear and agitation that we lost sight of what's important and real. Here comes some of my residual hippy bullshit but....</p>
<p>Remember we are collectively creating this concensus reality and we need to keep our vision of the future and the world we want to live in. Don't get angry at people that don't agree with you just feel sorry for them. They are still our brothers and sisters, not that we need to save everyone but that we can't be so divided that we can be conquered. </p>
<p>My opinion is that we are so divided by our political views that it makes us easier to control and thats not what we want. Its good to disagree with people and take in their viewpoint. It is ok to be wrong it doesn't need to challenge our egos in such a way that we act out against them. We can appreciate an alternative view and live how we want at the same time.</p>

        <p>Liberals used to be for free speech, freedom of choice, anti-corporate, anti-establishment...now that far left progressives have hijacked the term liberal, they are for the opposite. Rage against the machine has become rage on behalf of the machine.</p>

        <p>Super “liberal” hippy granola. I live in Manhattan so this sub is my saving grace for sanity. I don’t think a single friend of mine could even comprehend my thoughts on this matter. It makes me go mad feeling like I’m all alone. I despise the media’s framing of us as republicans because I feel like I can’t even voice an opinion without someone assuming I’m a trumper and dismissing my thoughts entirely</p>

        <p>I was and still am a “goth”. I call myself a classic liberal because I believe in abortion, equal pay for equal work for women, LGBTQI rights, etc just I recognize that the new leftist is a follower who panders to the most oppressed people of the week while ignoring more serious issues. Basically I am a liberal from before the complete pussies and virtue signaling jerks took over.  Now it’s you better love who leftists tell you to love or else.</p>
<p>But I remember when being a liberal was when you used critical thinking skills and decided for yourself what you wanted and dogma was a conservative thing. I am only 33. I remember when they first started this shit with “women only space” in college but if I made a “man only space” I would get called terrible things.</p>

        <p>I used to identify as such. I believe I had good intentions, too. Now I’m in the same boat where left and right are illusions and distractions.</p>
<p>I first saw the hate of the left in 2015 when Trump got elected and I saw the hate when people were hitting a Trump piñata at someone’s work Christmas party. I still vividly remember all of these ‘woke’ people behaving like ferocious animals. It gave me the willies!</p>
<p>I stayed a hippie liberal still, and I was scared of the Covid. But sooner than later it didn’t make sense. Nothing added up. Soon enough, it clicked. We are being played. So hard. This is the beginnings of a new world order. Then I started to see how insidious this whole agenda is. I walked away and I’ve never felt better. I am truly grateful that I woke up from being ‘woke’. I’m truly grateful I didn’t vaxxx. I’ve seen behind the curtain and it’s something I cannot unsee. It’s liberating! It’s also really scary at times. I try to be smart, keep a clear head and not live my life in fear. </p>
<p>I feel for those that have those good intentions yet are lost. Love thy Neighbor, not what they do kinda thing is my strategy. I tell you it’s not always easy!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to my brief red pill story. And thank you for welcoming me to this community:)</p>

        <p>I definitely was in the 2011 liberal group at some point and still hold a lot of those ideals, but I've drifted more towards the "far right" over the years as the left has turned its back on its previous opposition to corporate tyranny and has become more authoritarian and dogmatic.</p>

        <p>i’m a huge hippie, more loosey goosey with going with the flow and appreciating the cosmic joke.  becoming more of a theist/believer in an almighty force of good, or a higher power.  i do wear a lot of tie dye and appreciate my freedom and self styled independence.  not really a modern leftist but a big time classical liberal and a live and let live believer.</p>

        <p>Hippie woman who is also queer! I can’t stand what the left has become, because it sure isn’t the party of tolerance and love that I used to think it was. People are always shocked when I say I’m not getting the vaccine because they genuinely believe that I must be a leftist if I’m not straight. It’s all such a joke, but know you are not alone!</p>

        <p>I'm definitely left, but I just cant get down with this new "ultra left" that has sprung up in the last 10 years.  Most of the people in my circles are of that persuasion and simply because I dont agree with their storytelling I end up as "the right wing guy".</p>

        <p>Political orphan here. I’m not a conservative. Today’s liberals are a bunch of hypocrites with never ending double standards. I’m in CA and the progressives are turning it in a crime-ridden hell hole with their policies. I’m somewhere between a libertarian and a republican I think. I think we need less government and we should all be free to earn money and make a living and live the American dream. I’m against government handouts and taxes. Everyone I know IRL who is a democrat is angry &amp; irrational, has liberal views (and double standards and never ending mental gymnastics) suffers from trump derangement syndrome &amp; has at least 1 mental health diagnosis. Quite frankly the only sane leftists with common sense &amp; decency that I’ve ever met are right here on Reddit!</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you. In fairness I think the transition started well before covid, probably around the time everyone around me was trying to brow beat me into voting for Hillary cuz trump was such an "existential threat". They just shut down and waited for their moment to speak when I would counter that she was a corrupt, lying, murderous monster and I could never bring myself to vote for her. I'm hardly a republican, two wings same bird, but I must admit I've noticed a higher concentration of common sense in the south in these covid times.</p>

        <p>I don't like categorization anymore but I think I'm in the ballpark of what you are asking about.</p>
<p>I voted Democratic through Obama's first term before I grew up and realized that neither mainstream party represents it's constituents, and just uses the other party as an excuse as to why nothing ever gets better for us.</p>
<p>Both parties are wholly and completely owned by corporations. They pass legislation and then collect millions in speaking engagement fees and book deals (two ways that money is laundered, among others.)</p>
<p>I'm not "antigovernment" because I'm intelligent enough to realize without government corporations would step into it's place. I mean - we're practically there. It would just get worse.</p>
<p>I do believe it takes a community of people working together - workers uniting, to have a voice against capital.</p>
<p>However, I'm also intelligent enough to know that anything big becomes corrupt. Only a small government can reflect the will of it's people. As soon as a government is big enough that the elected officials don't even have to meet its people - it's too big. We are way, way, way past that by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>And that's why we have absolutely no say in our government.</p>
<p>They dumbed down the education system to the point they just trick people into thinking they want whatever the government is selling.</p>
<p>I say selling because that's the role of a politician -- salesmen that sell to the public the interests of concentrated wealth..</p>
<p>But I'm also suspicious of fake grass roots movements that are coopted into doing the opposite of what they claim to be on the surface.</p>
<p>Therefore, I refuse to label myself anymore and I just support common sense approach to solving problems.</p>
<p>But the Democratic party is now worse, even, than the Republican party of 2001 era. The Democratic party is so incredibly bad that there's no way I will ever vote for them again.</p>
<p>Not that it matters. This whole ritual of voting in America is just to give serfs and peasants the illusion they have any say in the power above them.</p>
<p>But no, "getting rid of government" doesn't solve anything.</p>

        <p>Definitely hippie, fairly progressive, female POC living in a super liberal area, went to liberal schools all my life. Took what I needed about self-empowerment, I guess! </p>
<p>"Woke up" in December although I didn't realize it until recently. Sooooo basically I am currently struggling with accepting that many people I know will perceive me as "crazy" if they ask me questions and I tell them the truths that I've discerned. I am not one to lash out or worry about what other people choose to believe and generally am just living life but I don't know if that same respect will always be given to me. </p>
<p>Will add that I actually don't identify with left/right liberal/conservative labels at all anymore and feel like I'm done with that divide like OP, but seems like most people would put the "right" label on me if they knew what I really thought, simply because I consider alternative viewpoints and don't think it's healthy for me to viscerally hate anyone.</p>

        <p>Always considered myself a leftist. In high school and college, I was passionately against the War on Terror, pro gay marriage, pro choice, feminist, skeptical of big pharma, etc. </p>
<p>I think I started feeling disaffected after 2016. Things just didn’t add up. While topics like racism and transphobia are important, I feel like they are the focus of leftism now while they’re suspiciously quiet about classism and wealth distribution (which are ingrained in keeping minorities disenfranchised). I think the focus on identity politics is almost like a distraction so politicians don’t have to make real changes and maybe not be as rich or popular with corporate donors.</p>

        <p>I am a 420 friendly, far-right Conservative.</p>
<p>I hate Republicans. Of course, I can't stand Commie Dems either but that's a poltical difference. Republicans are supposed to be aligned with most of my political values and might be  when they speak. But they are the most spineless wimps I've ever seen. </p>
<p>Both parties just need to go away. I wish we had 15 political parties so that absolutely nothing could get done. Gridlock is always my hope, no matter who is in power.</p>
