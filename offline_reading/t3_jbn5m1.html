        <p>COVID LOGIC</p>
<ul>
<li>Your mask does not protect you. It's to protect others <em>from</em> you.</li>
<li>Therefore, if you do not wear a mask, you're potentially putting others at risk, because of the big scary asymptomatic spread, but you, yourself, remain at the same level of risk. </li>
<li>However, if you do not wear a mask but contract coronavirus, it is a moral failing on your part. Even though, according to science, your own mask doesn't protect you anyhow, it's still your fault for getting sick.</li>
<li>It is also your fault if others get sick. In fact, even if you don't directly get someone sick, you could pass it to someone who passes it to someone who then passes it to someone who gets very sick and maybe dies.</li>
<li>There is no way to know if you are sick at this very moment. Even if you tested negative, you could pick it up at any point thereafter without showing symptoms. Therefore, you perpetually exist in a state of disease. You can never be truly sure that you aren't a walking disease vector. Because of this, any activity you partake in that is not absolutely essential is selfish.</li>
<li>People who are at risk, either due to age, being immunocompromised, or any other reason, should be allowed to participate in society fully. It is not selfish for them to engage in non-essential activities. However, it is selfish for YOU to do so, because you are putting these people at risk. Perhaps you're even putting someone who lives with such a person at risk. Therefore, it is imperative that you stay home. Vulnerable people must be allowed to experience the world with no additional risks to themselves. It is unreasonable to ask these vulnerable people to take extra precautions, because no one should have to live in a state of constant fear and restriction. Except for you, a healthy person.</li>
<li>The 200,000 people who died were murdered due to negligence on behalf of the government, however:</li>
<li>When Trump and Republicans get sick, it's their own fault. Karma. They deserved it. Yet, for anyone else, ESPECIALLY Democrats, they were victims. </li>
<li>It's solely Trump's fault for how the virus was handled in America. Because we didn't take it seriously from the outset, we're in the undesirable situation we're in now. Other countries who took it seriously, like the entirety of Europe, are enjoying the fruits of their labor. </li>
<li>On second thought, it appears that Europe is having a second wave. It may be because these other countries didn't take it seriously enough either. However, the blame is still entirely on Trump.</li>
<li>It is extremely selfish to expect others to sacrifice themselves for the economy. Everything should just be shut down. While being shut down, low wage earners who work for Instacart and Uber eats should deliver food to every household. It is not selfish to expect these people to provide goods and services, however.</li>

        <p>&rt;Your mask does not protect you. It's to protect others <em>from</em> you.</p>
<p>Yes, this is mostly true, but there's actually some evidence showing this isn't entirely the case:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html</a></p>
<p>The basic idea is that even if your face covering isn't N95-level secure and only blocks 1 out of 100 viral particles from entering into your lungs, getting sick from 99 viral particles is preferable to getting sick from 100 viral particles and is likely to be a less severe course of the disease.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Therefore, if you do not wear a mask, you're potentially putting others at risk, because of the big scary asymptomatic spread, but you, yourself, remain at the same level of risk.</p>
<p>But let's assume there isn't any evidence showing that face masks help the wearer.  Yes, you are correct here.  Let's make it simple for you by narrowing it down to just two people in a room together:</p>
<p>Case 1: No one wears a mask, both are at equal risk of contracting an asymptomatic viral illness from one another.</p>
<p>Case 2: One person wears a mask while the other person doesn't.  The unmasked person receives the benefit of decreased chances of contracting a viral illness from the masked person while the masked person is at a higher risk of contracting a viral illness from the unmasked person.</p>
<p>Case 3: Both people wear masks.  Both people receive equal benefits from the other person wearing a mask.</p>
<p>How is this hard to understand?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;However, if you do not wear a mask but contract coronavirus, it is a moral failing on your part. Even though, according to science, your own mask doesn't protect you anyhow, it's still your fault for getting sick.</p>
<p>While you may arguably share some fault for getting sick by engaging in risky behaviors, it's not really you getting sick that you are at fault for.</p>
<p>What you <em>are</em> at fault for is everyone whom you infect after becoming sick because you were too selfish to wear a mask despite everyone telling you that you should wear a mask or people around you might contract the virus from you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It is also your fault if others get sick. In fact, even if you don't directly get someone sick, you could pass it to someone who passes it to someone who then passes it to someone who gets very sick and maybe dies.</p>
<p>If you aren't taking basic precautions that public health officials have been telling you to take for months now, yes, it is your fault for knowingly or unknowingly getting others sick.  At this point, there isn't really a difference between you knowingly or unknowingly getting others sick because you clearly know that is a possibility and yet you refuse to take simple precautions.  This is in your face so much that you've joined a fucking denialist sub and write lengthy comments like this, lmao.  <strong>There is no excuse at this point.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There is no way to know if you are sick at this very moment. Even if you tested negative, you could pick it up at any point thereafter without showing symptoms. Therefore, you perpetually exist in a state of disease. You can never be truly sure that you aren't a walking disease vector. Because of this, any activity you partake in that is not absolutely essential is selfish.</p>
<p>Yup.  It's really a shitty situation for all involved.  But yes, we are basically in a perpetual state of disease at this point, because (a) this pandemic has been downplayed from very divisive leadership since the beginning so a huge portion of the country isn't taking it seriously while another huge portion of the country IS taking it seriously, (b) people who don't take it seriously refuse to stop partaking in risky behaviors and spreading the virus, and (c) the ones who do take it seriously will continue to take it seriously until it is no longer a threat to their lives and livelihoods.  Your "old normal" ain't comin' back at this point until there's a vaccine because the virus is too widespread.</p>
<p><a href="https://dallasvoice.com/a-harsh-lesson-in-the-reality-of-covid-19/">Take it from this COVID denialist who selfishly got 2 of his family members killed and another 13 infected</a>:</p>
<p>"You cannot imagine the guilt I feel, knowing that I hosted the gathering that led to so much suffering. You cannot imagine my guilt at having been a denier, carelessly shuffling through this pandemic, making fun of those wearing masks and social distancing. You cannot imagine my guilt at knowing that my actions convinced both our families it was safe when it wasn’t.</p>
<p>For those who deny the virus exists or who downplay its severity, let me assure you: The coronavirus is very real and extremely contagious. Before you even know you have it, you’ve passed it along to your friends, family, coworkers and neighbors."</p>
<p>It sucks.  It sucks a lot that this guy couldn't learn from the mistakes of others (and that subs like this exist that are literally dedicated to denying lessons from the mistakes of others) and now 2 of his family members who were alive just weeks ago are now dead, but that's the reality of the world in which we live.  I suggest you start learning to accept rather than deny it, before you end up regretting it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;People who are at risk, either due to age, being immunocompromised, or any other reason, should be allowed to participate in society fully. It is not selfish for them to engage in non-essential activities. However, it is selfish for YOU to do so, because you are putting these people at risk. Perhaps you're even putting someone who lives with such a person at risk. Therefore, it is imperative that you stay home. Vulnerable people must be allowed to experience the world with no additional risks to themselves. It is unreasonable to ask these vulnerable people to take extra precautions, because no one should have to live in a state of constant fear and restriction. Except for you, a healthy person.</p>
<p>Your 80-year-old granny who doesn't care about being taken from COVID and who is ready to go should still be wearing a mask and socially distancing when possible.  It's not about her.  It's about everyone around her.  Just because she's ready to go doesn't mean she is not selfish by putting others at risk who aren't ready to go.</p>
<p>I won't even get into the reckless disregard and negligence of Trump except to say that <strong>dude has done more than ANYONE IN THE FUCKING WORLD to fan the flame of this virus</strong>.</p>
<p>Edit: don’t just downvote, engage in a conversation.  Try to convince me and everyone who reads this that I’m wrong and you’re right.</p>

        <p>I don’t care. Enough fear mongering. Don’t force me to put something on my face. If people are afraid or worried about spreading it around then they can wear a gas mask, or stay home. Stop looking for a sacrificial lamb and blaming the President.</p>

        <p>It’s pretty clear you don’t care or you wouldn’t be trolling this subreddit.  I won’t say that I hope you see consequences from your ignorant selfishness, but I certainly won’t feel bad for you if you do.</p>
<p>I will just say out of necessity, fuck Trump and fuck anyone who still supports him.  I’d go on about just what I think about the guy but I’d get banned by nearly every subreddit on this website.  Suffice it to say, I do not hold the man in high regard.</p>
<p>But the shit I’m saying about masks and about this virus is <strong>very well founded</strong> and at this point the evidence is so overwhelming that it is on you to prove it wrong.  Good luck with that.</p>
<p>There is a good case to be made that, just to be safe, you should think of this as “airborne AIDS” rather than “just another strain of the flu.”  There is even suspicion among the medical community that COVID can cause months-long if not permanent changes to your immune system.  “Long haulers” are no joke (google it).  If you don’t believe me I’ll find the source for you.</p>
<p>What does that remind you of?</p>

        <p>Why don’t you force/dictate what people eat as well why you’re at it....science proves that those with an unhealthy immune system have more symptoms..therefore spreading the virus more...At what point are we going to realize that this is about free will and that once u start allowing the govt to dictate your health we’re fucking screwed</p>

        <p>Well if you had kept reading I literally started the next paragraph by saying “but let’s assume that masks don’t protect the wearer at all.”  Maybe you should try reading beyond the first paragraph even if you disagree with what it says, instead of just shutting down in denial and shoving your head back into the sand.  You might learn something new.</p>

        <p>Think they were an early mask adopting country and there are scientists from the Czech Republic involved in #masks4all.  When I googled it, it looked like the whole "my mask protects you, yours protects me" language might have been used there first, but I wasn't doing really deep research, I'd want to go back and look into it more carefully to be sure.</p>

        <p>No I suspect it was just an advertising ploy.  Advertising is not about truth, it's about selling an idea.  They have been doing market research on selling the covid reasoning this entire time.  Right now they are working on how to sell the vaccines.</p>

        <p>It isn't suddenly, it always has been. Just because people have been doing it doesn't mean it has worked, and there is no convincing evidence that masks slow the spread of ANY respiratory/flu-like illness.</p>

        <p>The mandating and shaming is the bullshit. If you want to do anything forced to another human being you better have clear cut unbiased peer reviewed studies from multiple sources, not cherry picked b.s. about how masks kinda sorta might help. Seatbelts are the perfect example. It's a law to wear them. I can right now look at study after study and alllll the crash test footage to see yes indeed 100 percent if you're wearing a belt you WILL survive MUCH more often. The past 50 years of studies by the medical community unilaterally agreed masks do "eh". Recommending? Sure that's about the flu. Mandating? That has nothing to do with science or the flu and everything to do with petty tyranny.</p>

        <p>That never really made much sense,  I agree.  But i suspect it was a marketing ploy targeting younger and healthy people.  It became obviously covid was not much threat to healthy people early on, so the only way to pressure them was to emphasize a sense of duty and respect to others.   In public we do a lot of things just out of politeness and societal expectations that we do not bother with in the privacy of our homes, they had to make the masks one of those things or most people would blow it off.</p>

        <p>I find it hard to believe that a mask protects others given that all of the studies by virologists until March 2020 said they weren't effective at preventing viral spread. </p>
<p>I see no reason why Covid would be different.</p>

        <p>The people who say that never believed it anyway. That’s why they’re so gleeful when they hear of someone who didn’t wear a mask apparently (because the fear mongers always conveniently find these stories) dying from COVID, directly relating their death to their lack of mask wearing. When by their logic, it should have been other person fault for their death.</p>

        <p>I'm going to give a little background here: </p>
<p>Tucker Carlson called out the CDC because "Carlson cited a study conducted by 11 medical institutions that analyzed a group of people who tested positive for coronavirus during the month of July. The study found that among those who were infected, more than 70% reported they had "always" worn a mask over the preceding 14 days. Another 14.4% said they had "often" worn a mask. </p>
<p>In a statement issued to Fox News on Wednesday, a CDC spokesperson wrote that "social media postings citing a table in an MMWR published September 11, 2020, suggest that CDC’s face mask guidance is failing to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 because study participants had indicated having worn masks often and still contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>The statement added, "CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected. At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers."</p>
<p>So this isn't about droplets or protecting others first, this is the CDC's own defense to the accusation that masks failed to protect the wearers. The CDC's response is that masking was never intended to protect the wearer. There is clearly a logical fallacy here in them saying that.</p>

        <p>The problem with the CDC saying that masks aren't meant to protect the wearer is that it implies then that no one is protected. Because in any scenario where everyone is wearing masks, everyone is the wearer therefore not protected.</p>

        <p>Right, its supposed to help stop the spread by filtering some of what we put out into the atmosphere. An by filter, I mean like covering your mouth when you sneeze an cough. A ton less particles spreading into the air.</p>
<p>Especially if you're asymptomatic, you would still be helping limit the spread and accidentally getting someone with any serious underlying illness infected and perhaps dieing. </p>
<p>It's literally done all around the world, you get sick, you wear a mask to help others from getting sick. Nobody said it was a fix, it's just there to help.</p>
<p>Mask were not a fix and was never mentioned as one. When the CDC give statistics like if 95% of Americans were masks, we would save 40k lives. They dont say people just stop dieing. </p>

Most of the Scandinavian countries do not mandate masks because it's quite simply not worth it based on this, for the same reason we don't wear helmets in cars, which would also save a very small amount of lives. They are no better or worse off than countries who do mandate masks. </p>
<p>We as a society deem the drawback and annoyance of putting on a helmet to drive to the shop not worth the effort. Masks are exactly the same - if they have any effect at all, and the jury is still out on that, it is so small as to make all the negatives of wearing one (and there are many negatives) not worth it, when applied to the general public excluding specialised medical staff like surgeons.  In fact, there are more negatives to wearing a face mask than there are to putting on a helmet in a vehicle. So where do you draw the line? </p>
<p>A solid roundup of the lack of evidence that cloth face masks are in anyway effective can be found here from Oxford universities center for evidence based medicine:</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
<p>Note that of the studies that showed any positive benefit, many were in healthcare workers who have had training on how to use them and follow strict guidelines on mask use, not take it off, shove it in your pocket then wear it again later like 99% of the general public.</p>

        <p>I mean that's a completely different kind of argument than "masks don't work."</p>
<p>You're saying "masks work, but I'm not gonna wear them" which is fine (though foolish i think), but why not just say that instead of pretending they don't?</p>

        <p>Isn't that the interview where Fauci explicitly lied to the people to "save" masks for first responders? Why would you use this as evidence?</p>
<p>I don't know why you think the government has your health and best interests in mind. I'm in the NY area (we got hit real hard in the spring, if you remember). Independant minded people started wearing n95 masks well before the government recommended it, because it was obvious what they were doing right from the start.</p>
<p>If you don't want to wear a mask, that's your decision (one i disagree with). Stores have a right to refuse service to you, so please don't get mad when they do. Everyone offers curbside pickup now, so please just take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Why do you think an n95 mask doesn't work? It's filtration is independantly tested and they have to hold to the niosh standard. Getting a good fit isn't rocket appliances either, you can look up how on YouTube.</p>

<p>Did we watch the same interview? Where did he say 1 word about "saving masks for first responders"? </p>
<p>Again go watch that interview. He stated masks dont work and they give you a false sense of security. </p>
<p>Common sense </p>

<p>Am a Libertarian, I respect personal property and the store owners right to discriminate.</p>
<p>Ill either accomodate by bending the rule (wear a bandana over my mouth but not my nose) or go patronize some other place </p>

<p>I'm the one explaining that he lied, and admitted he lied, to benefit the state.</p>
<p>I'm trying to tell you that you shouldn't use the government's (ever changing)  position on the virus to drive what you will do to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So then I really don't understand your thoughts on masks:</p>
<p>We both agree that shitty cloth masks don't do much, and presumably, we both agree that an n95 type mask does work. </p>
<p>So if you want to not get the 'rona, the sensible thing to do is to wear an n95 when you're indoors close to other people, right?</p>
<p>If your position that you don't mind getting the virus, well, I guess that's a position too.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the insult, but in this particular case it's not actually about protecting the people around you. </p>
<p>I've already said this elsewhere but I'm reposting it here so you have some context.</p>
<p>The CDC were called out when a study determined that masks weren't protecting people as 85% of people with covid reported "always" or "often" wearing masks.</p>
<p>The CDC's response is that masking was never intended to protect the wearer. </p>
<p>So this isn't about droplets or protecting others first, this is the CDC's own defense to the accusation that masks failed to protect the wearers. </p>
<p>There is clearly a logical fallacy here in them saying that if you really think of the implication behind them saying that. Because it essentially means that no one is protected.</p>
<p>Here is the background and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tucker-carlson-responds-cdc-mask-wearing">article</a> for reference. Yes it's Fox News but the CDC actually did respond with this to Tucker Carlson because he was the one who called them out:</p>
<p>"Carlson cited a study conducted by 11 medical institutions that analyzed a group of people who tested positive for coronavirus during the month of July. The study found that among those who were infected, more than 70% reported they had "always" worn a mask over the preceding 14 days. Another 14.4% said they had "often" worn a mask.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to Fox News on Wednesday, a CDC spokesperson wrote that "social media postings citing a table in an MMWR published September 11, 2020, suggest that CDC’s face mask guidance is failing to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 because study participants had indicated having worn masks often and still contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>The statement added, "CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected. At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers."</p>
<p>So you can be infected, we're both wearing masks but my mask does not protect me from you as I could still get sick.</p>

        <p>They have been clear from the start.</p>
<p>Mask wearing protects those around you by reducing droplets exiting your face hole. If everyone wheres one the spread is lessened. My mask protects you, your mask protects me.</p>
<p>This makes us look like idiots. What we should really be memeing about is:</p>
<p>- Studies showing it does not reduce the spread based on virus size and overall bad habits such as constantly handling the mask and putting it down, etc.</p>
<p>- That spreading the virus is actually what we want, while protecting our vulnerable population by providing them free n95 masks and grocery delivery service, etc. While we build heard immunity to an essentially harmless virus.</p>
<p>- Why are we masking now when we didn't mask for the flu?</p>
<p>ETC</p>
<p>I am totally anti mask but for first time visitors reading this.... this isn't an argument.</p>

        <p>Wrong. They are saying that the mask protects other people. You delegitimize our views when you make faulty arguments. The narrative is that we need to wear the masks in case we are sick, because the mask protects others even if it does not protect you. I.e. My mask protects you, yours protects me. </p>
<p>The real issue is that we should never have begun arguing this in the first place, nobody should be changing their lifestyle over paranoid fear of an overhyped cold. Someone else being a terrified pussy does not place any sort of responsibility on me. Also we really shouldn't be bending over backwards and fucking up our way of living for old people and sickly people; if they die it's natural selection, and the flu or some other disease could have killed them just as easily.</p>

        <p>Also a non-doomer. I think the argument is faulty. The claim is that masks protect other people from droplets, not that masks work to protect the wearer. Its like a one way street I guess. </p>
<p>So saying "it doest work to protect the wearer, so it doesn't work at all" is kind of like saying "I can only drive one way on this street so its not a street at all".</p>
<p>And you can think I'm shilling if you want to but I don't wear a mask. I just think that if you're going to attack the efficacy it should be about something realistic, like how even if they do work, they're just spreading cases across a longer amount of time or how if they're only 30% effective, they give at-risk people a false sense of security in places they might otherwise avoid.</p>

I’m not sure if your aware but 30% is 30% more than 0% in fact it’s even closer to 50% than it is to 0%. Your chose not to wear a mask because you’re a self twat. That’s it just a selfish twat.</p>

        <p>Your a fucking moron and your poetry is some of the worst shit I’ve ever read. Before you say I don’t understand it or I’m not smart enough. No, you’re just a shitty writer and your should feel shitty about it. Funny enough the same applies to your shit views on humanity.  I’d help a 1000 sick old people from dying before i pissed in your mouth because your teeth were on fire. It’s not natural if your taking steps to actively infect them. Yes that’s right I’m arguing that purposely not preventing the spread is actively spreading it. Jesus Christ how can you be so fucking callus towards people just so you don’t have “bend over backwards” it’s a mask you fucking pussy. No one is fucking up your way of life little girl. You can’t go out and have to wear a mask for a while. Not for ever. But the longer you twats keep breaking the rules the long it takes. It’s like when I tell me son he’s on time out. It doesn’t start until he he’s quiet and in the corner. </p>

        <p>If I can fart through my cloth underwear and pants and someone else wearing a mask can smell it then wearing a cloth mask is in no way protecting others from a virus that is smaller than a fart particle. Now admittedly if i have liquid diarrhea, my pants will stop that from getting on someone else. So while masks may stop spit, there's no evidence that the virus itself is not getting through the cloth.</p>

        <p>You guys are stupid.  The mask does not stop the virus as it’s too small. The virus however is carried in saliva and the saliva or at least most of it can be limited in its spread by wearing a mask. It reduces your exhale travel.  Also those who wear a mask do get some protection as you can block the incoming virus in the saliva on the surface of the mask. Stop trying so hard to be stupid.  We need to work together.</p>

        <p>This is a funny logical fallacy, but nothing more. Please don't use it as an argument against masks, you'll only appear heartless.</p>
<p>My mask protects you (to a limited extent, and only in case I'm actually sick), so I can't take it off exactly because your mask does not protect you.</p>

        <p>Sure, but that's not what we are discussing. In case you wanted to protect me (I really don't need protection from a nearly harmless virus, but let's assume I did), then your mask would offer some partial protection for me. So the meme is not very smart.</p>
<p>I don't like the masks craze any more than you all do, wear one only occasionally at work (I work with actually deadly viruses), I don't like the virtue signaling and the sheepish obedience. In the context of CoNvid, I consider putting off community immunity to be the wrong strategy. </p>

        <p>This is sort of off topic  but I am going to keep preaching this whenever someone claims the most popular style of masks is having any effect on stopping viruses.</p>
<p>The science is pretty clear about cloth masks which are the ones most people are wearing:</p>
<p>http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13523664 </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185834/#!po=1.06383</p>
<p>Cloth masks are basically useless and collect a ton of moisture. When someone coughs behind one of these masks, the droplets really go flying. </p>
<p>If society and the powers that be ACTUALLY cared about reducing the  spread, they would be recommending doubling up on masks (cloth + surgical for example) or insisting on n95 and ramping up production.</p>
<p>Instead we have security theater and a near religious like intolerance for anything that says otherwise.</p>
<p>Sew or just wear a surgical mask against the back of your cloth mask which will give it a much better aerosol blocking rate and make sure to hang it up in the sun between uses or wash it.</p>

<p>The sciense points to masks do help prevent the spread of covid.</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0</p>
<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

        <p>In 2015, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of cloth masks with that of medical masks and controls (standard practice) among healthcare workers in Vietnam (4). Rates of infection were consistently higher among those in the cloth mask group than in the medical mask and control groups. This finding suggests that risk for infection was higher for those wearing cloth masks. The mask tested was a locally manufactured, double-layered cotton mask. Participants were given 5 cloth masks for a 4-week study period and were asked to wash the masks daily with soap and water (4). The poor performance may have been because the masks were not washed frequently enough or because they became moist and contaminated. Medical and cloth masks were used by some participants in the control group, but the poor performance of cloth masks persisted in post hoc analysis </p>

<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>

Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. "</p>

<p>isn't it funny how pre-covid all of the data shows that cloth masks are useless and even dangerous ?</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm</p>
<p>but now everything since Feb 2020 says they work ?</p>
<p>isn't that weird ?</p>
<p>are people washing / disinfecting their masks ?</p>

<p>&rt;Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARS–CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients. Prior evidence that surgical masks effectively filtered influenza virus (1) informed recommendations that patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear face masks to prevent transmission (2). However, the size and concentrations of SARS–CoV-2 in aerosols generated during coughing are unknown. Oberg and Brousseau (3) demonstrated that surgical masks did not exhibit adequate filter performance against aerosols measuring 0.9, 2.0, and 3.1 μm in diameter. Lee and colleagues (4) showed that particles 0.04 to 0.2 μm can penetrate surgical masks. The size of the SARS–CoV particle from the 2002–2004 outbreak was estimated as 0.08 to 0.14 μm (5); assuming that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar size, surgical masks are unlikely to effectively filter this virus.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342</p>
<p>&rt;The penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% compared to medical masks with 44%.</p>
<p>so you see, I can spam links too</p>
<p>and pre-covid, cloth masks were known to be fucking useless</p>
<p>welcome to the modern world where science can say whatever you want it to say</p>
<p>conclusion ? wear a mask, but use something that actually works, not a bandana or your moms bra.</p>

<p>&rt;Multilayer cloth masks, designed to fit around the face and made of water-resistant fabric with a high number of threads and finer weave, may provide reasonable protection.</p>
<p>They recommend cloth masks for people <strong>not</strong> in hospital settings, they are far from perfect but they help prevent the spread of covid, as shown with all the peer reviewed research I supplied.</p>
<p>THey are saying if you are in a profession where you will be coming in contact with more covid + people they need better equipment(n95), to prevent hospital workers from being infected.</p>
<p>Masks as being advertised for the general public is meant to be a cheap/simple and safe way to prevent you from infecting someone else.</p>

        <p>ah fantastic, then you can compare a typical cloth mask, such as  a neck gaiter or these homemade ebay ones and see how easily everything goes through it compared to at least a surgical mask (the blue ones).</p>
<p>huge difference</p>
<p>the cloth ones are useless. and as you sit there breathing through them, expelling basically  just as many aerosols with as without and you need to cough...BAM, like an aerosol gun it all goes flying. all the buildup. all the particles. frankly its disgusting.</p>
<p>its awesome when we can use multiple studies AND common sense to arrive at a sound conclusion and its even AWESOMER when we do that without bending to the political will  of people with ulterior motives</p>
<p>being objective, fact based and impartial is a fantastic way to be and I'm glad you are headed in the right direction</p>
<p>&rt;The study found that cloth mask wearers had higher rates of infection than even the standard practice control group of health workers, and the filtration provided by cloth masks was poor compared to surgical masks.</p>
<p>pretty clear huh ? PRE covid study. before it all became politicized.</p>
<p>I really really hope you wont double down, overlook all of the quotes from scientific articles telling you they dont work and then latching onto the tiniest bit of thread to try to make your point. that would be biased and unscientific.</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.</p>
<p>I already showed the differences in the masks. No one is saying cloth masks are the same as a n95 we know that, but there is a shortage of n95, so we need a cheap alternative and those are masks for the general public, not healthcare workers. That is what all your links are saying and trying to show.</p>
<p>All the data coming out that I showed you, is that masks are a cheap alternative for general public, not perfect but they do help prevent the spread of covid.</p>
<p>You are the one denying all the experts and the science they are using to back up there arguments.</p>

        <p>&rt;Cotton 2 and 3 (20–26% filtration efficiency)</p>
<p>20% improvement for something that can be made at home is not bad at all.</p>
<p>How to tell if your mask is made of material that is effective?</p>
<p>&rt;The cotton should be woven/knit at a high density such that there are no visible pores under light.</p>
<p>Edit: supporting information from the authors.</p>
<p>&rt;While more data are required to confirm our findings, we suggest that cloth face coverings worn by the
public may be useful not only as source control but also provide limited filtration of particles. </p>
<p>&rt; If
designed, constructed, and worn correctly, cloth face coverings may reduce the wearer’s
exposures to infective droplets, although their use would not be appropriate for respiratory
protection in a workplace or another environment where respiratory protection is required or
needed.</p>
<p>They recommend social distancing and masks, as they are what the majority of the population can easily do and still combat covid, not for hospital workers.</p>

<p>If the question is "should I wear a mask if I feel like I might have been exposed to the flu, or if I am feeling unwell?" the answer is "yes." If the question is "should I get the flu shot to decrease my risk?" the answer is "yes." Now that I know, this will likely be the way I act going forward (although I usually get a flu shot, because, you know, have the freedom to do so and it is the decent thing to do to decrease the risk to those around me), even after this is long behind us.</p>
<p>But the comparison is silly. COVID-19 has already killed more than the last 5 flu seasons combined. Very close to the last 6 combined. And that is with strict stay-at-home orders for a significant period of time, relatively high mask compliance rate for a while, and continued significant mitigation efforts, and we aren't even a year into it yet. Trying to argue that this is just like the flu is just nonsense. It's clearly far more deadly (in the sense that it kills more people) even with our efforts to control it, so it would be a complete disaster if we treated it exactly the same way as we treat the regular flu.</p>
<p>&rt;The decent choice is, and has always been, to LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE. You're a moral busybody who thinks they're a hero, but you're really just another person who can't handle others not adopting your ethics and lifestyle.</p>
<p>You're projecting. You think that fighting back against the mask mandates makes you some hero against a tyrannical government. If you aren't going to wear a mask, at least realize that you are an asshole just like those people who cough without covering their mouth, or are meant to other people for no reason, or blast their music in the subway or out of their cars in a residential neighborhood. You <em>are</em> one of these inconsiderate dopes. I won't bother you, but if someone is going to defend their indecency, I'll point it out. If someone is going to make stupid comparisons trying to justify being an asshole, I'll point it out.</p>

<p>And the vast majority have been elderly. Compared to the flu which routinely kills young kids, I'll take Covid every time. I'd rather 10,000 80 year olds die than 10 kids.</p>

<p>The whole point of covering your mouth when you sneeze is so that you don't spread germs to other people. It's the same reason they are suggesting wearing a mask now, so you don't spread the disease. This isn't a false equivalence, it's almost literally the same exact thing.</p>
<p>And you probably agree with me that if you saw someone just sneezing and coughing without covering it, and they told you "It's my right" you would, correctly, think they are an asshole.</p>

        <p>? The act of sneezing or coughing is not an act of aggression against another person either. It's inconsiderate to not cover your mouth when you do so, just like it's inconsiderate to not wear a mask. I'm shocked that you can't see how exactly the same these two things are.</p>

        <p>No, I never said it was an act of aggression, I said it is inconsiderate, just like not covering your mouth when you sneeze. You said these were different, and then clarified it by saying breathing is not an act of aggression, implying that sneezing is.</p>

        <p>I suppose you know better than the people at Nature. And Fauci was initially concerned that our healthcare workers wouldn't have access to PPE (which they didn't, I have family and loved ones that work in the hospital and a lot were forced to reuse N95s). </p>
<p>Once the shortage passed and more evidence came out about the efficacy of masks, he changed his guidance, as data-driven individuals do. </p>
<p>I'm not going to continue talking to a wall here. These aren't controversial statements, they're facts that will help save lives. If you can't endure a minor inconvenience to help your fellow citizens, then I doubt there's much common ground for us to find.</p>

        <p>This article in nature is an opinion piece written by a journalist. It's not a scientific paper or a study. I'm sure you have never actually read the article. Its whole purpose it to tell people like you what to think. Here is a paragraph from your article:</p>
<p>&rt; But being more definitive about how well they work or when to use them  gets complicated. There are many types of mask, worn in a variety of  environments. There are questions about people’s willingness to wear  them, or wear them properly. Even the question of what kinds of study  would provide definitive proof that they work is hard to answer. </p>
<p>If you think this article from Nature is some sort of authoritative source proving that masks work, you are very mistaken.</p>

        <p>I'm adding to my reply from yesterday for greater context. </p>
<p>The CDC were called out when a study determined that masks weren't protecting people as 85% of people with covid reported "always" or "often" wearing masks.</p>
<p>The CDC's response is that masking was never intended to protect the wearer.</p>
<p>So this isn't about droplets or protecting others first, this is the CDC's own defense to the accusation that masks failed to protect the wearers.</p>
<p>There is clearly a logical fallacy here in them saying that if you really think of the implication behind them saying that. Because it essentially means that no one is protected.</p>
<p>Here is the background and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tucker-carlson-responds-cdc-mask-wearing">article</a> for reference. Yes it's Fox News but the CDC actually did respond with this to Tucker Carlson because he was the one who called them out:</p>
<p>"Carlson cited a study conducted by 11 medical institutions that analyzed a group of people who tested positive for coronavirus during the month of July. The study found that among those who were infected, more than 70% reported they had "always" worn a mask over the preceding 14 days. Another 14.4% said they had "often" worn a mask.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to Fox News on Wednesday, a CDC spokesperson wrote that "social media postings citing a table in an MMWR published September 11, 2020, suggest that CDC’s face mask guidance is failing to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 because study participants had indicated having worn masks often and still contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>The statement added, "CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected. At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers."</p>
<hr>
<p>So what this means is you can be infected, we're both wearing masks but my mask does not protect me from you as I could still get sick.</p>
<p>And you're incorrect in your assertion that a mask can stop aerosolized particles (not aerosolized droplets which doesn't exist - droplets cannot be aerosolized) because covid virus particles are smaller than the holes on a cloth or surgical face mask. </p>
<p>The problem with them saying this is that it means you are not protecting me because my own mask is not protecting me.</p>

        <p>Tucker Carlson should never come into a discussion about science-based policy. </p>
<p>I never said that masks protect you from aerosolized particles, I said that they reduce the amount emitted, which in turn helps reduce the risk of infecting others. It's not difficult to see how compliance with wearing masks helps to reduce the number of infections and consequently the number of deaths.</p>
<p>Instead of going to Tucker making a weird assertion based off of a study he clearly didn't understand, how about you look at any of the dozens of google hits discussing the efficacy of masks. </p>
<p>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</p>
<p>Some choice quotes</p>
<p>&rt;One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;A recent study published in Health Affairs, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;Another study looked at coronavirus deaths across 198 countries and found that those with cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates.</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&rt;The latest forecast from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation suggests that 33,000 deaths could be avoided by October 1 if 95 percent of people wore masks in public.</p>
<p>If you read that last point and decide that you still don't care and you'd rather not be mildly inconvenienced by having to wear a mask in public, then I don't know what to tell you. It's an easy choice for me and, thankfully, the vast majority of the people in the region that I live in. </p>
<p>Some additional reading materials if anyone in this subreddit ever bothers to care. </p>
<p>https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/inexpensive-accessible-device-provides-visual-proof-masks-block-droplets</p>
<p>&rt;“We confirmed that when people speak, small droplets get expelled, so disease can be spread by talking, without coughing or sneezing,” Fischer said. “We could also see that some face coverings performed much better than others in blocking expelled particles.”</p>
<p>&rt;Notably, the researchers report, the best face coverings were N95 masks without valves – the hospital-grade coverings that are used by front-line health care workers. Surgical or polypropylene masks also performed well.</p>
<p>&rt;But hand-made cotton face coverings provided good coverage, eliminating a substantial amount of the spray from normal speech.</p>
<p>&rt; On the other hand, bandanas and neck fleeces such as balaclavas didn’t block the droplets much at all.</p>
<p>https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v1 </p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Thus we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.</p>

        <p>I'm giving you context for what inspired the post so I have to bring Tucker into this regardless of him not being a doctor because the CDC statement that inspired this post was in response to his criticisms of them. It has nothing to do with whether Tucker is qualified to make these criticisms, it's a direct response to what the CDC said, which they actually said.</p>
<p>The fact that the CDC said that a mask does not protect the wearer (or the many wearers that got infected in this context) makes any studies you throw at me to be moot. The CDC themselves admitted that the wearer is not protected and they never claimed as such.</p>
<p>Do you understand that this means that no amount of droplet reduction is going to protect the wearer? The wearer is not protected. </p>
<p>The only way for this to work is if, in fact, both parties are protected. Because if one is not protected, neither is. It's a logical fallacy I'm pointing out here. </p>
<p>I wear the mask because I'm forced to. So don't lose sleep worrying that I'm not complying, I am. But I'm not going to pretend to like it. And I'm not going to stop speaking out against masks or the hypocrisy of the CDC saying this.</p>

        <p>&rt;  makes any studies you throw at me to be moot. The CDC themselves admitted that the wearer is not protected and they never claimed as such.</p>
<p>I listed a bunch of sources from academic studies showing that <strong>mask policies save lives.</strong> You keep fixating on this one statement by the CDC, so let's see what the CDC thinks on the topic. </p>
<p>from https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html</p>
<p>&rt;CDC reviewed the latest science and affirms that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 that could reduce the spread of the disease, particularly when used universally within communities. There is increasing evidence that cloth face coverings help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.</p>
<p>&rt;“We are not defenseless against COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”</p>
<p>There is no logical fallacy. Everyone wearing masks makes everyone safer. The masks aren't filtering out viral particles when people inhale through them, but they <strong>do reduce the amount of airborne virus released when an infected individual talks, coughs, sneezes, etc...</strong> which in turn reduces the number of individuals being infected and saves lives. </p>
<p>This shouldn't be a contentious claim, it's demonstrated in the studies I linked to previously and reflected in epidemiological data. I really don't know how to make this any clearer. </p>
<p>As the CDC puts it</p>
<p>&rt;The finding adds to a growing body of evidence that cloth face coverings provide source control – that is, they help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others. The main protection individuals gain from masking occurs when others in their communities also wear face coverings.</p>
<p>One confusing sentence from the CDC does not invalidate the overwhelming body of evidence that the CDC itself cites to justify mask policies.</p>

        <p>So in that example of the frequent mask wearers, how did they get sick? The answer you will give me is that the masks they wore do not protect them from getting it only giving it. But if masks can't stop aerosolized particles because they're too small and this virus is airborne, what is the point in the infected person wearing a mask? It may reduce droplets if you cough or sneeze, but if you're not coughing or sneezing because you're healthy there is no point. My breath will get through the mask if I'm asymptomatic. I can see symptomatic people wearing a mask making sense, but not healthy ones. I don't need a peer reviewed study for that, that's just logic. And as far as I know, if you are symptomatic, you must stay home anyways and isolate until you're symptom free.</p>
