    <strong>I finally got covid for the first time…</strong>
    <p><p>It’s not the most pleasant thing ever, I really miss my sense of taste and smell. </p>
<p>Here’s what I am going to do: Rest for a few days, stay home for a few days, get a little bit bored. Get over it and carry on. </p>
<p>Here’s what I’m not going to do: Demand the complete and utter shut down of my countries economy. Make other people stay inside because I have to. Push for a 2 tier society to make me feel safer. Shame people who see their friends while I can’t for a few days. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p></p>

        <p>We would be closer to ending this if people stopped going in for tests, which are unreliable anyhow. If you get cold symptoms, treat them just like we used to. And loss of smell occurs with colds too.</p>

        <p>Which is a big problem, if you go a laryngologist with any sort of problem, they will prescribe a Covid test and then there are two possible therapies:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it's Covid, take vitamins and paracetamol (standard flu/cold treatment)</li>
<li>If it's not Covid, you may have a proper illness that requires some real medication</li>
</ul>
<p>And what am I ranting about? A decision about a medical procedure is being made using an unsuitable PCR test aka the lottery! And it's a common practice. :(</p>

        <p>I used to have laryngitis every year like clock work as a pre-cursor to the Flu. Once i started taking Vit C regularly. I haven't had laryngitis or the flu in 9 years straight now. Like Magic.</p>
<p>My last episode 9 years ago was so bad that it totally fucked up the sound of my voice. I had never experienced anything like it before. Was real sick for a week or so that summer. I'll never experience it again thanks to Vit C supplements.</p>

        <p>Did you know if you ate low carb, you wouldn't need as much vitamin C? The recommendation for vitamin C is based on eating a lot of carbs, which aren't required for humans at all because of gluconeogenesis. Bart Kay is a nutritionist and goes into more detail about this and other things like the Randle cycle (perfect storm for inflammation, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc). The Randle cycle is activated by eating carbs and fat together. Remove one and deactivate Randle cycle. But if someone cuts out fat, they will at some point develop other health issues, including nutrient deficiencies. So the logical thing is cut carbs, since we don't need them anyway.</p>

        <p>That's very odd. You should have your DNA studied.</p>
<p>Vitamin D has lots of science behind it as a preventative for flu. Vitamin C does not.</p>
<p>I have taken vitamin C for years but didn't have anti-cold or anti-flu results until I started Vitamin D about 6 years ago. The juried academic publications convinced me. </p>
<p>Even Linus Pauling finally admitted Vit-C doesn't prevent colds.</p>

<p>Except for many people that +PCR result led to them being needlessly ventilated and enrolled in dangerous clinical trials. Not to mention the nocebo effect as well.</p>

        <p>Medical treatment is the 3rd leading cause of death in America...its right behind auto accidents. "Medications" do quite a bit of harm to people we just don't hear about it.

        <p>it's not just that. Since testing and treating COVID takes precedence over everything now, all you'd need to do is show a false positive on some funky test, or appear to be COVID positive in some other way, and you will be misdiagnosed and ineffectively treated for a completely different health problem that could even be very serious.</p>

        <p>Yes. Three of my roommates for it back in January and there was no reason I shouldn't have. I was with them for hours on end playing Xbox and watching movies. I didn't get it. My girlfriend also didn't get it. Her friend who was a covid freak , went to get tested. She got tested twice, one was a 24 hour test and one was one that took a little longer. One test came back positive and one negative. Another roommate got tested and tested positive and never got symptoms.</p>

        <p>Yes and it also appeals to the neurotic and hypochondriac personalities to have something special wrong with them.  The masking and ridiculous sanitizing everything is the bit for people with OCD.  So they have included a lot of things to specifically target known vulnerabilities in the human mind.</p>
<p>They are well aware that the upper middle class want to feel smarter and more special than everyone else while also holding the "moral high ground". So they have been heavily targeted by these feel good ad campaigns.  "I got my shot" etc.</p>
<p>I worked in media and analyzing this kind of shit and propaganda was part of my job.  They basically want to make you feel something and its usually something bad. Either afraid or that you are better than other people in some way.   I try to avoid consuming news media at all. They now use alarming meme statements as long headlines because they know folks avoid their garbage third world written articles more than ever.</p>

        <p>I have a history of OCD, [I am on the autistic spectrum], I had some recovery from my OCD, health is too poor to clean and rest of crazy stuff involved with it, but this mess has harmed me. I had to decide at a certain point my risk of health problems was far worse from isolation and still go outside and do somethings. I never washed boxes and that kind of crap they pushed people to do. Probably some OCD people have imploded from this, washing groceries, washing hands, etc. I have problems being around people still so they have messed me up, though I don't believe in this crap--believe the virus is "real" but phony PCR tests magnified the numbers.</p>
<p>Being high risk disabled people too, they screwed with us. Yeah the upper middle class and above, basically has covered the world with their "everyone is dirty" stuff especially the view of the lower classes and I don't care how the "woke" people claim they are against racism and classism, this entire garbage has classism interwoven throughout it.  Glad you analyzed things. I am avoiding news, I am tired of the onslaught of propaganda.</p>

        <p>The virus is certainly real but barely distinguishable from usual variants of coronavirus or cold virus of which there are many. So the tests are almost guaranteed positive.  Perfect setup.  Tens of thousands of older people die from viral related pneumonia in a bad season but no one cared till the media frenzy.</p>

        <p>Of course people cared. As an older person, I'm bombarded (at work, from my healthcare provider) to get the pneumonia vaccine.</p>
<p>My parents started that vaccine when they were about 70 (I'm not 70). I think it was a key reason my dad lived until 99 despite COPD. </p>
<p>But when you get a certain age, you can hardly turn around without someone wanting you to get the pneumonia vaccine.</p>

        <p>I should note I have no problem with vaccines. They are great and I have had many but I will not put barely tested experimental mrna technology into my body. Thats not a vaccine at all and its not effective thus they are now trying to deflect its failure by saying you just need booster shots and other dumb shit.  Fact of the matter is they have a backlog of experimental "treatments" lined up that depend on widespread adoption of mrna tech to have a prayer of getting to market.  Its not a conspiracy its just business as usual the public health be damned.</p>

        <p>&rt;I have a history of OCD, [I am on the autistic spectrum], I had some recovery from my OCD</p>
<p>I just replied to another person who said something similar. OCD has nothing at all to do with autism or anything else other than other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, Tourette's, eating disorders). A large majority of cases of legitimate OCD have a focus on morbid or taboo obsessions with specific (mental or physical) checking compulsions. Contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions are not common and are not the main manifestation of OCD. People with OCD who engage in physical compulsions also know that their actions are not ok and are unable to control it, in the same way that a person with Tourette's is not able to completely suppress their tics.</p>

        <p>I never knew that we were being pushed to wash boxes. I have met people online who obsessively clean their groceries due to CoVID fear, but don't know any in real life.</p>
<p>I read the scientific literature and avoid the news. I prefer studies done by institutions with which I'm familiar, and am not afraid to reach out to fellow academics for more data and with questions. Reddit actually has a really good subreddit:</p>
<p>/r/Covid19</p>
<p>(Not any of the other Covid related subreddits). That subreddit isn't perfect, but there is a good deal of moderation by actual scientists (mostly grad students).</p>

<p>That's not what OCD is at all. This is like saying people with Tourette's all scream curse words. <a href="https://houstonocdprogram.org/treating-morbid-obsessions/">A vast majority of people with OCD don't suffer from contamination obsessions, and instead suffer from morbid obsessions relating to sex and harm with checking compulsions.</a> Contamination obsessions with washing and avoidance are not a common manifestation of OCD.</p>

        <p>It's really just smell, but taste is mostly smell. When I had it, I could still detect pure flavors - sour, bitter, salty, sweet. I could differentiate chocolate and strawberry flavor from taste alone because one was a little bitter and one was a little sour. Chocolate and coffee tasted about the same.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply. I find it strange that the implication is that he was positive for months and didn't recover by himself.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have no idea.  I just know what he told me.  He is in his early 60s and takes excellent care of himself.  I've known him almost 30 years, and he's always been like that.  He assumed those symptoms were just part of aging.</p>
<p>Naturally, after he tested positive, the people he works with were pissed because he had been going into work all that time.</p>

        <p>With COVID, it's a bit different though. Typically can't even smell ammonia (if you have that variant) and if you do get a whiff of something, it all smells awful (most people say like burning rubber, but people have made other analogies as well).</p>
<p>So it's not just absence of smell. And we think we know why - it's not the most common symptom of COVID (and yes, people can confuse an ordinary cold for COVID) but MRI's show changes in the underparts of the brain that manage cell (epithelial cells are attacked).</p>
<p>Most people get over it in 6 weeks to 6 months.</p>

        <p>With Covid, a lot of people (mostly under 40) have few to no symptoms and still feel like going out.</p>
<p>That's basically the whole problem - unlike some other coronaviruses or other viruses, this one can be very silent in a large number of people, and then fatal or debilitating to others.</p>

        <p>Agreed ! I started working in 1992, but the first time I EVER called in sick was March 30, 2010. We didn't get sick days, but since I worked in a small office with 5 other women,  I didn't want to bring the stomach bug back to where I had caught it ( girl across from me had regaled us about her sick two year old the night before). I waited until 6:30 to call my boss and tell her that even though I was symptom free, I didn't want to risk it. She thanked me. If I'd still been working on the production floor (wide open large warehouse style building), I'd have gone in that day - the next closest guy was 30-50 feet away most of the time. </p>
<p>My current job (9 1/2 years now)  is the first job I've EVER had that offers sick time. I have over 120 hours of roll-over sick time right now.  We're have to take all of our vacation days,  floating holidays, and current year sick time before we can tap into it, though. Even though I'm still experiencing pretty bad post-herpetic neuralgia from my latest bout of shingles,  I'm not going to use my 3 remaining sick days or 5 floats until absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Cool, come into work while you sound like death, tough guys… but anti vaxxers are the problem. Surprised the whole dept didn’t end up with pneumonia. The only two weeks I was happy to be masking up during all of this (I know it’s not true protection).</p>

        <p>it's a sense of pride for some. also most jobs don't really give a shit if you're sick or not they just want the cogs to keep on grinding away.</p>
<p>the harsh reality is that people abuse sick days so much that employers will always be skeptical that you're just hungover or being a shitty employee and will pressure you to come in or make you feel guilty for taking too much time off. </p>
<p>it's pretty bogus but it is what it is. lots of people to blame</p>

        <p>Not in the least. I had loss of taste and smell with covid too. I didn't have a stuffy nose, or even cold like symptoms. It was definitely a strange feeling. Had smell and taste one minute and the next notta, zip, zilch. I would periodically stick my head in a bag of coffee and inhale as deep as I could, and nothing. Smell returned in about two weeks, and taste followed a few days later and was slightly altered for a couple months following. Definitely a legit symptom of covid.</p>

        <p>as someone who had covid and many a "stuff nose" once or twice i can tell you with 100% certainty that a stuffy nose is completely different and you're doing this sub a huge disservice for following that stupid narrative.</p>
<p>i lost my sense of smell and taste for almost two months after covid. a stuffy nose? yeah that comes back once the stuffy nose stops being stuffed up. all my other symptoms were gone in under two weeks. including congestion.</p>

        <p>So... the PCR test (according to Fauci) is fairly reliable at 35 cycles. In florida the Governor discovered labs were using 40 ( and possibly 45) cycles for testing. That many cycles results in tons of false positives among the population (cases) and among the dead ( 600k dead claims) Florida recently had to pass a law mandating that labs give the cycle rate they use to test because some labs refused to give our state government that information. Sketchy....</p>
<p>Then, 2 hours after Biden’s swearing in the WHO gave guidance to lower the cycles to 35. Miraculously cases dropped and so did deaths. Then the CDC recommended 28 cycles for fully vaccinated individuals ( almost insuring they wouldn’t test positive)</p>
<p>The long and short is that the testing ( for cases and deaths) appears to have been manipulated through cycle rates, thus making the pandemic worse or better depending on political goals.</p>
<p><a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/cdc-maximum-28-ct-for-post-vaccine-covid-pcr-tests/">CDC changed cycles to 28</a></p>
<p>( fun fact, I had the CDC guidance on this bookmarked but the link has been updated and no longer refers to 28 cycles)</p>

<p>The WuFlu is nothing but a flu with a marketing campaign. It has shown to be non deadly, and not "highly contagious". </p>

<p>https://m.timesofindia.com/world/us/india-top-recipient-of-us-economic-aid/articleshow/48093123.cms</p>
<p>It's not at all out of the question that they followed the idea that every single person who has a cough must be called a WuFlu death. Afterall that's America's stance.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>Even if you're shot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/colorado-coroner-calling-out-how-state-classifies-covid-19-deaths/article_297e3550-4131-11eb-9f01-ffe3e11d0f46.html">The Grand County, Colorado coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</a></p>
<p>Until eventually they audit it.</p>
<p><a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/06/04/alameda-countys-new-covid-death-toll-is-25-lower-than-thought/">Alameda County’s new COVID death toll is 25% lower than thought</a></p>
<p>Which makes sense, as 95% of deaths have 4+ other causes of death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>

        <p>It’s not just for ‘Dems’ political purposes.. it’s a bunch of nutcases that believe we can pretty much stay in a semi lockdown state forever. They honestly believe we can reduce automobile traffic by 65% and air travel by 90%. They have a whole laundry list of left wing extremists ideologies that will lead to worldwide serfdom if fully implemented.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Democratic Party has been taken hostage by these extremists and are actively working for the demise of the United States of America. Extremists in the WEF are actively trying to crash economies worldwide ( except China... who will continue production full steam ahead)</p>

        <p>No no the bullshit narrative people push citing it is what I mean.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you think The Great Reset is some New World Order plot to replace all white people with trans POCs and to protect the Christian USA, which is under attack from all sides, you need to make sure to not get vaccinated because that's how Bill Gates installs the microchips.</p>
<p>From your posts I believe you're one of those people. But you'll argue disingenuously so that you don't appear crazy, at first.</p>
<p>But you are.</p>

        <p>Lol! Well, problem solved. Label your opponent crazy and you don’t have to debate the merits of cutting automobile traffic by 65% or air travel by 90%. People get soft and weak when they aren’t challenged to defend their arguments.</p>
<p>(From their White Paper) </p>
<ol>
<li>RESET
 WHAT WE
CREATE</li>
</ol>
<p>We have to accept that we are accountable for what we create – and for the behaviours we encourage in the public.</p>
<p>We must push to create work that maintains the sustainable values, attitudes and behaviours experienced during lockdown:</p>
<p>n Reset how we travel: promote low-carbon travel (up to a 65% reduction in the volume of road traffic. 90% reduction in flights).</p>
<p>n Reset what we buy: more responsible consumption (22% reduction in retail sales in April 2020, compared to April 2019).</p>
<p>n Reset what we eat: promote a largely plant- based, healthy diet (during lockdown 44% of people are enjoying cooking more and 43% are buying fewer takeaways).</p>
<p>n Reset how we use energy: promote energy efficiency and renewable energy.
n Reset our attitude to waste: promote reuse / recycle / reduce (48% of people claim they are throwing away less food).</p>
<p>n Reset our connection to nature: inspire greater awareness and appreciation of the natural world.</p>
<p>The truly frightening part is these people are self described Marketing professionals ( read propaganda in public sector) I’m sure they have many many psychologists and psychiatrists on retainer to help them manipulate gullible members of the public into supporting this madness.</p>

        <p>Seriously? You still need a source to show that PCR tests can't discern RNA from any particular source and that all viruses or even contamination or past viruses or bacteria can show as a positive? Plus the fact that they were running them at a cycle threshold of 40 which basically just picks up noise. This information was available a year ago.</p>

        <p>Mine was a little more complex. I got horrible flu like body aches, congestion w the loss of taste and smell. Flu symptoms lasted 2 weeks or more, then intense fatigue and lethargy for another two weeks. A week after I started to feel ok I somehow got reinfected. It pissed me off. More flu body aches for about a week, then diarrhea for 2 whole weeks! It was nuts. Im finally recovering, thank goodness. Overall a month and a half ordeal, lost my job, now im super weak and need to start exercising to get back into shape. Still not getting any vaccine.</p>

        <p>Welcome to real life. There’s no cheap and easy cure. The vaccine has shown to only potentially (at best) prevent illness. Some still get it and need time off for it. Some get the vaccine and need a couple  day off just for the aching it causes them. Some might get the flu and need time off too. Welcome to real life. If your office is lame that it can’t figure out how to deal with one person being ill, you’ve got more problems than COVID. Allow individuals to choose based on their desire and their situation. It’s as simple as that. There’s no central planner or public policy expert who will know individuals’ situations and desires better.</p>

        <p>Let me help you.<br>
<em>Facts</em> are statements which can be proven true or false as opposed to <em>opinions</em> which cannot be proven true or false. You are welcome to ignore my opinions (which are included for a standard discussion based narrative). Below I have outlined exactly what I said and which are facts and which are opinions and for further clarification which are statistics which you seem to believe I shared--somehow without sharing facts. But facts must be proven false or ignored (doesn't look good). The opinions are mine and are added as a part of the discussion. The facts are laid out to give a backbone to the opinions shared. I don't see any statistics anywhere in my reply. Please tell me what you are referring to.</p>
<p>"Welcome to real life." (opinion, unless life can be proven to be fake or unreal)<br>
"There's no cheap and easy cure." (opinion)<br>
"The vaccine has shown to only potentially (at best) prevent illness." (Fact)<br>
"Some still get it and need time off for it." (fact)<br>
"Some get the vaccine and need a couple days off just for the aching it causes them." (fact)<br>
"Some might get the flu and need time off too." (fact)<br>
"Welcome to real life." (opinion, see above)<br>
"If your office is lame (opinion) that it can't deal with one person being ill (fact based on the opinionated statement of the person I replied to) you've got more problems than COVID." (opinion stated as a fact in that clearly they have more problems than COVID, but it's a reference to having <em>greater problems than COVID</em> which is an opinionated statement)<br>
"Allow individuals to choose based on their desire and their situation." (opinion based statement/suggestion)<br>
"It's as simple as that." (opinion)<br>
"There's no central-planner or public policy expert who will know individuals' situations and desires better." (a priori fact--<em>a priori</em> meaning <em>self evident</em>)</p>
<p>Please read the above and explain what you mean by, "But you didn't share facts".</p>

<p>A new CDC study provides strong evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, and other essential workers.  These groups are more likely than the general population to be exposed to the virus because of their occupations.</p>
<p>Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms in people age 16 and older.</p>
<p>Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is 94% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms. </p>
<p>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859#how-work</p>
<p>95% effective is pretty damn effective, do you have a real source for saying it isn't? Or did you just make that up.</p>

        <p>Maybe 95% is effective for vaccines. It sucks when the death rate for covid is sooo much lower than 5%. Survival of covid is higher than 95%. If that’s effective, than why is not being vaccinated not effective against covid. Which is it? Maybe you can’t understand this. Tough. I couldn’t care less.</p>

        <p>So this will either one go around forever in circles or you can pony up. Of course I've seen them, that is irrelevant if I don't understand them. So my statement clearly meant, how do you know I've seen an explanation of vaccine efficacy <em>that I understand</em>? I thought you're claiming I haven't. If that's the case, help me out. If you have no desire to help and just want to be right and move on, then move on. You can claim you won. I'm fine with it. I don't need to be <em>right</em> here. I'm looking for the truth.</p>

        <p>Wow. Do you want to start measuring dicks? Your ad hominem is lame. This is proof you have no idea what you are saying. It shows you know nothing about what you are talking. If you did, you wouldn't get snarky (did you need to look it up? 😆) and you wouldn't attack me. So far, you have zero truth to share. I've given you way too many chances.

        <p>This whole sub is uneducated conspiracy theorists (seriously, almost every profile I've clicked on from here posts heavy on r/conspiracy) who seem to think their anecdotal experiences and wants should come before everyone else in society. Who cares if hundreds of thousands of people died? If I didn't know em, they weren't really real and didn't matter! Who cares if hundreds of thousands of people suffered immensely from covid and it wasn't just a couple days of sniffling? Its just the liberal media, none of that is real, I didn't personally see or experience it. Look at all the people above proclaiming that their own experience with covid solely and entirely defines what the illness is like, and all those people who died or were in the ICU clearly made that up or exaggerated just to inconvenience these poor young male laborers. This sub is like beyond selfish people who struggle with accessing and interpreting non biased non conspiracy media.</p>

        <p>I disagree.</p>
<p>First of all the survival rate from the WuFlu is 99.9%+, so the mortality rate is less than 0.1%.</p>
<p>Secondly, if there was an actual pandemic with people dying in the streets, you wouldn't need government overreach. People wouldn't go out in the first place.</p>
<p>Finally, any actual deadly virus kills the host to quickly to spread a whole bunch. So it would really just take care of itself.</p>

        <p>I loose smell and taste for about 6 weeks every beginning of summer due to environmental allergies.   When I had Covid last January loss of smell and taste was the only symptom I had.  No worse, no better.  Time to switch to cheap bourbon,  Since you can't smell or taste the difference.  Enjoy the time off.</p>

        <p>4 months out, smell and taste is still funky. It came back but now I have headaches and smell chemicals all the time. Its different for everyone, but sugar is fine, while veggie and coffee taste like bitter propane. Pine sol smells like wet dog. My soap stinks. The toothpaste, might as well brush my teeth with decaying refrigerator kale. But, I can still smell a flower. Its so weird.</p>

        <p>i do kind of wonder if i had covid and didn’t i know it. i had a week or two las month where nothing tasted right. my sense of smell is generally pretty weak as is, but there’s this beer i drink that almost has a floral bouquet. i love the smell of it, and it just smelled and tasted like nothing. i didn’t get tested because i had literally no other symptom, and there’s lots of things that can cause anosmia.</p>

        <p>Eating's already a chore most of the time, there's maybe 1 or 2 nights a week where I'll actually enjoy food (and no it's not <em>what</em> I'm eating). Having no taste would make it even worse.</p>
<p>But my god if I lost my taste or smell to Coffee I think I'd be livid.</p>

        <p>Had the covid in January. My sense of taste and smell still hasn’t returned. Smell is nonexistent and taste is at about 20%.  Had Flu B with bronchitis in 07’, lost smell and taste then but it came back in a few months, this is definitely different in that regard.  Had no congestion, some funky heart palpitations.   Chugged vitamins, got up everyday and walked my dog, continued to eat nutrition rich foods, drink lots of fluids.</p>

        <p>Zinc deficiency is absolutely a thing, but so is overuse of zinc. I was taking a zinc supplement daily which was 50mg and I was occasionally getting nauseous out of nowhere. I did some research and found out that nauseousness is a symptom of zinc overdose. Apparently 40mg daily is the upper limit recommended for adults. Just some information for everyone.</p>

        <p>When i had covid what really helped was being out in the sun. It was earlier on in the year but being indoors just made things slightly worse and it does seem like sunlight temporarily alleviated most of my symptoms. Overall covid was not the worst cold i've ever had.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: Sunlight is a great natural source of vitamin D! I’m pretty sure it’s released from your skin due to the UV light, but I’m not sure exactly how it works. But that’s likely one of the reasons your “deadly disease” felt so light (aside from the fact that it’s not a deadly disease).</p>

        <p>Yep, same here. I discovered my sense of smell was gone while showering. I couldn’t smell the soap. I didn’t see a need for a test. I called my boss and worked from home for two weeks. I stayed home and self treated.</p>

        <p>I’d rather get covid again than the common cold. I worked out every day, felt fine aside from losing sense of taste/smell. It’s overblown and healthy people don’t need the vaccine. We know they inflated the deaths, pounded fear into people daily freaking everyone out. Why? To push for mail in voting. This was grown &amp; released by powerful people as a tool.

        <p>As tinfoil as it may seem, it is the only rational explanation I can think of. It may not be a full explanation, but it definitely explains why the US would be willing to kill the economy for a meme virus with a high survival rate. I could understand shutting down things early on when you didn't know how deadly the virus was, but prolonging the lockdowns for over a year is fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Same here. They seem baffled by it but it happens to me every time I get the common cold or flu. I’m also confused why they all say it lasts months for them. For me it’s a few days, and once I’m feeling better everything is back to normal.</p>

        <p>I normally lose smell and taste somewhat during a cold, but I had an experience in spring 2019 (yes, before covid) that was much different. I had a cold and lost my sense of smell <em>completely</em> and it wasn’t just a few days - it didn’t come back for MONTHS. It was really crazy. I had never had that happen before and nobody I knew had heard of it either. Of course, it can’t have been covid because it was several months before all that. But I guess the virus attacked my olfactory nerves in a similar way. Shrug.</p>

        <p>Think about this: </p>
<p>Wearing a piece of clothe that you don’t wash, cough, sneeze, and touch with your dirty hands is going to build up bacteria. </p>
<p>Wear it all day and you’re asking for an infection.</p>
<p>You can get pneumonia by wearing a ventilator for this reason. Not too much of a stretch for someone wearing a mask don’t you think?</p>

        <p>Personally I took like a week or so to recover and I did have difficulty breathing.  I felt winded all day every day.  I didn’t seek medical treatment other then getting a PCR test to confirm my suspicion of infection.  I was infected with the delta variant based on my locations reporting information.</p>

        <p>I have an autoimmune disease. I got Covid and it truly was probably the worst I have ever felt in my life. It was like the flu, but so much worse.</p>
<p>After a week of bedrest, I started feeling better. Took about two weeks to get back to normal.</p>
<p>There was a very real chance that I could have died from it because of my health.</p>
<p>I still remain firmly in the belief that the world has completely overreacted to this shit. Shutting down for what is basically a worse flu. Absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>I don't agree with everything this sub does, but I certainly agree with the idea that this should not be a "new normal".</p>

        <p>My partner and I had Covid nearly 4 weeks ago, I had body aches really bad, along with vertigo and a slight fever, of which all of that lasted 3 days, my spouse had similar symptoms, my 10 month old son had it as well, and guess what we all made it just fine, just can’t smell or taste still</p>

        <p>I had covid myself early last year. Initial week was pretty brutal: high fever, cough, messed with my asthma, loss of taste and smell (other than a constant metallic taste in my mouth). Then I had minimal lingering symptoms for a couple of weeks, but overall I got through it and haven’t presented with flu/cold symptoms since then. Happy that I’ve built up natural immunity.
Rest up, take your vitamins, and stay hydrated! Wishing you a fast recovery!♥️</p>

        <p>Just beginning the initial phases of Covid myself. So far my worst symptom is boredom. My body kinda aches and I’m fatigued, I have a slight fever and go between chills and uncomfortably hot. My cough isn’t too bad. I normally have bad sinuses so the fact that I can blow my nose and things are moving around up there is actually kind of a nice change of pace. I haven’t lost sense of taste/smell but my wife has and she hates it, I’m hoping that doesn’t happen to me in the next few days but if it does, it does</p>
<p>So far it’s mostly just an inconvenience. It sucks, I’m not “enjoying” it but I’ve definitely been more sick with bad cases of the flu or food poisoning. Definitely not something worth shutting down world economies over</p>

        <p>I just caught it as well. I drank tonic water, honey, lemon, vitd, vitc, and zinc twice a day. I did have to use my kids inhaler a couple of times, but that was it. Most of my symptoms were gone in 2 days. The rona ain't shit. The psychos of the world know this, but they want to keep us in a state of fear.</p>

        <p>Long haul symptoms are real, tho, bro. I used to think it was all snakeshit, but I still get pangs of exhaustion, brain fog, full body ache, etc. I push through them all, but, pay attention to your heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Consume less of the poison foods they feed us and more natural fruits and red meat, get plenty of sunlight, and exercise even if you feel like shit. Sweating helps.</p>

        <p>Follow regular guidelines for when you have a flu. Take walks outside!! 
If you're overwheight and past 50 I'd recommend to find a way to check  your oxygen levels regularly if you notice anything bad about  your breathing.</p>
<p>Advice from a doctor I know. Have a good day and thanks for not wanting to lock me up in my home until 2025!cheers</p>

        <p>My dad had it, felt like shit for a couple weeks, they treated him with a zpac or what ever it’s called for pneumonia. *edit, he said the worse part was loss of taste, well not really loss, he said everything tasted like vomit no matter how much he brushed his teeth. But like I said it only lasted a few weeks.</p>

        <p>There are well thought through therapies for that - the gist of all of them is to sensitize your nerves again. You might want to look up who in your vicinity can offer professional help. Other than that, you could start by exposing your nose to different smells in succession. Start with stronger smells and proceed to the lighter ones. Training sessions of 5 minutes dispersed throughout the day for a prolonged period of time might just so the trick. Nothing to lose, lots to gain, I guess. Maybe start with vinegar, coffee and the likes and introduce more and more herbs and flowers with time.
Good luck, friend.</p>

        <p>I hope you make it! I remember that cough being a bitch for me to deal with until the mucinex kicked in. You’ll get a lot done around the house due to sheer boredom so silver linings! Also your taste should come back in a couple weeks. It varied a little bit for each person when my whole family got covid at pretty much the same time, but it’s been back for everyone for a while. The weirdest thing for me was that of all things, onions smelled differently for a couple weeks after I got my smell and taste back.</p>

        <p>One event—like A particular study—is easy to manipulate or fuck up via poor (sometimes intentional) design. This is what makes meta-analyses so valuable—you can’t really fake a signal when collating data across a large number of studies.</p>
<p>To that end I would direct you here:</p>
<p>https://c19ivermectin.com</p>
<p>Try to keep in mind that the most powerful and wealthy corporate interests in the world have a strong incentive for ivermectin to be found ineffective—as no one stands to profit off a generic drug.</p>
<p>And also—given ivermectin’s high safety profile (it’s a WHO essential drug, about as ‘risky’ as taking aspirin) and the OP being actually ill right now and in danger of tissue damage/worsening condition—it’s our responsibility to point them and their doctor to information that could benefit them.</p>

        <p>I had the virus bad in February 2020 and treated it with highly concentrated oregano oil (oreganol). It's expensive for a tiny bottle, but each drop is like liquid gold of pure natural antibiotic. I added it to a carrier oil (almond or jojoba oil are good) and rubbed it on the outside of my chest, swollen throat, and sinuses (do not get in the eyes!). I also dosed 3 to 10 drops in a small amount of water a few times a day. </p>
<p>If you go this route, be sure to get probiotics afterward, since oregano oil destroys good and bad bacteria, and your gut will need an extra boost. Even kombucha will work for this. Hope you feel better!</p>

        <p>They call it oreganol because they are stupid </p>
<p>Actually it's this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvacrol</p>
<p>Better source seems to be thyme.</p>
<p>But yeah, using essential oils with antimicrobial effects to treat a virus is to be expected.</p>

        <p>Well sure, we wouldn't need restrictions if everyone who got COVID had symptoms as mild as yours!</p>
<p>Unfortunately—and contrary to what you might believe—the world neither revolves around you nor is your experience representative of all COVID cases. I'm happy to hear you're personally holding up well, but millions of other people have died from the disease and many more are hospitalised.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'd like to see you tell a dying COVID patient to "get over it and carry on". On second thought, you're so detached from reality that I bet you would!</p>

        <p>Actually he was referring to when DHS Science Secretary Bill Bryan said</p>
<p>“We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids, and I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes,”</p>
<p>followed by</p>
<p>"We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva.”</p>
<p>Guess what. Some disenfectants (kill bacteria on nonliving objects), can be turned into antiseptics (kill bacteria on living objects) by simply changing their concentration.</p>
<p>https://byjus.com/chemistry/antiseptics-and-disinfectants/</p>
<p>"We can use the same chemical as a disinfectant and an antiseptic by varying its concentration.</p>
<p>For example, phenol can be used as an antiseptic if its concentration is 0.2 per cent but to use it as a disinfectant the concentration should be 1 per cent."</p>
<p>Trump actually said </p>
<p>"And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting. </p>
<p>And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. </p>
<p>And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning"</p>
<p>He clearly was asking Mr. Bryan if the technology was available, not suggesting 'people inject bleach.'</p>
<p>Keep spreading lies though. The truth would screw up your bias arguments.</p>

        <p>I finally got a DUI for the first time…</p>
<p>It’s not the most pleasant thing ever. My license got suspended, and I can’t drive myself to work.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m going to do: Reflect on what happened, take public transportation until I get my license back, probably pay more for ride sharing than I would’ve otherwise. Get over it and carry on.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m not going to do: Demand the police enforce laws against drunk driving. Make other people sober up prior to operating a motor vehicle because I’m not allowed to drive intoxicated. Push for a 2 tier society to make some soccer mom feel safer on the road. Shame other people for getting away with drunk driving just because I was caught.</p>

        <p>Your analogy is really really bad. You are implying I am putting people in danger. I’ve already stated that I’m going to stay inside while I am positive. So that would be me, in fact, getting drunk and <em>not</em> getting in my car. </p>
<p>In your example, there would be consistent restrictions to stop me driving, even when sober. Even if I didn’t drink at all.</p>

        <p>Let’s go one further actually. Getting in a car, you have a 99.99% chance of getting to your destination alive. Therefore to stop the risk, why not limit driving to only once per week. Let’s have monthly driving tests. Let’s limit cars to 20mph too. If it saves just one life!</p>

        <p>that analogy is terrible. There are already laws against drunk driving else how would you get DUI in a first place?</p>
<p>Better analogy would be: you ran over a grandma, but not because you're drunk (because drinking and driving is something you can control), but because you're a shitty driver. And as a result you demand to ban all cars to prevent other shitty drivers like yourself running over grandmas.</p>
<p>Oh and you also want to ban grandmas from leaving their apartment for a year, so they dont get ran over.</p>

        <p>It’s great that you only have a milder case of covid! However, many can tell you of their experience of barely being able to breathe and being in intensive care with extra oxygen supply for weeks on end. I’m not saying you’re wrong, it just kind of seems like you’re saying everyone who contracts covid has symptoms similar to a mild flue</p>

        <p>lot of misinformation in this comments section lol, the reason the lockdown happened was to protect the elderly and immunocompromised, the regular person ofc has a higher chance of tanking covid, also having covid once doesn’t equate to receiving the appropriate dosage of a vaccine, it’s unknown how much antibodies made during reception of the virus help against preventing it later. get the vaccine, it’s just a day off work at most for symptoms, i’d say that’s a hell of a lot easier than a week off from a cough.</p>

<p>Ah yes, because it makes/made sense to lock down everyone rather than the elderly and immunocompromised. Genius.</p>
<p>&rt;also having covid once doesn’t equate to receiving the appropriate dosage of a vaccine, it’s unknown how much antibodies made during reception of the virus help against preventing it later. </p>
<p>This is misleading. We also don't know how long vaccine immunity lasts. However, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/reinfection.html">according to the CDC</a> re-infections with SARS-CoV-2 remain rare, indicating that natural immunity is durable and long lasting. 18 months and counting, now. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v3">And this study</a> shows how natural immunity is greater than vaccine immunity. </p>

        <p>regular folk still got infected and died, therefore the whole country got locked down to prevent the spread, but it was most dangerous for the elderly and immunocompromised. </p>
<p>yes, we don’t know how long vaccine immunity lasts, but there is the possibility of a booster shot in the future to maintain immunity. i have read the opposite of your statement about natural being better than vaccine immunity here: https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/06/22/how-immunity-generated-from-covid-19-vaccines-differs-from-an-infection/amp/</p>
<p>the article suggests that vaccine immunity targets multiple variants of the virus, whereas natural targets less. </p>
<p>so it seems that is a debate to be had when there’s more information.</p>
<p>for reasoning to get the vaccine, it’s just a more sure fire way to be protected. you’re infected with covid once right, but once that immunity wears off (which may occur) it wouldn’t make sense to get infected again. think of it like the flu, you get flu shots every year to keep up with the changing disease instead of literally getting the flu again and again. </p>
<p>a vaccine just makes more sense, it provides continued immunity with little drawback.</p>
<p>of course in the end it’s you’re decision, bodily autonomy is an important concept. i just think it’s the best bet</p>

        <p>&rt;the article suggests that vaccine immunity targets multiple variants of the virus, whereas natural targets less.</p>
<p>This is nonsense. The vaccine generates immunity against the spike protein on the virus and nothing else, while natural immunity from infection generates immunity against the spike protein and other parts of the virus. The vaccines provide immunity against other variants provided the spike protein doesn't significantly change. The exact same can be said for natural immunity from infection.</p>
<p>The re-infections that have occurred are almost universally less severe than the initial infection (similar to how breakthrough infections after vaccination are almost universally less severe), so again I would take my chances with the virus again. The most severe side effects from vaccination have been among people who were already infected before.</p>
<p>And for the record no, I don't get the flu shot ever. I'm relatively young and healthy. When I get older and more at-risk for severe infections I'll start getting vaccinations, but until then I'm going to let my immune system to its good work.</p>
<p>&rt;of course in the end it’s you’re decision, bodily autonomy is an important concept. i just think it’s the best bet</p>
<p>Agree and I'm relieved that you feel this way. Too many people want to mandate it or make life too intolerable to go without it.</p>

        <p>like i said in the above comment, the issue of natural vs vaccine immunity prolly needs to be researched more thoroughly before we have an answer either way since each source seems to have a different opinion. </p>
<p>and yep re-infections are less severe, that’s a valid point. however i stress the risk of infecting other people, especially immunocompromised individuals who may not experience as strong immunity as others from the vaccination, as those previously infected with covid continue to contract and spread the illness. </p>
<p>as such, the purpose of vaccination is to promote the health of those around you. if we reach herd immunity, then it’s likely that covid will be irrelevant in a few years anyway.</p>
<p>along that line of reasoning, a return to our previous way of living would be possible if this herd immunity is reached. so vaccination should be promoted.</p>
<p>the severe side effects after receiving a vaccine when you’ve previously have covid are described as similar to the second dose symptoms, it just means your body is reacting quickly and aggressively with the virus. nothing to be worried about, although unpleasant. (i had chest pain and extreme fatigue during my second dose but don’t regret it at all) </p>
<p>the flu shot bit was used to make a comparison, many people don’t get flu shots. but covid is comparatively more contagious and dangerous than the flu, so there’s added urgency in this situation.</p>
<p>glad we can agree about bodily autonomy tho</p>

        <p>We’re likely past herd immunity threshold already in the US when you consider at least half of the population has already been infected and thus has natural immunity, and there are many others that weren’t infected and have been vaccinated. Virtually everyone at risk for severe illness has been vaccinated, so as far as I’m concerned the pandemic is over in the USA and everything should be back to complete normal.</p>
<p>And Covid isn’t more dangerous than the flu, at least not anymore. In fact, the flu is well known to be more dangerous for children than COVID. My risk level is probably about even for both of them.</p>
<p>The pandemic is over. At risk people have been vaccinated, there’s no risk of overrunning the healthcare system, there’s no reason to keep anything closed or any mandates in place.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>

        <p>Imagine how much better it would’ve been without the television scaring people silly. If you’re sick stay home and you can’t pass it on to those who are vulnerable or old. Or if you’re vulnerable or old and you’re scared stay at home and let the world get on with life. Asymptomatic people do not drive pandemics so please stop with that modem myth too.</p>

        <p>It’s quite simple when you think about it like this - asymptomatic people were people who were given false positive test results. PCR tests were up to 93% false positives when the ct count used was 35 and above and the lateral flow test is around 50% false positives so I’ll let you do the math on that one.</p>

        <p>Well. If you understood anything and actually critically analyzed information, you probably wouldn't be in this subreddit. So yeah... I'll give one last try at educating a dumbass. First of all, it wasn't health secretary, it was Boris Johnson, prime minister. And he was talking about exclusively airport testing. The thing is that idiots spread the misinformation online and other idiots, aka you, read it. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-airport-idUSKBN27730G">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-airport-idUSKBN27730G</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In reality - Read even the abstract of this article: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080911v1.full">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080911v1.full</a></p>
<p>So the false positive rates are 0-16.7%</p>
<p>If you do any kind of proper research you'd find out that indeed the number of false positives has been rising. But that's because the number of cases has been dropping, but people are still testing a lot. So a larger amount of testing will mean more false positives. </p>
<p>Now go eat shit, idiot!</p>

        <p>Yeah, except that Florida is right now the place with the highest new cases count in the U.S and in Sweden's case, their PM publicly admitted that their tactic failed and too many people died. </p>

        <p>Who cares about the "case" counts? We're currently testing more than 1 million people per day in the US. At a 1-2% false positive rate, that's 10,000-20,000 false positives per day.</p>
<p>What matters are hospitalizations and fatalities. I'm sure Floridians prefer staying open and allowing people to get the sniffles for a couple of days. </p>
<p>Florida and Sweden both have similar death rates to other countries that did harsh lockdowns. Not sure how you can consider it a failure when there was nothing better.</p>
