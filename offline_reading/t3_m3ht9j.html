        <p>No one actually follows the science.  For example:</p>
<p>Alcohol is bad for you, kills your liver, leads to bad decisions, drunk driving and so on.  Yet billions of people drink (I drink)  Drugs are bad for you, yet tons of people do drugs (weed, hash, coke, dont get me started on prescription drugs).  Smoking is bad, yet billons smoke.  Exercise is good, yet billions dont get eanough exercise.  8 hours a day of sleep is necessary for your health, who gets that?  Fatty foods are bad for you, you should eat greens and tofu.  I could go on, your doctor will tell you this, you will leave his office and light a smoke and head for the nearest bar.  </p>
<p>The "scientists" will tell you whatever the person paying them (funding their research) wants the scientists to tell you.</p>

<p>While I agree with your overall point, this particular one turns out not to be the case. Ansel Keyes's original study had flawed data analysis, and this single mistake is what gave us the obesity epidemic. </p>

        <p>The term "Fat" I used is definitely open to interpretation.  There are good fats and bad fats, depending on who you talk to.<br>
My thought is: Eating large amounts of fast food (deep fried, greasy, Mc Donalds stuff) is on the whole not good for you.  You are a free man and can eat whatever makes you happy.</p>

        <p>One of the big things is that the old studies didn’t account for behavioral effects of different foods. In a lab study, you can only eat what’s provided. In the real world you have free reign. If you eat a servings of sugar or carbs in a lab, that’s it. You are what you got. In the real world you’d get hungry and then eat more. Fat makes you feel full and therefore not eat as much. </p>
<p>That being said, the pandemic was a real threat, the lockdowns and masks work, and the vaccines are safe. The pandemic is almost over. Y’all can chill.</p>

        <p>Perhaps if the variants don’t respond to the vaccine, but the mRNA tech allows for vaccines to be modified and rolled out more quickly. </p>
<p>I don’t really see the lockdowns existing past the near future. Mask mandates perhaps. But the better part of the pandemic is done, thanks to vaccinations and NPI’s. People will need to get new vaccines in the future for new variants. It will likely be rolled into the flu shot, much like the MMR vaccine. </p>
<p>Hopefully this new tech allows us to eradicate many other diseases too.</p>

        <p>What you are experiencing here <em>is</em> in fact supported by the data, but that's not why Ansel Keyes is wrong, or why fats are okay. </p>
<p>Ansel Keyes is wrong because Ansel Keyes is wrong, fats are not bad for your heart, period. (Except trans fats, and these do not occur in natural food in significant amounts.)</p>
<p>What <em>you</em> are noticing is different. You are noticing that highly processed foods, made of modified carbohydrates and nothing else, spike your insulin very high, are absorbed by your fat cells very rapidly, and you quickly have low blood sugar again. </p>
<p>You're right that you shouldn't eat ritz crackers. No one should. They are basically poison, along with pretty much all other processed food, like fruit juice, soda, table sugar, white bread, and <em>almost</em> everything that comes packaged with a nutrition label. </p>
<p>Ansel Keyes and his false conclusions about fat paved the way for the food pyramid, and for packaged, processed food made out of corn and soy components... which led to the obesity epidemic. </p>
<p>Basically, the greatest mass poisoning in human history that I am aware of. </p>
<p>Since I learned the biochemistry behind this several years ago (and I can explain in excruciating detail if you like), I've been quite vehement about it. Almost fanatical. It's just so very frustrating to see people suffer, while continuing to do the same things and made them fat and sick in the first place, because most of society is telling them it's okay, or that it's actually good for them. </p>
<p>I wince whenever I hear the words "juice cleanse".</p>

        <p>I think it’s a bit much to call crackers “poisonous”. Our species clearly evolved with access to sugar and grains, but I would agree that in the amounts most people consume carbs, yeah, it’s comparable to poison. </p>
<p>My girlfriend and I are starting a keto-lite diet after the coming snowstorm, so I’ve read up a bit on it, but I’d like to hear what you have to say on it.</p>

        <p>I hope you're right but I just heard Biden say one more year, Gates and Fauci say end of 2022, and read 2027 on Bloomberg, and read Klaus Scwab say what we knew as normal has been killed by Corona Virus.</p>
<p>MSM coined the term "new normal" not us. Just think about what that phrase implies. Lock downs, masks, social ~~distancing~~ isolation, "non-essential" business closures, "non-essential" medical procedures canceled, etc. is now normal. Not temporary measures. Not temporary abnormal.</p>
<p>They are saying this is it. This is normal now. No more in person learning. No more gatherings with people from outside your household. No more visiting grandparents. No more amusement parks, concerts, parks, dining out, bars, clubs, raves, going out to movies. Only Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Amazon, etc. for shopping...  Every once in a while they'll relax the rules, then clamp down harder than before... Is that the future you want?</p>

        <p>Lol, dude.... no. I’m not playing that game where you imply that I want life to shut down, like I want the social/emotional equivalent of a bread-and-water diet. </p>
<p>Nobody is using the term “new normal” to mean “we’re never allowing concerts or knee replacements anymore”. Just that we’ve been in a pandemic long enough it’s become mundane and boring (“normal” if you will).  The pandemic is on its way out. The vaccine is making a major impact. Transmission is massively down. Masks helped quite a bit too. </p>
<p>My mom was a doctor at Illinois State. After the SARS outbreak in the 2000’s, she was asked to take 6 months off, research some stuff, go to some meetings, collaborate with an epidemiologist, and write a Pandemic Response Plan. She was consulted on Illinois’s PRP, and part of her plan was adapted for the state. </p>
<p>I grew up hearing that this would happen someday. Pretty much everything has been a shot for shot unfolding of what she said to expect. The only real difference is that the CDC changed their minds on masks. When you lot talk about how Fauci should be put on trial or some aggressive shit like that, I think about being a teenager, with my mom at the kitchen table, papers and charts spread everywhere, typing away on an old laptop. </p>
<p>The lockdowns and pandemic response isn’t some devious plan to subjugate the nation. It’s a prudent, sensible response to disease, a response as old as civilization and supported by virtually a unanimous, international medical community. It’s not designed by nefarious deepstate monsters. It’s designed by little old ladies who spent years and years studying medicine and disease, who cared incredibly deeply for the well-being of the public.</p>

        <p>Knee replacements are not trivial, and even in the US, people have lost access to potentially life-saving healthcare and support, which just makes no sense as a plan that is meant to be about health.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s not designed by nefarious deepstate monsters.</p>
<p>I agree. I think that 'the greater good', that takes no account of individuals, is in itself monstrous, the intentions don't help make it any better. This kind of thinking never ends even by actually serving the greater good, and is often skewed by very biased underlying assumptions about what that means. Usually, even acknowledged tyrants don't set out to be, they think they are only doing what is for the greater good, and what is within their rights to do, to other people.</p>
<p>Much of these is well outside the remit of public health. It can work out that denying an elderly person in a care home visitors for a year reduces their risk of catching covid, it can't tell them if it was worth it. I find it surprising someone with your username seems to want a state to decide this?</p>

        <p>You’re right. Knee replacements are not trivial. And they’re done on precisely the kind of person who is most at risk from covid. They really shouldn’t be going into hospitals for that right now. And most older folks have chosen themselves to avoid that kind of thing, though some have insisted on pretending covid isn’t happening. </p>
<p>Regardless, conservatives have spent the last few decades ensuring business have expanded, protected, explicit rights to turn away patrons for all sorts of reasons. Often without even having to justify themselves. Hospitals often don’t want unnecessary surgeries atm, and as many of them are privately owned, or at least not publicly owned, it’s frankly not your right to tell them that they <em>must</em> do something.</p>

        <p>Alcohol in large quantity is bad for you. Narcotic drugs in any dose(in most cases) are bad for you. Prescription/Non narcotic drugs in amounts greater than what is needed is bad for. In general, overdose of any drug/beverage/food is bad for you and in some cases is deadly. Smoking is bad for you whether you do it seldom or often. Exercise is good for you. People dont follow because they are lazy. They want to do what they are comfortable with. At the end of day, its your health and I couldn't care less. But when you do something that affects others in a bad way for no fault of their own, then you are a problem. </p>
<p>Atleast half the people where i live follow 'the science' when it comes to the above situations. When it comes to covid, 95% of the people i have seen wear a mask and follow the instructions.</p>

        <p>These people you’re responding to only see black and white, and probably just read the click-bait headlines to form their opinions. Like for instance, the actual person you’re responding to seems to think scientists are responsible for allowing alcoholism/drug-use to exist, and don’t do enough to say it’s bad for you (I think? I don’t know maybe he’s high or drunk). Scientists DO have a say in the best way to prevent a fucking pandemic that is overcrowding hospitals, and killing people. This sub is a sad look at anti-intellectualism.</p>

        <p>That would be true if wearing a mask only protected yourself. But choosing not to wear a mask endangers others, which makes it less akin to drinking yourself to death and more akin to drinking while driving and killing someone else in the process</p>
<p>You don’t seem to get that endangering yourself and endangering others are two very different things. Why am I allowed to smoke but not in public spaces? Because it’s okay for me to give myself lung cancer but not okay for me to give it to others. It’s really not hard to understand</p>

        <p>As they are all ignoring regulations and having maskless parties, maybe it will. Would be nice to live in a world without sheep who hear one conspiracy theory on the internet and don’t have any brains to do anything other than accept it blindly</p>
<p>If everyone were to do telework there would be no one to do delivering. There are also not an infinite number of jobs allowing remote work. Plus, do you know how much more expensive it is to order food in for every meal? Not everyone can afford such luxuries</p>
<p>It’s also less me that I’m worried about and more my family. I have four grandparents, a mother who’s getting up there, a sister who is immune compromised, and multiple family members and friends working in healthcare. You don’t have the right to endanger any of them when a simple act of wearing a piece of cloth on your face would keep them safe.</p>
<p>You are a selfish, ignorant baby, and obviously stupid as you haven’t addressed my point I’ve made multiple times now about why it’s not okay to endanger peoples lives by driving drunk but it is somehow okay to unnecessarily go around giving them a deadly virus. Although maybe that’s because you think it <em>is</em> okay to drive drunk. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone like you sided with murderers</p>
<p>Also I know you have worn a mask. I bet you anything when you can’t hide behind a screen you do as you’re told because no one would let you into stores or anywhere you need to go if you didn’t. You’re all talk and an asshole to boot.</p>

        <p>It’s the difference between doing something that harms yourself and doing something that harms others. You’re allowed to harm yourself, you’re not allowed to harm others... it’s pretty straightforward and kind of the backbone of functioning society. </p>

        <p>First: they're mask MANDATES, not laws. Learn the difference.</p>
<p>Second: you can in-fact CHOOSE to not wear a seatbelt. There are laws against it (awful ones,) but you can make that decision.</p>
<p>Third: I mean, I'm sure no one WANTS the rona, or ANY illness for that matter, but funny thing about getting sick...it happens whether you want it to or not :)</p>
<p>Last: obviously you CAN give the rona to others, regardless of any arbitrary regulations...otherwise, how does it spread??? Funny enough, prior to this past year, people still spread diseases to each other, and I would wager most were involuntarily. Yet, we weren't up in arms then...we didn't have ridiculous <strong>mandates</strong> telling us how to live our lives. </p>
<p>People still died, and when this is over, people will continue to die. It's your job as an autonomous being to decide FOR YOURSELF what is and isn't healthy for <strong>YOU</strong>. If you are so afraid of the risks of leaving your house...don't. Or if you "have to", wear a hazmat suit. You have options.</p>

        <p>&rt; Can you choose not to wear a seatbelt? No, because you dramatically increase the risk of others being harmed physically and of high insurance costs. </p>

        <p>Can we stop saying "the science"? That term is irrational and misleading. Either models accurately describe and predict outcomes in the world, or they don't. Miasma was "the science" for a long time. Nothing is beyond questioning.</p>

        <p>Bakunin warned, freedom should not be subject to science,  but science should be subject to the freedom of people. That doesn't mean that we make up whatever fits us, rather we should not use science as a form of total control over others. Oppression comes in many forms, religious, political, social economic and intellectual. Be warned.</p>

        <p>in an increasingly atheistic society we have begun the change to new forms of worship. everyone nowadays wants to live forever, healthcare professionals are the key ingredient to living a longer life via drugs/treatments. people are deifying them like the priests and “miracle workers” from centuries past.</p>

        <p>Know what I was thinking roughly the same thing. A lot of people want a longer life because the life their living now isn't a good life. Im not religious but I can see that a lot of the reasons why people are so unhappy nowadays is they have nothing to believe in. I think people are trying to use science to fill the gap and eternal life is their version of an afterlife. I'd rather live a good life for 40 years than live a mediocre life for 1000 years.</p>

They follow politicians who claim to follow the science so they cannot be held responsible for the decisions they take, or the media who claim to follow the science to create big headlines which invoke fear, outrage and hysteria, because that is what sells, keeps people watching them and getting them clicks.</p>

<h1>'In all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks.' - A. Fauci</h1>
<p>This is the good doctor stating what we all knew then and now - Healthy people are not sick, and we should not treat them that way, as even if they are secretly ill, they are not causing the situation to worsen.</p>
<p>“it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.”  -  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO.</p>
<p>“The evidence that we have, given the percentage of people, which is about 25, 45% of the totality of infected people likely are without symptoms, and we know from epidemiological studies that they can transmit to someone who is uninfected.”    - Fauci</p>
<p>What's going on here, is that the WHO told the truth, and Fauci argued, against all of the cumulative evidence in the history of respiratory disease (that even he previously agreed with), that Dr. Kerkhove is wrong.  He didn't provide evidence, he just changed his mind to drive the propaganda ship in the direction it needed to go to suit the aims of the death cult.  </p>
<p>Fauci is the quack, homie.</p>

If my degree was worthless you literally wouldn’t be wasting your day spreading misinformation on Reddit through your electronic device. Also, the science community is continually at odds with each other... it’s how science gets done. Of course it’s not infallible.

<p>&rt; Scientists are constantly changing their minds when presented with new findings. </p>
<p>If they're good scientists, they are.  Here are some examples that demonstrate that the medical field, in particular, has enough conflicts of interest to have shit the bed in terms of credibility.  Following the science, without bias, has led me right here...</p>
<p>"<em>The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue."</em>   <strong>-Richard Horton, Editor in chief of The Lancet</strong>  <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1/fulltext</a></p>
<p><em>"Between two-thirds and three-quarters of the trials published in the major journals - Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, and New England of Medicine - are funded by the industry."</em>  <strong>-Richard Smith, Editor for the British Medical Journal</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020138"><strong>https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020138</strong></a></p>
<p><em>"It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgement of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor at the New England Journal of Medicine."</em>   <strong>-Marcia Angell, MD, former Editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine."</strong></p>

<p>If the heads of the world's three leading medical journals agree to the extent that "the science" can be manipulated, I think we should listen to them.  </p>

        <p>Man, I triggered a bunch of snowflakes in wallstreetbets today...All I did was tell someone to weigh the risks before they get the vaccine.  Consider the risk level for your group vs the risk of a new vaccine and possible side effects.  I said I was pro vaccines etc, which is true, and literally only told people to think for themselves.  They really hated that lol.</p>

        <p>Based. Of course, and it's funny to see the politicization of many modern "studies" that don't follow the scientific method or go through the scrutiny of peer review. And the ones that do usually tell something totally different than what mainstream media reports on.</p>

        <p>One does get very tired of people who use the word "science" like religious people use the word "Jesus"... as a sort of abstract authority that they claim says whatever they actually want to hear. </p>
<p>But heaven forbid you should actually ask them to cite a study, or explain just <em>how</em> their claim works. </p>
<p>Science is not a body of data, a bunch of people, or an institution. It's a <em>method</em> of systematic observing things and reporting the results. And if you are not following it, you're not doing science, no matter how many times you use the words "science", or "expert".</p>

        <p>What numbers?  The numbers I see are 26 total deaths in New Zealand (0.00000528 per capita), a country that took the coronavirus seriously.  Compared to the US, a country with fuck-sticks like you who try to deny the science and refuse to wear a mask, which now has 530,000 deaths, (.0017 per capita).  That's a 33,284% difference in mortality per capita.</p>
<p>Or were you talking about the numbers showing that counties opting out of mask mandates saw a 100% increase in new cases compared to counties that accepted the mask mandate and saw a 6% decrease? <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/social-media/mm6947e2_KSMaskMandateCOVID19_IMAGE_20Nov20_1200x675-medium.jpg">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/social-media/mm6947e2_KSMaskMandateCOVID19_IMAGE_20Nov20_1200x675-medium.jpg</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm</a></p>

        <p>Or maybe it's because cloth masks (which most people are using) are only effective at preventing the person wearing it from spreading it to others, not the other way around.  </p>
<p>If I'm wearing a cloth mask and you aren't and I have covid, you won't get sick because my cloth masks prevents the particles coming from my nose and mouth from traveling as far (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNeYfUTA11s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNeYfUTA11s</a>) -- That's assuming you're socially distanced, the particles still travel just not as far.</p>
<p>If I'm wearing a cloth mask and you aren't and you have covid, I absolutely could get sick because the cloth mask doesn't prevent me from contracting the virus, only spreading it.  In this case social distancing alone isn't enough, your unobstructed particles travel a much greater distance than ones slowed by a mask.</p>

        <p>When weak people try to bully others, they can only do it by collaborating with existing systems of opression. They don't have enough strength to just bully someone by themselves, they need the government &amp; public opinion to help them. Those are the moments they feel powerful. They don't care about the fact that this power is totally useless to them, it's the feeling of power that they crave, not power itself.</p>

        <p>They cherry pick the worst of the worst in this thread, and that's how they paint their picture, at least this isn't a subreddit that glorifies and swoons over "total pieces of shit"</p>
<p>There is some genuinely good tidbits shared here, and some great insight to what life is like for others around the globe, Sometimes I don't always agree with things here, but that's the point of discussion.</p>
<p>People shouldn't be ostracized for wanting to live like a normal human being, and it's frustrating that we now live in a time where you will be ridiculed if you think otherwise; we just want things to go back to normal, and sometimes that means going against what we are told to believe.</p>

        <p>I'd imagine that most people like this either never had a strong role model to teach them the value of agreeing to disagree or they were never told the word "no". That'll be why the mere thought of an opposing opinion triggers them. Up until adulthood they'd never encountered nor conceded one.</p>

        <p>Because it's not meant to be a new normal, it's meant to be simple measures (like *gasp* wearing a small piece of cloth over your nose and mouth) that prevent people from dying.  Once everyone gets vaccinated this "new normal" gets completely abandoned.</p>
<p>And note, we don't actually have to get everyone vaccinated to go back, if the entire country had gone into lockdown for 2 weeks the virus would have completely died off in the country and we could've been back to the way things were in 2 weeks instead of over a year.</p>
<p>Look at New Zealand, they shut down hard when the virus first breached their country, but then they were back to normal like the virus didn't exist, because for them it didn't since everyone stayed home and stopped the spread until the virus was completely eradicated.  They've been having full stadium sports events and life as usual since.</p>

<p>A "real lockdown" is impossible. You would have to put the military on every street, shooting people on sight.</p>
<p>No jobs would be "essential", so forget about emergency services. Sick with covid? No hospital for you. Heart attack? Dead. Stroke? Cya. Fire? Your block's burnt down now.</p>
<p>Power stations don't keep working without people manning them, so no electricity after a couple days. Better hope it doesn't get cold enough to need to heat your home.</p>
<p>Sure hope you stocked up on 2 weeks worth of drinking water, since those pumps don't work without electricity.</p>
<p>The internet doesn't exactly work without electricity either, so even those jobs that can be worked from home aren't going to happen. And of course, no Netflix. Hope you've got books and candlelight to read them by.</p>

        <p>The geopolitical situation is key there. We did have two week lockdowns in much of Europe, but we're so interconnected, it was always going to be too little, two late. Here in the UK, I've actually lost track of how long the current lockdown has lasted at this point, and before that there were heavy restrictions. We can't close borders like NZ, it would result in food rationing and serious drug shortages, not to mention the political issues, we already had this discussion with Brexit.</p>
<p>There will, at this point, be a 'new normal', because a lot of that damage is done and things will just not bounce back, all we can do is push back against the government making it any worse, with more austerity and attempts to privatise our health service.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>

Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.

        <p>Why are you speaking as though the States took no precautions? Many states did employ hard lockdowns among many other methods. There's also no clear advantage to hard lockdowns in terms of deaths per million, for example. When you factor in the increase in deaths from causes like suicide, murders and ODs, lockdowns become even more dubious IMO.</p>

        <p>Quarantine after traveling between US states was on the honor system and not enforced. Mask use is on the honor system. People are free to dine indoors with people from other households.  </p>
<p>Due to immense pressure,  states would hold off implementing restrictions for 7 to 15 days. Some states had little to no restrictions and people were free to travel. My state, NY, widely considered liberal,  school has been open since September,  and restrictions on businesses are minimal. And our cases the last few months have been among the worst in the USA </p>
<p>Compliance with restrictions in the USA has been moderate at best, because too many are worried about themselves and not the general community. </p>
<p>Many countries have proven that restrictions need to be immediately implemented and fully complied with when any community spread is detected. The quicker its implemented, the shorter the restriction period.</p>
<p>Americans have proven they are unwilling to work together and do the hard work to beat this virus, as plenty of countries have done.  Without the vaccines American deaths would have been in the millions.</p>

<p>Eeeh...how many of y'all are there, again? Nothing personal, but if we had the option to get the lot, it would <em>be</em> a 'precaution', in a manner of speaking...</p>
<p>We did lockdown in the UK, and we've been in one again since the start of January, and it's not going to end for months yet. It didn't stop this, and it's killed people. They never even told us it'd end the pandemic, just 'flatten the curve'. I'm not sure how closely you're following what other countries do, here cancer patients aren't being treated and screenings aren't being done, as a life-preserving decision, this does not seem like a good one.</p>

<p>So we need to arrest all democrat senators who put young sick people into old folk homes right?</p>
<p>&rt;How many US deaths would it take to want to take precautions, five million, or it doesn’t matter?</p>
<p>Around 330 million.</p>
<p>&rt;So many Americans dead because we fail to understand what many other countries do,</p>
<p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 400K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>

<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

<p>“ From December 31, 2017, through December 29, 2018, 2,831,836 Americans died from all causes. From December 30, 2018, to December 28, 2019, 2,845,792 deaths were reported, a small increase. From January 5, 2020, through January 2 of 2021, 3,332,482 people died. That is an increase of 479,050 or 17%, compared to the year before.”</p>
<p>Important to note, the highest surge of covid deaths was AFTER 1/2/21, so when this statistic is extended forward, the proof will be even more dramatic.</p>
<p>People need to lie to themselves to justify risk taking and the result is other people die, good luck when it’s your time to meet your maker.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the deaths from things such as flu, heart disease, cancer, etc have dropped considerably since last year. To near 0 in some cases. </p>
<p>On top of that, lockdowns are deadly. There's been a huge increase in suicides, mental health issues, alcoholism, drug abuse, people stopped exercising, masks allow easier crimes, and people stopped going to the doctor and are less likely to be diagnosed with a disease in time to be saved. </p>
<p>Many surgeries were cancelled resulting in deaths. Really at the end of the day, it would be silly to think the total amount of deaths didn't go up. </p>
<p>However there's no link to the WuFlu.</p>

        <p>There has been an estimated 30% rise for homicides in 2020, which would account for a few thousand more deaths,  hardly a dent in the 460k overall increase.</p>
<p>Statistics for 2020 suicide deaths are not clear and if there were an increase in suicide deaths,  it's just a likely they were indirectly caused by covid (loss of a job or death among family or friends).</p>
<p>Actual stats say 2020 deaths went up by 460k and a medical test documents 350k of these victims were infected with covid.</p>
<p>In 2016 we elected a president who refuses to tell the full truth about anything, refuses to consider science or facts, and unfortunately that line of thinking has infected American culture, and alot more of us are dead as a result.</p>

<p>Oh no. The elites are quite excited about pushing the "New Normal" and have been since about March 2020. I guess you've also not noticed all the WFH Karens, particularly school teachers, that have been vocal about how they enjoy this new lifestyle of half-assed "working" in their pajamas and with a glass of wine in their hand, and they never want it to end. They will be dragged back to the office kicking and screaming.</p>

<p>Oh really? </p>
<p>&rt;The challenge is that as we emerge from the pandemic the pressure to go back to ‘Business As Usual’ will intensify. But people don’t want to go back. Only 23%<em> of the UK public believe following lockdown, advertising should encourage people to consume, shop and fly like before lockdown. 77%</em> believe it is the industry’s responsibility to encourage people to behave more sustainably like during lockdown.</p>

<p>What evidence lol. Surgeons only wore masks during surgery to protect the surgeon blood splatter, and <em>bacteria</em> from saliva getting into open wounds. Nothing to do with viruses, because they do fuck all for viruses. No, not viruses riding on "MUH DROPLETS" either. </p>
<p>Hazmat suits and respirators are not comparable to cloth masks you disingenuous asshole. Yes, if we all wore that, maybe it would do something, but that's a bit ridiculous. "The experts" just told us to put on any old face covering (until they started recommending 2 masks! wait, doesn't that imply.... oh, nevermind). I don't believe the government ever sent me a hazmat suit to wear. </p>
<p>Here's the CDC evidence I was talking about. I'll actually cite my sources unlike you. Mask mandates were associated with a 2% reduction in the <em>growth</em> of cases! Much wow! <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm?s_cid=mm7010e3_w">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm?s_cid=mm7010e3_w</a> </p>
<p>Why are you so confident that masks are the main reason for Japan's success? Couldn't it have been other factors? Also, there are many other countries which had masks and also had bad outcomes. Same with blue states here in the US. You'd think if masks were so clearly effective, there would be a more consistent trend in the outcomes of places! Alas! Also if the "virus experts who have studied this likely longer than you have been alive" knew that masks were so effective prior to March 2020, why didn't they recommend wearing them for bad flu seasons in the past?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

        <p>Do you remember The Before Times? I know it's been a while, but it was a time when people acknowledged influenza existed, stayed home when they felt sick, stayed away from people they knew were sick, and if you caught the flu from someone you know, you didn't even think about where to place blame. Well, I don't know, maybe you needed to blame someone, but most people accepted it as a part of life, along with all the risks that came with catching a virus, including death.</p>
<p>We are not denying science or fact here, we are denying Tony Fauci and the WHO's new and ever-changing science. Most of the scientific studies I see on reddit are in the subs you've been told to think are far right, extremist or full of conspiracy theorists, and mainly this one.</p>

        <p>Yea most are pcr false positives too.  And if no symptoms not enough viral loads to infect, aka science.   The biggest study did contact tracing and out of 300 people who were supposedly asymptomatic,  zero others got infected.   This whole  ruse is predicated on non sick people wearing masks, which is the main point of this sub.  No one has a issue with wearing a mask and quarantining when acutally sick.  And when you look at locations that force masks vs that do not, same results.  Yet you doomers ignore that and say the religious,  follow the science without knowing what science is.</p>

        <p>It is now coming out that "asymptomatic spread" is massively overblown. Asymptomatic people infecting others occurs very rarely. Even Lord Fauci said that asymptomatics are not the driver of outbreaks in September 2020. You'd know all this if you actually followed the science like I do. Oh, and obviously, asymptomatics was the whole justification for making the entire population wear masks and shelter in place... so that should make you think for a second...</p>

        <p>Let me take a second to quote some of the people on this post’s comment section alone:</p>
<p>“Why are these pussies so offended”</p>
<p>“Go do your Zoom homework kiddos!”</p>
<p>“Because they’re brainless sheep”</p>
<p>“ it scares them that the world view that has been manufactured and forced down their throats their whole life could actually be a load of shit”</p>
<p>“I just have to laugh at things like this”</p>
<p>“No! Only The Holy Experts can do research!”</p>
<p>“They are entrenched in their ideology. These are the sickest people. Modern day conformists.”</p>
<p>The point is, neither side is helping much. Honestly, I’ve done enough research to conclude I think my family and I are perfectly safe without the measures, but I still take these precautions because other people feel safer with them. Also, if you want people to do their own research, cite your sources and their reliability. Please, do it</p>

Perhaps we should consider the 1 in 4 false positive and false negative rates in the tests? What about situations like New York where the sick were sent to nursing homes?</p>

<p>Here is where the CDC states "DO NOT use facemasks."</p>
<p>http://archive.today/RKdWc 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/84900</p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

<p>WHO does not recommend masks
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.

http://archive.today/4SGYt</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>
<p>http://archive.is/CfQBO</p>
<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

<p>University of Minnesota CIDRAP
"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

<p>“Because we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,” she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants.</p>
<p>“That’s how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,” Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days."</p>

Through elementary and middle school all the kids I knew would just roam the neighborhood and the woods for hours and no one thought anything of it. The only way for our parents to contact us was to scream our names and hope we heard them, or get some other neighborhood kid to look for us to give us a message... </p>
<p>Now that I think about it, that was just as much freedom for our parents as it was for us lol..</p>

        <p>It's not an extremist position. We all want to go to the prepandemic era and be able to ditch the mask, but if we do that now we're risking higher levels of infection. In a perfect world where we all get vaccinated, like with measles and chickenpox and smallpox and tetanus, we won't have to deal with that bad infection anymore and can open up in a month if we all got our vaccines.</p>

        <p>Well... I thought the frame of reference was pretty obvious. Currently 159,000+ cases confirmed in the United States, but for simplicity let's round down to 10,000. In a room with 350,000,000 people, there are 10,000 people who have covid19, either asymptomatic or otherwise. If we let them all roam free with no masks, no sanitizer, and no distance between them in social interactions, then each person in the room will eventually contract covid19. On a smaller scale, say there are 5,000 people spread across a state of 5 million people who are carrying covid19. Over time, as we conduct ourselves as we would before 2020, cases of covid19 would skyrocket because of the lack of precautions to stop the spread of an infectious disease.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was that far-fetched to just use basic epidemiology that we've all learned when we were kids. The more people interact without precautions, the higher the infection rate in a known infectious strand of diseases.</p>

        <p>Cases have always been a miserably inaccurate metric to the point of being useless.  The way we define and detect them tells us basically nothing.  Furthermore, a term like "higher" is relative by definition.  You would first need to define what level is acceptable (which, again, should not be based on cases anyway).</p>

        <p>Which is why I decided to be miserably inaccurate for the sake of argument. I knew that would pop up at some point, but infections spread exponentially. 1 infected individual doesn't just infect one more person and suddenly stop being contagious, but for the sake of argument, let's say that's reality.</p>
<p>1 person infects another person. 2 people are now sick. Two people infect one person each. 4 people are now sick. 4 -&rt; 8 -&rt; 16 -&rt; 32 -&rt; 64 -&rt; 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, then we're in the 16,000s, the 32,000s, the 64,000s, the 128,000s, and slowly but surely that 159k number that is on google (for my state) starts to make sense. The country number is closer to 30 million total current cases, so just start one infected person in every state and the already exponential infection rate grows even more exponentially (eg, (n^2)*50 instead of just n^2). Obviously, one person can infect more than one person at a time, so this is even more true, especially considering social circles and the people you may have contact with in your day-to-day. </p>
<p>The way I'm using higher is not a static number, it's a rate. The current rate of infection can be calculated by taking an objective measure of time and then find the amount of cases within that measure of time. In this case, I will be using cases per day, and measure the past 7 days (in my state alone, but you can imagine the country's numbers). </p>
<p>New cases in the last 7 days, starting from March 12: 481, 289, 331, 418, 261, 187, and 178, which gives us an average of 306 new cases in 7 days. 306 / 24h is an average daily infection rate of 12.75%. Repeating this process for the week before (Feb 26 to Mar 5) gives us the 7 day average of 298 new cases. 298 / 24h = 12.41%. These are actually pretty low infection rates, but my state is only just now recovering from infection rates as high as 63.92% (1,534 new cases in 7d avg, dec 5 2020) and 54.5% (1,308 in 7d avg, jan 14 2021). I wouldn't say 12.75% is "tolerable," but I will say that it's a lot lower and in the range I'd like to stay at. Those high rates are what happens when Oregonians try to open up too fast, or march closely in the streets with no mask, or riot in portland with no mask. Opening up to the public and lowering restrictions without a vaccine is directly associated with a spike in covid19 infection rates, which is the basis of what I'm trying to convey.</p>

        <p>we haven’t been locked down, had a mask mandate or pretty much any major restriction for a few months now, and the last one was because a patient gave false information. </p>

<p>And if that's all we were expected to do for this <em>respiratory virus</em>, I think you'd find that this board wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>You've made your bed. I now fully expect you to wear a mask and STAY. THE. FUCK. HOME. every year during flu PaNdEMiC season.</p>
<p>&rt; also, the flu has a tried-and-tested vaccine.</p>
<p>It's literally a guess at which strain is going to be prevalent in the year it's released, and even then it has 40-50% efficacy. But sure, "tried-and-tested".</p>

        <p>i’m sorry, what else are you being subjected to, other than anti-freedom masks?</p>
<p>the flu is a virus that humans have 1) had a chance to build some form of immunity against; even when the strain changes, the basic genetic makeup is the same, which means that herd immunity can do its thing, and 2) have a vaccine which is, by your unnamed sources (i’d like to see that source by the way), 50% effective, further increasing that herd immunity, AS LONG AS EVERYONE GETS IT. </p>
<p>with covid, nobody had any immunity, it spread in unpredictable ways, and killed more than 300,000 americans. now it’s mutated, we could take that knowledge and prevent or at least restrict the damage, but unfortunately people on this board are likely to let it happen again.</p>

<p>It's so simple, right? Just mask up and STAY. THE. FUCK. HOME. every flu season. One death is too many! Staying home and wearing masks is <em>so damn easy</em> that you should have no problem doing so every year.</p>

        <p>Being “called out” for having wrong information or a differing opinion on Reddit or Twitter means that you get verbally attacked. Doesn’t really matter what the topic is, being polite and cordial isn’t really a thing anymore. </p>
<p>In regards to the pandemic, people think this sub is full of people who don’t think masks work for any sort of sickness and are pandemic deniers but that’s not true. Some people think that way but they’re the minority tbh. </p>
<p>We often use CDC statistics as our sources and it’s not like we can manipulate those statistics to fit our narrative. </p>
<p>This sub is full of people who are exhausted from this pandemic just like everyone else. However, we’re suspicious of what the government will do/ is doing to take away even more freedoms from people. They chip away at freedom every time a tragedy rolls around and it’s not like the pandemic is any different. That’s really the main concern that this sub is trying to get at. </p>
<p>They want people to be suspicious of the government and to make sure that they’re reading statistics and not allowing the government to take more control over our lives.</p>

        <p>If that’s the point of the subreddit, I certainly am not getting a good introduction.
I am in an argument with a guy who is insulting me based on my username, spouting absolute bullshit and telling me I should take a walk so as not to be in the ‘risk group’.
Wearing a mask takes nothing - NOTHING - from your ‘freedom’. Period. If you think it does, you are not just an asshole, you are also a huge moron.</p>

        <p>Sure it does. Freedom of expression. Literally expression. Facial expressions are a big part of communication.  People are hurting, depression has skyrocketed. Frankly, I don't know how you're missing the greater societal impact. It's huge and there's been no indication that it's changing anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Being mandated to wear the mask by the government is the issue. Americans don’t like being mandated to do things by the government, it makes us resentful and suspicious. </p>
<p>Like, I happily wore my mask when it was recommended to. I loved being able to go outside with my face covered and not be judged.  Made me more comfortable around cameras tbh. </p>
<p>Now it just makes me angry that it’s being forced on me. It’s taking away my freedom to choose whether or not to wear a mask. The government is dictating what I wear or else I’ll be labeled as an outcast and “killer” by society. </p>
<p>I don’t think being mandated to wear a mask did anything but make people resent the masks, purposely not wear them, and further mistrust the government. I doubt we’d be having this issue with masks if it was a choice to wear them. </p>
<p>Btw, I also don’t agree with how those people responded to you. I think it causes people to discredit us immediately.</p>

Also case rates haven't significantly dropped in any single jurisdiction following the implementation of a mask mandate.

        <p>Yep. The very idea that others may have different ideas and points of view is incomprehensible to them, so they lash out. They demand conformity because non-conformity makes them uncomfortable - even though a majority probably see themselves as non-conformists who simply think alike, vote alike, dress alike...</p>

        <p>It's because they have no substance to their beliefs, it's all just knee jerk reaction type of thinking. They are very fragile and reject all evidence that contradicts their ideas. They couldn't invite criticism because it would literally shatter their very flimsy world view</p>

<p>&rt;<em>The very idea that others may have different ideas and points of view is incomprehensible to them, </em>so they lash out.*</p>
<p>But I think it's kind of ironic that you'd say that seeing how many anti-maskers have attacked people simply for doing their job of requesting them to comply to the rules of a private property. *</p>
<p>&rt;<em>They demand conformity because non-conformity makes them uncomfortable</em></p>
<p>&rt;A person who rejects things just out of the desire to be “different” still conforms as their life, like that of the more typical conformist, is still shaped by an external source, that being the crowd. True nonconformity, in contrast, is displayed to the degree that one’s life path, and thus character, are shaped by behaviors, beliefs, and values which are chosen for personal or authentic reasons. In many cases this will entail the adoption of things considered socially acceptable, but the nonconformist adopts them because they understand their utility, while the conformist adopts them merely out of the desire to be accepted.</p>
<p>https://academyofideas.com/2017/06/psychology-of-conformity/</p>
<p>I couldn't have put it better. I've been laughed at for wearing a mask more than I've been praised, either way I don't care I'll still wear it. </p>
<p>Probably even after, just to spite you and your kind but that would make me a conformist just like you and it's not my thing :l</p>
<p>&rt;<em>non-conformists who simply think alike, vote alike, dress alike...</em></p>
<p>Sorry but that's just fake intellectualism. It doesn't matter how many people ended up with the same conclusions as long as they ended up with these conclusions on their own using the informations they gathered.</p>

        <p>I mean, that's objectively disprovable. Not accusing you of doing it, but there's many videos of anti-maskers attacking verbally and physically workers asking them to wear a mask because of the mask mandate or because of the company policies.</p>

        <p>Yes, you're right. It's something I know that sometimes gets lost in these discussion. I'm an advocate of choice and firmly believe businesses should be able to set policy. I would imagine, for liability with employees and customers, they might require masks and social distancing.</p>

        <p>What hypocrisy have I shown? I’ve simply just asked about your opinions and you’ve given me fairly sarcastic responses. </p>
<p>If you must know, we, in the UK, are in fact staying home with strict guidelines in place for our easing of lockdown including a mass testing infrastructure in place. So I’m not too sure how that’s hypocritical. And I do believe in the fact that a mandated lockdown has greatly decreased the number of people who have contracted COVID-19 and the evidence does show this relationship. The UK government has put together a clear infographic showing so and if you’re skeptical about our government statistics (I know you would be and rightly so- I don’t blame you for being skeptical), there are independent organisations gathering their own statistics and making their own infographics showing the same decrease in positive COVID tests since the start of our recent lockdown.</p>

        <p>I thought this might be the case. Remember earlier when I mentioned traffic laws and how we all agree to abide by them to protect each other.

        <p>I’m assuming in this analogy. You having your very own car relates to you simply refusing to adjust to the pandemic, including but not limited to: refusing to stay at home, refusing social distancing measures, actively meeting with large groups of people. Whereas me selling my car is inherently me obeying responsible lockdown rules. </p>
<p>Let’s stay in this analogy. Let’s say I sold my car. I stayed at home. I come out only for the bare necessities. You still have a car and you refuse to sell it because you feel so entitled to it. However, you can still run me over when I come out the house. You can still give me the virus when you actively refuse to wear a mask and social distance inside a supermarket. Do you see where I’m getting at here? It’s hard with your piece of shit analogy.</p>

        <p>It's not an analogy, bud.</p>
<p>&rt; "Why don't you literally make your own families safer" is more accurate.</p>
<p>Selling your car would also make your own family safer as it would eliminate the risk of being in a car accident. Therefore you must sell your car, or else you want your family to die. We apparently live in a world now where zero risk is tolerable. Sell your car.</p>

        <p>There’s a fallacy here. We’re debating whether following lockdown rules would greatly benefit you and your family. Just because we’re defending the use of lockdowns doesn’t mean we believe that lockdowns are zero-risk. I never claimed risk-benefit analysis never existed. That’s something you decided to assume. But the truth is that lockdowns are greatly beneficial to the population in the long run at the cost of personal sacrifices. We are continually adjusting lockdown rules to appease those who are making the sacrifices as we gather more data. We ease rules when the data shows that there’s less risk while balancing our costs.</p>

<p>Also the studies comparing the chances of being in a fatal car crash vs. getting covid and dying from it, which should then draw the logical conclusion that those under the age of 50 should avoid driving since it's far more deadly to them than covid would be.</p>

        <p>I see you editing comments. Again. You have a fallacy in your argument still. Fatal car crashes and contracting COVID are independent events. But that’s besides the point. The argument is still about whether lockdown rules protect the population. And the cold hard truth is that people are dying as a result of people like you, who are not acknowledging that this virus is in fact highly infectious and easily transmissible to those who are vulnerable.</p>

Lots of us aren't from large urban areas and have <em>completely different experiences</em> than others. We're not being hit hard. Our morgues and graveyards aren't overflowing. We don't see almost anyone who's sick. That's what drives our behavior. You just can't see another perspective.</p>

        <p>Ok, and lockdowns aren't affecting small towns either, except when the packing plant has an outbreak and 40% of your town is infected. It's really just luck at that point. That said, I have yet to hear a reason not to continue mask mandates, they really are the perfect way to reopen and make sure people are working, because I fully agree that with out governments ineptitude, that people need to get back to work, while still keeping people as safe as possible.</p>

        <p>Still no outbreaks in my area. Wait. There's the Hasidic Jews community but that's not new. Otherwise, nothing. No outbreaks. Warehouses are open. Stores (that weren't decimated by lockdowns) are open. I could go on.</p>

        <p>See, it depends. Not everyone has your story. A town of 2500 not far from me had a thousand cases in a week, and no hospital to put them. I don't recall exactly how many died, but there were dozens. We had hospitals overwhelmed, and travel nurses and body trucks, so they couldn't just take more people.</p>

        <p>I don't live with my family, like most younger adults, many of whom live nowhere near them, I've had covid, and I'd have to be naive to  think I can do much for the health of my alcoholic dad, when he won't/can't himself - or even to think that covid is the worst thing that could happen.

        <p>That's not true, we make choices continually about when to do things for others or not. Much of what we do, just going about our lives, could impact others. Being a vegan with harm-OCD has made me especially aware of that, and also that, while it isn't something I can just tune out, that there's a limit to what you can do without driving yourself insane.</p>
<p>Almost anyone who has lived with an alcoholic, gets that there is a limit to what you can do, and to what it's healthy for you to attempt to do. Those decisions aren't even primarily mine, but my mum's. I've followed the covid rules -having had it, it now doesn't matter if I stop, though-, he's not, what am I supposed to do? I can't control him, nor should I attempt to.</p>

        <p>I've already had covid, which was no biggie, as a Millennial, yet here in the UK, GP-appointments are almost exclusively telephone-only now. Being disabled, and also having to deal with the obstacle-course public life has turned into, while my health gets worse, not helped by said obstacle-course and hospital appointment cancellations last year, I don't feel safer.</p>
<p>Those disabled people, including many mentally ill people, who are not at specific risk from covid are not safer. People stuck at home in abusive households, with support having vanished, are not safer. Isolated elderly people are often not safer.</p>

        <p>This is exactly y'alls problem. You think that because your personal experience wasn't bad so your ass shouldn't be wearing a mask. People have died.</p>
<p>Some people aren't safer, most people are. There are other problems beyond being told to stay the fuck at home that should be addressed. The lockdown has made life worse for most people, and if people who shared your mindset stayed the fuck home the lockdown would be over. It's entirely the fault of this in-denial mindset for forcing mentally ill people, abuse victims, and the elderly to stay at home as long as they have. It was just a few fucking weeks, now it's been over a year.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what part of that sounded 'not bad'.</p>
<p>Most people are not safer, given covid risk is very dependent on age, and still low overall. Lockdowns have caused deaths, including of young people and children to whom covid posed little risk. Here is one such case:
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/woman-killed-autistic-son-lockdown-b1800979.html</p>
<p>Most of us are following the rules. I have. Compliance with something as drastic as lockdown will never be total, if it has to be total to work, it's like prohibition or abstinence-only sex education, it's just not a good approach. If it was a handful of people not following the rules, wouldn't they all have been likely to have had covid already, and not be able to spread it? What about the legitimate reasons to break them, such as seeking mental health support from family, and the grey areas in the rules? It is obvious here in the UK that compliance has been high, the government acknowledged themselves during those first two weeks that it was, and even more than expected. It just doesn't work to bring an end to this, it was never even claimed it would, just that it was to slow spread. A lot of spread has been institutional.</p>

        <p>"Low risk" doesn't mean immune. Children have died to COVID, adults have died to COVID, the elderly have died to COVID. For every death caused "due to the lockdown" (the link you provided just tells me that an insane woman murdered her kid and she decided the lockdown was a good excuse), there's likely been at least 20 deaths to COVID.</p>

        <p>.....yes? You’re forced to wear a shirt and shoes in stores but no one makes a fuss about that. </p>
<p>Just like you stop at stop signs and red lights, just as you don’t shit in the middle of a restaurant dining room. Yet no “rEbElS” have come up saying how it’s unfair or difficult or whatever nonsense you’ve told yourself about your inability to put on a mask.</p>
<p>Could it be because you’ve taken partisan bait on social media?  Nooooo, <em>never</em> that... obvious this is a fundamentally different issue because.....because.......?</p>
<p>I’m truly amazed you think people fear you. I do not fear morons, I laugh at them.</p>
<p>In ten years literally no one will remember this little tantrum you’re having about “my face feews uncomfowtabew”.  Please keep telling yourself how important you are, it’s hilarious fuel for meta subs.  We’ll keep laughing and you’ll achieve nothing but high blood pressure.</p>

        <p>I wear 2 masks because I've heard that it helps better prevent transmission of the new variants, it feels the same as wearing one mask.</p>
<p>More filtration is better at stopping Covid from reaching your nose and mouth. Have you ever had a science project where you had to filter muddy water into clear water? 1 filter sure as hell won't do it so you need to layer up your filters.</p>

        <p>Several things disturb me. </p>
<p>What disturbs me the most is how politicized a pandemic has become. Lots of people I know thought it was a hoax and made up to influence an election. That is, until their friends/family started dying. Also, people will call you a racist for not thinking we should be in a total lockdown. </p>
<p>Then there are people who refuse to wear a mask when in public, crowded buildings like they are some sort of badass standing up to the government. When they just end up making some person just trying to do their job’s life miserable. Like the video of the girl who asked two guys to put on a mask to walk to their table (literally for 20 seconds) at an IHOP or something and then the two guys who were already filming started spouting off shit saying it was their right. They went in there just to film this for Facebook/YouTube. Im sure she had run into this a lot since she immediately quit on the spot instead of arguing with them. People claim wearing a mask for 30 minutes while walking around a grocery store is detrimental to their health. I am getting on a plane next week and have no problem wearing a mask in the airport and during the ~4 hour flight. It takes almost zero effort. At the same time, people who think you need to wear 3 masks while walking around a park disturbs me. I have been riding my bike at parks throughout this without a mask and some people looked at me like I was crazy and a few would say something as I rode by. </p>
<p>What also disturbs me is hearing things like in California where people were told not to go jogging outdoors even though that is a way to boost your immune system. </p>
<p>Seeing restaurants shut down when they’ve spent money setting up outdoor seating while a movie production set across the street is allowed to have large crowds eating together under a tent. Also having a governor having a dinner party at one of the top restaurants in the world while, at the same time, closing everything else down around them. Politicians getting their hair done while telling everyone else they can’t and them playing dumb afterwards. All of these are disturbing.</p>
<p>So many people only believe either an all or nothing approach is the only way. Where I am, everything has been open since last summer except for movie theaters. Although they do rent to private groups. People wear a mask when inside public buildings and businesses stay open. The numbers of infected/dead here are no higher than places that have had strict lockdowns. Actually the numbers are lower here than some of those. </p>
<p>I don’t understand why people can’t be bothered to do something so easy and effortless. I do understand why people are against lockdowns since it ruins people’s livelihoods and quality of life. I do not support those. People on both sides of the argument will give me shit for that.  I’ve still been seeing my friends, brothers, parents and grandparents. There are risks associated with everything. I’ve mostly stayed home and away from large crowds, but I haven’t totally isolated myself from everyone.</p>

        <p>What if the government told you had wear a specific government/doctor approved mask? They tell you its for your safety. It's easy and effortless. </p>
<p>The government says they will let us open business and have our basic freedoms back if we just listen. 
Also it has a ⭐ on it for verification purposes. And if you bring up the Jews you are a conspiracy theorist!</p>
<p>Would you do it? Would you feel guilty for a business who won't let you in because of it? I wouldn't even feel guilty for the girl at IHOP. If you are trying to enforce it then you are encouraging it. If the staff at IHOP quit what do you think IHOP would do? If all their customers got mad what do you think IHOP would do? Blind obedience is the reason we are in the situation we are in.</p>
<p>Freedom isn't a negotiation. And I didn't vote for any doctors or scientist. In this country we debate, we don't dictate. If this was all debated and voted on it would be a different story.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of these bully subs on Reddit.  They start off with "good" intentions of making fun of "bad" people, but eventually the vigilance to only hate on the "right targets" erodes and they end up being complete cesspools of terrible people.</p>

        <p>Sure, people are dying.  Have you looked at how many died with comorbidities vs just Covid? How incentives led hospitals to label car accident victims as Covid deaths? Or how anyone who died within 30 days of a covid test is labeled as a Covid death?  Are you aware flu deaths have gone from 10k a year to 0?</p>
<p>Are you aware that the civil war was American vs American? Hereto more Americans died in the American civil war than in ANY other war? </p>
<p>I very much doubt you are aware of your own brain, so these things.... well, probably asking too much. Aren't I?</p>

        <p>You guys are pieces of shit because you all refuse to make the slightest effort to actually get back to normal!  The virus is real. It is contagious. And it is deadly.<br>
The ONLY way things will go back to normal is if the virus is nullified.  And vaccines, masks, and social distancing are the only way that will happen. 
You dumb fucks refusing to practice the smallest bit common sense precautions are the reason the virus is still out of control.  So yeah, FUCK YOU ASSHOLES!!!<br>
We all want to get back to normal! Nobody, absolutely no one likes living like this!<br>
But you idiots are the ones are refusing to do what it takes to get back to normal.<br>
You’re like children, screaming that you want to go home, but are throwing a tantrum and refusing to actually get into the car.  You fucking morons.  </p>
<p>I’ve lost 5 members of my family to Covid.  And 14 members of my church so far.  And I blame you people. All you mother fuckers who have refused to take it seriously. Every jackass who refused to wear a mask in public places.  You sons of bitches are the reason I don’t have any grandparents anymore.  Fuck all of you.</p>

<p>What kind of safe space echo chamber are you guys running here? </p>
<p>I know you guys are basically Q-anon with even more of a victim complex...but can you describe why you think the white house doctors who claimed masks didn't help have since apologized for lying to keep Americans from hoarding the masks health care workers needed?</p>
<p>Or at least, bullshit some magic physics about how they can't possibly protect against the droplets virus particles are carried by?</p>
<p>If you're going to run around spreading COVID like a bio terrorist bukkake, you can at least help future historians understand why you streetwise cynics are all gullible as hell?</p>

        <p>Wow. A Q&amp;A sesh is what passes for real world proof these days? I guess I better understand why some people just do what they're told and don't hold their experts to a higher standard. </p>
<p>Even the AP ran a story just yesterday that analyzed the stats over the year and found that restrictions haven't played a huge part on reducing spread. In the end, it's the individual precautions that matter more, rather than the misguided reliance on public safety. </p>

        <p>&rt; Wow. A Q&amp;A sesh is what passes for real world proof these days? </p>
<p>I like the part where you pretend it's just a random opinion, and all the medical authorities are just as full of shit as you are.</p>
<p>So....you can't explain your fantasy physics, then? </p>
<p>&rt;  found that restrictions haven't played a huge part on reducing spread. </p>
<p>Odd. Seems to work in every country where you don't have Republicans screaming about mask oppression. </p>
<p>Are you pretending everyone's been making a good faith effort?</p>

<p>&rt; I'm not interested in placing responsibility for my health into the hands of strangers.</p>
<p>Of course not. You want other people's health placed in your hands.</p>

        <p>I think the words "Q&amp;A sesh" were clear. Not a study. Some experts expressing their expert opinions. But not a study, or even an analysis of real world statistics. </p>
<p>You want to stay safe, do so. Take all the precautions you need. If you feel like placing your health into the hands of people who would as soon spit on you than look at you, go for it. </p>
<p>I'll go with the tried-and-true, the proven methods to stay healthy.</p>

        <p>Oh, for cute. You're still here! And with a video that shows... well, it shows air currents. Damn, can't believe no one has ever <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/expert-shows-efficacy-of-double-masks-in-cold-weather-m0gWcCjM">shown air currents.</a></p>
<p>From the video: "But with a mask on, in the warm, humid space between your mouth and the mask, those larger droplets don't have the time to evaporate, and they can be captured by common fabrics."</p>
<p>Yep, I'd like to see proof for that claim. Otherwise, this is an exercise in propaganda. </p>
<p>Videos are interesting, but they hardly stand up to the scrutiny of scientific study. How long does the humidity keep the droplets large? Do they continue to remain large after hours of breathing thousands of breaths into the fabric? What about the open sides of masks, don't they keep air flow and allow for cooler air to evaporate the moisture? What concentration of virus is sufficient to infect another person? Does the structural integrity of a given type of mask degrade over time, and what is that time frame? How long does a virus spread by both droplet and aerosolized breath survive in both indoor and outdoor air?</p>
<p>If you can't answer those questions, then virtually stomping your feet and demanding that others do as you say is, to be charitable, tantrum-like.</p>

        <p>The facts are plain and simple.</p>
<p>Viruses exist. If you get infected by one, you either recover or you die. Worrying about them won't change those two facts, or improve your survival chances. If you live long enough, there's a good chance a respiratory infection will contribute to your eventual demise.</p>

        <p>Are you dense? States get locked down because they have high death rates, that's the whole point. Or do you believe that the virus somehow spreads faster when people don't go outside? </p>
<p>Your point is like saying malaria medicine gives you malaria because the countries who use the most of the medicine also have the most deaths.</p>

        <p>No, you think.</p>
<p>The virus travels trough air and, basically, spit. If you wear a mask, you will get (partially)  filtrated air. If you are in proximity with an infected person and they are wearing a mask, their saliva will (again, mostly) stay in their mask. Anything that escapes will get caught in yours. Its not a 100% method, but it helps. </p>
<p>Now, if you stay within 2 meter distance, it is much harder for the contaminated air and saliva reach you, wich means... the chance of contamination is also low?</p>
<p>But hey, we can also get contaminated trough our eyes, right? Face shields exist.</p>
<p>But even with all that, there is still a (small) chance of contamination. And thats why the lockdown. If you dont get in conctact with people... you dont get contaminated? Oh wow, who wouldve guessed?</p>
<p>Most people stop spreading within 2 to 3 weeks, thats why the lockdown was as first only a month. If EVERYONE followed the regulations, no new person would be contaminated and we could just treat the small amount of people with complications. But people didnt want to comply, thats why we are in for a whole year. </p>
<p>I literally explained to you every single thing. If you want to give a response to par with, i will be happy to reply. If you wont, then dont even bother.</p>

But people didnt want to comply, thats why we are in for a whole year. </p>
<p>Here you go: This is impossible. You can't have 100% of people stay home, even if 100% of people were willing to comply. Essential workers need to physically go to work to keep society running. So the virus keeps circulating among that population forever, bringing it home to their families... And then what? Everybody else just stays locked down forever? </p>
<p>A month lockdown with 100% compliance would not eliminate spread. THAT WAS NEVER THE GOAL OF THE FIRST LOCKDOWN, MORON. Do you remember what "flatten the curve" means? Its goal was to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed AND THAT'S IT. The same number of people would <em>always</em> get infected regardless of what behaviors we did. Read that sentence again. </p>
<p>And guess what? We did flatten the curve (in terms of hospital capacity). Hospitals were not "over capacity" anywhere except for a handful of ones in Brooklyn and Houston. All those field hospitals we built? Never got used. We tore them down. Mission accomplished! Except the goalposts shifted from "flatten the curve" to "eliminate all covid spread forever" and dummies like you didn't notice.</p>

        <p>Fair enough they did have a lot of instances where they were on lockdown! Though as I was researching I found that their lockdowns were very very short. Over all they have only had about 2,400 cases and 26 deaths. And you’re right that a lot of New Zealand’s numbers came from them being a more isolated island. If we ran our shit like that though we’d be in a different spot in regards to death. Cause the New Zealanders quarantined hard core and wore masks much more than the whole of the us. I’ll answer your question genuinely. I think its worth it, I have a methodology for this and I understand not everyone values things the same. I can break down why I think its worth it f you are genuinely interested.</p>

<p>&rt;Fact-Checking Facebook’s Fact Checkers
The media giant is employing left-wing vetters to limit
scientific debate.
By The Editorial Board
March 5, 2021 6:36 pm ET</p>
<p>&rt;China last winter censored doctors who shared “dangerous” misinformation about the novel coronavirus on social media. Now America’s self-anointed virus experts and social-media giants are also silencing doctors with contrarian views in an apparent effort to shut down scientific debate.</p>
<p>&rt;We’re seeing this up close and personal. Facebook this week appended a Wall Street Journal op-ed “We’ll Have Herd Immunity by April” by Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary (Feb. 19) with the label “Missing Context. Independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people.” According to Facebook, “Once we have a rating from a fact-checking partner, we take action by ensuring that fewer people see that misinformation.”</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;The Facebook label links to the third-party site Health Feedback, a member of a World Health Organization-led vaccine project and an affiliate of the nonprofit Science Feedback that verifies scientific claims in the media. Another Science Feedback affiliate fact-checks climate-related articles in predominantly conservative media.</p>
<p>&rt;“Misleading Wall Street Journal opinion piece makes the unsubstantiated claim that the U.S. will have herd immunity by April 2021,” Health Feedback’s “fact-check” says. “Three scientists analysed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be very low.” This is counter-opinion masquerading as fact checking.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Makary didn’t present his opinion as a factual claim. He argued, based on studies and other evidence, that Americans would have enough immunity from vaccination and natural infection by early spring to sharply reduce the virus spread. He essentially made a projection, much like the epidemiologists at Imperial College and University of Washington do.</p>
<p>&rt;But the progressive health clerisy don’t like his projection because they worry it could lead to fewer virus restrictions. The horror! Health Feedback’s fact checkers disagree with the evidence Dr. Makary cites as well as how he interprets it. Fine. Scientists disagree all the time. Much of conventional health wisdom about red meat, sodium and cardiovascular risk is still fiercely debated.</p>
<p>&rt;The same goes for Covid-19. There’s still much we don’t understand about the virus and its transmission and immunity. Yet Facebook’s fact-checkers “cherry-pick,” to borrow their word, studies to support their own opinions, which they present as fact. So let’s fact-check Facebook’s fact checkers.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;A Kent State epidemiologist quibbles with Dr. Makary’s claim that “when [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild.” Her evidence? A single case report in the Rhode Island Medical Journal that cited a handful of severe reinfections globally since April. Yet that same study noted that “there have only been a few reports of reinfections in COVID-19 patients.”</p>
<p>&rt;A New England Journal of Medicine study last month identified only two asymptomatic possible reinfections among more than a thousand U.K. health-care workers with anti-spike antibodies from prior infections. Another study last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found antibodies from prior infection conferred a degree of protection that “appears to be comparable” to mRNA vaccines in clinical trials.</p>
<p>&rt;Another fact checker says Dr. Makary incorrectly extrapolated the share of Americans who have probably been infected. We will never know this number with certainty because most people with no or mild enough symptoms don’t get tested. Antibody surveys can help extrapolate infections, but antibodies wane over time and more quickly in mild and asymptomatic cases. So they may underestimate infections.</p>
<p>&rt;A study in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that 2% of American blood donors had antibodies in mid-December 2019. Early in the spring, testing was only picking up one in 11 cases. The ratio fell by the fall to around 1 in 4 as testing expanded. Dr. Makary applied what he called a “time-weighted case capture average of 1 in 6.5.”</p>
<p>&rt;A disease ecologist at the University of California Santa Cruz says he should have used 1 in 4, which would have extrapolated a lower estimate of infections. This is an arbitrary number and would underestimate the number of infections during the spring. She also claims the 0.23% “infection fatality rate” that Dr. Makary cites is wrong and says it is around 0.6%.</p>
<p>&rt;Infection fatality rates (IFR) are based on models and vary by population demographics and the degree to which societies protect the elderly. Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis found the median IFR estimate across 51 locations worldwide was 0.27%, but many estimates were from the spring when there were few treatments. The infection fatality rate has since likely fallen.</p>
<p>&rt;A recent study in the journal Science estimated an infection fatality rate of roughly 0.23% in Manaus, Brazil. Speaking of which, a Harvard epidemiologist takes issue with Dr. Makary’s citing Manaus as an example of “herd immunity.” Epidemiologists estimated 52.5% of Manaus had been infected by June at the same time hospitalizations plunged and stayed low for seven months despite relaxed government restrictions.</p>
<p>&rt;The Washington Post in August pointed to Manaus as a possible real-world example of herd immunity. Yet hospitalizations inexplicably shot up in December. A recent Lancet paper offers several hypothesis for this surge, including new virus variants that evade antibodies and flawed models. These hypotheses deserve to be investigated.</p>
<p>&rt;Yet Facebook’s Harvard epidemiologist concludes Manaus should “be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to ‘herd immunity’ from infection for protection.” It’s always a red flag when a scientist proclaims that a single piece of ambiguous evidence is enough to demonstrate anything. These Facebook fact checkers aren’t acting like scientists.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Scientists often disagree over how to interpret evidence. Debate is how ideas are tested and arguments are refined. But Facebook’s fact checkers are presenting their opinions as fact and seeking to silence other scientists whose views challenge their own.</p>
<p>&rt;We’ve been leery of proposals in Congress to modify Section 230 protections that shield internet platforms from liability. But social-media giants are increasingly adding phony fact checks and removing articles flagged by left-leaning users without explanation. In short, they are acting like publishers in vetting and stigmatizing the content of reputable publishers. The legal privileges that enable these companies to dominate public discourse need to be debated and perhaps revised.</p>

        <p>When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E).</p>
<p>Uh, sure about that?</p>

        <p>In the real world, humans have movable jaws. They inhale and exhale almost a thousand times an hour. The masks they wear are a mix of various fibers, some thick, some thin, in various sizes and fits. </p>
<p>The test you refer took place in a lab. It used standardized masks, fitted onto standardized heads that emitted standardized puffs of mist for the test. That's a far cry from the real world.</p>

        <p>It's a study using simulation of a real world scenario which is the lowest grade of scientific evidence. The only two randomly controlled trials, the highest grade, that took place when it comes to mask wearing were Vietnamese hospital workers and the most recent one from last year that took place in Denmark. You can look both of these studies up they are very easy to find. Neither found any evidence that mask wearing provides a significant benefit in terms of infection rates.</p>
<p>Not only this, you can compare actual infection rate graphs from Sweden, where mask wearing is not mandated and a tiny percentage wear them, to places wear they are heavily enforced and you will not be able to find a statistical trend. Mask wearing does nothing, but if it makes you feel safe, go for it, but don't enforce it under threat of state sanctioned violence on others.</p>

        <p>Let’s look at Sweden and New Zealand. New Zealand has half the population but not even 1% of reported deaths. They took lockdown and mask measures seriously.</p>
<p>Here’s the leaders of Sweden admitting that their response failed: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55347021</p>
<p>While true that the Denmark study didn’t show a statistical difference, it didn’t account for what the study referenced previously by a supporter of NNN showed: the most significant drop is when the spreader wears a mask. It is entirely possible that the mask wearing group was in the presence of an infected person not wearing a mask, which leads to less effective prevention.</p>
<p>Assuming I found the correct Vietnamese study, as you did not direct me to it, it shows that cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks, but surgical masks reduce particles by ~1/2. Additionally, the authors produced a statement that a cloth mask is still preferable to no mask.</p>

        <p>The fact that you pick New Zealand of all places to compare to lets me know you're a disingenuous fuck not interested in a good faith discussion at all.  A tiny island with a miniscule population that can easily close its borders and yet still is regularly locking down entire cities and abusing its citizens over a single case. I can take an equally extremist position and just say, let's compare to New York then, somewhere that mask mandates have been in place since July-ish yet has at least 5x the mortality rate of Sweden.  The fact is the difference between Sweden, New York and New Zealand has absolutely nothing to do with masks (or any of the other measures) and everything to do with other epidemiological factors, but this nuance is probably lost on you. 
The health service of Sweden does not think masks work, are they all anti-science fools as well? The leaders of Sweden, much like other places, are driven by political factors not science. Go listen to Johan Giesicke if you want their view, it most certainly isn't that their response 'failed'. </p>
<p>Honestly, what part of no statistical correlation do you not understand - for any example you give, I can also give one from the other extreme, because masks have had no effect on spread anywhere in the world.  I could show you 50 mortality and infection curves unlabelled from across the world and you wouldn't be able to tell me which ones had stringent measures and which ones had none. The Vietnamese study actually found cloth masks increased transmission, and not only that, you need to understand this was with trained hospital workers obeying much more strict PPE training and regulations than Joe Bloggs screwing up their made in Bangladesh shitty cloth mask and shoving them in their pockets once they leave the supermarket.  The point really is not just 'do masks make any difference at all', but do they make enough of a difference to justify enforcing them under threat of state violence, and the answer to that question is obviously no.  This was a position virtually all Western state governments took prior to May 2020, when the subject became heavily politicised, you can even go back and look at WHO pandemic guidelines from March 2019 and see that masks are not recommended for the general public.  The fact that it's some kind of controversial stance to take now less than 1 year later should make you pause for thought at least. </p>

        <p>This theory dissolves on contact with scientific consensus and the real world. </p>
<p>You’re talking literally decades of studies on masks and mask policy; not to mention nigh on a year of mask mandates. We are seeing no significant effects of masking or not.</p>

But I do think we should take prudent and effective measures.</p>
<p>Masks have proven useless, drop them. You can still wear it if you want.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are incredibly harmful and counterproductive, drop them and prosecute the governors, mayors, etc who supported them.</p>

        <p>A year into this comparing mask studies are the biggest waste of time. If someone wants to wear a mask feel free. I won’t mock them and they can leave me alone for not wearing one. I’m good, granny’s good, my friends are good. Now everyone be good as well. Bitching and moaning about masks has to end. Just do whatever it is you feel works</p>

        <p>The only reason I ask is because I work for the NHS and as much as I would want patients to wear masks I can't force them to do so. If I can better understand their point of view then I can do my job lot better in COVID research. 
At the moment, I haven't come across studies that have been massively compelling and would just be curious to see the the studies that are. 
But I am glad to hear that your family are well and good. It is heartwarming to hear the times when people's lives have not been tainted by the pandemic.</p>

<p>&rt;Hey let's not forget that a majority of those people posting there also be like, " I'm not gonna get the vaccination lol" . And are also judging all of those who get it, because we don't wanna get a preventable Virus, and don't want to pass it on people who ACTUALLY can die. So many people losing their lives because of the Virus and still so much stupidly going around. SMH<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To clarify<br>

        <p>The best part, in reference to the first quote, is that this vaccine does not prevent virus transmission. It only lessens the severity of your symptoms when you contract COVID. </p>
<p>I've been asking myself what the point is then? And why does getting this vaccine mean you can go out in public without a mask when you are just as likely to spread it to other people/get it yourself? </p>

        <p>You're asking yourself these questions because you are able to think critically as you do not have a limbic system that is fused to MSM fear porn. If the jab only lessons symptoms and not infections, then let those who don't want it suffer from bad reactions. Just don't force it on others. </p>
<p>Why someone would want an experimental jab for something for which 99.9% survive is beyond me. That said, they have the right to do whatever they wish with their OWN bodies.</p>

        <p>I agree it is a little suspicious. It seems like from newer studies that it really does stop transmission though. So now hopefully people will stop crying and trying to force masks even with vaccines</p>

        <p>To be clear, I'm not suggesting that the vaccine <em>doesn't</em> prevent transmission. I don't think they'd bother manufacturing it if it didn't. But I'm also really fucking tired of the "health experts" denying that the human immune system exists and the circumstances surrounding this vaccine are suspicious enough that I, a fairly healthy guy in his 20s will be skipping it. If I were in my 60s or older, I might get it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think we both pretty much agree. Definitely suspicious vaccine, lockdowns are unethical, etc. But for those people who are like 80+ and have underlying conditions, the vaccine does seem to reduce the severity of Covid which is good. </p>
<p>I don’t even think the fact that it seems rushed is bad, as long as no one is forced to get it. The biggest problem is if they start forcing people to try and take the vaccine or mandating that you need the vaccine to go to certain places</p>

        <p>Perhaps it's just the subs I end up on, but it occurs to me that when a sub exists to call out the left, the focus is on the things that are said and how likely they are to be upvoted and rewarded.</p>

<p>People are conditioned to obediently follow the group, be it in standing up to the sound of a tone, or murdering people because they have the wrong skin color/religion/soccer team.</p>
<p>Even if asked by an actor in a lab coat to electrocute a stranger begging to be released, half of more of people will do so until a deadly voltage: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUEC5YXV8U&amp;ab_channel=BrianBurak">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUEC5YXV8U&amp;ab_channel=BrianBurak</a></p>

The second wave was weaker, this coming third wave will be weaker still. All the different variants are the same bullshit, weaker viruses that are maybe more contagious.</p>
<p>This virus will never be gone. It just won't. What will happen is that it will come and go and we will be so bored with it that we will just start calling it the flu.</p>

        <p>I was talking to my mom who is a psychologist about something similar and she had a good insight. It’s less about the huge majority of people being total morons, because there are intelligent people that agree with the masses on this. What the problem is that so many people are so very concrete in their thinking, and aren’t willing to challenge their own beliefs. You can call that stupidity if you’d like but I think that’s simplifying it. Either way, because of this, they are unable to comprehend anyone else’s opinion.</p>

        <p>I'm ready to fight for my right to think freely. I refuse the orwelian future so many are allowing with open arms. So crazy that a large portion of our society is earnestly welcoming a controlled way of living. I think what they think so they make my life easier. Better. 
We need to wake these people up. Doctors and scientists are being silenced and media is winning. I'm expecting an implosion, we can't be forced to conform like this.</p>

        <p>Anyone able/have the time to clarify for me what this subreddit is? This showed up on my popular page and from the comments I'm honestly not sure if you're a collection of people unsatisfied with the way the world is going in general, or is it directly related to covid and masking?

<p>No, you irretrievable morons.  If you count on the vaccine, basically you've hobbled yourself by putting normalcy on that one extremely precarious thing.</p>

People thinking you’re dumb for not understanding (or refusing to understand) basic scientific principles isn’t the same as what Jewish people faced in the late 30s. If you’re allowed “free thought” to spew misinformation about a deadly virus then others are allowed “free thought” to judge you for that.</p>

        <p>How dare we follow science!</p>
<p>Directly from the CDC website:  </p>
<p>**During March1-Dec. 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2313 (73.6%) of the 3142 U.S. counties.  </p>
<p>Mask mandates were associated with a .05 percentage point decrease (p=0.02) in daily Covid-19 case growth rates 1-20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.8 and 1.8 percentage points 21-40, 41-60, 61-80 and 81-100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all).  </p>
<p>Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p=0.03) in daily Covid-19 death growth rates 1-20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.9 percentage points 21-40, 41-60, 61-80 and 81-100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all).  </p>
<p>Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.</p>

        <p>Nope religion and science are very different. If you were to wipe all religious information from the world, everything written and everything in peoples brains, it would never come back the same. If you were to do the same with science, the information would come back the same as it was. It would take a very long time, but it would happen. This is because one is based on fiction with the intent of controlling populations, and the other is based on unbiased observations with the intent of keeping populations safe and healthy and in harmony with the earth</p>
<p>The governments do have to enforce things sometimes, that’s how society works. But the government (most of them, anyways, Trump’s administration kind of did their own wacky thing) develop the rules and regulations based on the recommendations of scientists. It’s true governments are not perfect and often they will not follow the science. When this happens, I speak out in protest. We see this with climate change. I have been to many climate change protests and done what I can to speak out and advocate for legislative change that will slow down carbon emissions. But in the case of this pandemic, the government is actually following what science recommends. Thus I follow their guidelines willingly because they make sense and come from a place of logic and the intent of keeping people safe.</p>

        <p>It’s a shame because In a world where everything is for sale you can’t base anything on fact. </p>
<p>Science is supposed to be that relief in the idea we can actually have proof and figure out how stuff works. </p>
<p>What doesn’t help is scientific data being manipulated, set in stone, never questioned because the prestigious well respected guy who wrote it just happened to have a fatal accident the otherday. </p>
<p>My point is... in this world we actually don’t have anything we can put our backs to for safety and trust.  If anything is for sale you can shift the world to your desire, even the most important and vital documents can be shifted if you talk to the right guy. 
I’m sure he’ll say “I don’t see why not” because if he doesn’t he won’t be around for long. This sounds crazy but we are talking about what money can do.</p>
<p>My final point is.... I wish I could, but I don’t trust anything because it actually is so easy to manipulate people and the world around you with the right resources. It’s a harsh reality when you realise these people would throw you to the wolves for a sandwich. </p>
<p>Real people care about each other, but there are some that like playing Monopoly with life and these people have no Conscience, remorse or compassion. </p>
<p>I cannot possibly explain these points to my mother who is too innocent to comprehend evil out of ignorance or even more just straight up evil.... people haven’t been exposed to this sort of environment or idea so it’s alien to them that someone might want cause harm on purpose. </p>
<p>If you want to get further down the track of monopoly games, you have to be cutthroat. Is it not hard to believe people live by this code?? It isn’t... what’s hard for people to believe is these said people are in power and effect the world around us. </p>
<p>You either see it or you pretend not to. 
Either way you know deep down somethings up. </p>
<p>Governments are not perfect is an understatement if you look at history. </p>
<p>They are preforming a service and gathering information while doing it.... nobody said they actually have to care. </p>
<p>The world is full of people carelessly preforming jobs because they have to, for money. </p>
<p>Your friends and family care for you, but don’t assume someone you don’t know who has 10x more power than you and your family cares about you. </p>
<p>Your just a number at that point, same as everyone else.</p>

        <p>I don’t have any kind of blind faith in any institution, not even academic institutions. What I do have is the ability to parse out facts as well as hearsay information and determine which is most steeped in facts and logic. It’s possible to learn how to properly sort out facts from misinformation. You can learn how to spot when statistics are being manipulated and when they are not. If you are interested, you can do it. I would encourage you to do so.</p>

        <p>That is a reason. I’m part of this but ironically and saw the post. That’s how I got here.</p>
<p>I have facts. You don’t. There are no “alternate truths”. COVID is real, and dangerous, and the spread is slowed by social distancing and mask wearing. There is no danger to wearing masks, only benefit. Those are the facts according to the most up to date scientific information we have so far. You can choose not to believe them, but that doesn’t make them any less true.</p>

        <p>This is how the dark ages/medieval mob thought. This is what they did to heretics, witches, apostates and those whom they disagreed with. It is what they did to their own who disagreed with dogma and the "new" reality they constructed. Constantly moving goal posts and when you couldn't or wouldn't anymore just get rid of dissenting or normal voices and terrorize them into submission. They are goons and political criminals.</p>

        <p>Honestly, this reminds me of 1984 (Wow, shocker, I know :p), as in: people who don't follow the MSM narrative are so widely hated, and for what reason? Because they're told to do so? </p>
<p>I mean, not to blow my own whistle, but - I've been anti-everything since the beginning. I wear my mask as little as possible, etc etc etc. Yet have I gone around murdering people's grandmothers? Have I went round the block, stabbing elderly people with a knife I just coughed on? Nope, I didn't. Yet that's what the media portrays us to be. It sucks.</p>

        <p>You know a good way to go back to how things were before a virus hit is to actually get the virus under control. And yes, it's possible because other developed nations that aren't filled with imbeciles have done it just fine (i.e. Australia where they're happy and walking around mask free with no COVID).</p>

        <p>Not total, I mean, maybe some of the people here are out of their minds, but most of the people in this sub I actually semi-agree with, and they have points that they make that are worth taking into account. It’s not all bad!</p>

        <p>You are all selfish, arrogant twats.  I work in environmental services at my local hospital and have literally seen patients with tubes shoved down their throats.  I have literally seen people die from Covid.  My boss' wife lost a patient in my age group to Covid. I have to wear a N95, a gown and gloves to clean a room after a Covid patient is discharged.  Surely you can wear a basic mask while grocery shopping.  But you can't, you won't, because being mildly inconvenienced is worse than people dying.</p>

        <p>I mean I've never seen this sub before and now I know that it's full of people who don't understand why  being  being selfish and choosing to forego caring about other people's safety is why America is one of the worst in the handling of the outbreak. And the fact its deflected as "oh the others are sheep" just look at Texas for saying it's OK to reopen and do away with mandates, but the governor is vaccinated, and now blames democrats for letting the virus in like what. That is peak not knowing consequences of your actions.</p>

        <p>Incorrect.  Every single study on the efficacy of non-surgical cloth masks showed that they were ineffective at stopping viral transmission but actually increased the rate bacterial infection... until 2020.  What.  A.  Coincidence.  </p>

<p>Why the fuck would scientists &amp; the government want people to wear masks if they didn't work at all, like, seriously, what the fuck is the point? What do they achieve? Is it some form of spooky mind control? This is the funny thing. I've heard dipshit anti-maskers talk a lot about how masks don't work and the government is just "taking your freedom" and all this nonsense, but no one ever suggests a reason as to <em>why</em> they'd do that.</p>

        <p>That's like saying, "If doctors didn't exist, then I wouldn't know what being sick or pain is." Get real, the last time something this happened was 100 years ago — nobody asked for this or wants to prolong it, it's just a slow transition back. Ignoring it completely definitely won't help ot go faster.</p>

        <p>All it takes for evil to triumph is for a good man to do nothing. You not only do nothing to help curb this plague you revel in doing nothing. So much for being a good person. And as such, as far as I'm concerned you are complicit in the deaths of people during this time of plague, just like Charles Manson, Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler, so on and so forth were complicit in the deaths of others. You may not have lifted your hand against them personally but you sure as hell helped to kill them with your ideals , rhetoric, and actions. And that is why I say NNN is creating a new normal for the wholesale slaughter of people.</p>

        <p>Yes, you are.  This subreddit is beyond idiotic.  We are dealing with a pandemic and by the end of the summer when enough of the population has a vaccine, masks will go away and we will return to normal.  </p>
<p>Hopefully we can keep some of the changes in society (remote work, wearing masks in public when you're sick, less waiting at doctor's offices, etc).</p>

        <p>My concern is that it wont go away. I'm scared we are being teased with this sense of okay when we reach this point you can have these things back like seeing your family and leaving the country but they will keep moving the point and eventually it will just be seen as acceptable and we will have lost the opportunity to take a stand and stop authority having too much control over people. 
Yes I think this sub can be pretty extreme sometimes and I dont really agree with the whole bashing other people for not believing the same thing as you (especially when they clearly hate when people doing that to them) but I think that's really all this is about, being more scared of the fact that this is making it very easy for the politicians to have too make control over free people than covid</p>

        <p>Did the soviets care when millions died from the holodomor? What about the Chinese government when they killed millions? How about the German government when 16 million people were slaughtered. The government doesn’t care because as long as they have power it doesn’t matter who dies. Plus, they are making a ton of money off of shorting stocks and low prices. They have no reason to end the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Well in 1919 the government had no reason to give up control. There was no internet or global banking system the way we do now. The idea of fascism hadn’t been invented and the Soviet Union was in total disarray. Nowadays they talk about the great reset, they talk about how it’s ok to lock down for five years, and not to mention they didn’t have a vaccine, and weren’t counting deaths the same way they do now. The Spanish flu kills everyone, covid kill old and obese people. And they weren’t locking everything down and killing the economy. 
And just as a pro tip, don’t use insults in an argument, it’s makes you look like you don’t have any real points.</p>

        <p>CDC and Fauci  often mention even after getting vaccinated you have to wear masks. Often mentioning there's some things vaccinated people still won't be able to do. CDC released guidelines 'allowing for limited freedoms' for vaccinated people. Have you never heard of tbe Tuskegee experiments? I feel genuinely sorry for you</p>

I really hope I'm thinking too much in to it and that I am paranoid and that the government is doing these thing because they are trying to get things back to the way they were.

        <p>yes, I think mask mandates will be gone and pretty much everything will be back to normal by the end of the summer.  There might be restrictions on huge events like concerts and stuff, but I imagine by football season, the stadiums will be operating at full capacity again.</p>
