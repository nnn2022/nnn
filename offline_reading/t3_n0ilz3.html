        <p>The thing is that it’s not these older people who are advocating for these lockdowns though. It’s their children, who are in their 40s to 50s, who are the most vocal supporters of this, because they can’t face their own mortality and face that they will not always have their parents here, and that they are soon heading to that age/time in their lives. They want to show that if their parents/previous generation’s life can be extended, they can still have hope for THEIR future.</p>
<p>it’s the most selfish thing.</p>

        <p>Yep. As a 50 year old, I'll attest to it. It's my generation, my friends and family who are cowering and buying the fear narrative. </p>
<p>Personally, I'd rather take a bullet than destroy my children's future economy, mental health, and civil liberties. </p>
<p>But I can't seem to convince my friends who are comfy in their ivory tower. I've lost all respect for the selfish bastards. </p>
<p>I would guestimate that my network is about 80% doomer, 20% rational. </p>
<p>Way fewer birthdays to remember going forward. Not because anyone I know died of Covid 🙄</p>

        <p>Dang, that's rough! I'm very thankful to be living where I am, I only know of about 5 people total that have bought into the narrative. Almost everywhere I go to any friends or family's houses covid comes up in conversations, and 99% of everyone I've spoken to about it agrees its total bullshit. </p>
<p>There have been daily protests against the lockdowns and vaccines on a main intersection for a long time. Very well received in person, torn to shreds online.</p>
<p>When I look at my towns subreddit and Facebook groups it is 100% pro lockdown and pro vaccine. To an overwhelming degree. Shows something isnt right, im now under the impression that the people that support this online are either total losers that haven't been outside in months/years and just sit online 24/7 in the dark or they're all bots. If you go out into a grocery store here without a mask, almost everyone that walks by will give a thumbs up or make small talk about how they should start doing the same.</p>
<p>I know a ton of people that have tested positive with covid, I have hung out with people that tested positive, so I've probably gotten it at some point aswell, and I don't know a single person that has died from it. I do however know 1 person who died shortly after getting the vaccine, of "natural causes". Literally every single person I know that has tested positive either had no clue and never saw symptoms, or it felt like a very mild cold for a couple days.</p>

        <p>It's the opposite in my family. The twenty-somethings are masking everywhere they go and getting their shots like good little sheep. The over-70s were blowing most of this off through all of 2020, but got a bit concerned during the winter surge. All of them got their shots in January/February.</p>
<p>But we 50s are all skeptics, and happy to be part of the "control group." We are glad that our parents and elderly relatives got the protection that the shot provides, and we totally support their choice to get it. But all of us worry about our healthy children taking part in the global Phase Four trial.</p>

        <p>I was speaking to an elderly man and his wife maybe a year ago queueing up outside a supermarket. I didn't want to stand too close to them because I didn't want to make them ill if somehow I was carrying it, but he really wanted to talk and kept moving closer when I tried to give him more room. He was saying 'if you ask me, you get it, you get it!' and laughing.</p>

        <p>I just never understood why the young and healthy had to lockdown. I can understand putting additional safeguards in place for nursing homes and having at risk people take precautions, but I will never understand why we had to tank the economy and fuck up everyone else’s life. Free country my fucking ass. And don’t tell me the founding fathers would have locked down over COVID because they wouldn’t have. They didn’t lock down over smallpox and that has a death rate of about 30%.</p>

        <p>all the old people i talk to think this is all a bunch of bullshit. my theory is that the original virus was a thing created by that wuhan lab used to intentionally kill the elderly and thats why they intentionally grouped them in nursing homes throughout the world as an "oversight". why? because the elderly have LIFE EXPERIENCE, the most important thing in this world. they have seen shit with their own eyes and can relate a perspective that you cannot have without having life experience.  </p>
<p>there has been a coordinated effort the last 2 decades to make old people seem unapproachable and outcasts. labelling them as the racist old guard, labelling them as senile, labelling them as uncool. it's so that young people dont interact with them and actually learn a thing or two - if they did, they might realize when their freedoms are being taken away. </p>
<p>now they've successfully killed some of the elderly, and for the rest, well no worries people are too afraid to get near them lest they "kill grandma". so these young people have no guidance about what is going on around them right now.</p>

<p>EDIT: YEP. So you wouldn't possibly be another alt troll account linked to r/WallAffectionate5823 now would you? Because that one is also 199 days old sitting at -99 karma and has only posted in this sub. Nah, must be a coincidence. Way to give your own accounts upvotes, by the way. </p>

<li>
<p>The republican party: We can't have single-payer, government sponsored healthcare because it will reduce the quality of everyone's care and will result in the formation of death panels prioritizing care away from the sick and elderly and those people must be protected. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The republican party:
We have to outlaw abortion because life begins at conception, regardless of how that conception occurred, and regardless of the prospective life that child may have due to the mother's age or financial situation. She should not have the right to choose. The reason is because we have to preserve that life at all costs, regardless of the burden to the mother directly or society at large.</p>

<p>ALSO the republican party: We should not make any sacrifices as a society to stop the spread of a deadly disease that is killing hundreds of thousands around the world. If the old and weak die, they die.</p>

        <p>Conservatives largely are against single payer healthcare for numerous reasons, including but not limited to quality of care</p>
<p>Not all conservatives believe in outlawing abortions. I think the most common belief among conservatives is that people are free to do what they want, but are against making taxpayers subsidize the costs assosiated with it. That's not to say we don't bare moral objections to it. Moreover, conservatives tend not to have opposition to abortions of rape babies. I think your conflating conservatives with Religious Nutjobs/Bible Thumpers/Jesus Freaks. Granted there is a fair bit of overlap, but they are not mutually exclusive. </p>

        <p>Just a note on the abortion thing, 207 congressional lawmakers filed a brief to overturn Roe v. Wade in early 2020. Most Republican. If the main issue was disagreement with funding it with taxes, they wouldn't want to overturn it, they would just be trying to reduce/eliminate funding for planned parenthood (Which they're also doing, but outlaw is different than defund).</p>
<p>But anyway, I understand all three points. Let's assume the basis for the abortion thing and the anti-healthcare thing are both based in morality, because that is usually at the forefront of the arguments. It's one of the main talking points, even if it's not the whole reason. With this being the assumption for sake of this discussion, the argument against masks/lockdowns etc doesn't mesh well with the other two positions. Help me understand how one can simultaneously hold all three positions at the same time.</p>
