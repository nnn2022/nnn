    <strong>The Netherlands seems to be crumbling to the masks and rules</strong>
    <p><p>Cases have been rising in the Netherlands and restrictions are being tightened. A second lockdown is being discussed but the people are resisting more this time around. </p>
<p>I'm seeing both good and bad things over here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Corona-app which has been a sore point since the beginning was in the news again today. The security of peoples data is doubtful. It's already being tested but not widely rolled out. And the whole point of the app was to get an alter if you've been close to someone with covid so you can get tested before you get symptoms so you dont become an asymptomatic spreader. Okay, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that i guess. But there aren't enough tests by FAR as it is. Never mind if people who don't even have symptoms start demanding tests because an app told them too. The government always said that "when the second wave comes the app will be our important weapon" and now they are whining that a second wave is probably here already, but the app is A: not secure and users are put <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/toch-privacyprobleem-in-corona-app-patienten-zouden-onder-druk-kunnen-worden-gezet~be3d0c8b/">under pressure</a> because healthcare workers can see if you report int eh app that you have the virus after you get tested or if you keep that information private and put pressure on you to share that information , and B: if you use it and get an alert <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/testen/wanneer-testen">you cant even get tested</a> cause test capacity is utter shit. </p>
<p>Test capacity is bullshit anyway. Two months ago they had a huge surplus of tests and were encouraging everyone to get tested at the slightest sign of trouble, now they've run out suddenly and schools and hospitals are buying their own tests just to have enough. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Masks are now "encouraged" in all the country. Despite the fact that mandating masks is against the constitution here they are getting around that by making it an encouragement. I took a lovely trip to Amsterdam on Tuesday and as I was there I read online that starting Wedensday (yesterday) the big museum I visited would start demanding masks. Big warehouses like the Bijenkorf are already demanding masks. Supermarkets seem to be resisting <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5186910/supermarkten-en-hema-laten-klanten-zonder-mondkapje-toe">for now.</a></p>
<p>All of this comes after months and months of the government saying masks don't add any value because non-medical masks don't stopt eh virus. This comes straight from the horse's mouths int eh form of Minster van Ark for Medical Care and Van Dissel the director of the RIVM (basically Dutch CDC)</p>
<p>They even ran a temporary test in Rotterdam and Amsterdam demanding (unconstitutionally)  for masks to be worn in shopping streets to see if it would change behavior and if people would keep more distance. Spoiler alert: after research was done it did not change behavior. People did not keep more or less distance. Masks are pointless. </p>
<p>Our  minster president <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/video/video/5186787/rutte-verdedigt-mondkapjes-draai-we-moeten-alles-proberen">does admit</a> that masks are not the big solution, "but we must give everything a shot now".</p>
<p>They also recently changed their guidelines stating that care-workers for example in caring for the elderly must now wear masks even when coming a little bit close to an patient for just a moment, whereas before it was vehemently claimed these situations did not require a mask. It seems possible the data here was fudged a bit because at the time our country had a serious lack of masks so using them was discouraged, but now that we've replenished our stock masks are suddenly required everywhere. Something is fishy about that. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In other news: <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/ondernemers-en-bedrijven/horeca">general rules</a> are being sharpened. Restaurants and bars must close at 10pm. (The economy what is that? We are not allowed to invite more than 2 people to our home. Gatherings of more than 30/50 (these numbers flipflop a bit) must be reported and must acquire permission in advance. But PROTESTS are allowed still to just go on no problem (though many anti lockdown protests get cut down)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We're going in the wrong direction and I'm not liking it. Time for a new government.</p></p>

        <p>Point 3: there is no second wave. It's a ripple. </p>
<p>At my yoga location they now also recommend masks. I am not complying. And also in the supermarket. There luckily I think 7 in 10 were not wearing one still, but significantly more than before. Also happy to see most employees not wearing one I guess they stood up to their bosses.</p>
