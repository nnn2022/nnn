        <p>That's my main pet peeve about masks and the main weak point in doomers narrative. <br>
sure masks CAN work, and in the right circumstances they DO work, i've talked about that before. But those are very very specific circumstances. </p>
<p>Sure I'd feel safer if a surgeon about to operate on me wore a mask. Because I know that that surgeon had to train a wholeass long time to learns about proper hygiene. It's not just the mask. He had to  learn to wash his hands in a special way, wear a hair net, wear gloves, wear a special apron, not touch anything, THEN put on the mask. The whole damn surgery room has to be sterile too. And as soon as any contaminant enters that surgery theatre everyone has to disinfect all over. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>sure that is how masks d√≥ work. </p>
<p>How masks do not work is how we are using them now. Stuffing them into coat pockets, hanging them from desklamps or car mirrors. Touching them, adjusting them, putting them on and then taking them off again, wash rinse repeat. Some people keep their mask in a ziploc bag so they dont have to stuff it in their coat pocket, which is hilariously ineffective because they use the same ziploc every day even if they replace the mask every day. Also: the surgery theatre has sterilized air, the outside air... does not have sterile air. Before the mask even gets half a chance to stop whatever virus particles it may try to stop (even thoug hte virus quite often just bypasses the mask, gets out the sides or simply goes through it anyway) the mask gets clogged with outside air particles like dust and dirt and pollution in the air even before that. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also I'm way more worries about a surgeon sneezing into my open body cavity while performing brain surgery and what that could lead to, than I am of a cashier sneezing at me with a hopped up flu. If I'm feeling scared I'll wash my hands after that, but 90% of the time no need to be scared.</p>

        <p>Thank you! This is what I've been thinking but I just couldn't put it into words. The surgeon argument is a load of nonsense tbh</p>

<p>Surgical masks do fuck all for a respiratory virus. N95 like throwing sand at a chain link fence. And it goes in and out the sides, top, and bottom no problem.</p>
