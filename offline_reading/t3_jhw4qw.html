        <p>listen. with the craziness of the situation, it's natural that people are looking for answers.</p>
<p>but this ain't it. not only does this sound <em>way</em> too much like an early 2000's movie plot, there is practically -zero- evidence any of this was 'pre-planned' to such a level in 2010. anyone with basic access to "<a href="https://news.google.com">news.google.com</a>" would be able to type up a post like this and half-ass some "this is what is going to happen next!!" fabrication.</p>
<p>one can disapprove of the new normal without going full into this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yeah ... I’d like to see some verified original docs, please. </p>
<p>Also, the coordination required to pull this off <em>globally</em> is unrealistic - even if they managed to prevent 99% of “leaks,” there’d still be a LOT of leaks. </p>
<p>But hey, just in case, I’ll help spread the word:</p>
<h1>A virus with a 30% mortality rate will burn out very damn quickly.</h1>
<p>In that case, it would only take a few weeks to suppress most spread - all you’ve gotta do is stay at home (which everyone will do naturally, as no one wants to die, and therefore laws will not be necessary). A virus like that comes with a huge death toll no matter what, so if that happens, there is no choice but to wait it out and then bust out the pitchforks.</p>

<p>That is the original Rockefeller paper.  I don't particularly buy into it, but it's certainly interesting and the Lockstep scenario is eerily similar to what is happening.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think it’d be weird if governments hadn’t considered the situation and possible responses. Not the sort of thing you want to think about for the very first time when the virus is already rampant. </p>
<p>Plus, again, sooooo many people would be needed to coordinate this globally to make it happen. </p>
<p>That said, I do believe that, of everyone supporting lockdowns/mask mandates, there is now a group that is doing so exclusively because they think it will support their own agenda and believe crises shouldn’t go to waste.</p>

        <p>Okay, I’ll bite (things are weird, and I’m willing to at least hear out basically any hypotheses at this juncture).  </p>
<p>So...Biggest hole I can see in this theory is that the chances of it literally becoming The Stand would be astronomical.  What benefit is there to an elite class to release a highly lethal virus combination on purpose, when there would be literally no way to ensure they <em>themselves</em> did not become casualties in the process?  They know by now that masks, lockdowns, etc. do NOT actually contain the virus, so no matter how well they tried to avoid it themselves, they’d be hard pressed indeed to avoid a real-life enactment of The Masque of the Red Death or The Stand.   </p>
<p>I’m interested to hear counterpoints on this, but that is the biggest reason I tend not to believe in a conspiracy quite this far-reaching.  Having unleashed the viral equivalent of an atomic bomb (more like an endlessly self-sustaining <em>series</em> of atomic bombs), how would you successfully protect yourself from the “fallout” and not just die alongside all the people you infect?  </p>
<p>(V for Vendetta is the closest fictional “successful” use of this strategy that I can think of, but the elites only did it because they already HAD the cure—obtained through human experimentation in a prison camp—BEFORE they released the virus.  And the point was to create both fear AND gratitude in the population as the government swept in and “saved the day.”  So what would be the point of deliberately releasing a weaponized trifecta of <em>incurable</em> viruses into your population, thereby making yourself vulnerable along with everyone you were trying to control?  If all I had to do to take out Fauci was cough on him....😉).  Thoughts?</p>

        <p>If you planned it, it would be quite easy to protect yourself by vaccinating yourself before you released it.  Bigger issue would come with designing a virus that was both very high mortality and highly contagious. These kinds of viruses burn themselves out very quickly because they kill the host before they can infect others.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that was why I lost the plot of this proposition as I read through the slides.  The minute you add HIV to anything, you’ve eliminated the possibility to stop it...ie the lethality would be more like 100%. (Straight up Captain Trips territory).  There would be no “winners” in such a scenario, because HIV (almost by definition) has no vaccine—the 40+ years of effort attesting to the near-impossibility of inducing an immune response against a virus that destroys your immune system. 😕</p>
