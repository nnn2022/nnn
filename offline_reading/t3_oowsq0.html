    <strong>The madness that will not end</strong>
    <p><p>Hello friends. It has been a year and a half of the scamdemic. The masses have only seemed to enter into a deeper state of REM sleep to what is occurring. The train is in full motion and we cannot stop it now. I don’t know if we ever even could have, because this has all been foretold and those of us who Believe know that it was inevitable. As I sit here in my early 30s I just have to cry. I never imagined I would see this happen in my lifetime. There is no safe place any longer. </p>
<p>I think all the time about where to go and what to do. But this planet has been drawn and quartered. There is no escaping what has happened and what is to come. Even if by some divine miracle the Lord decided to end all this madness tomorrow the trauma on our generation will be a forever stain on humanity. How do we cope with the idea that there is no going back? How do we accept the loss of our spouses, our family, our friends, our lives as we once knew it? We cannot fight back any more than we possibly have. We are outnumbered and those in power will never ever release us from the chains they have put us in. They only seem to be reducing the links to these chains by the day, even by the hour. The tyranny and control is suffocating. We are drowning in their mass delusion. No matter how hard we all tried to be a voice in the wilderness we were met with deaf ears. </p>
<p>I know none of us will make it out of this alive, vaccinated or not. I am just so exhausted with this global mess. I don’t understand how people have accepted this agenda with open arms. How they have fallen to their knees and begged to be controlled. How they have sacrificed their bodies and their souls to a pure lie. And they have held the doors open to what is coming next. It’s only just begun. </p>
<p>Looking forward to the great NNN meet up in the camps someday.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve felt like this too but honestly, the best course of action is just to not dwell and ruminate so much about it. Stop watching all media, if you’re on social media get off of it. 
I know it feels like you’re being intelligent by keeping up with every possible current event, but sometimes ignorance is bliss. I’ve basically just stopped caring. 
I mean sure, the world is totally ducked right now but there’s nothing you and I are going to do to stop any of it. 
Just try to live your life as normally as possible, that’s what I’m doing now. Still never getting the vaccine or wearing masks again. So I guess I’ll just see what happens and enjoy the show.</p>

        <p>This is how I handle it and it works. I hardly think about what is going on anymore. I have my future homesteading plans and just focus on that. I haven't taken my temp or wore a mask at my work for months and no one says anything.</p>
