    <strong>Only 40% of adults asked in France intended to get a COVID vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/france-swhy-france-is-the-most-vaccine-skeptical-nation-on-earth.html</p>
<p>&rt;only 40% of adults asked in France intended to get the vaccine. The highest intention was found in China, where the coronavirus pandemic first emerged in December 2019, with 80% of people agreeing they would get a vaccine if it were available. For comparison, 77% of those asked in the U.K. said they would have the shot, and 69% of those in the U.S. said they intended to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;The widespread public distrust of vaccines in France has been attributed to factors including misgivings about government, previous public health scandals and demographics such as age and sex.</p>
<p>&rt;French yoga teacher Amel Lamloum told CNBC she doesn’t see the advantages of having a Covid vaccine. At 30 years old, and with no underlying health issues, statistically, she is not considered at high risk from the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;“I don’t see why I would take the vaccine when it has been done in only ten months … and we don’t know the long-term effects, ” Lamloum told CNBC Tuesday. “They say that after taking the vaccine we would still have to wear a mask so it’s like we take the vaccine for nothing.”</p>
<p>&rt;Another concern for Lamloum is that the vaccine could become compulsory, or that she could feel forced to have it if there were restrictions on those who had not been vaccinated. “It’s going to be very hard to move if there is a vaccine passport,” Lamloum said.</p></p>

        <p>My parents arent taking it unless theyre given complete legal confirmation that they never have to wear a mask again. I reminded them that everybody is saying that theyll still have to wear a mask (while sprinkling in some rants about how theyll never give you freedom again willingly, and how i have yet to see proof masks have done shit for anybody etc).</p>
<p>I never thought I’d say these words out loud but my entire family now is “proudly” anti-vax. We weren’t before, and we aren’t with any other vaccine, but good fucking luck convincing me that I need to inject something with a 10% chance to ruin my face, because of a disease that given my physical attributes, literally cannot kill me.</p>

        <p>The Bell’s palsy isn’t permanent.</p>
<p>This has caused me to look into other vaccines. I’ve been researching Hep A vaccines given to babies the day they are born. Hep is spread through needles, sex, and can be passed on from mom to baby. </p>
<p>If the mother is hep negative, why are putting anything into the body of a newborn baby?</p>
<p>I trust no one now. I believe vaccines can be helpful and can be safe. But I don’t think they are necessarily helpful and necessarily safe, and I’ll be picking and choosing the ones my kids get. Carefully.</p>

        <p>These polls are useless, 'adults' include a huge proportion of people who don't need, or feel the need to take a vaccine, as it's not mandatory of course the percentages of takers seems low.</p>

        <p>You know nothing about statistics. With a small control you can get a good indication of the overall group.</p>

        <p>&rt; The 15-country survey conducted December 17-20 among 13,500 adults on Ipsos’s Global Advisor online platform finds the highest levels of vaccination intent in China with 80% agreeing they would get a vaccine if it were available. </p>
<p>Depends on your 'small control group' and where the survey was conducted. Those most likely to take the vaccine are not using a global advisor online platform, ask 13.5k people, over 15 countries the same question on the bottom of their bingo cards down the local bingo hall this weekend (if the bingo halls were open!), I reckon pretty much 100% will want it.</p>
<p>And its those oldies that are most at risk who are required to take the vaccine to reach herd immunity levels acceptable by society to relax all the control measures.</p>
<p>So I say, useless polls, you're polling people who don't need it and have no reason to believe they have a requirement to take it.</p>
<p>Stats can be made to say anything.</p>

        <p>You have a point, but I assume they would choose a fair control. Not say, asking 17.5k 19 year old QAnon supporters.</p>
<p>Sorry for saying the first part I am grumpy today. :)</p>
