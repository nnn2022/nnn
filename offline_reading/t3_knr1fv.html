    <strong>It’s not an inconvenience</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen this mentioned all over Reddit and I’d like to address it here, wearing a mask is not just an inconvenience. Staying home is not just an inconvenience either. We at r/NoNewNormal are not your enemies. We are not “keeping” the lockdowns coming by not obeying. It’s not as simple as if everyone would just forfeit their rights or “fun” for a few weeks or a few months this whole thing would be done and over with. We are not your enemies. We did not lock you down or take your job. We didn’t tell you to be afraid. We didn’t kill the economy and destroy mental health all across the globe. We ALL are being divided by the tyrants telling us what to do. And for the record, we here are fighting for our rights AND Your rights also. We should be together as one but you chose to believe the Tv and the “news”. If you could see this for what it is, we would not be your enemy. That is all</p></p>

        <p><strong>The impacts of lockdown and fear porn portrayed by the media far outweigh the impacts of Covid.</strong></p>
<p>Many people didn't go to the hospital for conditions, or were turned away, and thus died. At the very least the quality of life and life expectancy of many will be lowered:</p>

        <p>This is a non-distinction. Literally no difference. Unless you have COVID and died from getting hit by a car. If you have COVID and die from anything remotely related to the side effects of COVID, you died cause you got COVID.</p>
<p>You know, which is why there’s been more deaths every single month since March this year than the average.</p>

        <p>OK this is where we’re going to disagree. Just because you have Covid and you died from a heart attack does it mean you died from Covid. You died from a heart attack while having Covid. If you smoke three packs of cigarettes a day and die from lung cancer also while having Covid you died from cancer not Covid.</p>

        <p>The actual cause of death isn’t “cancer” either. It’s whatever complications the cancer causes. Like organ failure. I guess people just die “with” cancer too, huh?</p>
<p>I don’t know why you’re going down this route. You just look dumb. Let me repeat it again for you. You don’t die “with COVID.” You either die from complications related to COVID, or it isn’t relevant.</p>
<p>This entire line of argument was invented to make stupid people like yourself think the government puts COVID down as the cause of death when someone gets hit by a bus and they’re COVID positive. It’s embarrassing when you utter the phrase “with COVID, not of COVID.”</p>

        <p>That’s kind of the point, though. For official recording purposes, those deaths are being recorded as covid deaths rather than cardiac arrest, or secondary pneumonia, or whatever actually killed them. Normally that’s what would be on the death certificate even as the family says the individual died of cancer. This is being used as a scare tactic for covid as the survival rate climbs, especially for younger and/or healthier people. </p>
<p>There are people recorded as covid deaths who actually did just die with covid. A roofer in FL was struck by lightning and fell 30’ but his corpse tested positive and so he was recorded as a corona death. Same for a motorcycle crash victim. </p>
<p>For many others who died of complications of covid, they were also of advanced age or illness, or malnourished, or very overweight. There were contributing factors in their deaths beyond covid; lumping them all in and emphasizing covid to imply people with no preexisting conditions are equally at risk is misinformation at best.</p>

<p>Show me a source for this. Until you can do that, this sounds like a chain letter you'd get from your grandmother that she copied off of Facebook.</p>
<p>&rt; For many others who died of complications of covid, they were also of advanced age or illness, or malnourished, or very overweight. There were contributing factors in their deaths beyond covid; lumping them all in and emphasizing covid to imply people with no preexisting conditions are equally at risk is misinformation at best.</p>
<p>That isn't what's happening, though. The effect of comorbidities has been an emphasis since basically the beginning. That's why there's been all this talk of people that are "high risk." A person who is 18 with COVID isn't high risk. A person who is 18 with diabetes is high risk.</p>
<p>So you're pretty much guilty of the thing you're trying to accuse the other side of.</p>

        <p>I remember reading about the roofer this summer. I can’t find a reference, so I take it back. The motorcycle accident was here: https://www.rt.com/usa/495200-coronavirus-motocycle-crash-mistake-florida/</p>
<p>So what are you saying? That lockdowns for everyone are justified even if we can identify who’s really at risk? This seems to be what the “other side” relative to my own personal opinion is arguing.</p>

        <p>No scientist or medical professional would ever distinguish between “died with” and “died of.” You don’t die of COVID. You die of complications related to COVID. You don’t die of cancer. You did of complications related to cancer. “Cancer” isn’t a cause of death.</p>
<p>You look at how they died, and you look at what complications lead to it. If you die from complications related to COVID, COVID is part of the reason you died.</p>
<p>It’s so brain-dead simple, but obviously little attention seekers like yourself aren’t interested in anything but regurgitating shit you read on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

        <p>So are the deaths from obesity, medical errors and smoking, but people aren't jails for.lighting up or eating a big Mac.</p>
<p>Death happens. The fact that this doesn't significantly increase the death rate.for 2020 shows that the number of deaths are being poached from other causes.  Hence dying with covid vs dying from covid.</p>

<p>The majority of Deaths are WITH COVID, not FROM COVID.</p>
<p>Did you know that everyday in the US more people die than died on 9/11?</p>
<p>Did you know there are no excess deaths in the US?  The so called Pandemic has had no impact on the overall number of deaths in the US.    </p>
<p>Did you also know that the definition of Pandemic has changed recently?</p>

        <p>As of december 12, we have well over 200,000 more deaths in the US than all of 2019. By the time they finish counting through the end of the year, it will be well over 400,000, far above what has even been attributed to covid officially. What killed this extra 15% of people this year?</p>

        <p>Yes thousands out of billions of people die everyday.  What's your point?  If you want to save more lives you need to stop shutdowns now.  People are committing suicide, dying of homicide, will go hungry, overdosing, get heart attacks from immobility etc. as a result of what you are pushing.  This is fact.</p>

        <p>Well said.</p>
<p>We were told 2 weeks to slow the spread.  We were okay with that, but when we gave these governors the power to shut down everything without going through the legislative process we set a precedent.  They will not give up this power and some are now telling us how many people we are allowed to have in our own homes.  This is not an inconvenience, it's tyranny.</p>

        <p>I mean 2 weeks of complying with orders to slow the spread, which I know many people refused to do. Slowing the spread by the way, being really the only thing we needed to worry about, sure not everyone with covid will die but they are going to take up valuable medical care and limited hospital space that other people need.</p>
<p>I get not buying into the fearmongering, this isnt the fucking bubonic plague, but fuck dude the impact this has on our hospital systems is extremely significant idk why that's so hard to beleive an industry that is usually already running close to capacity would be overwhelmed when a new problem is thrown into the mix.</p>

        <p>They're the same people that have always died. Covid numbers are being poached from other causes of death. If you go to CDC website, you'll see that as covid deaths have risen,.other causes of death have fallen at the exact same level. Covid needs to be celebrated. It almost single handedly wiped out other causes of death. </p>
<p>Covid deaths are, according to the CDC itself, overestimated by roughly 40% as well. Further suggesting the numbers are being taken from somewhere else. </p>
<p>And even if their numbers are true, yours isn't, as they have their number.lists as less than 350k.  Over by at least 40% means closer to 210k if the CDC is to be believed.</p>
<p>That's less than the average death rate just for obesity related disease states just in the US, and less than half tobacco related deaths in the US annually.</p>

        <p>Except as of december 12, well over 200k people have died over 2019. By the time they finish counting through the end of the year (we are averaging close to 70k per week for the last 2 months) it will be well over 400k, a 15% rise over 2019. Deaths have risen every year for the last decade, but by 0.5-3% annually.</p>
<p>So why did all of these extra people die this year?</p>
<p>Edit: and to emphasize, this is over 50k more than have even been officially attributed to covid 19. So even if you accept that covid killed 350k in 2020, at least some other cause of death had to have risen as well.</p>

        <p>So the people who said the selves their numbers might be off regarding covid are the people you go to for covid numbers?</p>
<p>Remember there are hidden deaths- deaths related to the pandemic but not the disease. Suicides, increased obesity disease states due to sedentary lockdown environment, easily treatable or chronically maintained disease now no longer maintained cos people are afraid to go out.</p>
<p>You will also notice that I never said it wasn't real, only that the mulyth that hospitals are overflowing is predominantly false.  I have 2 family members in the hospital due to covid, and I see it every day, but it isn't the monster the media makes it out to be. The so called measures for safety do just as much harm as the disease, if not more.</p>

        <p>Im literally not talking about covid numbers. Those are the deaths, by week, from all causes. While i dont necessarily trust the CDC's covid death count due to how politicized it has become, i do trust them to pretty accurately tabulate how many people have died in total.</p>
<p>Again, why did 15%, or a bit over 400,000 more people die in 2020 than in 2019? You really believe it was primarily from these hidden causes? Just a minute ago you were arguing many other causes of death have fallen to boost covid numbers, which is it?</p>

        <p>Both, if you can actually understand math. Those deaths are being thrown at covid, when that isn't the full picture.  </p>
<p>Did you know that thanks to the lockdowns more people die in la daily from drug overdose than covid?  Suicide rates have skyrocketed, as have preventable deaths.
You're arguing me on something I never refuted.  I said covid deaths are exaggerated, they are. I never said they are not happening.  </p>
<p>You're trying to equate one thing with another. I merely said hospitals have for most of this year been essentially empty, and you decided to try throw covid numbers at that instead of actual counter arguing.</p>

        <p>seriously, this argument is so ridiculous. Hospitals are overwhelmed, oh no! Like this isn't a free market and you can't just increase the number of hospitals if the demand was actually there. You're telling me there's some apocalypse-level deficit where hospitals are supposed to be, and somehow, nobody whatsoever in the billionaire capitalist class gives a shit to make easy money from it? Really though? But we need them? How is it even possible that this makes sense to anyone.</p>

        <p>This only really applies to America and that's if people can actually afford health care.</p>
<p>Where I and most Europeans live hospitals are managed by the government. In this case they really are overwhelmed but this is less the fault of the pandemic or the people and more the fault of the government.</p>
<p>They could have properly prepared by hiring more staff over summer, potentially getting some from overseas such as Australia. But they didn't. Instead they can't even staff the "nightingale" hospitals that they built specifically for covid.</p>

        <p>well it's essentially the same story here anyway. Except here, the hospitals are all private, and many of them are choosing by themselves to remain understaffed, because the lockdowns and the mass joblessness just gave them an enormous amount of leverage over their workforce, so that they will all do greater amounts of work for lesser amounts of money.</p>

        <p>This is where I get my tinfoil hat on and wonder why anti vaxx memes have specifically been so popular the last 4 years leading up to this. Is it because they knew lots of people wouldn't want to take the vaccine, people from all races, genders, and political affiliations? By spreading all those memes equating anti vaxxers as one group who also belong to a certain political group, have they set us up to be dismissed as the bad guys before we ever had a chance to convince anyone?</p>

        <p>I've been wondering this myself. I used to check the Cheezburger network, and they would go months at a time with dozens of snarky images taking potshots at "antivaxxers." I asked in the comments a few times why there were so many of these things addressing what was an essentially very, very niche group of people who if nothing else, mostly kept to themselves and weren't bothering anyone.</p>
<p>Naturally, I would get 10 tons of flak in response about how evil and bad and wrong they were. I still said "Okay, but why are we talking about them every day?"</p>
<p>I don't mind wearing the tinfoil. I don't think these things are unconnected. There was no explanation for it before, and there is now, so in the absence of any better explanation, I'm going to go ahead and say that I think it was a campaign.</p>

        <p>Wearing the tinfoil? Is that even an insult anymore with all those masks walking around? People are literally wearing masks, obsessively washing their hands, and isolating themselves out of paranoia for a fictional pandemic. At this point people who wear tin foil hats to protect themselves from aliens would actually be quite new normal in their level of sanity.</p>

        <p>100% agree. Look at that PDF that recently came out about the “language” that should be used to “convince” people to take vaccines.  Is it such a stretch that they would also use psychological techniques to start this “anti-vaxxers are bad” movement as well?</p>

        <p>they probably went ahead and seeded the anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in the 90s, giving certain people a good reason to be suspicious. Then surprise, what a shocker, only the most radical and laughable examples of anti-vaccination viewpoints are ever significant enough to enter the public consciousness. Enter Jenny McCarthy, Roseanne Barr, etc.</p>

        <p>I know there's Democrats who oppose masks and lockdowns, but you have to a dummy to vote for Biden then express shock that he is pro-mask and lockdowns, says he will do a nationwide mask mandate, implies he will do more lockdowns, etc. If the masks and lockdowns are a deal breaker then voting Biden was a stupid mistake, and yes, I am aware people voted for him in the hopes he would somehow <em>stop</em> the mandates even though he's basically supported it, and has a Dream Team of fearmongers on his taskforce.</p>

        <p>Nope. Anti maskers killed my grandma and took my job and home, not big daddy gov. He would never! /s</p>
<p>Follow r/rant for two days and see if you can keep count of the amount of posters that blame anti maskers for the lockdown, for the death of their elderly/already hospitalized family members, etc. This is FUCKING silly, childish, and illogical. What happened to adults understanding that life isn’t fair and that there isn’t always someone to blame? The days of accepting what we can’t change are long gone. Coping mechanisms aren’t being taught or mentioned at all. Public tantrums and whining about everything are all the rage. Sometimes I wanna hi five TPTB because they did a damn good job brainwashing most of the world.</p>

        <p>What bothers me most is that the government is making orders/laws/mandates based on POOR science and faulty models. It's not like they have solid evidence that any of this does anything. Even the BEST evidence for masks say they BARELY do anything, but that that minimum is better then nothing. Yet people cling to the idea that 1 person not wearing a mask in a huge crowd is the reason the virus spreads, when even the science FOR masks shows that's simply not true.</p>
<p>And when government and a mob mentality backs something, even something seemingly benign , with little to poor science behind it....that's a scary situation and should NOT be fostered. In no way am I comparing the atrocities of the holocaust to this, but that's kind of how that all started. People were told the Jews were lesser humans, they had "Science" to show it, and people ate it up just to fuel their existing antisemitism. The lesson is still important. Realize when you're swept up in a mob mentality, realize when your government is trying to take more and more control and using bullshit excuses to do it. This being accepted has set the stage for even worse bullshit because now the government knows they can keep doing it.</p>
<p>We can't even have a conversation with people who are so blinded by this. I'm in healthcare with a degree in science, and people I know who didn't get beyond high school are telling ME I'm anti-science. I know doctors and literal scientists who are against this stuff too. But they can't say anything. That's dangerous! It's the equivilent of a child sticking their fingers in their ears and going "LALALALALA I'M NOT LISTENING YOU'RE WRONG" but when enough do that, you just get silenced.</p>
<p>In the end these lockdowns HARM WOMEN. HARM POC. HARM CHILDREN. Cause poverty. Increase the wage gaps. Allow the wealthy to get wealthier. All things self-defined leftists and many liberals claim to be AGAINST. Yet they're 100% for it. It's insane that the hypocrisy is this thick. And I was a self-described left leaning liberal (I still believe in those tent-poles, but I can't use those labels anymore because they've been hijacked by the ignorant.) It makes me sick to see the mindlessness behind their choices and claims.</p>

        <p>Right. If everyone magically wore face masks 24/7, the spread would just be blamed on something else. Even as it is, I've seen signs saying certain masks aren't allowed in due to being "too breathable" including neck gaitors and bandanas which cover the entire lower face and neck. As soon as people started wearin face shields, all of a sudden they are "not effective" even though they cover the entire face, lower jaw and even part of the neck. The more we comply, the more they blame us for not doing enough.</p>

        <p>Y’all I don’t agree with everything in this sub and to be honest I follow it mostly to challenge myself and what I think. 
I agree with you about the government not wanting to give back rights, after all governments exist to have governments continue existing. However I also think sometimes collective action towards a common goal is required (ie a virus that spreads was easier than the ones we’re used to) and maybe sometimes the only way to achieve that is through government guidance. </p>
<p>So I guess I’m asking, what if this virus was much more deadly than it is? If it killed 1/3 people who got it or something crazy like that, would you support government mandates then? Or is that still to far to go? At what point of severity is it okay to require people do these things?</p>

        <p>If the virus was super deadly you wouldn't have to have govt mandates, people would stay at home by choice because they would see with their own eyes how deadly it is.</p>
<p>But to answer your question, these mandates would be okay if they paid people not to work and bailed out small businesses, if lockdown was just a short term strategy designed to buy time and if hospital still proceeded with cancer tests, treatments and other necessary medical treatment because by not doing that, they are not saving lives, they are just choosing who dies and who lives.</p>

        <p>If this virus (or any virus for that matter) was so deadly, why is every media company and government trying so hard to suppress “misinformation”? Wouldn’t they know that the truth would win out and wouldn’t be afraid? Collaboration reveals truth usually. In this case, it seems that they are so eager to stamp out any one that disagrees with them, one has to wonder why they would do that.</p>

        <p>Well it seems to me that the problem with this virus isn’t that it’s particularly deadly but rather that is spreads suuuper easily so even a moderate death rate means a lot of people will die and or have a rough time. </p>
<p>That wasn’t my question though, I was asking at what level of catastrophe do you think it’s acceptable for the government to enforce restrictions like the ones we’re having now. Like for example if a virus came around that spread super easy with a 50% death rate and spread as easy as covid would you still be opposed to restrictions on freedom to have all businesses open?</p>

        <p>You’re not going to get a consistent answer for the how-deadly-threshold question, because everyone is going to have different rates. I’m not sure I could pick just a single answer for every version of this hypothetical, but I’d bet most people would be okay with some (reasonably) heavy restrictions for a disease that killed like 70 percent of people. But also, more importantly, if a disease was actually killing such a high number of folks, you’d have way less resistance against the lockdowns or whatever measure the government takes, so in effect, the security measures would be far less necessary, because people would see that three quarters of their friends and family were dying. </p>
<p>That is not how this year has gone. The government continues to double down on security theater even a year into this pandemic. We have over a year’s worth of data, and yet some places are tightening the noose even more. So, the question isn’t about how easily it spreads, because that’s not a measurable quantitative metric. The death rate is really the most important metric. You can clearly count those who died from covid (not WITH covid) from those who didn’t die from covid. And boy, we have so much data about the death rate, and so little reason to continue with the security theater.</p>

        <p>Okay, I don’t necessarily agree with this, But I appreciate that this has actual reasoning unlike most things on this sub.
Most of the time it’s just people saying masks are a form of communism, with no reasoning or claim to back it up. Or people saying they don’t want to wear masks because they think that they’re soooo special. And other things regarding this </p>
<p>Like I said, I don’t agree with this, however I appreciate how there’s actual reasoning, unlike most people here.</p>
