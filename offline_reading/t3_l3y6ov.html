        <p>Is anyone else super annoyed by this 'new variant' bullshit? I have yet to see ONE media source actually explain <em>how</em> these new variants are "more contagious" and "deadlier". They just peddle the "new U.K. and South African variant" B.S. with scary fearmongering buzzwords. </p>
<p>And i'm annoyed because I can see EXACTLY what's going to happen. Call me Nostradamus... But these "sCaRy nEw vArIaNtS!!" will just give governments more of an excuse to keep lockdown restrictions in place, you know, "to inhibit the spread of it" even if numbers are low... Then when the vaccine rollout has happened and we're teased with the prospect of going back to normal, suddenly a new "[Insert Country Name Here] Variant" will emerge that will be conveniently immune to the vaccine, therefore giving governments the perfect excuse to force us back into lockdown AGAIN until a NEW vaccine can be made against THAT variant... So on and so forth.</p>
<p>All this 'new variant' garbage seems to me to just be setting the foundation for introducing a continuous, never ending world of lockdown restrictions since you can rest assured a 'new variant' will continuously pop out that will somehow be completely immune to any vaccines and treatments. </p>
<p>And don't get me started on my tinfoil hat conspiracy theory that the 'new variants' will be blamed for any seniors that suspiciously die after getting the COVID vaccine... </p>
<p>Tbh I don't even care if I sound crazy anymore. All the stuff I was called crazy for a year ago ended up happening so at this point I may as well just own it lmfao.</p>

        <p>I think it is because main stream media knows that there is a vaccine now, we are probably approaching herd immunity, people are getting sick of it, and Biden will magically lower the numbers and the virus will fade away, so they are milking every last minute of terrifying everyone and having them glued to the screen with "new variants"</p>

        <p>I'm noticing the variant stuff too. I was immediately suspicious upon hearing that pop up on Britain. One day they say that the vaccine is still effective against the variant, then they do a 180 and say that it might not be effective against the variant after all. Plus the expectation that every scientific "study" about these things is supposed to be believed simply because it's "science."</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs okay my friend. Just keep in mind that we need to push back against the Covid overreach. If you leave the mask off, it‚Äôll give others the courage to go without a mask as well. Try to start building mental strength, so that you can do it. üí™üèªüß†</p>

        <p>My husband and I are both very anti-lockdown, but he convinced me we should start wearing our bandanas at the store after a dispute with Walmart security. I grudgingly agree. We can't afford to be banned from every store in town or potentially even get arrested, so we'd rather keep our heads down until we're more financially secure. Compared to mandatory vaccination, mass testing, and contact tracing, mask mandates are the least of our concern anyway. Better to pick our battles wisely until we can move out to a more rural area, as cities and suburbs seem to be the epicenter for almost every measure to control ~~us~~ the virus. We won't stoop to the level of "proper" earloop masks though.</p>

        <p>I work at a private school. We've been open since August, teaching in person, not requiring masks for students or teachers. Then we started getting reported by parents. So then, we had to ask that masks be worn between classes, despite very low numbers and limited spread due to other precautions being taken. We got reported more. Now, we are being required to wear masks in the classroom, too. If we don't enforce this, we risk the school getting fined or shut down. We are even having to make kids wear masks in the after school care program, so some of these kids are masking for 8-10 hours a day. Why would we keep letting the kids whose parents are reporting come to the school? Half the time, the parents complaining loudest have kids that don't mask at all...it's just frustrating. I can't even get my doctor to write me a note excusing me from this tomfoolery because I'm pregnant and in a higher risk group, despite the fact that breathing is tough with a little human compressing your diaphragm and lungs...</p>

        <p>If they are that concerned about it, they should have pulled their kids out and switched schools already. These karens probably can't conceive of the fact that that depriving their children of vital oxygen while their brains are still developing is infinitely more destructive than a virus that they have a 99.99% change of surviving. </p>
<p>Also I would shop around for a new doctor. No reason why you shouldn't be allowed an exemption for being pregnant.</p>

        <p>We offer virtual for all students who want it. No reason to even swap schools. I just don't get why the ones whining the loudest are the same ones whose kids don't follow what we have to enforce now.</p>
<p>I don't have issues with the doctors, as both primary care and OBGYN have been really good to me, and just want to make sure I'm healthy. Just frustrating that pregnancy makes me more vulnerable, despite the discomforts of breathing through a mask.</p>

        <p>A lot of the parents have this idea that their students are following every rule, even when they usually aren't. But their kids tend to 'help' when it's convenient. They may not wear masks, but they'll get evidence of their teachers not masking in a heartbeat, even though they aren't supposed to have their phones out.</p>

        <p>I said this somewhere else but I think that it makes for a good rant. It's something that pisses me off that I saw lately.</p>
<p>One of the biggest news companies of my country called de Telegraaf used to be a Nazi propaganda newspaper  telling us to hate the Jews and obey the Nazis. And now they're telling  blatant lies relating to the new normal. On Youtube I saw them talking  about someone who's fighting against the new normal in our country  (informing the public and fighting the government in court like a true  hero) and they said that he's ignorant of how science works and that  that's causing him to get frustrated which is why he supposedly lashes  out against the new normal. According to them he's anti-science and they patronised him by saying that he should be grateful to science because  without science we would have no phones. So I looked up his credentials  and found out that he's an actual scientist who finished a science education and has a science career and wrote scientific papers. </p>
<p>Did they  not know who they were talking about? Did they not bother to actually  look up this guy? To be fair though, this is about what I expected going in from literally an ex-Nazi propaganda company. Later I heard de Telegraaf talking about a pro-real-normal protestor and again they talked about him as if he's a  moron even stating that he has a low IQ. This time I did not even bother checking, I've seen enough lies from this literal ex-Nazi  propaganda paper. If I have to debunk all their statements then I'm never done because they keep shitting out lies and propaganda.</p>
<p>Pisses me off that those Tik Tok morons get treated like heroes while real heroes taking on the government, taking them to court, and informing the public get painted as if they're idiots. But during the Nazi regime de Telegraaf did the exact same thing but then Nazis and everyone who supported them were said to be the heroes and the supposed criminals were Jews and everyone who dared to associate with them or not shun them.</p>

        <p>Can we talk about how covid 19 has never been isolated or seen under a microscope? Only sars covid 2 supposedly. Guys read Aids Inc. by John Rapoport and you will have a aneurysm when you realize what they're doing with covid. Covid seems to be a "syndrome" they made up that is diagnosed when you have a positive sars cov 2 diagnosis and symptoms of any flu or anything. And the pcr test are literally so inaccurate they can just test anyone and come up with anything.</p>

<p>Exactly. Sars covid 2 is the virus and the disease from the virus is covid 19. </p>
<p>The pcr tests for sars cov 2 virus...that doesn't mean you "have" covid 19. Think of it like HIV and AIDs. Viruses don't necessarily cause disease. If so we would have died extrmely early in life.</p>

        <p>Fair point but 
1. That is not how it is presented by the media. There is a massive conflation between SARS cov 2 and covid 19 to the point where no one knows there is a difference. Then you have the very suspicious overlapping dieseas symptoms that are literally standard symptoms of any flu. 
2. Sars Cov 2 has never been isolated. Researchers have assumed there's an association between certain genetic material and sars cov 2 when there is no proof and are creating a vaccine that targets something no one can prove exists.</p>

        <p>Scientific studies do not equal truth. If that were the case we wouldn't be arguing about the accuracy of presented information on covid. Truth is truth. Logic is logic.

        <p>I think so much of this depression that people are experiencing comes from one big thing- too much time to think.</p>
<p>Life was not meant to be lived by sitting inside reading reddit or playing video games, at least not this extensively. </p>
<p>Of course some of you still have totally normal lives but to those in heavily lock down states, how would this not cause your mind to give out? Too much thinking is not good but harmful.</p>

        <p>This is a great thread in community. I have to vent. Husband is deployed and I have a toddler as well as being 11 weeks pregnant. Was going to do pick up groceries today but no timeslots open. So I put on my mask and we go early in the morning to a grocery store on the army base when there is like 5 people in the store. I have been way nauseous and breathless this pregnancy and as we're checking out I feel like I am going to faint. We are at self checkout so I think "whatever" and cardinally sin and take off my mask after wearing every damn time since they started asking. Checkout get receipt and am 20 feet from the door. Self check out watcher asks "MAM, where is your mask!?" She had the most clutching pearls expression on her face too. I told her we were just leaving. She says "You NEED a mask." Then store manager comes up to me, breaking social distancing and asks if he needs to call the MP (military police) on me. Told him I was leaving and felt out of breath so I just need to take my mask off momentarily. "Masks are the law. If you don't have one next time you come in there will be consequences and I will have to call security." 
I am just so fucking done. I don't judge people for wearing or not wearing masks. There were five customers in the whole store. You can't fucking mandate microbes. They're everywhere and we are stuck with them and fearing them and death does not help. Shit likes this makes me seriously consider never wearing a mask and just leaving if people ask because it's obvious these power trippers think they are now our holy shepherds.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're going through this, it's absurd. AND you're pregnant. Can't you ask for an exemption on the basis of being pregnant? From what I've read, "base commanders have been given authority to make exceptions to these [mask] rules based on local situations". Maybe you could talk to your physician? Or maybe use a "face shield" (I know, they look and are ridiculous).</p>

        <p>Even if it was possible for me to get a complaint high enough up to the base commander, it wouldn't be something I would want to do, I am sure they have larger fish too fry and I am not trying to make more people have more stress during these times. From what I know on this base there are no exceptions.
Yeah I might do a face shield if it keeps being a problem but I just can't believe how aggressive people that were seemingly peaceful a few years ago are these days.</p>

        <p>Maybe if you left the mask on, but just pulled it down on your chin, exposing your mouth and nose. Carry a water bottle and hold it like you are going to be taking a sip of it. I see people do that all the time, walk or talk with the masks down and a drink in their hand. No one says anything.  Then they can see you have a mask, and you can pull it up if they mess with you, pull it up, walk away, and pull it back down</p>

        <p>Anybody else wondering about the GME shenanigans and their connection to the "pandemic"? Distraction from the lockdowns so they can pass new rules without media coverage? A deliberate attempt by the people in charge to crash the economy (great reset time)? Just more fearmongering and hysteria for no purpose other than creating more tension, division and terror?</p>

        <p>Videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkP5OvWdREg&amp;t=48s">these</a> that make me do a double take. Ignore the actual content of it (I'm not spamming it for my own gain) but notice masks aren't an issue? Filmed in Sarasota Florida the past couple of days. It's not so much that they are completely at a normal way of life (That I envy), but that if you did that in my state there would be melt downs.</p>
