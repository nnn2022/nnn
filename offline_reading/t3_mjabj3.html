    <strong>UK Vaccine injury at 7.5%, likely higher.</strong>
    <p><p>Working off of publicly available data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/COVID-19-weekly-announced-vaccinations-25-March-2021-revised.xlsx">1.6 million UK residents received the second dose</a> between 8/12/20 to 21/03/21.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975808/COVID-19_mRNA_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print.pdf">120k severe injury from Pfizer-Biontech vaccines</a> between 9/12/20 to 21/03/21.</p>
<p><strong>120k injuries / 1.6 million second doses = 7.5%</strong></p>
<p>Note, this data does not show the injury caused by other vaccine makers (Astrazeneca, Moderna, Sputnik V, Valneva, Novavax, or Jansen), the injury rate is much higher.</p></p>

        <p>So far, the UK has ordered the following number of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833">vaccines</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>100M AstraZeneca</li>
<li>100M Valneva</li>
<li>60M Glaxosmithkline</li>
<li>60M Novavax</li>
<li>50M Curevac</li>
<li>40M Pfizer-Biontech</li>
<li>30M Janssen</li>
<li>17M Moderna</li>
</ul>
<p>This puts Pfizer-Biontech (8.75%) accounting for 120k injuries. If we assume the other vaccines are just as harmful, and that ratio of administered types of vaccine is similar to the numbers acquired, we can extrapolate the total number of injuries caused by all the UK vaccines:</p>
<p><strong>120k / 0.0875 = 1.37 Million injuries</strong></p>
<p>This puts the total expected vaccine injury rate at <strong>1.37M / 1.61M = 85%</strong></p>

        <p>The current narrative is that 2 doses to go back to normal.</p>
<p>Once covid passports become law, the new narrative will be that we need 2 doses per year to combat the yearly mutations, and to maintain the green check-mark on the covid passport.</p>
<p>The 457M doses are enough for 2 doses per person for 2 years, they will be ordering more.</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t see anywhere where this refers to injuries per second doses? It could be any adverse event after any dose in which case your numbers are wrong and it would be closer to 0.3%. Can you point out where you found that? Additionally this list isnâ€™t a list of only â€˜severe injuriesâ€™ unless you consider diarrhea, hard stool and ear discomfort severe?</p>

        <p>The findings of the latest pre-pandemic <a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158">mRNA study</a>, which states that all animals suffered vaccine-induced spike antibodies after the second dose and died within 3-6 months of injection.</p>
<p>Based on the above study, I'm assuming the majority of the injuries are caused by the second dose in the ongoing human trials. Of course, you can't know for sure until that data is actually recorded.</p>
<p>"severe injury" is the least misleading label for a data-set containing 120k reactions ranging from minor side effects all the way to critical injuries and fatalities.</p>

<p>Secondly this is SARS-CoV-1 in macaques. Not SARS-CoV-2 in humans.</p>

        <p>This data doesn't show that the vaccines caused any injuries. You'd need similar data for people who *didn't* get the vaccine, and then you could see if the rates for disorders are different. Like pain around vaccine site probably would be different in the two groups since the people who didn't get it shouldn't be able to get that, and flatulence (page 11 of the second one) would probably be about the same.</p>
<p>If you took two groups of 1.6M people and had one group drink a glass of water, and the other a glass of lead paint, you'd  see people in both groups getting the disorders above and some dying over the next three months just because those things happen. It doesn't mean the glass of water caused anyone to get sick or die, or that the lead didn't hurt anyone. You need to compare the two groups to see what is different.</p>

        <p>I agree with you to a point. This doesn't prove it but it does show it and should be cause for grave concern. Why haven't we seen concern or desire to prove/disprove the connection?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, vaccines are never tested with proper control groups, this one is no exception. I really wish it was done as you describe. However, I do believe that results of such a study would be too detrimental to the vaccination policy and for this reason it will never ever happen.</p>

        <p>It doesn't show the vaccine caused it any more than this data shows that being in the UK or winter weather caused these injuries. You need to compare to a control group to show that the vaccine had something to do with this. It very well could have, but that data isn't enough. If there were a difference between the control group and the data above, that would be a big cause for concern!</p>
<p>Vaccines are tested much more rigorously than what I described above, with proper control groups. Like in the data above, maybe the people they're looking at got the vaccine early because they're sick and old. If that's the case, we shouldn't compare them to healthy young people who didn't get it, we should compare them to sick old people like them who didn't.</p>
<p>In the safety and efficacy trials they get two groups of people, and the ages/health conditions/etc is basically the same between the two groups. Covid vaccines were tested in this way, and the testing is continuing. Here are three reports: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html">Moderna</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html">Pfizer</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html">JJ</a>. </p>
<p>You can see in any of those that they compare people who got the vaccine to a control group. People in the control group got some of the side effects, but people who got the vaccine had many more than in the control group. Nobody is pretending they have no side effects, but the covid vaccine is not the only thing in the world that makes people feel sick.</p>

        <p>Where are you getting "severe injury" from? The second report is listing and and all side effects, <em>not</em> "severe injuries."</p>
<p>Your 120k number is the <em>total</em> number of reported side effects and not the number of individuals reporting side effects. If someone reported nausea and diarrhea, you're counting that as two "severe injuries" which is quite misleading.</p>
<p>You're misrepresenting the data to try and show a conclusion that you want to be true, not one that actuslly is true</p>

        <p>The list includes minor, moderate, serious, severe, critical and maximal injuries as well as fatalities, calling all these "minor side effects" or "fatalities" doesn't properly label the data, so I went with the midpoint "injury / severe injury".</p>
<p>Regarding the 120k total, correct. I'm reporting the total percentage of injuries relative to the number of second doses. If I was reporting the number of individual injuries, I would have stated that 41k individual injuries.</p>
<p>More importantly, I haven't included the total number of injuries from all the vaccines, as I haven't been able to find that information. </p>
<p>The 7.5% figure is very conservative.</p>

        <p>Wow, this sure sounds like being classified as a COVID death if you died of another cause <em>with</em> COVID. I wonder what your take on that is?</p>

        <p>Damn, youâ€™re right. Just reading through, I noticed that many of the incidents with a significant number of occurrences were quite minor, like 10k cases of headaches. Uncomfortable, yeah, but not particularly severe. At best, they donâ€™t understand or didnâ€™t really look at the data theyâ€™re basing their conclusion on.</p>
