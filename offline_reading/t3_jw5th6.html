    <strong>DAE think that some people may "struggle" to return to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I know that overwhelming majority of people want to go back to normal and would easily do so.</p>
<p>However, I'm starting to see some doomers saying things like "I will never look at humans the same way again". For some reason, that struck a chord and got me thinking, after all of this some people try returning to normal but after developing a sense of disgust with crowds, unmasked people, etc., they end up unable to do so. I mean, there are some who strongly notice in TV shows and movies that people aren't wearing masks or social distancing. I wonder if some may be unable to connect to their pre-pandemic life as well. Do you think some may end up going back to their lockdown/COVID lifestyle even after all of this is over? The best analogy I can make would be like a prisoner after being released ends up being institutionalized and ends up trying to go back to prison.</p></p>

        <p>IIRC the idea of square dancing, and other spaced out group dancings rose in popularity after the Spanish flu. This was due to how many people were turned into germaphobes. </p>
<p>Yes, some people will have an issue returning to normal. We may see cultural shifts that give us more spaced out popular activities. However, for most people I think they'll embrace returning to normal.</p>

        <p>Think outside the box. People met each other for a long time before social media existed. They can do so, again, which is one reason why the social media sites love the lockdowns so much - they're afraid that we'll all wake up one day and realize that collectively, we don't need them.</p>
<p>Also - anon servers can get people past IP bans, if they really want to do so. Not that I can see why they would.</p>

        <p>I agree social media sucks. However we can't forget that it's a massive part of life today. On top of that, we don't yet know the extent that "vaccine passports" will exist for yet. We may be banned from bars and the like if we don't comply with the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Why would you want to meet somebody in a bar? I've never heard of that working out well.</p>
<p>Rural sheriffs have proven reluctant to enforce the Covid lunacy, as a group, it seems. One way of dealing with the problem you mention, should it arise at all, might be to join the rush and abandon the cities.</p>
<p>What's the reason to stay in them, anyway? The chance to walk past shuttered former cultural institutions en route to watching the next riot?</p>

        <p>It's just an off the cuff example. The big issue is what a possible vaccine passport will do in the future.</p>
<p>I agree that cities are full of degeneracy. I personally live a small city, with a lot of small town culture. While working in a small town. If it wasn't for the lack of people, shit internet, shit water pressure, etc of the small town, I'd live there. However Canada is thinking about implementing per city handgun bans. If my city passes such a move, it's small town living for me haha.</p>
<p>Personally I've never been in a city larger than 981k people. That was for a few hours. City I live in is 280k. Benefits over my small town of less than 5k?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Internet, gigabit vs 10/1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water pressure. Oh god showing at my friend's place makes me depressed there's no pressure. Like God damn it's pathetic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less things to do. In my small town your choices are hang with friends, go to the one bar, or drive an hour to find something to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decent selection of groceries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can buy anything on demand on a weekday. In a small town you have very limited selection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food. My small town has one fast food joint, a bunch of Asian restaurants, and a gas station that serves seafood. I think you can see the issue there for date night. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection of people. I grew up in my small town. There's few girls I'd even think about dating. Even fewer that would date me in return. If I moved back I don't think I'd see myself in a truely happy relationship. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least for me, far more reliable power. The small town loses power a lot. The city rarely does. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports/teams. Again, compared to my small town, you can actually find a rec team in the city you can play on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uhhhhh jobs? Yeah let's go with jobs. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I love small towns, but they do lack a few crucial things, especially for the young adult. I'd love to raise kids in a small town, but the city is better for a bachelor.</p>

<p>Uh, huh. I currently live in an apartment on the near north side of Chicago. That's a city of 2.7M people, located next to Lake Michigan, which is a few blocks away from where I live. When I was a kid, I spent a lot of my summers in a farm house my parents owned a few miles outside of a town of 3K people in Wisconsin. I doubt that you've ever heard of the place.</p>
<p>The water pressure in the place in Wisconsin was a lot higher. Not sure where you got the idea that water pumps were things that only big city governments could keep running, but this really isn't the case.</p>

        <p>Every small town in different. I've actually worked for my small town's government for a while, and as far as I'm aware, for the past decade the key to the water treatment plant was located on top of the door frame. At any point anyone could have literally shat in the town's drinking water, or hid a body in the large reservoir. There's no cameras, even to this day. </p>
<p>Issue is underpowered pumps. It's likely just that small town that has this issue, but it would be hard enough moving to the small town I knew. Let alone moving to a foreign small town, where I ask the home seller person if I can test out a shower before buying the home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the real world ... recent graduates have been complaining about the difficulty of finding jobs in major cities since the late 20th century. Business has been moving out of the big cities for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Yes, one could get work in more remote locations, before the lockdowns. Now - and this is the point you seem to be refusing to get -  getting  them in the largest cities is nearly impossible, because almost everything has been shut down over an unusually harsh flu bug, under the guidance of some shaky looking theory. Meaning that it will probably happen again.</p>
<p>There are things a lot nastier than Covid-19 waiting to find their way over here.</p>

        <p>For the record, the "uhhhhh" was because I was struggling to find a reason, but wanted 10 points. I use jobs because there's a small variety of jobs in a small town. While I'm sure big cities have lost businesses, if for nothing more than taxes, there's still a far larger variety of jobs in even a small city vs a small town. Especially if you moved there before finding a job. </p>
<p>Morso, I ignored the WuFlu in my comparison as it's not normal life. This is a exception from the rules.</p>

        <p>&rt; Young people are scared.</p>
<p>No, they're not.  They're <em>acting</em> scared, because they think it's noble and virtuous to do so and they enjoy having an excuse to shame people and lord their self-righteousness over others.</p>

        <p>Yes people will. It's intentional. The big tech folks profiting from this scare people to control them. </p>
<p>Terrorists no longer scare people into complying. The war on terror is ending. </p>
<p>The war on disease is beginning. I'm sure they'll market it better than calling it a war. But they will keep finding new reasons to exploit fear and turn it into obedience. And apparently we are horrified of disease now.</p>

        <p>One of my friends is an introvert who spends a lot of time at home as it is. Today I invited her to drop by to see our new kittens. (She loves cats) Her response “I'll have to take a pass. I'm too afraid of covid-19 leave the house. But thanks for inviting me.”</p>
<p>It took all that I had to not say anything back.</p>

        <p>Think?  No.  I do not think that.  I <em>know</em> that.</p>
<p>A very wise man once said  "Idolatry is committed, not merely be setting up false gods, but also by setting up false devils; by making men afraid of war or alcohol, or economic law, when they should be afraid of spiritual corruption and cowardice."</p>
<p>That's not what's happened here.  Here, the people as a whole have mass converted; turned their back on their gods, be they natural, supernatural, or artificial, and turned to embrace the great god Fear.  The War on Terror is over, and Terror has won.  </p>
<p>Most people will break, of course; they'll start to come around eventually, and we'll have some semblance of normality back in due time.  But the diehards will stay zealous for a long, long time.</p>
