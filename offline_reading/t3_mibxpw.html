    <strong>Got an outdoors job so I don't have to wear a mask at work.</strong>
    <p><p>Well that's not the only reason, but it's definitely a perk.  A little backstory:</p>
<p>I left my job working in a lab.  I was only there for 2 months but I still barely knew what anybody looked like because we all had to wear masks inside.  Usually I am really sociable with my coworkers but with this job it was really hard to build a rapport with them because A) I could barely hear what the fuck they were saying, and B) I couldn't read their lips or detect social cues with their expressions.  This made it really difficult to build a connection with them.  Sometimes it would actually give me lucid nightmares, where my coworkers had big, gaping voids where their mouths should be.  Pretty horrific stuff.</p>
<p>About two or three weeks ago they started getting vaccines.  I asked my boss why he was getting it if he still had to wear a mask and do the social distancing bullshit, and he didn't really have an answer.  Then I found out he hadn't seen his mom in a year.  Wow.  I think I visited my parents like 3 times in the past year.  Anyway at this job people were getting vaccines but there was absolutely no end in sight for getting rid of the mask bullshit.  So what's the point?  The place was still filled with paranoid people.  Multiple coworkers would sneeze into their masks constantly, which is fucking disgusting.  One time one of them sneezed into their mask and said "I hope you're vaccinated."  Yeah man I am fine, I got my immune system, but you should probably wash that shit.  Another time this guy that wore two masks asked me if I was going to get the vaccine and I was just like "eh we'll see, I'm gonna wait" and he started getting on my case about it so I just diverted the conversation because I am not going to argue with an obvious paranoiac wearing two fucking masks.</p>
<p>Also having to wear a mask 8 hours a day was seriously affecting my breathing after a while.  I got winded faster from doing basic physical labor, and I noticed it became harder to draw breaths when I was off work at home.  Just breathing in my own bacteria all day for 8 hours, so healthy.</p>
<p>Anyway I got something else lined up and left that stupid place and their paranoia behind.  When I went to go apply for this new job I went into their office and saw nobody was wearing a mask and I was like "yup this is the place for me."  It's a lateral career move and it will pay more than the previous one, but I'll be working outside in the fresh air with no mask.  Plus it's a 3 minute commute and you can't beat that.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I agree even if it was less money it sounds like it would have been the right decision. I couldn't imagine wearing a mask for 8 hours. I mean I don't wear one but for five minutes at my kids school for drop off (just haven't fought it there) and it's awful lol</p>

        <p>I've wondered if part of the objective for the masking mandates was to complicate our ability to communicate since the virus limiting efficacy of the muzzles is questionable at best.</p>
