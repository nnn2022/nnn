    <strong>Going back to home country for a month, emotions starting to pile up.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I am an international student in the U.S. who saw through the bullshit from day 1. At the time the pandemic began, I moved back to my home country with my family, as many International Students did, and things didn't go the way I thought they would.</p>
<p>Our country went under militarized lockdown. Anyone caught outside of their houses who were not going to the supermarket for food could be arrested. We were not allowed to jog outside even in a close neighborhood because of these regulations. Disinfectant stations were setup to go in to the supermarket, when you went back home, people thought you could catch Covid from surfaces (shoes are still a problem for some smh), groceries were disinfected thoroughly (imagine spraying alcohol on top of food, lol), people were scared, fearmongering was insane, etc., etc. </p>
<p>As soon as I could fly back to the United States, I did. Unfortunately, I live in a very, very liberal state, which wasn't the dreamland I was hoping of coming back to. Either way, it was a huge relief.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to present day and I had to get vaccinated because my University required it, although I keep an extremely healthy lifestyle and don't need the vaccine whatsoever (that goes without mentioning all the possible side-effects and crap that everyone willfully ignores because their daddy government's want <em>the best for all of us).</em> Looking at the bright side, at least I have an excuse to not follow any "health recommendation" because I had to be part of the experimental group, lol.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will soon go back to my home country. Things are looking a lot better there, the fearmongering has reduced, no longer militarized lockdown, vaccines are being distributed (for those who think that a 99.74% survival rate virus is a problem), etc. However, in my country I know absolutely <strong>nobody</strong> who sees through the bullshit. Everyone talks about covid, about the death count, about how terrible things are, how the vaccines will save them, etc. The social pressure is insane.</p>
<p>I don't plan on following alleged "health recommendations". They're going to have to force me to use a mask. They're going to have to force me to bow down to the world-ending catastrophe that Covid is. They're going to have to leave my life if they cannot stand someone who opposes complete government control and submission.</p>
<p>I will try to keep the good fight. I was way over these things until I started noticing the situation back at home, so it's a situation I will have to face.</p>
<p>Just a small rant. Once again, back at home, there is nobody I know who I can speak to about this. Needed to vent.</p></p>

        <p>U.K. here, absolutely nothing like that, we’ve had all restrictions released, I just attended a massive event with no masks or social distancing. We never had a lockdown with arrests for being out jogging. The fear at the moment is vaccine passports coming in September to get into bars etc. At the moment though nothing is being enforced, and protests are trying to keep it that way.</p>

        <p>Didn’t those women get tickets for being in a Park drinking a coffee?  And the old gal in her garden having a cuppa got raided at 9.45 pm. ?  And wasn’t there that snowball fight (Leeds) where arrests were made?  I live in the US now but my family  are Brits and they tell me stuff.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say some police don’t abuse their power, they’re statistically more likely to psychopaths, but it’s not a police state. </p>
<p>Park drinking a coffee - this decision by one officer was overturned by his superior, the fine was never paid </p>
<p>The other two, not heard of them, I don’t doubt they happened, I feel sorry for the old gal but that will have been an abuse of power and you only know about it because of the media attention (I.e, everyone agrees that’s insane), the officer likely suspended, and as for the snowball fight that sounds like it happened during our hard lockdown and it would have counted as a group of more than 6 gathering outside, again ridiculous but that just wasn’t allowed for a bit.</p>
<p>Now with cases declining while we have no restrictions I don’t see another lockdown coming.</p>
<p>We really do need to push back against the vaccine passports though, it looks like it doesn’t have much support in parliament, if cases keep going down we need to make sure the coronavirus act isn’t renewed in September so they have no right to ever put any restrictions on again.</p>

        <p>I hope you are right. I really do. The thing that upset me most about the old woman in the garden, she was in an assisted living home and someone grassed on her, that’s what got me the most, I mean what kind of people do that to an old woman who was seeing a friend in the garden of her assisted living home. The cops turned up at nearly 10 o’clock at night and intimidated her and actually insisted that she show them identification and she was all flustered because she was nearly 80. She didn’t have anything and then she ended up finding an old driving license I just got so angry I wanted to scream. I thought of my mother going through something like that and then I thought about the cops doing it I thought how could you do that what kind of a person are you to think this is ok. It made the news over here. It’s the little things. They add up. There’s actually a video of the snowball fight. Yes it’s funny in a way as all the snowballers scatter as the cops raid them but deep down it’s not. They were just letting off steam after being cooped up and what did they expect. Even in California we’ve had some hard lockdowns but some of the sheriffs of the counties here have been pretty outspoken making videos saying they are not enforcing any of the draconian measures being put forward by the governors etc. of the different states so it’s been quite good like that they said people have already got enough to cope with and they are not going to add to their misery by fining people  or arresting them or checking up on them but other than that it’s been pretty dire here. I have to work in San Francisco from time to time and I was up there in April and it was just awful to see the city the way it is now. The people in San Francisco are totally hysterical and just bent over. I’m a member of the San Francisco sub on Reddit mainly for the photography and just stories about the city which I love, but it’s such a depressing sub now if you go on there.  It just is so upsetting to see what everybody is saying and how they all agree with what’s going on there. They are just about to issue new rules about who can go inside bars.  In some bars you need to show proof of  vaccination  and many of the bars in San Francisco are going along with it it’s unbelievable. It’s not a law yet but it’s scary. Anyway. Vent over.</p>

        <p>At one point our government was suggesting people should report their neighbours and they’ve had everyone scared, lots of people are still scared, and worse than that, divided. The division and polarisation is really scary and it’s where comparisons to 1930s Germany don’t actually seem so unreasonable. And it’s happening all over, not just in the U.K., the USA is more divided and polarised than ever, like him or love him, that was actually one of the goals of Trump’s campaign. </p>
<p>Everyone needs to keep their eyes open to this, the further divided we are the easier we are to conquer. The more the pro-lockdown pro-vaxxers think that those turning down the covid vaccine are selfish and should die, the worse it gets. </p>
<p>That sounds horrible what happened to the old lady, the kids should have been allowed to let off steam, god knows everyone needs it, and the USA is doing a much better job at rejecting the “new normal” than we are. Loved a recent article here that we’re walking head first into tyranny while the USA fights against everything happening but the media are just not covering any of our protests and the government are either doing everything really slowly or just really unsuccessfully, there’s so much back peddling it’s hard to keep up what is and what isn’t gonna be enforced going on.</p>
<p>And yeah, it’s depressing seeing what a lot are saying everywhere, it just comes back to the polarisation. Social media is the virus, there’s a documentary on Netflix “The Social Dilemma” that shows exactly how we ended up in this mess. The TLDR is that on your phone you’ll be shown much more content related to anti-vax anti-lockdown and doomers will be shown much more content related to staying in doom and getting vaccinated etc, because all the social platforms have figured out which content keeps them scrolling to show more ads.</p>
<p>Solution… stop watching the news and delete social media, if everyone in the world did that I think the pandemic would be over</p>

        <p>I like to say that the real virus is the media and in particular social media. I often say to my friends if all of this had happened say in 1998 or 2000 to 2004 we wouldn’t be where we are right now. Information gets passed at lightning speed much of it is not even true, we’ve opened Pandora’s box if you like,  the genie is out of the bottle and there’s no way of putting it back. No way. I get terribly depressed just thinking about it and I just don’t know what the answer is. One of my favorite quotes is from years ago when people started posting stuff on social media and someone said look just because you can do a bit of research on Google it doesn’t make you a journalist. We just have so much information at our fingertips much of it you know, not even true before you know it someone says something and it just spreads like wildfire. The world is totally flat now. I agree that the division is frightening more so because there’s never any middle ground is there,  it’s either for something or against it, very few people are in the middle. Sometimes I’m really grateful that I live in a quite remote area in California so I’ve been in some ways cocooned from some of the madness in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco although I have worked in San Francisco twice since the pandemic started and that was a terrifying experience. Where I am living, we are a remote desert community and a lot of people out here are very anti-lockdown, anti-mask,  anti-vaccine anyway so I’ve got lots of friends up here that feel the same way that I do. But the majority of them do not. Even my own family. That’s been really hard to deal with. My incredibly intelligent sister who always hated the government really, didn’t believe any of them actually did anything for anyone,  now she’s just capitulated and it’s been one of the shocks of my life. She recently called me and asked me how I was and just because I was a bit depressed about everything She told me she couldn’t listen to me anymore and she’d call me back when I felt happier. Anyway I don’t wanna keep venting because it’s depressing but I am scared right now I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel to be honest. I keep saying to anyone that will listen I can’t wait to see all the movies that are going to be made about this cluster fuck because there’s gonna be quite a few because I do feel that the truth usually always comes out,  I hope so anyway. I think it’s gonna take a long time for some reason though</p>
