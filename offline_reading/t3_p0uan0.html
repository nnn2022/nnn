    <strong>Mask Depression</strong>
    <p><p>Don't want to live in a world where masks are mandatory for an indefinite period. My state just re-instated mask mandates and it's put me into a state of despair (alongside the pressure to get the vax and all the other crap). No one around me seems to understand why it's a big deal - and in the beginning of this whole thing, I didn't think it was a big deal to just wear them in stores and such. I'm lucky to have a WFH job rather than a job where I had to mask up all day (but I feel this empathetic sadness whenever I see workers stuck in masks for hours on end).</p>
<p>Anyone else feel this way? Like masks take away the beauty of life and human connection?</p></p>

        <p>Mask to take away people’s humanity. Thats the point. People that are okay with mask mandates are the real sheeple that are lost. Unfortunately its your destiny is to know the truth. The consequence os swallowing the red pill is that you cannot go back.</p>

        <p>I hate masks because I want to see people smile. One thing I picked up is how fake some people are though, where you couldn’t even tell if they were smiling or not with a mask on because their eye muscles didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am with you… I started feeling depressed myself and feeling like I am the only one who doesn’t see this as a problem. I mean, to sink civilization, the economy, the health of our kids for what? Old fucking people who already had lived their life? For gluttonous slobs who destroyed their health by eating shit, being lazy, doing drugs etc? Fuck off. Everybody is responsible for themselves.</p>
<p>I hope you can dig yourself out. I am so glad I found this Reddit though because finding like minded people really brought back hope for me</p>

I'll be OK - I am quite resilient - but it helps a lot to be able to share some of my deeper feelings here.</p>

        <p>I agree, my friend. I hope I didn’t sound too callous… but I strongly believe we cannot crush the future with this nonsense for people who, otherwise, lived their lives. The young will be the ones bringing us a better future to take care of us. We are not teaching them well if we follow these bs laws.</p>

        <p>I agree... but I have to be careful what I say among most people because they will say I don't care about the elderly. I actually care a lot - I think they should have support to live quality lives while they are alive ( this means not being isolated!) and should have preventative and treatment options for illness... but not shut down the whole world for them.</p>

        <p>Masks have become a trigger for me, I honestly don't know how I will ever go to the dentist again. If it weren't a big deal to wear one, then people would be just fine with me not wearing one. Seeing adults in masks annoys me, but seeing children in masks lights a fire of rage inside me. We are creating a bleak future for these kids. Masks will never become normalized, not while I still draw breath.</p>
<p>But yes, this BS has caused me depression as well, more so than usual. I've been having very dark thoughts.</p>

        <p>I feel this. They are a trigger for me too. I am angry because my kids have to wear a mask to school. No one gave a damn during flu season. There is no way Newsom will mandate masks before the recall but after, all bets are off. My county probably will mandate masks even though we haven’t had any deaths and our 7 day average is 47 cases with no new cases in the last week. They just put out a flyer with a girl dressed in a cap with a surgical mask and gloves that says “your superpower is wearing a mask”. So I think a mask mandate is on the horizon and honestly if it happens, I will cry. Masks are so dehumanizing. And by making kids wear them, we are teaching them to a)comply and b) do whatever the government tells them to do because “it’s for their safety” when we know damn well it’s not for their safety. I’ve had very dark thoughts myself. Sometimes the future feels very bleak.</p>

        <p>Im in CA as well. Pulled the kids out of public and put in private. Never going back. My kids were in-person the whole year. We had an emergency fund and this was our emergency. We got our kids in before the wave of interest but during the year new kids would show up when spots opened therefore its never too late to try to enroll. Sure they had to wear mask but everyone including the teachers had zero mask discipline especially towards the end of the year. Don’t be intimidated by the cost because most schools have scholarships and the more you pay does not mean the private school educate better. Even the cheapest private is better then the average public. We pay about 12k per year per 2 kids. There was not a day last year that they regretted going to school. A lot of people feel that tuition is a cost they pay for all eternity but in reality its just a phase in life and you can try it on a year by year basis.</p>

        <p>For me it was a big deal from the very beginning when they first suggested them. Not only suggesting people be paranoid enough to wear one, but trying to force them just to go places like a store or doctor. Absolutely disgusting and dystopian.</p>
