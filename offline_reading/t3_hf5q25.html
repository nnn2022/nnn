    <strong>Why Do People Believe Social Media So Much In The " New Normal " ?</strong>
    <p><p>It's common knowledge at this point that social media and msm are agenda-narrative driven and mostly just function as some form of political or corporate propaganda... I wanted to highlight social media platforms like facebook, reddit and twitter where people have to understand, we aren't customers of social media, we are the products... Always remember, if it's free your the product.</p>
<p>Twitter doesn't care half the accounts on it's platform are bots spewing agenda driven propaganda, same as reddit... When you see massive pro lockdowns posts or mask shaming for not wearing them and you call them Karen's, there not Karen's, there bots created for that purpose of propaganda. Normalize the Orwellian agenda. Make the minority seem like a majority, then public conformity does it's thing.</p>
<p>Social media cater to who ever they have to make peace with, there companies with a bottom line and know exactly who they have to serve in order to stay alive and going.</p></p>

        <p>As naive as it may sound, it never occurred to me until recently that there were bots on Reddit. I mean I can spot the bot created posts but it never occurred to me that they were also in the replies. </p>
<p>Who or what are these people/accounts and how can we better spot them?</p>

        <p>I don't have an answer to you... There seems to be this massive synchronized effort globally to normalize lockdowns, mandatory masks and line ups until the end of the year on social media yet I don't know of anyone in real life who does or even want to participate in this environment much longer. </p>

<p>Social medias ban them but only when they are from China, Russia and the non coalition countries... Deep state agenda driven bots and pro lockdown/pro vaccine bots seem to flourish tho.</p>

        <p>From the 2019 article:</p>
<p>“...while another from the same year showed that real Twitter users with more than 10 million followers tended to behave in a similar manner to bots.”</p>
<p>This is so telling and proves that humans behaving like programmed automatons is what social media has mostly become. Only, their beliefs have been programmed and manipulated without them ever realizing it. Those with the most reach and influence are programming their followers. </p>
<p>This is how you get to where we are today with the COVID narrative and every other important issue out there.</p>

        <p>Same.. I thought Reddit was pretty bot-free. How do we spot the Reddit bots?</p>

        <p>People tell themselves they can consume it because they find it entertaining and just filter out the propaganda. Unfortunately that's not how the human mind works. It's way easier to accept what you're told than think critically about it, and if you hear something often enough you tend to assume it's true</p>
