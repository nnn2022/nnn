    <strong>Discussion of covid vaccines will be censored</strong>
    <p><p>There are increasingly frequent and strident calls to ban "anti-vaccine misinformation" on the grounds that it might decrease societal acceptance and uptake of the covid-vaccine candidates. This new wave of censorship was only to be expected since the commercial and financial interests surrounding covid vaccines are much larger than for masks, lockdowns, and covid in general.</p>
<p>The UK Labour party has joined the vaccine censorship brigade:</p>

</ul>
<p>The tech giants have lined up to impose vaccine-related censorship just as they did with masks and other covid topics:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/social-media-giants-agree-package-of-measures-with-uk-government-to-tackle-vaccine-disinformation">Social media giants agree package of measures with UK Government to tackle vaccine disinformation</a></p>

        <p>If you could actually debunk the anti-vaccine stuff, you would not need to infringe on the free speech of these people like this.</p>
<p>I frankly think that the anti-vaccine period people are stupid... vaccines are good and once you are over 7 or only do one vaccine every 2 weeks with no genetic disorders, there are no connections to autism.</p>
<p>However infringing on free speech? No damned way.</p>

        <p>Trotting Kill and Malevolence Gates around like billionaire doctors in dressage has done more to convince me that vaccines are pure evil than ever before. I'm pissed that our public health system is nothing more than a giant advertising agency for Big Pharma.</p>

<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jv26ro/vaccine_needs_to_be_stored_at_70_degrees/</p>
<p>SS -"This means that at this temperature it is inert or not active. That means at -70C there is a very limited amount of latent and/or kinetic energy that can be expressed.</p>
<p>If it were an explosive, biological material, a virus or bacteria that could rapidly grow, <strong>a biological nano-machine</strong> that had to stay in stasis until delivered that would all make sense but a simple vaccine with common adjuvants does not add up. </p>
<p>The only time I have seen injectable material that had to be maintained at these kinds of extreme temperatures it was a modeled AIDS-like virus used to transport RNA to other cells, meaning a biological engine used to splice DNA and alter the genetic material of the target cells.</p>
<p>I know what happens with binary replication in cellular transport systems. The first injected virus changes a cell, which creates 2 copies, those 2 copies change 2 cells which creates 4 copies, it doubles at each interaction. At some point half the body changes the other half and the host dies."</p>
<p>*This was info by someone listed as Dave Meckanic online and I found it very interesting so I looked into this RNA vaccine situation more.  </p>
<p>"A new class of vaccines, “RNA vaccines”, has recently been developed. RNA vaccines rely on a different way to mimic infection. Compared to previous vaccines, this method is more robust, more versatile, and yet, equally efficient. Therefore, the RNA vaccine technology holds great promise to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases, such as influenza or cancer.</p>
<p>Have you heard about RNA vaccines? This technology recently made the news when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation invested $53 million in the German company, CureVac, which specializes in the development of these vaccines" - Graduate Student Group at the Harvard Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>"mRNA vaccines, trick the body into producing some of the viral proteins itself. They work by using mRNA, or messenger RNA, which is the molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action. Inside a cell, mRNA is used as a template to build a protein. ‘An mRNA is basically like a pre-form of a protein and its (sequence encodes) what the protein is basically made of later on,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.</p>
<p>"To produce an mRNA vaccine, scientists produce a synthetic version of the mRNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins. This mRNA is delivered into the human body, whose cells read it as instructions to build that viral protein, and therefore create some of the virus’s molecules themselves. These proteins are solitary, so they do not assemble to form a virus. The immune system then detects these viral proteins and starts to produce a defensive response to them.</p>
<p>Because mRNA vaccines are only now beginning to be tested in humans, there are a lot of fairly basic unknowns which can only be answered through human trials. ‘What is really the current challenge, I think, is to understand whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response in the human and to understand, for example, which quantities of mRNA will be needed to do this,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.</p>
<p>Other outstanding questions include whether the proteins that have been chosen for the vaccine are the right ones to prevent a coronavirus infection in the body, how targeted the immune response is to this particular coronavirus, how long any immunity would last, and whether it causes side-effects such as increased inflammatory responses like redness and swelling or, in the worst case, aggravates disease." - Horozen the EU research and innovation magazine</p>
