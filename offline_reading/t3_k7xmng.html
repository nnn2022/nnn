        <p>I live in MA and the casinos are the only place that I can still see other human beings. Seeing human beings is the only thing that’s keeping me from thoughts of killing myself. </p>
<p>My school is closed, most restaurants are closed, all the public areas are closed, all the streets are empty and devoid of life. What the fuck else do they want from us? These antisocial nerds got their lockdowns and they <em>still</em> want more to be closed down. They’ve ruined this state, and they still want to create more despair over a 99.9% survival rate.</p>
<p>If we let these paranoid freaks have their way with the world, there will be nothing left on this planet to live for. There are already so many people suffering but it isn’t enough for these doomers. They will never be happy until we’re all depressed, empty husks living in permanent solitary confinement. </p>
<p>If I met one of these smug “health experts” in real life I’d be going to jail for assault.</p>

        <p>Well said.  I am sorry you are in a place that sounds like pure dystopia.  We all have varying degrees of this shit that we are dealing with.  You are not alone, though you may feel that way sometimes.  </p>
<p>Ignore the fearism that is pervasive around us.</p>

        <p>The dining restrictions are definitely screwing our sales in restaurants bad. Real slow past 4 weeks. Some places voluntarily closed indoor dining only to go. More restrictions would really kill us.</p>

        <p>When what you're doing isn't working, try doing more stuff that won't work either. MA has some of the most draconian policies in the nation and is not any better off than more maskless and open states. There are people who whine that it's because people are not following the rules, which some aren't, but compliance in MA is far beyond what you'll find in most other places.</p>

        <p>One of the Tweets:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>I don't think I ever voted to elect a "public health official."</strong> Who credentialed these ppl to make demands of us and attempt to run our lives? I don't recall ever giving consent to this. These people are largely nothing more than socialist MDs who failed to make it on their own. </p>
<p>The insanity just does not stop. You get what you vote for, oh wait, I forgot no one elected Jha but them folks over in MA sure voted for that Jack Ass of a governor.</p>
<p>I have a theory. The Boston Bombings was a false flag to see what Americans, in particular Massachusetts, would tolerate. The event showed Americans would tolerate the militarized civilian police on the streets (see Boston Bombings response) violating their rights. Not one American picked up a firearm a fought back; the people of Boston got played like a violin. So by us Americans allowing that to happen, the governors have issued these "executive orders" knowing full well, us Americans, at least in Massachusetts are not going to do a damn thing.</p>
<p>So when these technocrats and bureaucrats open their moves, and say we need to do X, Y and Z, you're going to get the huddled masses say, "yes, massa!"</p>
