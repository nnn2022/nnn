        <p>&rt;    Those who are authoritarian in nature don‚Äôt care about seeking out the truth. Rather, they‚Äôd prefer to seek out authority. It‚Äôs one of the reasons why you‚Äôre seeing so many people who‚Äôd happily approve the silencing of any medical experts whose views contradict the WHO or CDC guidelines. ‚ÄúObey the rules!‚Äù becomes more important than questioning if the rules were legitimate to begin with. </p>

        <p>Yep. I've brought up how unhealthy this situation is for children, that they should not be living in fear that they are going to die, that it was great to see them out at Disney World with their families having fun, they need that, not to be locked up all of the time living in fear. As I expected, I was flooded with downvotes. </p>

        <p>Exactly, and that belief is spot on. Here in the Nordics we don't believe children can get a bad corona case, so they don't fear anything here or are scared. When we send them home it's to reduce new cases. Not to protect them because there is not really anything to protect them from.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in USA if a child doesn't wear a mask or goes to school people are murders or something dumb.</p>

        <p>This is so rationale. So logical. I det√©n feel like I‚Äôm waking around in an insane asylum. I‚Äôm so grateful for thinking differently about this. My husband tells me he‚Äôs incredulous that I don‚Äôt believe the 6 companies that control all media we consume. The only thing we‚Äôre spreading is fear. The only thing contagious is fear. The only thing to be afraid of is fear.  We have a pandemic of fear. Humanity Is not a pathogenic virus. Healthy people breathing oxygen is now seen as a enemy act. I see people look at me like I have three heads when I walk around without my mask. They don‚Äôt know how to reconcile it. This has to stop. The cold and the flu will always exist because our bodies will always heal themselves when we are either  deficient in something we need or trying to rid our bodies of too many toxins. There is nothing new under the sun except what nightmare scenario someone can dream up to divide us more. Enough. https://questioningcovid.com</p>

        <p>The thing is, these aren‚Äôt even really theories, not by the actual scientific term.  They‚Äôre hypothesis‚Äô at best, and typically fall apart very quickly with basic research.  I could tell you of the countless ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù that break so easily, like one that says the Wuhan lab is owned by Soros through a convoluted web of businesses.  Two seconds online immediately showed that no, it wasn‚Äôt owned by a business of any sort.  It was a government owned research lab.  But the biggest issue with a lot of them?  They‚Äôre inherently self sealing.  If you don‚Äôt believe it, you‚Äôre a sheep, or have been paid off or brainwashed.  That isn‚Äôt exactly conducive for critical thought on it, because then you might just be a sheep.  But... username checks out I guess?  You can say you can critically think about it, but when every media and expert is in on it, then clearly they‚Äôre wrong and you find another avenue, some source somewhere that agrees with you.  That isn‚Äôt critical thought.  That‚Äôs working with a bias, and even actual theories have been tainted by issues of bias or even potential bias.  Just give it some thought okay?  </p>
<p>I simply want people to live a happy healthy life, and the government has always restricted rights in some ways to protect public health.  Illegal drugs are a good example, but for one closer to the example of Covid, seatbelt laws are also one, or maybe drunk driving is more your cup of tea?  It isn‚Äôt a violation of rights to ask for a small concession of rights in exchange for a public health issue.  It‚Äôs simply the government trying to make sure its citizens are at the very minimum healthy, and not dead.</p>

        <p>Lol theories aren't necessarily wrong, but they aren't necessarily right.  I've been in this sub for a while, most of the 'theories' I've seen here are just really bad takes full of statementslike "well, it makes sense to me" or "the <em>real</em> problem is the so called 'experts'"</p>
<p>The 'theories' on this sub seem to just be the random thoughts of people who have done minimal research or have a very limited knowledge of whatever they're forming their theory about but they have no idea what they don't know that they don't know, it's called these dunning kruger effect...  what is it you do for a living?  Could it be seen by somebody with a rudimentary understanding of the topic as pretty simple?</p>

        <p>Science is all about curiosity and experimentation to validate hypotheses (theories).  I have found that a lot of the questions I think of end up directing me to the CDC data itself.</p>
<p>It's quite obvious that the leading experts do not always immediately have all of the answers or right answers due to the novel aspect of the disease but more importantly, the strategies and related ethical concerns.</p>
<p>People here are typically raising the questions that most people were thinking back in March before the narrative shifted from "we're all in this together" to "non compliance is equivalent to murder".</p>
<p>Unelected health officials making life changing decisions for people would have seemed like a conspiracy theory less than one year ago because in the past it seemed more focused on providing guidance on health matters as opposed to end-to-end policy, legislation and enforcement.</p>
<p>The problem with that is that once you grant that type of authority, it is unlikely you will get it back and eventually the power will be held by somebody who you disagree with politically who doesn't have the same altruistic motives you gave it up for.  Lockdowns for terrorism or whatever is the crisis de jure seem inevitable to me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyways, there is some dumb stuff in the sub sometimes and m often people  people disagree with me politically but resistance against the New Normal strives to be a non-partisan and that is what brings people together.  I'm hoping it can be used to help ease the destructive hyper-polarization that is coming to a tipping point.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p>
