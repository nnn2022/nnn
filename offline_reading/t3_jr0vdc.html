        <p>So if the news came January 21st when Biden was President, it'd be okay?</p>
<p>Trump's not making the vaccine himself. Pfizer wouldn't put out a vaccine that doesn't work if they want to stay in business.</p>

        <p>Yes, but the people in urban NY are mostly dumb and vote the same shit over and over again. Its the same across American big cities. They vote Democrat all the way despite massive failure of most of their policies. Ironically, a lot of them flee to red states and sadly vote for the same bad policies that made them immigrate again. Its a mess.</p>

        <p>It took COVID for me to realize that he was right the whole time about “fake news” and wrongful persecution from the left.</p>
<p>He is an abrasive asshole and he puts his foot in his mouth sometimes, but the way the media blows everything out of proportion/deliberately misrepresents what he says/treats his idle musings as though it’s all stuff he’s really going to follow through on, is disgusting.  It’s absolutely right, they will jump through any hoops necessary to paint him as the villain of the story.  And I expect they will continue doing so for years after he leaves office.  Like holy fuck, get a hobby, hating one guy that much is unhealthy</p>

        <p>Well as long as you're not in NY/CA/HI/IL or some other super left leaning state, Trump has essentially ended lockdowns because now no other states will have a reason to enforce.</p>

        <p>There's a guy named Gene Robinson, who made history as the first openly gay Episcopal bishop.  This caused controversy at the time, and one of the big complaints was that this was "an assault on traditional Christian marriage".  To be clear: this was not the Episcopal Church approving of gay marriage; they didn't then, and I think they still don't today.  This was just them appointing a gay bishop.  I remember thinking "I'm just glad that the church's founder, Henry Tudor, and his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and his wife, Anne Boleyn, and his wife, Jane Seymour, <em>and wife his, Anne of Cleves, and his wife, Catherine Howard,</em> <strong><em>and his wife, Catherine Parr</em></strong>, aren't around to see this heinous assault on traditional Christian marriage".</p>
<p>But that was just a few devotees being a little crazy, right?  Well, back when gay marriage was the political issue of the day, I remember wondering what kind of magical anti-sanctity powers gay people had that were so much worse than Hollywood's "more spouses than fingers for rings" and "24-hour quickie marriage and divorce" fads were.</p>
<p>I think the same kind of powers were afforded to Donald Trump, in the eyes of his political opponents, and were spread to much of the American public.  It's dwarfed even the anti-Obama vitriol of twelve years ago.</p>

        <p>It’s bad news because of that way in which  the current administration plans to vaccinate. First focusing on the private administration of the vaccine which will be focused on major metropolitan areas first. The issue that Cuomo sees is that it won’t trickle into poorer areas (in terms of easy access to health care) and those people will continue to be disproportionately affected by infections. The reason they want to stop or slow down the current administrations plan is that they won’t be able to undo the plan in 2 months when Biden takes over. It will be harder to shift gears and refocus on the areas that actually need the vaccine.</p>
<p>But don’t worry guys, you’re crackpot conspiracy theories are just as valid as what was actually said, which apparently none of you listened to.</p>

        <p>Also it was his policies that left out the most vulnerable at the beginning, he gave nursing homes a financial incentive and a liability shield to take infected patients and did one of the stronger lockdowns in the country that kept the poorest working on the "front lines" and NY still has one of the highest per capita death rates.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about financial incentive so I won’t comment, but you are right that he directed nursing homes to accept patients (who lived there) even if they were positive it stable. It was a safeguard measure to get people out of hospitals if they were stable. An audit confirmed some 6,300 people were transferred before another EO was issued that patients needed to have a negative screen before being transferred. </p>
<p>When the virus hit the US, it hit New York first and nearly collapsed their medical system with how quickly it overwhelmed it. I would expect one of the most densely populated states to be smear the top of any stat regarding infectious diseases so the point is really moot given what happened and when. </p>
<p>And the reason the poorest people had to keep working is because they had no (read zero) other financial means to support themselves. The federal government has bungled any form of assistance and focused on appointing a new judge over a covid relief bill before the election. In Canada anyone effected got an immediate $2k plus $2k per month for 6 months which helped immensely. Some Americans have received $1200, many have not.</p>

        <p>Cuomo had the entire Javits Center available. Have you ever been there? I have. It’s where the NYC Marathon distributes bibs to 50,000 runners, and where ComicCon is set up. It’s huge. Didn’t use it (I’m not even mentioning the SS Comfort since that was specifically for non-COVID patients).</p>
<p>I live here and I knew <em>at the time</em> how freaking disastrous this was. I remember thinking on my last day in the office (March 12th), I’m glad I didn’t have any relatives in a nursing home because I would’ve pulled them out then and there - we knew back then how dangerous that was.</p>
<p>Also there’s a reason that so many more poor New Yorkers that got the virus. Those were the folks delivering everyone’s groceries, working down in Staten Island at the Amazon Warehouse, the nurses, bus drivers, the grocery store clerks - literally society would collapse in a week or two if they stopped doing their jobs. The Work From Home crew surely wouldn’t have been able to chug along like it was nothing.</p>
<p>So to pretend like they could’ve gotten paid to stay home and YOUR life wouldn’t have been drastically affected is one of the most tone-deaf, classist and I don’t like using the word “privileged”, but this is example 1A of privileged right here.</p>

        <p>I mean, no I’ve never been to New York I am Canadian after all. But in Canada, grocery chains paid their employees extra and only essential workers were allowed out in the beginning. Including most trades, grocery clerks and delivery people. Ironically, they were less effected by covid than the elderly.  All those not deemed essential worked from home did so and those who were laid off got paid to stay afloat. </p>

        <p>Yes, of course, they are expecting to roll out 40 million doses before the end of the year. This ties back into Cuomo’s original point that the method in which the current administration wants to go about distribution of the vaccine is inherently flawed and skewed against people who need it based on poor access to healthcare. The slow down is to better insure fair access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>It’s not that anyone wants to stop the vaccine from being available it’s to whom it’s available to first that is the issue. Something like 50% of Americans have limited access to health services like pharmacies or medical centres. The current plan focuses on rolling out the vaccine to people who do have access first stranding those without to wait months to get their shot. This matters because if you don’t have healthcare access and you get sick, you need to travel however far and have family stay near to see you.</p>

        <p>I distrust what he said because he is a corrupt politician. I'm asking if you're a paid shill because you're pushing political talking points with nothing to back them up other than what a corrupt politician said. So you are either getting paid or you like the taste of his ass.</p>

        <p>Trusting politicians, especially politicians with an OBVIOUS lust for power like Cuomo is not a good thing. It will not make your life easier as Cuomo legitimately would make it as miserable as possible as long as he gets to rule it like a dictator.</p>

        <p>Im sorry but why do some people need a vaccine more than others based on income? Is everyone not inherently at the same risk for contracting a disease? There arent shortages on soap. </p>

<p>Also its really cute how concerned you think Cuomo is about poor people. Bless your heart.</p>

        <p>That's what he said, but it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>If the poor people got left out, the Biden administration could still sponsor some kind of free public vaccination program three months from now, and they'd have a head start compared to no vaccine program now since there would be fewer people remaining who want it.</p>

        <p>He literally said he'd intentionally slow the process and try to block it. There is no way to interpret that except for powerlust. If he wanted to get the vaccine to vulnerable people, he'd implement a program to do so. And yeah-they could undo Trump's plan when Biden takes over if it was hypothetically so slow that it would be easier for Biden to just find a better way to distribute it (which I don't believe given the fact that he seems to think this is entirely a private sector thing which is not the case). Cuomo slowing it down does not help. No. He just wants power by continuing his police state policies.</p>

        <p>If you listened to what he’d said, you might see it as something other than power and control. But you didn’t. You heard him say they’d slow it down or stop it but you heard power grab. The fact is, the trump administration has fucked up the entire response to covid and they could potentially do more damage this way. The trump administration is now a lame duck and they should not be responsible in handling anything else towards covid or any governance for that matter. He should accept defeat, aid in the transfer of power and go away</p>

        <p>I listened to what he said. That doesn't mean I have to take it at face value. Orange man bad is not a valid excuse to sabotage a vaccination program. His own logic makes no sense whatsoever. I swear this puritanical hatred of anything Trump is so fucking tired. He's not Satan-he's at worst another corrupt politician-but that's no excuse to sabotage a vaccination program in progress to spite him. Cuomo's comments-are completely unacceptable and potentially criminal.</p>
