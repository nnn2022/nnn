    <strong>Being allowed to post here helps keep my sanity in check</strong>
    <p><p>I really don't understand why people would want a world where you can be silenced. If something is going on in the world that is troubling you then you should be allowed to express that. With this group I feel I have been able to fully express myself and it's been a blessing. In an era where people want you to get Covid tested whenever you cough, have a fever, etc. wear a mask wherever you go, blindly accept that the vaccines won't harm anyone, that you're doing a patriotic duty to wear a mask and stay away from people.</p>
<p>We never lived like we have had to when the pandemic was at it's peak. Getting verbally or even physically abused just for not wanting to wear a mask? Getting verbally or physically abused for questioning if masks or vaccines are effective or safe. Getting mentally abused by the government and people around you who were to afraid to come see how you were doing.  I mean what kind of life is that? We are living in a society where everyone wants to be your mom. IF YOU DONT DO THIS YOU ARE GROUNDED. IF YOU DONT DO THIS NO ENTRY! IF YOU DONT DO THIS NO JOB! Is that really the life these people want? Anyways I just appreciate this sub reddit so much. Being able to post here every day just helps take a huge load off whenever society starts to fuck with my head.</p>
<p>So I thank you all of  you. Not only for this group being here, but for each of you that has been so supportive over others that are going through a tough time with Covid restrictions &amp; lockdowns that we are just so sick of it all. Being able to come here and voice how much all of this Covid stuff can be upsetting or harmful to our mental health has been a huge blessing. People don't understand the huge benefits this sub reddit and that's sad.</p></p>

        <p>Your mom analogy was great!</p>
<p>But I'll add - everyone acts like a personality disordered mother, doling out rules and punishments with a healthy side of gaslighting. </p>
<p>Most moms actually love their children and want the best for them. These people do not.</p>

        <p>The brigadier are coming...they are being sent to silence &amp; ridicule (they dont really know why)...next will be to physically harm.  That step is scary.  I'm hoping it stops before we get there, but I think in some places it's already there.</p>

        <p>At the moment, I think it makes the normies feel safer to be part of a big herd. But it's not going to stay that way, when they realise that what they've essentially supported and helped to build is an information totalitarian society where your opinions are relentlessly surveiiled and your friends encouraged to snitch on you if you express the wrong ones.</p>
<p>Even minor deviations from the dominant narratives can get your reported to the thought-police, cancelled, censored and banished, online and off. That's a scary, paranoid tightrope to balance on.  And what's going to make it scarier is when people realise that what was considered right-think last week could be wrong-think by the week after. All the virue-signalling that got you likes at one point of time could easily make you the target of shaming or cancelling or censorship or bans at another point.</p>
<p>People are going to eventually understand this, but by then it could be too late to dial it back.</p>

        <p>This situation has nearly driven me to suicide (thanks cops for getting me to Psych Urgent Care!). I survived partly because of this Lockdown Skeptics and the British lockdownskeptics.org. I've known from March lockdowns would cost more lives than Covid-19, this totalitarian nightmare was fully preventable. Thanks for your post!</p>
