        <p>It’s not meant to be a database of fact, it’s just a repository for reports.  Nothing entered is reviewed or checked in anyway. Unreliable as a definitive source of information but entertaining to watch people try to use it that way.</p>

        <p>There was an update today. In the raw data (where symptoms are typed out in full by the person submitting the report), I see two entries that mention "hulk". One was that it felt like Hulk was squeezing his neck and the other is his arm felt like Hulk punched it. In the streamlined data (where symptoms are put into classes),  there's no mention of "hulk".</p>
