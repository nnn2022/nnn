    <strong>Newcomer</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I'm new here and I just wanted to tell you my story. So, I have been through one of the longest lockdowns in the world. At first, I was completely on board, and faithfully wearing my mask etc. I figured if I followed the rules, I wouldn't get sick. Of course life likes to make things difficult, and I got covid. It was sucky. Luckily, I got through OK and life goes on. I figured now that I had natural immunity, I wouldn't have to get the shot. I was wrong apparently? I'm told I still need it which makes no sense to me? Am I in the wrong here? Things are getting super scary, and I'm hearing a lot of really nasty talk about the unvaxxed. This terrifies me. Why are people saying such crazy things? Like they want to forcibly inject people? Huh? Am I eating crazy pills?</p></p>

        <p>No you don't need the covax especially if you've had the virus already as you have natural immunity. The public are being led like a donkey with a carrot on a stick by a bunch of clowns.</p>

<p>You're not eating crazy pills, OP.</p>
<p>You're starting to ask some very sane, basic questions, and you have been gaslit for the better part of a year and a half into thinking anyone would be crazy for even thinking like you are now.</p>

        <p>yes, all it is pretty stupid. As a baby I suffered from measles. Back in my time and country, babies were not vaccinated against measles. You had it and got on with life. Since them, I was never pushed into taking a jab for measles. Why things have to be different now?</p>

        <p>There are a lot of extreme views on this r/ so I think the main thing is to recognise that being scared is okay. It is scary. Both for vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The future is so uncertain and with all countries' contributions being heavily covered in the media, it can feel like a whirlwind of chaos. If you're not sure (and the fact you're on this thread), that tells you enough to wait. Make the right decision for yourself. Again, if you're not sure, don't push your ideas on others and, equally, don't allow others to push their ideas onto you. Research where you can, but also recognise where things have been censored or taken down. The more you hang around, the more you will see information being suppressed. Look at the type of information being taken down, some of it is actual government data being used in ways they don't like. That should tell you enough, too. Peace.</p>
