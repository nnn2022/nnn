        <p>It’s easy to make it sound silly but we’re actually coming up on 100 September 11th attacks. We’re at the equivalent of at least one a day now going forward. Are you all just this bad at math? You’re right on with an estimated 38000 traffic deaths. There are over 220 MILLION drivers in the United States. You all think that an “over 99% survival rate” sounds like it backs your argument but it makes you seem even less competent, and no one can engage with that. I think that honesty, the number of deaths from the virus just goes over your heads. I have one aunt who thinks the virus is a hoax, and when confronted she really had no conception of how many people 280,000 is. Get your heads out of the sand please, calling everyone sheep in the face of such brutal and obvious facts? Good to know that in an actual worldwide crisis I can trust my dumbest neighbors to completely ignore it.</p>

<p>Ok. I think that 280,000 is less than 0.1% of our country's population. I also think that in a given year around 10 times that number will die of any cause. Is my conception of that number accurate?</p>

        <p>So your solution is what then? Well people are dying I could do this basic thing to help my fellow countrymen from dying but I don’t think I will because it’s uncomfortable. To go back to the driving example yes death from automobile accidents still occur but they are much lower than if we had no seat belts, and no laws enforcing speed limits and people driving under the influence. People are dying whether you believe the numbers are that high or not but the fact is that families now have loved ones who they won’t see for the holidays because we as a country couldn’t hunker down and wear masks. Would people still have died yes but would it be fewer deaths also yes.</p>

        <p>Yes, there’s MEDICAL evidence. OVERWHELMING - SCIENTIFIC - MEDICAL EVIDENCE. Does it make someone a doomer to point out the obvious? “Simple” measures could be a total fix if we could trust that every American would participate. They didn’t work because, and this is fucking key, America has a serious problem with people confusing the responsibilities of “individual Liberty” with immediate personal gratification at the expense of everyone around you. Everyone on subs like this needs to cling to the small population of people dumb enough to agree with them and it’s not helping anyone. It’s really too easy to look at the demographic fault line in America and see that you either need to be too stupid to know better, or too much of an asshole to come to terms with the fact that your actions affect others.</p>

        <p>Show me the population level evidence with a control group and experimental group that concludes masks, as an isolated variable, completely stopped the spread of a virus. </p>

        <p>There’s no such study, and like your use of the phrase “isolated variable” it further demonstrates your lack of understanding. Population level studies need to account for human error, like all medical studies. The article you provided is information that everyone already has. No one thinks masks keep people from inhaling the virus. That’s never once been argued. They are incredibly effective in preventing the SPREAD of the virus. There is nothing in the world of scientific evidence that wouldn’t support the control of respiratory pathogens with cloth masks. It’s common sense unless you have the brain of a fucking Turkey sandwich</p>

        <p>&rt; More recently, Dr. R. MacIntyre, a prolific investigator of face masks, has forcefully stated that the historical reliance on theoretical assumptions for recommending PPEs should be replaced by rigorously acquired clinical data. 5 She noted that most studies on face masks have been based on laboratory simulated tests which quite simply have limited clinical applicability as they cannot account for such human factors as compliance, coughing and talking.</p>
<p>(This was in 2016, super recent by scientific standards, not outdated.)</p>
<p>It sounds like this review is calling into question the effectiveness of masks in not only inhaling but <em>exhaling</em> as well. </p>
<p>Look I’m not saying masks aren’t better than nothing, or that they’re useless. Im saying 1. That I’m not convinced of their efficacy for controlling the spread on a population level, 2. The government should not be issuing sweeping mandates that limit the freedom of healthy individuals that are C19 free, and 3. I’m saying I’m skeptical of the religious zealotry they’ve been assigned by people like you. You treat them like they’re Jesus Christ himself, and answer to all your problems. They’re not. And we’re seeing that even with increased mask compliance in the population, cases are still rising, more than ever. If masks were “the magic bullet” you claim, and compliance went from 60 to 90%, for instance, we might expect 30% fewer respiratory particles exhaled into the air, and we should see at least SOME decrease in cases as a result, not necessarily 30%, but at least SOME. But alas, we are not seeing that.</p>

        <p>I actually can’t believe people as dumb as yourself exist but there you are typing somewhere. It blows my mind. You need your tiny echo chamber, and in your safe space I’m the troll. In real life hopefully you’re all too embarrassed to share these views. Within one year it’s skyrocketed to one of the leading causes of death in our country, and it’s mind numbing to see the small collective of speed limit IQs gathering, jerking off to some of the most cherry picked mental gymnastics inducing “research”. Why don’t you guys go find someone with a PhD to agree with you, do a full panel of research in support of your claims and then have it peer reviewed. That’s never going to fucking happen and in the meantime there are thousands of pages of peer reviewed articles that have been the basis for the response to the pandemic. I think it’s funny and sad that I must be a sheep, all of you are such brave strong individuals unable to be swayed by the liberal media. That is a line being fed to you. Rugged individualism isn’t real, it’s a fake line we let ourselves cross in order to be selfish without consequences. It’s counter intuitive to living in a society or even a functioning family. I honestly hope everyone here is able to hold it together, because so far it looks like a small rectangle of fabric is really causing you all to struggle mentally</p>

        <p>Remember that the earth being flat, the sun rotating around the earth, slavery, and rampant anti-Semitism have all been overwhelmingly popular with public opinion at times in history. Will you be on the wrong side of this one too? Lol. Hell even honor killings of women who show their faces in public is overwhelmingly popular in some middle eastern cultures TO THIS DAY...</p>

        <p>Ironically, you’re forced to align yourself with literal conspiracy theorists just to have peers to agree with. Many of these people CURRENTLY believe the earth is flat, and that satanic pedophiles are making them wear masks at Disney world. Contriving conspiracy theories has been linked with diminished cognitive function again and again. Chaos exists and is supposed to be a part of life but humans are supposed to be smart. Smart enough to listen to those smarter than us, but that apparently is too hard for people who think they already know everything, and since they have an opinion how dare anyone else Point it that it’s fucking stupid and contrary to what makes sense</p>

<p>How the hell can you prove that? I’ve already told you first world nations in North America and Europe have increased their mask compliance over the last two months and have simultaneously had exploding case numbers. How can you explain that if masks are your savior? Have a little intelectual humility for once in your life. </p>

        <p>Prior to the advent of Covid-19, theses were the guidelines for pandemic management, authored by D.A. Henderson, who eradicated smallpox:</p>
<p>http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2006/2006-09-15-diseasemitigationcontrolpandemicflu.html</p>
<p>The article documents how several prior pandemics, including smallpox, were successfully managed. </p>
<p>These are authors who <em>successfully</em> managed pandemics. Any peer-reviewed research about the response to this pandemic can only be considered flawed unless one considers anything about the response to Covid as having been successful. </p>
<p>Arguing about a single NPI like masks is a waste of time.  Believe whatever you want to believe.  Insults and attacks do not advance a situation at all.</p>

        <p>I’m Canadian. Mask mandates have been heavily enforced; yet the case numbers continue to rise (which is how they justify these insane mandates). There is no basis in reality for the gov’t reaction; it is simply virtue signaling for the pro maskers, and a test of how compliant the population will be for the banana republic we call our leadership</p>

<p>Sure, if we just ignore all of the places where the interventions didn't work, and then focus on places where they seem to heave worked then we can conclude that they really worked!</p>

        <p>I mean, you seem to be joking, but there are places that have started to tax unhealthy foods and beverages in an attempt to curb the obesity problem that is plaguing many western countries now. Hell, most fast food places have been required to prominently display the nutritional information of their foods so people can "make better choices" when eating out. So that's really not that far fetched of a idea.</p>

        <p>I know but they do it all the time. Remember clove cigarettes? Banned because the only flavors allowed are menthol and tobacco. They sell clove "little cigars" instead now. I used to buy djarum clove cigarettes, now they are banned. And I quit smoking but yeah, still banned.</p>

        <p>With that logic why not get rid of seat belt and speed limits together? The I feel like the seat constricts my chest so I can’t breathe and I feel that it is my right as an American to drive whatever speed I want when I want. Look if you are scared of getting hit by my car then stay home but I for one am gonna finish this 18 pack of bud light lime and go 60 through a school zone to protest these “safe” driving laws</p>

        <p>Seat belts should be a choice in your own car. Absolutely. </p>
<p>With Speed limits, at least they regulate behavior based on a known and determinable correlation: the faster you’re going, the greater the danger to others. </p>
<p>Mask mandates DO NOT do this. They regulate EVERYONE’s behavior, healthy or not, based on a random guess as to who has C19 and who doesn’t. The only way you should be able to make mask laws is if you KNOW the person you’re forcing to wear one has COVID and is dangerous. Otherwise you’re making them guilty until proven innocent.</p>

        <p>Difference is that wearing a mask and washing your hands doesn’t stop you from going about your day. And COVID kills almost as many every day in the US alone as car accidents in the entire world. Two reasons why this is flawed logic.</p>

Driving 10mph doesn’t stop you from going about your day either, you just have to plan ahead because you might get to your destination a little slower, but it’s worth it to save lives right?

        <p>Wearing a mask is a slight inconvenience. I’m looking forward not having to wear one anymore as well but comparing it to multiplying any commute time by 4 at the very least is ridiculous. Not to mention that you wouldn’t even have to drop the speed that much to achieve the desired effect. It’s just a deeply flawed comparison and a logical fallacy (false equivalence if you want too look it up). And if you can’t make you point without resorting to logical fallacies you just don’t have a rational foot to stand on. So either admit that this has nothing to do with rationality and you just feel like being an entitled self centred five year old or  shut up 🤫 But you won’t of course because as long as you stay within your little echo chambers you don’t need to make sense to be validated by other entitled crybabies. So congrats, you’re so much better than everyone else for your fight against common decency. Keep it up and have an award!</p>

        <p>It’s not a false equivalence at all. It’s your very same logic. You’re not giving me a death number that would justify taking away freedoms. </p>
<p>And of course I can make my point in other ways. Forcing healthy people to wear masks, when they present no danger, is morally wrong. Playing a guessing game as to who has C19 is a terrible way to regulate behavior. </p>
<p>It’s funny you think increasing commute time isn’t acceptable to save lives, but hampering healthy people’s ability to breath and locking down businesses and ruining livelihoods ARE acceptable to save lives. Where’s your line?</p>
<p>YOU are the indecent one by taking people’s freedoms by guessing based on your fear.</p>

        <p>You’re getting it! I’m sure you know the 14th amendment doesn’t actually say men can get married to each other.  It doesn’t say “men can marry other men.” The right of homosexual marriage was extrapolated from the equal protection clause of the 14th in Obergefell v Hodges. </p>
<p>You now understand my point, then, that not all of our freedoms are expressly stated in the constitution? Many are extrapolated from the framework that is our constitution. Including the freedom to cover my face with whatever the hell I want, or don’t want, as my guaranteed freedom expression. If at all, the state is the only level that can mandate mask wearing constitutionally, and At least one state court (Michigan) has already ruled against the use of Whitmer’s unconstitutional emergency powers, reversing her mask mandate. Wisconsin is doing the same. You’ll find that most states allow, at best, only a short period of emergency powers, not indefinite mask mandates like we’re seeing. Our default freedom is clearly to choose how we cover our face.</p>

        <p>You don’t have a guaranteed freedom of expression. And states can create laws for anything that is not already protected in the constitution or the bill of rights and other amendments. </p>
<p>There is nothing that guarantees that you will not be asked to cover your face, especially in a state of emergency. And this is indefinite? It hasn’t even been 9 months dude. Get a fucking grip; you wouldn’t know what indefinite meant if it hit you in the tooth. </p>

        <p>Well the guarantee of expression in this case really depends on the state constitution that you’re living in, since I said states are the only level that can mandate this. The US constitution indeed DOES prohibit mask mandates as it leaves public health policy to the states. Biden has repeatedly admitted this already, which is why he’s not doing a federal mandate as part of his plan. </p>
<p>And of course states can create laws, but I guess you don’t know that’s NOT what has happened with mask <em>mandates</em>. There is a huge difference between unilateral executive mandate and the passage of <em>law</em> through state congressional process. Whether those mask <em>laws,</em> if properly introduced into the legislature, would stand against the state constitution would be decided by the courts. </p>
<p>Yes, many unilateral mandates have been indefinite so far, as they don’t provide a timeline for ending. I don’t think YOU know what indefinite means. It doesn’t mean LONG, it means an undefined period of time.</p>

        <p>I care about laws as much as you do. We both accept just laws and would reject unjust laws, and we both break laws that aren’t enforced heavily(you’re telling me you don’t speed or cross lanes when turning ever? Lol). </p>
<p>Many of us just happen to see forcing healthy, non-infected people to wear something over their face in public as an unjust law, which forms part of the basis of our disobedience.</p>

        <p>Nobody likes the government telling them what to do. To quote our president elect: “come on, man!” You know people just wanna be left to their business, by and large. </p>
<p>For us libertarians, the government should only legislate to the bare minimum in order to protect the right of people not to be directly aggressed against, and their right to private property ownership. Forcing healthy people to wear masks doesn’t fall under that umbrella.</p>
