        <p>There actually is evidence the virus spreads most effectively indoors with <em>prolonged</em> close contact. Very typical virus. However, that doesn't justify this. The response to this virus isn't at all justified. Don't go to work or to get your hair done if you're sick. Common sense. </p>

        <p>Apparently people don't realise that yes, respiratory viruses including this one spread most effectively indoors with prolonged close contact. That doesn't mean services should be forced outside, hairdressers should simply not come to work when sick and customers delay appointments if sick. Hairdressers where I am never closed.</p>

        <p>They are <strong><em>not</em></strong> major spreaders of the virus at all - making it a typical respiratory virus. As for the rest, people not recognising respiratory symptoms because of allergies, that's the reality with any virus including the flu. That's life. This virus is here to stay in the world.

        <p>The conclusions of that study are poor and make plenty of assumptions based on limited evidence. This virus behaves very typically, and asymptomatic spread is not a major mode of transmission for this virus and is very rare. Says other larger studies and also backed by studies on similar viruses, and this one is very typical.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree on Asymptomatic being rare, especially individual to individual. A group of asymptomatics may pose more an issue. </p>
<p>Pre-symptomatic is the one I think is most dangerous based on the studies out there. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is people are contagious before they know they are sick. We can't rely on people to be able to consciously mitigate their own spread. By the time they know, it's too late. The correct course of action, especially in the US, is just assume everyone is potentially contagious.</p>

        <p>For respiratory viruses, pre-symptomatic spread is also rare according to the majority of evidence and appears to be the case with this virus that acts very typically. It is theoretically possible but most likely to occur within households with close contacts if at all. Not much has demonstrated the theory. It's also not dangerous - because this virus largely isn't dangerous and again, it's not a major mode of transmission so doesn't justify making people afraid of their healthy bodies being killers. It's simply not these individuals who play an important role in transmission.</p>
<p>Viruses are successful - as this one is - if they cause minor to moderate symptoms in their host because this enables the most successful transmission. If you disable your host by rendering them severely unwell, there's limited opportunity to spread because the host then has limited movement and contact with other hosts so the chain ends there - despite such severe symptoms equaling greater viral shedding. If you cause no symptoms which is mostly a product of your host's immune system resisting (also those testing positive via the RT-PCR test without symptoms doesn't even mean they're even infected or that intact/live virus is present) transmission practically dies out as this isn't shown by evidence to be an effective or important mode of transmission. Those are both self limiting and not an advantage to the virus. If you cause mild to moderate symptoms that do not disable your host then you increase the chances of transmission because this means significant viral shedding <em>and</em> your host has more contact with other hosts since their mobility remains greater. (Btw this doesn't apply to say sexually transmitted viruses - they have different evolutionary characteristics that make them successful)</p>
<p>Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals simply don't justify not allowing indoor hairdressing and other services. Even if it were a major mode of transmission, advising those at risk or living with those at risk to assess the risks when choosing to undertake these activities is adequate. Those at risk were at risk before this and would be now if this virus had not happened. I have loved ones at risk of viral infections, they assess the risks they're willing to undertake as do those who live with them.</p>
<p>Our hairdressers remained open the entire time, while we had plenty of cases. Not a single case was attributed to a hairdresser here. It's not sustainable to continue this way, and people shouldn't be fearing their own healthy bodies.</p>
