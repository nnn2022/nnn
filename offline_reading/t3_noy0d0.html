    <strong>Somethings will never be the same for me</strong>
    <p><p>I never took this shit seriously. It was always a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and I foolishly assumed everyone would think the same. Sadly as the year went on I watched everyone I know slowly lose their god damn minds. </p>
<p>I started feeling truly alone for the first time in my life. Seeing how fragile my closest friends and family were has had a lasting impact on me. I‚Äôve lost so much respect for almost everyone I know. </p>
<p>and now the people who acted hysterical, shamelessly point fingers at the ones who didn‚Äôt.  </p>
<p>Anyways glad I found this sub it‚Äôs been comforting.</p></p>

        <p>Same, I will never hate those who are blind. Hate is poison. We can only try to educate and help them see the truth. Many are young and don‚Äôt remember the evils of big pharma and governments through the years. I pray they don‚Äôt find out the hard way‚Ä¶.</p>

        <p>Isn't that in reality the separation between good and evil?</p>
<p>Good still prays for their enemies at the end of the day. </p>

        <p>I know how you feel and I dont think I will ever feel the same way about people again. It has been so blindingly obvious from at least April 2020 and arguably before that and yet people have meekly swallowed the propaganda. It's very sad.</p>

        <p>100%.  There are people who I thought the world of who I will never look at in the same way again.  It‚Äôd take a huge 180 and for them to have to self reflect and admit to acting like complete cowards.  Few people have the humility.</p>

Dumb luck and opportunity, I literally found the woman of my life thanks to this pandemic, so if it were up to me, I wouldn't change a thing, people want to panic, lose their job, their economy?

        <p>You are not alone. I feel that way too! So many of our family and friends have done the same, some were the organic granola loving, yoga practicing natural type folks. Very fragile minds those folks had for sure, no strength in their convictions. They all went running to be part of the experiment. As for me and my family, we are choosing to be part of the control group. Stay strong and know you are not alone.</p>

        <p>I was in a different boat than you on that one, but with almost the same results.</p>
<p>I would say that the reason why most people have the same opinion about things is because of that "wanting to conform" way of thinking.</p>
<p>I've never tried to conform (which makes me a "rebel"), and I'm pretty much used to getting criticized and treated poorly because of it, just so that when I have better outcomes people do a full 180, and now they try to seem like they "always believed in you".</p>
<p>This time I see it as the same, the whole thing is completely insane and stupid, there is no way in the future this will age well. The sad and frustrating part is that unlike those other bs things I've "rebelled" against, this is pretty mayor, with horrible consequences.</p>
<p>I would say, never do things because others are happy about it, do it because you are happy with yourself.</p>

        <p>This is my situation also. Friends I saw twice a week without masks seemed mostly sensible about it and seemed to have calmed down. THe day after a gathering, one of them said his grandson who he had cared for tested positive. He had gotten and recovered from the C word and had both vaccine shots, but he was told he should quarantine for two weeks because it had been 3 months since he had the C word but hadn‚Äôt quite been two weeks since his 2nd vaccine shot.</p>
<p>Everyone panicked. One guy seemed angry as he listed off all the measures he then needed to take including getting his whole family tested and possibly keeping them all out of work for two weeks. He was very worried about older in-laws that he cares for.</p>
<p>I told them how i felt‚Äîthat they were drastically overreacting considering that he had recovered from the C word and been vaccinated. I told them I was abstaining from our gatherings because I was not exercising the caution they were because I just wasn‚Äôt that afraid and that it was good for my own mental health to be around that kind of fearful energy.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been depressing to find how vulnerable some people close to me are to all this propaganda and fear mongering.</p>

        <p>I have the exact same concerns.</p>
<p>I completely fell off the social grid. Firstly, I was skeptical about the whole mess. Secondly, the reaction of my friends - people who i formerly would have trusted with my moral compass were okay with the harms caused by lockdown, just so that they could "feel safe". I feel like i can't trust people anymore. I feel like I'll have to make entirely new friends. This is a problem for me, as I don't socialise very well. 
I just couldn't understand how my friends - who do socialise well, couldn't see what was being done to them by the government, and how bad the rules and regulations are. They would talk about the contradictions put out by the government via the mainstream media in doublespeak.
I knew it was only a matter of time before I'd snap and be labeled a granny killer/conspiracy theorists simply for questioning the narrative.i have a few sources of content creators who have become like a lifeline over this time. Other than that, I don't know how to find a freedom cell, and don't know how to trust them. 
It's totally messed up.</p>

<p>There are things going on we will never understand, but we can control how it affects US. That's all you've got. </p>
<p>Maybe it's time to pull away from society, or change jobs, or maybe something as simple as meeting a new friend. It doesn't have to be life-changing and drastic, but its time to move on with your life and understand you can't fix it, you can't change it, and accept it.</p>
<p>You are loved. Never forget that simple fact. You are loved.</p>

        <p>I made this critical error myself. I just assumed everyone I knew, friends, family, co-workers etc. would see right through the bullshit. Not even close. I‚Äôve stopped talking to 99% of my friends, their own choosing not mine. More than two thirds of my family members, again, them not me. I used to say, ‚ÄúI thought they were brighter than that‚Äù. Now I just default to everyone I know is a doomer. Just easier.</p>

        <p>This is exactly how I feel. I‚Äôm just so mentally destroyed. I don‚Äôt know how to have hope for humanity anymore, this has really beaten me down. And I try so hard to not feel this way because I really do not want to, but everywhere I turn I‚Äôm reminded that this dystopia is real. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever snap out of it because I‚Äôm forced to be a part of society and being a member of it the way it is is one of the most depressing things I‚Äôve ever experienced.</p>
