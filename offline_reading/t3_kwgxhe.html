    <strong>What do you guys think about face shields?</strong>
    <p><p>My school will finally be in person for the majority of the week in second semester. Problem is? You have to wear a mask. I can’t wear masks anymore. Especially for 7 hours 4-5 days a week. I get horrible headaches. I was looking into face shields since I saw a few people wear them at the school without masks (I’m doing hybrid at the moment, which is 2 days a week in person). My question are Face shields worth it? Do people accept it as if you were wearing a normal mask? I honestly don’t want to wear a face covering but my school is forcing us to if we want in-person education.</p></p>

        <p>I’ll take your advice. My state is red (We have a RINO Bloomberg-sellout governor so we unfortunately have to deal with restrictions) so I might get away maskless. The problem is that I live in a blue county and my school is definitely pro-mask. The people in my Journalism class are brainwashed by the MSM and I wouldn’t be surprised if I get harassed if I don’t wear a traditional face covering. I’m praying that I’ll get away with just a shield.</p>

        <p>I live in Ohio but in a county with a big city (Aka one of the worst counties). I heard that people who live in the cornfields don’t give a crap about our governor and his restrictions. It’s just the counties with the big cities. Hopefully Whitmer will get out of office soon.</p>

        <p>Who knows at this point. I know some people get mad at the fact that people aren’t wearing TWO masks! </p>
<p>There’s a lady at a local store who wears a face shield, plus a mask just covering her mouth and chin. No one says anything. It’s silly, but you could likely get away with it.</p>

        <p>Just don't wear anything. Stand up for yourself and don't let others make you feel bad. I haven't worn anything since the beginning and I work with the public. Most people are fine, a few act scared to come near me and one person threatened me. Just treat people with respect, don't get angry or emotional and people will realize how ridiculous they are.</p>

        <p>Just bring up that 98% of the country is wearing masks, yet the cases keep going up. Also, inform her that nobody is actually testing positive for Covid. Unless a culture was taken, isolated and tested for live virus material, it isn't a positive Covid test. They tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. Big difference.</p>

        <p>I tried to, but her response was to “just follow the rules this will end soon” and to “stop believing everything you see on the internet” (Yeah, I know, super ironic for her to say that). I don’t know if there’s anymore hope for her. But thank you for suggesting for me to stand up for myself. I would if my mother didn’t threaten to force me to do full remote if I don’t wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I think that’s what my dad uses. I’ll rather use a shield since my entire face would be visual which will make me feel less dehumanized. It’ll definitely be a plan B though if they’re easier to breath in.</p>

        <p>It’s going to depend completely on your school...If you are allowed to do a face shield sure why not? At my kids’ school face shields (alone) are absolutely not allowed. If you can’t wear a mask then you have to stay home. Gaiters are allowed for elementary and middle school but not high school (no clue why). I’d look up the rules on your school’s website- they are usually pretty detailed.</p>

        <p>Ideally, you would wear nothing and make a stand. </p>
<p>But listen, I get why you can't. </p>
<p>I would mock the situation as hard as possible. My son wears a massive face shield to school. In fact it has started a contest to see who can find the biggest face shield amongst his friends. They all know it's a joke. The thing is like 3 times the size of his face. It's hilarious. </p>
<p>Find a gaiter you can see through, pull it up over your entire face and when someone asks if you can see, say "I can see just fine do you feel safe yet?"</p>
<p>Wear a Darth Vader helmet. </p>
<p>Fuck em.</p>

        <p>We were told to wear a mask AND a face shield at work, in the beginning. The shield was giving us all headaches and the only way to stop the headache was to push the shield way up on our head, exposing our mouths. I did see a visor hat face shield that looked way more comfortable, but they stopped forcing the shields thankfully. Still have to wear masks when moving about. If you found a huge shield that went all the way down and around, I don't think anyone could say anything. This whole situation is fucking madness🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
