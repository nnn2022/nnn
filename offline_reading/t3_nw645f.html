    <strong>How many of us would take a safe vaxx? I know I would...this shit isn't safe.</strong>
    <p><p>I have another person I know who got the vaxx, and SOME PEOPLE are getting sick with severe delayed reactions. When I see formerly healthy young people getting seizures or autoimmune disorders they never had before even just 6 weeks after this vaccination, something is going on, and we know the idiots aren't tracking these patterns just brushing it all off as correlation doesn't mean causation. </p>
<p>This vaxx is not safe. All you have to do is search a little online to find endless horror stories and many of us PERSONALLY know people whose health is dive bombing. They know all this isolation has kept the "word of the street" suppressed but I find myself wondering why this crap is still going on and why people aren't getting pissed just from the numbers of people getting sick. When I see harm coming to healthy young people I am even just acquaintances with or know in a group, I am PISSED OFF. They never deserved that to happen to them. Maybe I care too much and am not a closed down narcissists or cold scientist sociopath which too many of this society seems to be becoming.</p>
<p>I also refuse the vaxx based on spiritual reasons. They couldn't have come up with something more monsterous if they tried.</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™d had all my vaccinations. Iâ€™ve even gotten the flu shot. The amount of coercion surrounding the covid vaccine has me questioning whether Iâ€™d ever want to be vaccinated again. The lengths theyâ€™ve gone to are beyond creepy for a virus that just isnâ€™t that dangerous.</p>

        <p>good question. I think we can trust the old ones that are decades old but you think I am ever going to take a flu shot again? Hell no. I only took that being at risk. I also worry about later changes in the formulas though the old ones are probably okay now.</p>

        <p>I don't take the flu shot either, but not because I think it's not safe. I am not at risk. It might be easier to talk me into taking a safe vaccine, but they wouldn't need to push so hard if a) the vaccine were safe and/or b) the virus actually presented a danger to healthy people.</p>

        <p>One thing here the book the "Gift of Fear" tells people when they have strong intuitive fear they need to listen and well we have it with these false vaxx. I know I had MMR, TB and even one flu shot. I didn't worry about dying of blood clots or being incapacitated. They are basically telling people now, yes it is a lab leak so even in mainstream news, and I remember the news about HIV too, hmm they had to be splicing HIV and Coronas, and now they expect us to still trust the vaxx? Why? I read that article by Moderna about how mRNA failed for other disorders and they switched it to vaccines from 2017, even screenshot that article in case it's ever taken down, I though hell no. It's bad tech from start to finish.</p>
<p>Yeah they could have made millions off curing the common cold, I guess killing us all is more profitable. There's a lot of shit here that does not add up. I won't give blind trust. They are manipulating human emotions too, people so beaten down and sad over losing all joys in life, they'll do anything to end it with false hopes, including poisoning themselves. Yes it is tiring</p>
<p>Here is the Moderna 2017 article.

        <p>I agree with you. I get angry that this is being pushed on to the very naive and sheepish population, and people are being severely harmed. There is also no recourse. Nobody in the media will mention it. If you bring up concerns and adverse reactions to these vaccines in person, then you'll get strange looks and be called an anti vaxxer who just doesn't understand science (I have a masters in medical science lmfao). It's sad but I'm a compassionate individual who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. I hope I'm wrong and these vaccines end up being safe long-term, but just on the sheer number of illnesses that come to people after inoculation has me saying that these must be stopped and banned before more and more younger people and children become killed and harmed.</p>

        <p>I would, but only properly tested ones.
I've had my MMR, polio and tetanus jabs, but they have all undergone proper testing and approval. </p>
<p>The covid ones haven't yet and that's one of the thing stopping me. The other is that I don't take the flu jab because I'm not vulnerable, which is the second reason I won't take the covid one either it's just unnecessary.</p>
<p>Of course I would never seek to stop anyone taking any treatment that they want to, it's absolutely their own right to take, or not to take, anything they wish. I am jusr sick of that courtesy not being returned and constantly being pushed to have the jab and questioned on why I won't.</p>

        <p>No vaccine is 100% safe and there will always be risks.  Taking a vaccine for the measles is something completely different than one for Covid.</p>
<p>The Covid vaccine is not even a vaccine since it has no dead covid viruses in it.  It is an experimental drug.</p>
