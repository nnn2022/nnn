    <strong>How deep does the rabbit hole go?</strong>
    <p><p>Back in April, i thought for sure this would all be over by Summer. Surely by July 4th people would be over this by now, right?</p>
<p>Well I was wrong about that prediction. For context I'm in CA where we reopened briefly in June before shutting down again in July. Despite my rapidly declining mental health. I told myself to at least grin and bear it until November. Surely things would be different by then, and the election would change things? Maybe Covid would magically disappear by then?</p>
<p>Well that prediction was wrong as well. So once again I'm back to asking myself how much more of this i can take? Keep in mind my mental health ain't exactly on the upward trend.</p>
<p>My new plan is to prepare for a bleak, boring, depressing winter, then try to make it until late January where (presumably) Biden will be taking office and... Well who knows what's gonna happen by then. Could be good could be bad.</p>
<p>Beyond that, i really don't know how much more i can take. Maybe March 2021 would be my ultimate "I can't take this anymore" date, but who knows. I've already been wrong twice, hard to get optimistic anymore at this point.</p>
<p>How about everyone else? How much more of this can you take? And how deep does the rabbit hole go?</p></p>

        <p>The rabbit hole is pretty deep. It's gaslighting after gaslighting on the populace, and they keep eating it up.</p>
<p>This winter will be deadly because of our overreaction to a virus that we should have ignored. We will band together and open up, one way or another. Mother Nature has our backs in this grand adventure. Humans are significant but also not but also are.</p>
<p>Hold on tight, because it's going to be a bumpy ride. There is enlightened life at the end of this ride though. You'll see the world change over this next year like you won't believe, and it isn't going to be anywhere near like the megalomaniacs and their supporters envisage.</p>

        <p>The good news is I'm not suicidal (yet). I want to see how this movie ends. That's kind of what keeps me going. What is next year going to be like? Is it going to be great, or even shittier? I want to find out. I just wish i knew how long this movie was, cuz it's a lot longer than i expected.</p>

        <p>Come to rural Alabama. Things are pretty normal here. I've heard parts of rural CA are basically ignoring everything, too, but I haven't been there and can't say for sure. </p>
<p>It seems like there are places where people legitimately want this, and I can't imagine them changing their mind any time soon. With the reasoning they're using, we'll have to keep it up for the cold and flu, too, so you'd probably better start ignoring the silly rules and living your life.</p>

<p>I was done with this as soon as it started. Nobody get's to make rules like this over how I do day to day stuff. I've been looking around and trying to get people as angry as me since April. </p>
<p>Shit is going to go down if they haven't stopped this bullshit by spring. I'll do something on my own if I have to.</p>

        <p>I'm not leadership material, otherwise i would have loved to start some kind of movement. Instead, I've just been miserably waiting for someone to take a stance and lead the charge. Except... It just never seems to come. At least not here in America (and especially in CA).</p>
<p>It sounds pathetic, but i literally don't know what else i can do except vent on reddit and attempt to live as normal of a life as I'm able to at the moment.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve been suicidal for months. Life is not worth living in isolation. No idea how I am going to make it through the winter, let alone what comes after, considering this may go on for another year or longer. I have completely lost what little hope I had in humanity and the future of the world. The public shaming going on is absolutely  sickening.</p>

        <p>If we don't take care of ourselves, no one else will.  Therefore yes, our individual mental health is <em>very</em> important, pandemic or not.  Sacrificing for the alleged "greater good" is what got us in this mess in the first place, after all.</p>

        <p>Of course I'm aware of that. But people are handling it differently, some better than others. Some people are perfectly fine staying indoors doing nothing for an entire year. Others, like myself, are losing their goddamn minds. I don't see how this changes the context of my post at all.</p>
