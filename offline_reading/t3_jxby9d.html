    <strong>Were there similarities in Y2K panic and now?</strong>
    <p><p>During ytk I was young and not allowed to watch TV or anything so all I really remember is my moms reaction to y2k but I dont know how the media actually portrayed it. Does anyone think it was similar to now? If so, how?</p></p>

        <p>It was hyped by the media but not like the plandamic. Also a huge voting fuck up happened in the 2000 election which I find it odd how the two events are similar. And the following year 9/11 happened, it was a wild ride but this takes the crown.</p>

        <p>Yeah its odd. I was thinking that myself. Exactly 20 years since the last worldwide scare and election issues.</p>

        <p>This got me thinking about those years again and i remember an interesting story that happened to me in 05 I think. I was mowing a church and this random guy pulls up, he kind of looked like he was tweeking and flaged me down. So I go over to him and he pops his trunk which was filled with dvds, all the same documentary and he gives me one says I need to see it and rolls out.</p>
<p>I can't remember the name and no longer have it due to someone borrowing it and not returning it. It was about the big pharma. At the time the oil corporations were making boat loads of profits but this doc showed how big pharma was making what big oil did in one year quarterly.</p>
<p>It also explained that because of the way they dispose of unused drugs (by flushing them down the toliet). That there were traces of ever know prescription showing up in drinking water. Needless to say I quit drinking the city punch after that. Around that time is when the drug commercials started to hit every channel on tv.</p>
<p>At the time I didn't realize that we were in Afghanistan for the opiates but looking back it was a double win for baby bush.</p>

        <p>It’s kind of hard to compare because media was completely different. Yes it was a huge story but because people weren’t plugged into their phones and social media 24 hours a day, there just wasn’t the bombardment. You might hear about it on the news once a day or while you surfed a very slow internet but the media didn’t have the capabilities to push out doomer reports all day every day. As a result there was a small but not insignificant amount of people who went into full end-of-days mode but most people just crossed their fingers and figured the computer programmers would figure it out.</p>

        <p>Yeah smartphones are a huge problem with this.  I just wonder because I remember my mom panicking and saying the world was ending and stocking up on batteries and flashlights and canned goods etc. Kind of like people buy toilet paper and sanitizer  now</p>

        <p>Some people went kookoo bananas but they were rare. Most people in my life didn’t give af. My family didn’t do anything special. Times were so different then. If it happened tomorrow I’m sure everyone would be doomsday prepping. </p>
<p>This is far worse.</p>

        <p>Some people freaked out but nothing like the present situation. I may be biased because i was a teenager at the time, my dad worked in the computer business and knew it was mostly just hype, so it didn't affect my life at all really. They didn't force anyone to change their behaviors though, the doomers were doomers but those who weren't worried weren't forced into anything. It was mostly a normal year. </p>
<p>2001 was far more extreme with 9/11, but even the aftermath of 9/11 didn't have anywhere near as much effect on the vast majority of Americans' lives as the COVID panic has.</p>

        <p>I actually knew a guy in the military who knew without any doubt that no emergency vehicles or personal vehicles would run and that all computers across the world would shut down.  No one could talk sense into him. </p>
<p>When nothing happened, we all made fun of him. He didn't speak to anyone.</p>
