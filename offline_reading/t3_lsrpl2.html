    <strong>Nurses during the Pandemic...</strong>
    <p><p>Any Nurses out there, I believe you are good people, and not every Nurse does this, but here we go. </p>
<p>Lately, people have been talking about Nurse’s actual role within the Covid-19 “Pandemic” and often talk about Tiktoks and Among Us games while supposed to be treated patients. If these hospitals are so overcrowded, and the medical force is “overworked” then why is this laziness happening? In September, my Friend’s dad suffered a Heart Attack. They went to a local hospital and wished to visit him. They were willing to go one at a time, but they were not allowed due to “Protocols.” There was no protocol for this case as he was not a victim of Covid-19, and my friend claimed that the Nurses screamed “Random Colors, Names, and the word Suspicious a lot while in the Nurse offices.” I can only infer this is a classic game of “Among Us.” My friend asked the nurses 4 times to see his dying dad, as his chances decreased by the minute. Still, no. They had to authorize the visit, get him prepped, and sanitize before entering to see a patient. They were too busy playing their games to let a teen see his dying dad. His dad died around 11 o’clock that night, and the nurses are still working there as of today. The Tiktok deal, is noticeable everywhere. Go on there, and you’ll find a bunch of nurses doing them, instead of actually working. Sad.</p>
<p>What’s worse, is that Nurses aren’t as “short staffed.” They just won’t come into work. My Step father is a Nurse Head Manager at a hospital, and he’s gotten several calls a day from nurses just calling in sick. These Nurses have lives outside their jobs, right, but seriously people, everyday?</p></p>

        <p>I am so sorry for your friend who wasn't allowed to see his dad in his final hours of life. That is outrageous and very sad.</p>

        <p>Any good doctors and nurses with heads on their shoulders and hearts in their chests are in danger of being fired for standing up.</p>
<p>The medical profession is also just as corrupted by human moral failing as any other. Plenty of people go into it for selfish reasons like the desire for status and wealth without actually caring about performing their duties responsibly or morally.</p>
