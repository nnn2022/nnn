    <strong>BF fell in the shower and broke 2 ribs, ER tested him for covid because he was having trouble breathing. Clown Drs.</strong>
    <p><p>So a couple days ago my boyfriend slipped in the shower and broke two ribs. He gets to the ER, and the first thing they want to do is test him for covid. He asks why, and they say "because your breathing is labored". This was at one of the top hospitals in the country. This is the level of stupid happening. I just can't get my mind around any of it.</p></p>

        <p>Ugh that's so ridiculous. </p>
<p>My daughter has a lung disease and is in the Same hospital about once a year for a flare up - usually in the spring. Allergies compound her breathing issues. So last May when she had to go in, she was sitting in an ER by herself (her first time going not as a minor) with difficulty breathing. They made her wear a mask which she kept taking off bc she already couldn't get enough oxygen (subsequent pft had her around 55%). She had to tell them that if they were going to make her wear a mask until they got the covid test results, that they needed to give her oxygen. I was so angry. She also had to tell them to look at her chart to see what her disease was bc they didn't believe she didn't have covid. Ridiculous to treat a young, sick, child like this while not allowing her mother to be present.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry about your daughter. 
Look into methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)Â and its impact on allergies. I'm not saying the allergies will go away but it might help her quite a bit. I'm not a doctor btw, just someone taking MSM regularly because of its benefits. </p>
<p>Here's a study, maybe you can find other studies or simply try it and look for yourself</p>

        <p>&rt;People who have a history of lying to the hospital to get drugs or because they're mentally unstable will have a long record of doing so. This person was on their 1st visit meaning the only information they have will be from the patient, to ignore that is beyond stupid. My mom works at a hospital and I KNOW this to be fact.</p>

        <p>No, they harm people continually because they refuse to listen to patients, precisely because they have that kind of othering attitude towards them. The majority of crazy people are entirely lucid and capable of explaining what's wrong, too - and for those that aren't the possibilities should be very obvious.</p>

        <p>People's esitmated lifelong tax and insurance payments are traded on an underground stock exchange. There is a financial incentive for hospitals to "diagnose" people with covid because they are promised a % of the death bond when that person dies. This is of course bundled up in legal mumbo jumbo to make this payout seem like legitimate funding for hospitals that are overrun with patients.</p>

        <p>I thought I had appendicitis a month ago and went to the ER. Basically, my friends ambushed me and drove me to the hospital because I had this dull lower belly pain for weeks that suddenly turned sharp. I didn't want to go to the hospital because I didn't feel like getting tested and/or unnecessarily getting quarantined for nothing. All I had was a sharp pain in my lower right belly. When I first entered the hospital there was this lady on the entrance awaiting to take my temperature asking what was going on, she pointed that temperature gun thing at me, I said I think I might have appendicitis and kept saying "well, do you have trouble breathing? Are you coughing? Did you have a fever before you were e xperiencing this pain?" And I was like what I'm sorry, how is this related to my potential appendicitis. </p>
<p>Long story short, I had to pass through four to five checkpoints just to get to an actual examination room. They kept taking my temperature and just basically kept pressing me and asking if I had any bad colds in the last few weeks and I kept telling them for christs sake, I came here because I've been having pain in my lower belly, not because of suspected covid. Even when I managed to get to an actual examination room, the doctor completely disregarded my symptoms and kept asking me sus questions like "Would you say that previous to your pain you've experienced anything that you'd say deteriorated your health overall? Like a really bad cold? Perhaps a high fever that would persist for days on end?" Excuse me what? I told him I had pneumonia back in Jan/Fev 2020 that went untreated for two months due to the beginning of the covid craze. Then I overheard him saying to that nurse "Well, she must have had covid back in February or March, so I don't think we should prescribe a PCR for this one". In the end, he completely disregarded my symptoms, kept reading me the wrong test results, I kept waiting for like two hours and he kept saying just wait a minute, we've had one covid case here. I just got the hell outta there as quickly as possible in between his sixteenth time leaving me all alone and right before coming back to tell me the same thing.</p>
<p>Not to mention that I had to wear a mask up to my fucking eyeballs because of this nurse that would harass me each time it would get lower than my eyelashes practically. I'm generally very sensitive and I get migraines very very easily. That moist, oxygen-depriving environment of a face mask is the perfect migraine trigger for me. Anytime I have one on for more than twenty minutes I can feel the migraine coming. I left the hospital with the worst migraine of my life and slept for like 20 hours when I got home, because I was in so much pain (migraine plus stomach), I was so angry with their utter negligence and how covid monopolises everything nowadays and generally all around exhausted. I'm still exhausted.</p>

        <p>They should have told your boyfriend to make sure to avoid moving them to much, especially try to avoid rotation.</p>
<p>They should give people with broken bones a vibration device to help heal the bone more quickly.  Be careful though because this will hurt much more than expected.
Certain tuning forks can also be used, again ouch.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he must try breathe deeply every once in a while, even though it's painful, because extremely rarely pneumonia can develop in the lungs.  </p>
<p>So he should probably stay away from hospitals, they cannot do anything about broken ribs.  You just gotta wait it out, unless it is close to heart or something.</p>
<p>Fracture in the ribs are very hard to see on x-ray, basically impossible in the first 72 hours, because the inflammation will obscure the fracture.</p>
<p>I know you didn't ask me, but as a chiropractor, the inability of ERs to address the simplest of problems.</p>

        <p>Similar, not identical, but it would be extremely rare that labored breathing is your ONLY symptom if you have the flu. It's extremely sad that I have to explain that to a presumed adult.</p>
<p>Labored breathing could be your ONLY symptom if it's covid, or it could be asymptomatic.  Covid is slow onset and symptoms take a while to develop and with the flu they tend to happen all at once.</p>
<p>Again, it's a precaution. It doesn't hurt anyone. Stop thinking you're oppressed by getting a little swab up your nose.</p>

        <p>I never said it can NEVER manifest as only labored breathing.</p>
<p>But the NIH states that "Influenza is characterised by sudden onset of fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, dry cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion." We have billions of cases of the flu. It is well researched. And this is the characterization that the NIH gives based off years of research ð¤¯</p>
<p>Sudden onset. Multiple symptoms.</p>

        <p>Just to be sure... are you purposely ignoring the fact that the CDC only accredits 6% of the recorded covid deaths to covid?  Or are you ignoring the fact that the Flu kills half a million people every single year without being inflated?</p>
<p>Or are you ignoring both?  I mean... in 1918, the flu killed 50,000,000 people world-wide.  I know that was a long time ago, but I struggle to understand why you think that the flu isn't as deadly as covid.  So I'll ask again, why do you think that you're so smart because clearly you're not.</p>

        <p>Are you aware that the flu changes every year, therefore the death rate can vary every year?</p>
<p>Yes I'm purposely ignoring that debunked myth. But allow me to to explain it to you since it's too hard for you to comprehend on your own. That is 6% who had NO other underlying conditions. You fucking fat fuck Americans have so many other health issues. If this debunked statistic is your argument then you've got some serious issues.</p>
<p>If you want to make the comparison with deaths from the flu, why don't you take into consideration who had underlying conditions with the flu as well?</p>

        <p>Yes, we Americans do have a lot of health issues and that's why not a single one of us really cares when someone dies from being unhealthy.  We just don't fucking care.  If people want to be healthy then they'll be healthy.  If they decide to be so unhealthy that they die from a pathetic virus like Covid-19, then that's their fucking problem.   I've traveled around the world multiple times and I've beaten viruses from so many different countries.  I've served 9 years in the military.  I've traveled across most of the United States.  I accept risk.  I expect others to accept risks as well.  You'll never once convince me to be afraid of this weak ass virus.  I don't care about anyone who has died from it.</p>

        <p>I agree, Covid and the military are great ways to kill off the stupid before they reproduce. Gotta love Darwin!</p>
<p>My argument was never that I care about people dying. I don't. My argument was that you are uneducated and don't know how to interpret statistical information.</p>
<p>I love how this argument turned into a paragraph about your life story and your âï¸feelingsâï¸, like anyone cares, because you finally realized you're wrong and I'm right ð</p>

<p>Their lack of logic is killing other people too. Anyone who supports this plandemic narrative has blood on their hands. They are complicit in all the suicides, iatrogenic deaths, and systematic torture/abuse of our entire human race. These people make me fucking sick.</p>

<p>Because delaying treatment for someone with broken bones, especially their freaking <em>ribs</em>, REALLY won't cause them any damage. Sure.</p>

        <p>I've broken my ribs on a couple occasions from coughing so hard from pneumonia and bronchitis. The first time, my doctor pressed down and laughed when I yelped from the pain. Two broken ribs according to the x-rays. I was prescribed Tylenol and told to ice. That's the treatment.</p>
<p>It only really hurts when you cough a lot (which I was doing uncontrollably) or sneeze or put pressure on. But it's not a big deal. Minor pain when breathing. Not urgent. Not going to die.</p>
<p>Broken neck would be urgent.</p>

        <p>A broken anything is urgent. I, unfortunately, have had broken bones too. Left untreated isn't a good idea, and they damn well should take higher priority over a goddamn respiratory virus (unless the patient is complaining that's the source of their symptoms).</p>
<p>Broken bones don't kill, yes, but they are horrific pain. Worry about the damn patient, not yourself.</p>
