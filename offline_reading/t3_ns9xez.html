    <strong>Did you guys see the New York Times article on Fauci’s emails?</strong>
    <p><p>Me neither...</p>
<p>But here’s one from 2 weeks ago:</p>
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/well/live/jane-brody-and-dr-anthony-fauci-on-staying-fit-and-focused-at-80.amp.html</p></p>

        <p>I read the emails and didn’t see anything all that bad. It’s not news.</p>
<p>The worst I could find were:</p>
<p>One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information</p>
<p>On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.</p>
<p>On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.</p>
<p>Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.</p>
<p>Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)</p>
<p>He said he didn’t think masks were needed and that symptomatic spread was the largest means for transmission, but that was on February 5th, a month before COVID hit the US, two months before we had solid data, and three month before the NIH updated their recommendations with the new published data.</p>

        <p>He knows masks are useless or even detrimental then insisted the whole country wear them for a year, kids included.  That's pretty bad in of its own.</p>

        <p>What makes you say that? Once we had effective and clear data showing masks are effective at reducing the spread and mortality rate of the virus, we started recommending them.</p>
<p>They’re not perfect, but they do reduce the spread of viruses. These findings are consistent across researchers and populations:</p>

        <p>What data you crackhead? Sweden has never mandated masks, Florida and Texas have taken them off months ago. Poland has taken them off outdoors as well weeks ago and cases are still plunging. I could show you graph after graph of cases over time in different counties and you would have no clue when mask mandates came into effect or were relaxed. In fact, most of the time cases shoot up after mask mandates.  We all know mask hygiene is terrible out there.  Go paste your comment in another thread now defending Fauci as your messiah.  You re on the wrong side of history with your oppressive tactics and i sure won't forget.</p>

        <p>When Quebec mandated masks the graph was already dead, covid went wayyy down lol. When they mandated the masks, cases sky rocketed a little bit after.</p>
<p>Many scientists already proved that the masks dont prevent spread of this virus.</p>
<p>Texas proved this virus isnt even a big deal lol.</p>

        <p>First of all look at the user name.  alt account 6.</p>
<p>And this is about the 8th time I've run across this copypasta comment.  It's simply silly.  He says "I've read them" (in an earlier post it was "I've read most of them") then quotes 4 messages and dismisses them.   I'll just trust there was nothing interesting in the other 4000 pages.  Are we supposed to believe that he sent the lab leak email to a colleague for review and more information, and never got a reply or again mentioned it?</p>

        <p>You commented the same thing word for word on my other post. And my response is basically the same - it’s the context that matters more than the content. And depending on whether gain of function was actually used, these emails could be a bombshell </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3187 is very noteworthy if you look at the context. Kristian Andersen tells Fauci that he’s looking into the possibility that the virus was made in a lab. On the very same day, Andersen publicly denounced the lab leak theory by quote tweeting Tom Cotton. Why would he publicly come out against the lab leak theory on the same day he told Fauci he was still trying to decide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one from Daszak looks really, really bad. Thanking fauci for spiking the lab leak theory while trashing Fox News, with the context that the NIH gave EcoHealth millions in grants, much of which meant to WIV..that’s worthy of an investigation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than those, the emails are mostly just fan mail and Fauci giving shit inconsistent advice on how to protect yourself. I don’t care about those as much, but the lab leak ones need to be seriously investigated</p>
