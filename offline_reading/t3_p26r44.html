    <strong>The importance of getting involved</strong>
    <p><p>I attended a public meeting of my local school board meeting yesterday. They were voting on whether to require masks for the children in schools. They kept it open to the public and we had organized for a large group to show up against the requirement. We spoke and voiced our concerns. There were a few people who were not part of our group who spoke in favor of requiring masks, all of them took jabs at us claiming we were making it political (none of our group made a single statement about politics) and implied we were uneducated yada yada the usual stuff. There were FAR more of us than of them. The school board voted against requiring masks in our school district. That means our children will be allowed to attend school five days a week and breathe freely. They may wear a mask if they so choose, but it was clear that not enough people wanted them or feels like they need them. Iâ€™m in a blue state!!! We are the only school district for miles to have made this decision. Our children are free!!! I will not stop here and I feel so grateful. I prayed before, after, and during. God is good. He freed our children here. </p>
<p>Please, if you can, get involved. Attend protests. And most importantly, talk to your local government. Your local government is the one making decisions that truly affect you. Make them look you in the eyes while they make their decisions. Tell them in person what it is that you need them to do. Or stand by someone who will tell them. Do something if you can. Anything. We need to end this madness.</p></p>
