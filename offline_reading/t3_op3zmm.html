        <p>I work in healthcare and yes I have seen it. I had two patients who had neuro issues, one can no longer walk on her own. Needs a walker in home and a WC outside now and it happened 3 days after moderna. It’s been months and she never recovered. Another has severe tremors in her hands and can no longer use her hands to feed herself or do any self care , she has to be fed and dressed by family now.  My coworkers son is an EMS worker and he got Pfizer and he ended up in the CCU in cardiac arrest. He is recovering but cannot work. He is 34 years old. Not sure what his prognosis is. My ex Hs mom was close friends with a man in his late 50s, massive heart attack three days after Pfizer. Healthy before. He died.Can’t think of anymore but a close coworker mentioned to me she has had a few patients complaining of things that sound related to this as well. No proof but patterns are emerging. Time will tell.</p>

        <p>My patients are "people I know". I'm not making them up. I am connected to these people and speak to them several times a week. I knew them before the vaccine and now after. I don't think the person has to be lying in bed next to me to count lol</p>

        <p>yea but any of these cases were classified as side effects caused by the vaccine? or still no proof to show? IMO the only way to prove the vaccine is linked to all these side effects is with statistics, unless you have a recorded timeline between getting the vaccine that shows correlation to similar side effects and severity suffered by those people, it might be possible to "link" the symptoms to the vaccine, and still these can still be classified as "normal" and pure "coincidence" and has nothing to do with the vaccine as these are mere "Statistic" but not scientific evidence.</p>
<p>this is how many countries still have zero death related to vaccines, officially.</p>

        <p>Of course there’s no proof, this entire thing is a giant experiment lol this is where our common sense comes in. If you keep seeing patterns and similar things happening in quite a few people formulating a hypotheses here seems like a natural thing.. At this point I’m going with my gut. All the debating and all the arguing in the world is not going to change my mind at this point. I’m sure millions of other people are feeling exactly the same way. Many many people are not even aware that this is experimental at this point. They think these vaccines are approved and they’re not. Everyone taking the vaccine right now is part of an experimental phase of all of this which is why so many millions of people want to wait and see what the long-term data is. When people say there’s no long-term data of connections or side effects or whatever, well yeah of course! There’s no long-term data period.</p>

        <p>My mom got the pfizer. After the 2nd shot she was dizzy and such that day and the next. Then at about 3 days she also started having trouble breathing and coughing. Finally culminated at 2.5 weeks and went to the hospital where she stayed for several days. They ran tons of tests, couldn't find anything, she was on oxygen for much of it, steroids and breathing treatments. </p>
<p>This was back at the beginning/ middle of June. She followed up with a pulmonologist who gave her an asthma diagnosis based upon breathing tests. Gave her a daily inhaler which she uses. She's still fucked up and gets dizzy all the time. </p>
<p>Oh and the hospital and the pulmonologist all claim it could not possibly be related to the vaccine.</p>

        <p>How is there going to be proof at this point? We are still in an experimental phase. There is no long-term data at all at this point. You’re looking for something that doesn’t exist. People are going on observation at this point and that is their right. If you wanna wait for data to show this is causing certain things then that’s fine but many people are not taking the risk and that is within their right to make that judgment call and at the very least wait.</p>

        <p>doesn't matter. in the eyes of the law evidence is everything. if there is no presentable evidence showing something is dangerous, then the said item is considered safe.</p>

        <p>I have a friend that was in congregate care and a ward of "the system". He was given the shot a month after he had recovered from covid. I say he was in congregate care because now he is in a full-time skilled nursing facility as he can no longer use his arms and legs.</p>

        <p>I had posted the story here a few weeks ago. Short summary: An acquaintance of mine reported in her WhatsApp about severe pain in her arm right after the shot and severe headache 2 days later.
I contacted her to tell her that's why I'm afraid of taking it. After a little back and forth she blocked me.
So I don't know if and when it got better.</p>
