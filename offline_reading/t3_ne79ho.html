        <p>BuT science CaN evolve, DUMMY!</p>
<p>Yeah, it can. But like we've been saying all along: it evolves with evidence. Verifiable. With years and years of study and peer reviewable scrutiny. There's a reason every medical and natural science degree also requires you take basic (and oftentimes advanced) statistics as well: because numbers and data sets can be manipulated to say ANYTHING given poor sampling, poor parameters being set, hell even just wording things vaguely so your results look like they were the opposite of what they actually are. </p>
<p>The fact that any voice of dissent is silenced shows this isn't science. When I was in school getting my biology degree, science was not a consensus. Not this monolithic version of unchallengable thought that we all got together and agreed upon a singular version of truth. Everything was made to be questioned. Hell, even things like gravity still got tested, not to necessarily prove or disprove its existence; but to further our knowledge. There was a time in our past in which science was a monolith like it is now: the dark ages. This isn't a shit post on religion, I do not believe the two MUST be at war with each other; but this is when one entity (the catholic church) determined what was and wasn't "real science". We are seeing a rise of a singular authoritative entity, a new church, to determine for us peons what we should believe about science. The Church of the "Experts", as it were. We should all be shitting our pants, cuz we're heading right back to the dark ages folks. No one questions, to do so is yo be branded a heretic, lunatic, and excommunicated beyond the salvation of "god".</p>
