    <strong>A conversation I had 3 days</strong>
    <p><p>So I met up with my old photographer 3 days ago not seen her in 1 year 5 months </p>
<p>We had lunch etc. Than we got chatting about the jab(s) she had hers because she works in the hospital doing photos and whatever else. </p>
<p>I told her my feeling about the jab(s) and how I for one will not be having any of them and these passport things to freedom and them forcing it upon on or bye freedom. </p>
<p>To which she said... I work in the hospital i see people die from cv19 etc..you know the same shiz I hear all the time. </p>
<p>She saying oh the jabs are just minor side effects and some don't have any. And I be fine. </p>
<p>Than I said ma auntie was in pharmaceutical's for 40 years and you can not make a vaccine that quick when they take 10 years to make. </p>
<p>Her reply was oh it was based on another form of study of medicine when they made it. 
I asked well what was they called than? ( she could not answer me ) </p>
<p>She quickly moved the goal post and mentioned dying people again from covid and its real. ( I weren't going to argue at this point) </p>
<p>Waste ma breath and all.. than I moved it to well there forcing it on to people since these passports are coming in. ( she said nah it won't happen, and your be exempt anyway) due to ma liver disease. </p>
<p>I got a feeling i won't as I've had numerous texts and NHS letters though my door hounding me about it. </p>
<p>I told her about my OT her husband and how he took the shot and ended up on ventilation and nearly died he was on hospital for 3 weeks. ( she also disregarded that too ) and said maybe he something in his body did not like it. ( no he is a guy in his 40s fit and healthy and done many marathons etc. Until he took this shot. He has permanently damaged himself and never be the same and his scared to take shot no2. </p>
<p>But no that went over her head too. Like i was making it up. </p>
<p>Than she went on to say I listen to much to media and  scare mongering.( at this point I knew she was fed into it and she believed everything by the elite government. </p>
<p>So I ended lunch with her and said I see her next time..</p>
<p>People this is what people have been brainwashed with and we are apparently talking shite and making this up as we go along </p>
<p>But yet before this force vaxx and passports. Were there not stadiums filled for football and Ascot the F1 etc.  </p>
<p>And now they want to jabs and let you into nightclubs big venues by September. ( right o ) </p>
<p>There talking shit. How the hell is this about health its not. Its control and more control. First freedom is blackmailed with jabs . What next our money our houses etc ?</p></p>

        <p>The "history" the vax is based off of which allows them to skip MOST nonclinical and toxicity studies is defined as a <strong>"platform approach"</strong></p>
<p>(The link below shows videos where Big Pharma literally says they turned in the IDEA of nonclinical studies they PLANNED TO DO if time allowed... and the FDA found that totally acceptable)</p>
<p>They assumed because the animal fat layer around the viral mechanism, aka Lipid Nanoparticle (LPN), was the same. That ignores half the "vaccine" and thus relies entirely on assumption.</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy, as the representatives of Pfizer and Moderna admit this during medical webinars by Labroots, which one can watch to earn PACE credits. Since they removed the videos from Youtube (ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) you can watch them on the Labroots site for free, <em>I made a post about it here:</em></p>
