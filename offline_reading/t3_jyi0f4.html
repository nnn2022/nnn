    <strong>In 1948, the WHO defined what the definition of health was. It seems like most of the world governments and so called “public health experts” have forgotten this definition.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</strong> The bibliographic citation for this definition is: Preamble to the Constitution of WHO as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19 June - 22 July 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of WHO, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948. The definition has not been amended since 1948.</p>

<p>I would like someone from the government of south Australia who for my understanding if you lived in  apartment complex basically told you to have your dog shit in your living space look at me with a straight face and say that they are enacting their mandates with this definition of health in mind. </p>
<p>I would like someone from the government of France who from my understanding told residents that they couldn’t walk more than 1km from their house, and couldn’t use a public park if it was outside that distance look at me with a straight face and say that they are enacting their mandates with this definition of health in mind. </p>
<p>I would like all the nursing homes and hospitals who did not even let visitors into the building for months, and let people die without seeing their loved ones to look at me with a straight face and say that they enacted those policies with this definition of health in mind. </p>
<p>I would like all the media organizations and governments who refused to give straight numbers about the risk(IFR) of the disease, so I had to look them up myself from the  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">CDC</a> and who gaslighted the public with statements like “if you all wore masks this would all go away” to say with a straight face that they wrote their articles and gave their speeches with this definition of health in mind. </p>
<p>How dare you.</p></p>

        <p>In 1949, the dude who invented the frontal lobotomy won a Nobel Prize. I think you are expecting too much from these people. Some of them are actual psychopaths who gravitate towards control of human bodies.</p>

        <p>Honestly that’s why I frequently exclude 2020
when looking at scientific or public health articles. It’s sad that it’s come to this, but honestly there’s just been too much fuckery.</p>

        <p>Due to increases in technology, data scientists now have access to much more information than ever before that apparently has given politicians the confidence to confidence to make radical life altering policy measures (lockdowns).</p>
<p>The problem is that these models are theoretical and even if they were accurate, if the raw data is bad (inaccurate test results), the resulting conclusion will of course be bad (garbage in, garbage out).</p>
<p>Technocracy doesn't work because technology today now uses the "work fast and break things" model which is great to get products to market ASAP and is fine when the goal is impressing investors to raise a stock price.  They can always clean up the mistakes in a subsequent update.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, politicians are applying the "work fast and break things" model to changing society to fight corona and socioeconomic forces which is obviously having terrible permanent consequences that cannot just be fixed in a patch.</p>
