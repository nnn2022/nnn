        <p>If masks come back, then politicians are low key communicating to the public that the vaccines don’t work. It gives them and the pharmaceutical companies a bad name. Although many people will blindly obey whatever they are told without question, more people will still wake up. People who got the shot are going to be unhappy that they went though side effects only to be told they don’t have resistance to the delta/ lambda/ whatever variant. </p>
<p>Newsom is facing recall in California. I think he will hold off on reinstating masks and whatnot until his recall election is over in September. If he is able to stay governor, I would not be surprised at all if he brings masks back.</p>
<p>Edit: if masks don’t come back, politicians will have to come up with a reason why they aren’t reinstating them. I predict something like “the vaccine essentially makes it a common cold”.</p>

        <p>I’m the oddball for this sub, I know. I’m not anti-vax and I got the Covid vax as soon as I could. However, I don’t believe anyone should be forced to get it, or even pressured or coerced. That being said, I’d be pissed if mask mandates come back. I doubt they will in my particular state, because we’re over 70%, and all the places with rising Covid rates have lower vax rates. I also think that, if masks come back, it’ll be in places with sub-50% vax rates, so politicians will absolutely say the vax works, but “you dumb rural hicks didn’t get vaxxed, and that’s why you have to wear masks”. It’s coercion. But for reasons I stated in my previous comment, I bet it will be limited to rural red areas in blue-run states.</p>

        <p>Same! I got the vaccine too. I am not against it at all, but I also am totally against people being coerced and pressured into getting it by government or their employers. Also, My area is like 80% vaccinated by now,  and people STILL wear masks when walking alone outside or do the thing where when they walk past you they jump away in a frightened panic and put their masks on.</p>

        <p>Who exactly wants Newsom recalled though? If the majority of liberals in CAs big cities want him to stay, then he’s staying put. Chances are if he is overthrown. Another liberal whose crazy for covid restrictions will simply take his place.  I honestly believe that one the most liberal states will bring back mask mandates CA/NY/IL. If you don’t live in those states then you may not have to worry.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think Newsom has a good chance at being recalled. I think a lot of people who are against him are quiet about it because they know that the mob will attack them. That said, I also think he has a good chance of staying around.</p>

        <p>The dynamic is weird. The places where the Covid rates are increasing, primarily because vaccines rates are low, usually have leadership that <strong>is not</strong> inclined to mandate masks. In the places where leadership <strong>would</strong> mandate at the drop of a hat, vax rates are high enough that Covid rates are staying low. 
The only potential for crossover is in liberal states with some rural areas. For example, California’s Gov could mandate masks in rural counties in northern CA if their Covid rates go up. And since his goal is 100% vaccination, this is how he could “punish” the counties with lower vax rates. I wouldn’t worry about this in states like Florida or Texas.</p>

        <p>Im not too surprised by this. California has been going off the deep end since Covid even became a thing. Also is infection rates are high that means people got covid. So why would they need the vaccine? Doesn’t make much sense to me. But I’m just some 18 year old what do I know lol.</p>

        <p>“Infection rates are high” is a little misleading. It’s still a very small percentage of the population that has been infected, but you’re right that prior infection is about as effective as the J&amp;J vax at preventing future infection, at least for 6-12 months, which is similar to J&amp;J.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that they consider any 'viral material found by a PCR Test to be an 'infection'.</p>
<p>So if there is a 3% to 7% 'infection' rate (which used to be called a 'case'), it's not very much in practical matters, because 99% get sent home because they're not even sick.</p>
<p>The States that are ignoring this are good to do so, because a 'casedemic' doesn't warrant the lockdown and restriction of an entire population and is not a crisis or emergency</p>

        <p>Because they're not 'covid rates', they are 'cases'.</p>
<p>And since 99% of positive 'cases' are not sick or symptomatic, and sent home with no further medical treatment other than 'isolate for 14 days', that is what they are basing their decision on.</p>

        <p>This is all due to the f*ing press and healthcare scum trying hard as f to keep us in the “state of emergency”  so they can keep getting money. Infections are worthless if there are no hospitalizations or deaths. Flu has infected people for decades and we didn’t see any mask mandates. I always knew they would fight as hell to keep the BS as long as possible. Nothing is going to happen other than the infected recovering after a few days especially the ones that have vaccinated many whom won’t even notice.</p>

        <p>They will be pushing covid regime until they meet enough resistance. They are like a gambler on a winning spree, they are unable to stop because every step is so successful. Technically, they should secure the winnings and stop a little so that people get used to no freedoms, but just like a gambler can't stop playing until they lose big, they will tightening the bolts until society breaks down.</p>

        <p>It's up to those who took the jabs, thinkig they would return to the old life. If reality kicks in against their wishes, then there's a chance things will change. I'm sure riots will happen in a lot of places.</p>

        <p>I am living in a Cult of The Mask and Vax majority run province in Canada.</p>
<p>I believe I would be at highest risk for this to return, because even as Mask mandates have been lifted - removing some of their iron grip over us that they've had for 12 months - they are still wearing Masks in stores, at jobs and about, and majority of businesses still require them out there (some also mandated vax for employees)</p>
<p>They would love this, as they are not only driven by FEAR and SUSPICION, and also paid by coivd19 benefit packages by Justin Trudeau to comply $2000+, they have become addicted to their self-righteous power to command others about, and to virtue signal their devotion to the Covid19 narrative.</p>
<p>If we are not open by September 2021, and people have not learned to live with and manage covid19 as it makes its course, and more lockdowns or mandates come back...</p>
<p>My business and that of 3 others I deal with directly are GONE in 2022 if we do not have a profitable Spring and Summer 2022. Sure we can always rebuild, but we're GONE. For myself and at least another in the same field, even our way of approaching prospects face to face will be gone. Besides the 3 that I have direct contact with, subsidiary businesses are also suffering, and they may go out of business as well.</p>
<p>Big companies who have managed to stay around through all of this will no doubt gain strength as they snatch up our customers, and having less competition in the marketplace will have a 'booming recovery' which will be reported</p>
<p>Still, the 15-30 jobs or so (+ temporary workers to round out needs) that we have provided between all of us, will be gone as well (And have been for 2 x Spring Summer Falls in a row, if this continues)</p>
<p>Then personally I will face an existential challenge - what do I do now, and is it even worth it, with such a glum future ahead of me?I'm tenacious and I will survive.. but this totalitarian crap is on the near horizon.. and thoughts of working on longterm projects and plans and dreams turns into survival mode....</p>
