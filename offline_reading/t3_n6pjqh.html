<title>I don’t know if there are other refugees from the left here, but this very eloquently describes my experience with them. I woke up, I hope more do too. I’m ashamed of how I treated people on the right. I’m trying my hardest now to wake up others. Thanks for having me here.</title>

        <p>Former lefty here.  See, what happened is, they moved the goal post so far left, that whether you wanted to or not, you become right-leaning.  </p>
<p>Take Dr. Martin Luther King, for example.  He believed that people should be judged based on their character and not on the color of their skin.  By today's standards, that is considered racist, because being blind to others' ethnicity is a no-no.</p>
<p>To be clear, Dr. King was in no way, shape or form, racist.  But if you judged his comments by today's woke left, he could be construed as one.  Really messed up, if you think about it.</p>

        <p>We need to stop segregating people, dividing, it's gotten so bad now, it really has. Full 180.</p>
<p>The only reason we should consider race is if it's a doctor and they biologically need to be treated differently in order to give them a better health outcome.</p>
<p>I've seen fucking job opportunities that explicitly state they are only hiring PoC... Like what would people say if they said they are only hiring white people? If it doesn't pass that simple exchange test that's just racism in disguise of woke culture.</p>

        <p>The leader of the Canadian Libertarian Party did an interview with a mental health professional a few days ago (on his channel "Liberty Experts"). He is a firefighter from Alberta, and he talked about his experiences dealing with horrific scenes (burned bodies, deadly car crashes). He said that when they first introduced post-call measures (talking with a professional about what they saw) to help firefighters deal with the trauma, it actually made it way worse. Before that, firefighters would naturally learn to focus on what they did right and how they helped, and would simply detach themselves from tragedy of the victims. They would use really dark morbid humor as a coping mechanism (he said the first time he had to put a burned body in a body bag, they joked with him after asking "who wants BBQ for lunch?", and asked him "how was your first crispy critter?").</p>

        <p>For me, that process of waking up started in 2017, and accelerated drastically in 2020. I'd always had dissatisfactions with the left, but was able to handwave them away because I was convinced the right was so much worse. That said, I've always avoided dumb political slapfights and tried to find common ground and get along with people I disagree with, so I didn't directly shit on conservatives--but I did drift away from the ones I knew, especially in the run-up to the 2016 election. </p>
<p>I find the current situation, in which the left and right are so intensely polarized, alarming, and, frankly, heartbreaking. I'm old enough to remember when it was perfectly normal to have friends of differing political beliefs; you had to be a true radical nutjob not to. But the internet's made it possible to camp out full-time in online echo chambers of people who share the exact same beliefs, while excluding and demonizing anybody who doesn't. That's divided us to a truly dangerous and horrifying degree, a process that has been actively encouraged and abetted by the corporate media and tech companies.</p>
<p>Last year, I swore to myself I was going to stop being part of the problem, to stop being part of this antagonistic us-versus-them shitshow we've ended up in. And I've found I get a much friendlier reception from people on the right, even though we still don't agree on a whole lot, than I do the left, where even mild disagreement gets met with incoherent screeching and accusations of being a Nazi, a racist, alt-right, fascist, etc.</p>
<p>So after being a lifelong Democrat, I'm now politically homeless.</p>

        <p>Yeah definitely think I’m in the anarchist/libertarian mindset these days. I’m not even sure with how corrupt and big the government is, if it’s worth salvaging. Kinda think we should abolish the fed and just let the states rule or something, idk. I just want them to leave me and my family alone.</p>

        <p>Cool. I’ve been following Derrick Broze, Jason Bermas, Ryan Cristian, Whitney Webb, James Corbett, and Sal the Agorist, if you are interested in checking their stuff out. They are more anarcho capitalists leaning and trying to work on decentralization solutions. Most are on Rofkin because they’ve been banned from YouTube for reporting on the Covid scam and medical tyranny.

        <p>I was hardcore liberal during the Obama years. I mean after the Bush presidency and the lies that got us into the me I was chomping at the bit for a return to sanity and Obama was the perfect candidate for that. I didnt start to have the wool pulled from my eyes until 2015 tho. That campaign, I was on the ground and in the chat rooms and i noticed that what the media was reporting was counter to what I was witnessing. They were just so in the tank for Hillary, no matter how many gaffes or simply put, outright hostility she had for the American voter was swept under the rug. I used to only get my news from mainstream media and that's when I began to notice the propaganda.Then Donald Trump won and people lost their damn minds, there was no discourse anymore just this collective mass of pure vehemence and the msm was stoking this anger like a bellows. You could see they actually wanted to incite riots and attacks between the two groups. Finally I just shut the tv off and started doing my own research. Wasn't completetly sure till 2019 which was such an obvious power grab by the elite they didn't even try to hide it. The entire democratic primary was a farce, you had Joe at 1% and Harris at less than that and they managed more votes than any other president in history? It was a message to us all " we own this country and you have to conform or well make you into the enemy". What scares me tho is so many of my friends are still brainwashed and just go along with whatever narrative is currently being spun. I just hope they have a wake up moment sooner rather than late, were losing control of this country at an alarming rate.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with everything you said. I voted for Bush and after the War lies and torture program I went full Obama. I was Bernie in 2016, saw the same cheating bullshit and swore democrats off after that. I voted Green Party this last election, but totally believe it was rigged in Biden’s favor. It’s all bullshit. People like the Bilderberg group own our government. I hope they wake up soon because we are headed towards living in a Technofascist police state.</p>

        <p>It's disconcerting when you hear the brainwashed repeat the buzzwords and talking points theyve heard to describe something. The term NPC is used for a reason bc it fits so well and it's scary how many think they're not being controlled and manipulated.</p>

        <p>I used to consider myself way left. I was a punk rock kid in high school. The left used to be Question Authority. Question everything. Stand up for oppressed people. Tolerance...</p>
<p>Now it’s question nothing.  Oppress people who don’t agree with you. No tolerance for people with different views. </p>
<p>I don’t agree with everything the right has to say but they have it right when it comes to Civil Liberties. I consider myself Libertarian now. Let people do what they want even if you don’t agree with them and get the government the fuck out of my life.</p>

        <p>It doesn't surprise me that there are no pure conservatives commenting here. Reddit succeeded in driving us off the platform over a year ago. I've been in politics as a Conservative from the start, over twenty years now. I've watched the Right get called evil and insane for warning about issues for decades only to be slandered and shouted down. Well now it's all come home to roost.</p>
<p>Talk about the fact an MtF still has XY chromosomes? You're a science-denier.</p>
<p>Ask for hard research and data on climate change? Science-denier and idiot.</p>
<p>Question the intentions of the government (ex: Waco, Ruby Ridge, Operation Northwoods, Operation Mockingbird, etc.)? You're a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>Talk about the fact that ghetto culture (which any race can belong to) glorifies crime, promiscuity, fatherlessness, and destruction of western values? You're a nazi racist.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I'm bitter and jaded at this point after seeing *so many* leftists come blinking into the sun going, "Wow! I've seen the light!"</p>
<p>But what's coming is the first wall: when your previous allies that preach tolerance, peace and love suddenly turn on you and defame you. Call you names for your beliefs. Maybe you'll stand up to them. Maybe you'll say nothing and avoid the fight. I don't know you. I hope you'll stand up.</p>
<p>I don't really have a point to this post. Just to say that the shame you say you feel means very little to us. You guys have spent your lives calling us every name you can think of. Words don't mean much to us any more.</p>
<p>But hey, you succeeded in electing Biden (fraudulently, look up Dominion, Crowdstrike and the shadiness abounding) and you brought down the western world with COVID. Better late than never, I guess?</p>

        <p>I didn’t vote for Biden. And I wasn’t a life long democrat. I voted for Bush and his lies and torture program pushed me the other direction. I voted for Obama, then Bernie, then Hawkins. I apologize for my part in getting caught up in propaganda and mob mentality and whatever harm it has caused well meaning people trying to express their values and views. I am a big enough person to admit I was very wrong, and I was also extremely naive. I’m not asking for your forgiveness. You are absolutely entitled to hate me if you want. All I can say is that I’m sorry.</p>

        <p>GOP had its phases in recent years. The Bible thumpers in the 1980. Neocons in the 2000s. Tea party early 2010s then populist in late 2010s. I’m really hoping to return to economic conservatism in the 2020-2030s but I know fear is sold to the right just as much as it is to the left</p>

        <p>I'm liberal (moderate) and a Democrat, but I believe the government is here to serve its people.  Taxes should go to providing education, healthcare, support for those truly unable to work due to disability, protection from enemies foreign and domestic, etc.</p>
<p>I believe in being as independent as one can.  The government should enable that.  I think we're going to see a counter culture of conservative and self-reliant democrats.  Unfortunately, the main culture will be the sheep.</p>

        <p>I agree most of the population pays more taxes than they should, and the upper 5% probably pay much less than they should.  Regardless, tax revenue is mismanaged, and the IRS itself is a big expense.  The only real problem I see with getting rid of it is you'd have a lot of people out of jobs.  Not just IRS staff, but tax prep companies would have to let people go.</p>
<p>I can't think of an option that doesn't screw sombody over. That is unless we live in a fantasy world where the government is suddenly not corrupt and inefficient.</p>

        <p>Ideally, yes.  That may not be possible due to the number of available jobs in general.  The IRS employees about 77k people.  That many hitting the job market at one time would be problematic.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's impossible, but even I can see the difficulties.  Even if jobs were available, it would take months to place even a fraction of those people.  Plus, you have to remember they have mortgages and children.  More time to try to sell their house, relocate to a new place for work, buy a cheaper house, enroll kids in new schools.  Even worse if they're caring for elderly parents.  Then, consider the cost of fair severence to facilitate the transition.</p>
<p>It's not as easy as kicking them out and telling them to get a job at Walmart.  There are other effects and variables to account for.</p>

        <p>Don't deflect.  The government doesn't have to take care of the IRS employees because  they do have jobs.  Seems like you want to abolish the IRS, which would put all of those people out of work, and require the government to take care of them until they could find employment.  Also, you lose their wages going back into the economy to support businesses.</p>
<p>The only people who really can't work are those with certain severe disabilities: drug-resistant schizophrenia, cerebral palsy, severe developmental delay, high spinal cord injuries etc.  Now, I don't mind my tax dollars going to help them.</p>

        <p>Not really because there's a $140k cap on Social Security tax.  Those 1% pay just as much as 6 figure professionals.</p>
<p>The 37% tax bracket starts at about $518k.  The top 1% make a lot more than that.  Again, they aren't taxed proportionately high enough vs the rest of the population.</p>

        <p>Where in the wide world of <em>fuck</em> would $518k be the top 37%? $515k is the cutoff for the 1% in the data I linked, which you clearly didn’t even read. The top 1% pay just as much in absolute terms and almost 100% more in relative terms as the next 9%, who pay twice as much relative to the next 15% or so. When should it stop? When the top 5% are shouldering 97% of the income tax burden singlehandedly? Fuck that, there shouldn’t even be an income tax in the first place, <em>much</em> less a graduated one.</p>

        <p>I think I'm in the same boat. I was a huge "Let's just get this lockdown over with" supporter.</p>
<p>Until it didn't end.</p>
<p>2 weeks turned to months turned to over a year.</p>
<p>And now, if I get pricked, they're promising me everything can go back to normal?</p>
<p>It's tempting, it really is. It's like, they've managed to make this vaccine so desirable. As time dragged on in lockdown, the shit we were willing to put up with to go back to normal increased. People are accepting more and more authoritarian methods to try and get back to normal. </p>
<p>If it's too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>I'm abstaining from the vaccine for authoritarian protest reasons. If Canada does not go ahead with a vaccine passport, then I'll consider getting it. </p>
<p>But I will not do something to aquire freedom. It is a right, not something to be earned.</p>

        <p>I've always scored centrist libertarian on the political compass, but I socialized almost exclusively in the left since I was a teen, so I'm indoctrinated.</p>
<p>I have PTSD from sexual violence and cant wear a mask bc that. This year was a 180 flip from #webelievesurvivors to being accused of making the whole thing up and being forced to repeat my rape story multiple times in front of half a dozen people at seven-eleven, just so I could buy ginger ale for my period.</p>

        <p>thanks dude. Im not sure if it's "trauma" at this point or just being more aware than most people that human nature is to be a two-faced POS that will bully any one that they cant get away with just for fun. There are many lovely people who are exceptions, tho</p>

        <p>thanks dude. I'm going through some serious times re-evaluting everything i believed about human nature and i think alot of this "everyone has a good heart" is cultural brainwashing. Rough time this winter coping with the weight of it, but it's been freeing and liberating to see things how they really are. I feel like Im ready to let go of the ups and downs and whims of being a part of this ill culture and just go hang out on a beach and rescue pigeons and live my life on my terms with chill vibes only till I get old and wrinkly and pass away peacefully in my sleep one day</p>

        <p>The only reason it became political left vs right garbage, is because so-called "left" thinkers are MUCH faster to adopt and accept new things. This can be good or bad. So-called "right" thinkers are MUCH more hesitant to give up on things that have proven to be fine for centuries. This can also be good or bad. </p>
<p>This is why (on the extreme level) people who fear new technologies are almost always very right-wing. At the same time, people who want to try massive experiments on a large population like UBI (universal basic income) are almost always very left-wing. </p>
<p>The left brings us into the future, while the right prevents us from forgetting important lessons from the past. And the sane are in the center lol</p>

        <p>I think this is supposed to be called progressive and conservative, rather than left and right.</p>
<p>I think the words left and right are deliberately chosen for how non-descriptive they are. They can be re-framed to whatever fits an agenda to create a false dichotomy that then can be used for the purpose of "divide and conquer".</p>
<p>Let's use adjectives that actually have a distinct and clear meaning to describe how a regime acts.</p>
<p>I'd say a progressive, authoritarian, lying surveillance-regime is not really any better than a conservative, authoritarian, lying surveillance-regime.</p>

        <p>Here, here! It's been really tough for me, to be honest. I certainly don't feel like I have lost an identity (because my identity is not tied to my political leanings), but more so it's been this weird questioning of, "Am I <em>really</em> that different than all my friends?" Because I don't think I am, or was, or will be. But something has changed.</p>

        <p>The biggest redpill for me was this:</p>
<p>"Right" and "Left" in the West are both fake and astroturfed. Nobody wants the Democrats; nobody wants the Republicans. They're two sides of the same establishment-serving coin, designed to present the illusion of choice.</p>
<p>The game is rigged.</p>

        <p>Don't blame yourself. The majority of the government's around the world have been slowly infiltrated by controlling factions. They use convert narcissistic sociopathic tactics to slowly erode our perceptions and concepts of what we believe. Eventually we've all developed something like stockholm syndrome. Eventually this has degraded to a sociological psychosis. In simple terms, we've been brainwashed. Thankfully there are sometimes triggers to snap us out of it and back to reality, if only for moments of sanity. In those moments we can escape. Freedom of thought is paramount to healing. Glad you are here. 🙏💞</p>

<p>The most passionate advocates of liberty I come across are like us. They started on the left and wound up “on the right.” We understand what it is to be duped by our emotions. We can still he compassionate while changing our mind on dictatorial marxism. Which is actually just fascism.</p>

        <p>My political leanings are odd, but would be put in the right-wing. I see more and more people saying the same thing, "I didn't leave the Democrats, the Democrats left me." You are welcome here, I have always enjoyed discussing different political opinions, but I'm glad we can agree that being able to discuss them freely is important.</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar boat, although I'd already had some issues with the left pre-COVID. I'd considered myself far-left for a while. I supported Bernie and voted third party because I refused to be bullied by the Democrats into accepting shitty political candidates who, I felt, catered to the centrists instead of creating real, progressive change for the country. I'd taken issue with identity politics and the over-emphasis of DEI (diversity, equity, &amp; inclusion) in my line of work (education), but I certainly never would have considered myself anywhere near the conservative side of the spectrum. </p>
<p>The thing is, though: The conservative friends and family I had treated me far better, despite our practically diametrically-opposed viewpoints, than my liberal friends. It was only liberals who talked down to me and tried to make me feel guilty or ashamed for wanting to vote for Bernie or third parties over their unimpressive centrist candidates. Other commenters here are exactly right in that it felt like an abusive relationship; and after so much abuse, it's really no wonder that the right became a welcome respite. And the more I talked and listened open-mindedly to the people on the right, the more I confirmed what I'd already suspected: that the lies the left had been spreading about them for years don't really hold up. Instead, I find increased logic and reason and, actually, *less* racism. But of course to even suggest that to my liberal friends would have me ousted.</p>
<p>Anyway, you're not alone, and hopefully there will be more of us soon.</p>
