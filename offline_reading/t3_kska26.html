    <strong>My mother is a nurse at a doctor's office. Everyone went home today after their second shot.</strong>
    <p><p>She's not feeling great, though luckily that's the extent of her side effects. Still, when all the doctors who received the vaccine felt bad enough to go home, and there are thirty at her clinic, I'd be wary going to the hospital today in my county... since they gave it to every damn health worker on the same day.</p>
<p>That's the problem with the "you can't criticize the vaccine!" propaganda. It leads to completely avoidable situations like this one. You aren't supposed to give all the health workers any vaccine on the same day because of side effects. An untested vaccine that is known to have more severe (normal) side effects will be even worse.</p>
<p>That means healthcare workers either got to go home or are trudging through the day feeling like garbage and likely making a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>My mom, who is pro-vaccine to the core, looks so sad as she simpers in the corner in pain and misery. It's against the new religion to complain about it, though. But not bad enough to miss a day of work, lol.</p>
<p>Also: the office staff have been too scared to get the vaccine. I bet they're even less likely to get it after seeing all the doctors go home feeling sick en masse.</p></p>

        <p>This is not a real vaccine.  It's an mRNA serum that reprograms your RNA to send out RNA strands that reprogram your other cells to do the same.  It's to "trick" your body into attacking these RNA strands- basically, it's an artificial virus that is supposed to cause your body to go into full defensive mode when there's no need to.  </p>
<p>A vaccine sends out weak viral strains that are easy to deal with which your body uses to build up T-cell memory so it'll be able to deal with the attack if it comes later on for real.  This thing merely launches your body into full antigen attack mode which takes a LOT of your body's strength.  </p>
<p>Ever get those days when your body is tapped because you're fighting something off?  That's 100% the state this vaccine puts you into.  It doesn't solve anything.  It doesn't train T-cells- it just puts you into full battle mode which is very taxing on your system.  What's worse is that it's artificial and experimental.  There's no way to know what the long term effects of this are.  </p>
<p>A full antigen attack is the most basic and generic defense your body has. Antigens are the front line defenders- they're the pawns.  T-cells are the knights and rooks and bishops.  They are specialized and seek out ways to deal with specific threats after the antigens are unleashed.</p>
<p>This vaccine can go to hell.  I don't want it until I know what the long term effects are.</p>

<p>When does it get your body out of battle mode and how does it know to do this? Is it possible that the vaccine will put your body into the battle mode and not get out of it again? </p>
<p>You sound like someone who's read up on this stuff...thanks for keeping us updated. The other day someone came in saying that they're going to release an even worse virus and taking the vaccine is the only protection against that, so I was rethinking my anti-covid-vax stance, but reading this thread certainly slapped some sense into me.</p>

        <p>It's not meant to get your body out of battle mode.  you simply have to let it run its course and no one but the lab techs that designed it know how long that'll take and they're not talking.  It could be a matter of hours.  It could be a few days.  It depends on the person I suspect.  How strong your immune system is.  I took a few med courses in college, that's all.  It was required for my electronics degree to work in a hospital.</p>

<p>Where did you see that info just out of interest? I bet this is some kind of psy-op to get "conspiracy theorists" to take the jab. That or just genuine bullshit. I love looking into this stuff. You'd be surprised what 77th brigade get up to. </p>
<p>Even if I KNEW that was true, does that mean I would volunteer to be injected with something that governments are being completely dishonest about? Instead the right course of action would be to get to the bottom of this other virus and its source.</p>

        <p>Ok this guy couldn’t be more wrong. He clearly doesn’t know anything about how this vaccine works.</p>
<p>This vaccine is an mRNA vaccine. The mRNA gets taken up by your muscle cells after being injected into your shoulder. Then the mRNA will be translated into SARS-CoV2 spike protein via ribosomes. Your cells will then spit these proteins out into your blood stream. Dendritic cells will take up these proteins and present these proteins to your T cells, which will then activate B-cells and confer long term immunity.</p>

        <p>I really hope the staff including your mom decides to speak up, I’m sorry, but ya it’s normal for a few people to feel a little bad after a shot and maybe have a slight fever, but for the entirety of the people in the same office who took it....that IS NOT normal. People should know and be made aware.</p>
<p>Edit: I hope your mom and everyone who took this comes out the other side ok.</p>

        <p>To be fair, those 30+ doctors are mostly therapist residents and thus millennial doomers. Thursday is the day where they do a lot of non-patient work so they probably just decided to whine and go home because they could get away with it. They were really upset that they couldn't continue doing telehealth after a few months.</p>
<p>For reference, my mom says the daily high patient count used to be 100. Now it's 190 and climbing. Most of who they see are drug addicts and the mentally ill, so that a huge and troubling increase.</p>
<p>The point is that it's obvious they are experiencing uncomfortable side effects and not every healthcare provider can cancel for the day like my mom's office.</p>

        <p>So if you work in a hospital and were healthy and without symptoms all year last year, and now take the vaccine and feel ill, then that means that the vaccine is more dangerous than the virus.</p>

        <p>Scary...what exactly is wrong with them all? When you say "feeling sick" can you be more specific? Like headaches, or muscle aches, or dizziness, or what exactly is happening? Also why did the doctors leave the medical clinic (probably the safest place you could be when something is wrong considering that it's full of medical supplies and other doctors) to go home (where they are with their untrained families and no supplies)?</p>

        <p>Like the poster below me said - they are clinic employees, not hospital employees (not directly, anyway). They can leave work easier than most and will do so over smaller illnesses.</p>
<p>That said, doing hundreds of thousands of healthcare employees for the same system on the same day is just idiotic because all care is now impaired.</p>

        <p>What the fuck. Why are people taking this?</p>
<p>Things they are openly stating on the BBC if you can sift throught the bullshit:</p>
<p>- It will not make you immune.</p>
<p>- It will not stop you from spreading it (Not that I believe their bullshit about asymptomatic spread, I'm just telling you what they openly say).</p>
<p>- All it does is supress symtoms most of the time. (I have no idea how this relates to virus related deaths, presumably positively but are people fully informed about this? I think not)</p>
<p>- We have no idea about the long term effects of this new type of vaccine (that isn't a vaccine because it doesn't prevent you from getting the disease).</p>
<p>- It's very possible that it could negatively effect fertility, but we'll know more once people become infirtile from it.</p>
<p>- You will need this at least 2 times per year from now on.</p>
<p>Here's one I'm adding myself for good luck which is not openly said but a "crazy prediction" that I'm making of which so far have all become true:</p>
<p>They will now use the fact that this vaccine supresses symptoms as their (previously lacking) scientific basis for asymptomatic spread. Are we following? The vaccine will be used as a reason to nappy your face, munchausen the population and all the other bullshit that hinges upon the asymptomatic lie, forever.</p>
<p>It's time to physically resist.</p>
