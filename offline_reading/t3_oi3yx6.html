    <strong>Any reports on how long severe vaccine reactions take to pop up?</strong>
    <p><p>Pretty self explanatory. I’m seeing reports of bad reactions majority of the time happen immediately or within a month of taking the vaccine. My fear is how people are going to fare 3-5 months down the line- idk if there are any reports on this? I have family who received theirs 3.5 months ago and I’m still on edge I’m going to get a call in a month or a week one of them has had a stroke or heart attack</p>
<p>Maybe this will be taken down here- maybe this is the one spot I can post</p>
<p>Just wondering if there have been reports/info of reactions past that 1-2 month mark</p></p>

        <p>The dude in the video sort of talks about how the vaccine interacts. Basically, I think negative reactions can show up between 48hrs to a few weeks. Depending on the kind of reaction your body is pre-disposed to</p>

        <p>Ok thank you, I’m glad to know that if something were to pop up it’d be well within the 3.5-4 months my parents have had it.
I really wish they hadn’t gotten it but my dad is 61 and my mom 58..</p>
<p>Neither have underlying issues or predispositions
Somehow my dad is healthier than me LOL dude bikes 10 miles for fun
But hikes with me a lot too</p>

        <p>I hope everything will be okay with you guys. My grandparents got the jab and nothing has happened to them and their health is average. Still doesn't discount the risk or use of the jab, but hopefully it indicates a chance for your parents?</p>

        <p>Thank you. I appreciate your comment and optimism. I hold the same for your grandparents.. and for everyone who has received the vaccine. I hope that severe reactions down the line are at the most manageable and mild and fixable</p>

But I want kids which is why I’m not getting it
Already I’ve started getting these VERY NEW ovarian cysts that rupture after long visits with them 
Could be coincidence though and at age 31 my body had decided to randomly revolt against me</p>

        <p>Oh definitely 
So I am someone who has actually unfortunately severe health anxiety
I freak out about antibiotics LOL</p>
<p>In the beginning I was terrified of COVID but came to terms with it summer 2020</p>
<p>Then you know I guess it started out with being interested in the Jeffery Epstein thing and certain parts of pizza gate- which automatically put me in that category of conspiracy theorist
I didn’t believe everything I heard, but I looked for patterns so I was already losing friends over that</p>
<p>I was skeptical of the thinking that sitting at a table for a restaurant would not be a risk to covid; but walking to the bathroom would be a risk</p>
<p>Anyways fast forward to vaccines coming out- idk right out of the gate I didn’t trust it because it had only positive outcomes reported which is statistically impossible… then when it was questioned I’d watch it disappear 
Then there were incentives to get it which was very odd
Then my parents started pushing me and all my family did and they wouldn’t even listen to an ounce of questioning and I was pushed by friends and was called a conspiracy theorist time and time again</p>
<p>And this is an experimental vaccine there’s no pamphlet they give with the ingredients- some life insurance companies are saying you now won’t be covered- and the makers of the vaccine cannot be held liable</p>
<p>I’ve gone through other subs and been fucking crucified- not with science but with cruelty about how stupid I am, and yelling at me that “the science” and everyone they know is getting it.. idk just no one is willing to even discuss the negative side effects </p>
<p>And then my bf told me about this sub as I was expressing extreme frustration this morning lol</p>

        <p>Well you sound like you belong here. haha.  </p>
<p>Funny how your anxiety about health, while it must be frustrating at times, has kept you skeptical and able to think this situation through.<br>
Well... the waiving of liability across the board seems like a good place to start. That pretty much does it right there. No long-term data, no transparency on ingredients and side-effects, and no liability. How is this informed consent?  </p>
<p>I haven't had any external pressure except from my aunt. She TRIED to push a little and after saying No, her only defense was "you don't want to protect me?" and I was like.. No? haha.. That's your job, and I'm not sick. Jeez. People think COVID is like aids or something.</p>
<p>So, I am trying to imagine what it must be like to have friends and family being so adamant. It would give me body-snatcher vibes and freak me out for sure.  I'm impressed that you were able to resist it. It worries me how fervent people have become. I think it's the uncertainty and the lockdowns. Everyone thinks the vaccines will make things open up again.</p>

        <p>Thank you!!</p>
<p>It’s interesting because with the health anxiety I have this horrible tendency to fixate on bodily sensations and end up thinking I have some disorder (was convinced I had MS for months) so one would easily assume I’d be in line first up for the vaccine- but I’m well aware of how irrational my health anxiety is and am skeptical of my own thinking so now watching everyone basically follow what I know is my version of irrational thinking is weird. Not that I don’t still freak out and think I have kidney disease for an afternoon LOL so embarrassing but I’ve been proven wrong many times- other times not</p>
<p>It is very frustrating having family be so pushy. I have barely any friend like I’m talking went down from 12 to 2. For some mix of being a stupid conspiracy theorist who is crazy and doesn’t care about others or ridding this country of the disease- which tbh I don’t appreciate because this disease was man made and has the feeling of being very intentional</p>
<p>No long term data on side effects and the extreme push to get it by EVERYONE media government etc is super weird</p>
<p>Family is horrible. My parents are at least done pestering me about but have made it clear they think I should get it and it’s a mistake I’m not “and that’s where they’ll leave it” (for now) I’m just out of getting my MSW so they’ll bring up me potentially not getting a job because of the vaccine 
Actually yesterday my bf and I were talking to her mom and we brought up spike protein (BIG MISTAKE) she went off on us about getting the vaccine ranging from “just get it just do it as a favor for me”.. “everyone I know and I know hundreds of people everyone has gotten it” (uh she doesn’t know hundreds of people but ok)… to “actually no the only person who hasn’t gotten it is your aunt” (who everyone goes on about as being insane and horrible- which she kind of is)</p>
<p>It has sucked a lot but both my bf and I ate not willing to budge. I wavered for a half a day until I found this sub and was just relieved of not being pressured or called crazy enough where I was able to weigh out more info
A lot of people automatically say the info I find is not real or bad reporting but I think it’s actually more indicative of bad reporting when everything is the same it’s like when police ask for the story and everyone has the EXACT same one so they know it’s rehearsed and can’t be true</p>

        <p>Some part of me questions if it’s still being released vs spreading or versions are vs mutating. Maybe that’s a little TOO conspiracy theory but idk</p>
<p>Tbh I still am freaked of Covid I still do not want to get it and am totally triggered by people reporting long haul symptoms like permanent lung damage or Neuro disorders 
But I’m still not willing to get the vaccine
It’s super hard standing my ground on it though because I have been so freaked by covid and so many SO MANY people tell me how covid is much worse and that I’m not following the right science and vaccine can prevent all that long term bad stuff from happening but something in my gut always screams DO NOT GET THAT VACCINE after I consider it for an hour</p>

        <p>It's a really uncomfortable bind to be in, huh..</p>
<p>Part of me wishes for a war because you can't BS a bomb landing in your backyard. haha. An invisible threat is the worst kind and neither option really seems ideal. For me, the vaccine is at least equally as threatening as COVID - be that more or less. The only thing I can think of is to just keep healthy, wash your hands, and just do what you can to make yourself feel safe.   </p>

        <p>Thank you so much. I likely will reach out. My mind plays tricks on my, convincing me I’ll get some deadly disease but usually calms within a day but with the constant news and family pressure it crops up almost constantly ..: my fear of the vaccine is super strong though and it feels like the vaccine is choosing to get sick whereas covid I may have a better shot at just not getting it. I’m safe and wash my hands but I went to restaurants all throughout 2020, stuck to mostly solo hikes with my bf and worked virtually.. but the fear of Covid still lingers if I think about it or have down time
It’s all exhausting and like my brain is in constant war with itself</p>
<p>I agree though I’d prefer some huge obvious apocalypse vs this invisible consistently changing danger</p>
<p>My biggest fear will always remain of the unknown though and the vaccine is the ultimate unknown to me- especially because people insist all side effects are good but are rarely clear on what they will be or who will get them.. 
idk I’m at a constant lose so I really really really appreciate you be willing to talk to me about it all</p>

        <p>Yeah, your worries make sense. It can be hard to know what to do. The pushiness of it all really doesn't help. I don't think it helps in many circumstances. Like being a kid and trying to pick a cereal and your parents are "omg hurry up and pick one". Like damn! I'll just go without if it means not being stressed. haha.</p>
<p>The fervor surrounding the whole COVID thing is overwhelming, and I find there are so many questions unanswered.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do right now either.</p>
