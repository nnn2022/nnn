    <strong>I feel absolutely depressed with everything going on.</strong>
    <p><p>First, sorry mods if this is against any rules or anything. I didn't know how to flair this, but i figured this is probably the best place to post this. Second, i am not asking for help as i know places i can go/people i can talk to about this. I just feel the need to get this off my chest and maybe it'll help someone know they aren't the only one. Or give someone who doesn't experience things like i have some perspective when it comes to mental health.</p>
<p>I have suffered from severe depression since i was young. I have even been hospitalized due to suicide attempts and the like, but a few years ago i "beat" it as much as one could without medication. I came to the realization that i was never going to do anything about it and i moved on with life. Unfortunately it seems with this push to change our very way of life my depression has come back *hard*. I find it difficult to give a damn about anything anymore and i feel like hope is lost. I was/still am a freedom loving American. I have (for the most part) enjoyed this country and the things it has stood for. I have fond memories relating to the freedoms this country has afforded me. Now it seems like its all going to be gone. It makes me feel so depressed that recently i have contemplated suicide again. Especially if we cant stop this "new normal". I won't do it. And please don't try and direct me somewhere for help. </p>
<p>What is possibly even more sad is i work at a behavioral health facility. I work with people similar to me in that they have mental issues and stuff like that.. Lately i have almost stopped giving a crap about work and have contemplated just leaving. Ironically i could end up in a similar facility if this gets to be too bad.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what else to say. I just felt i needed to make this post. This has been the worse my depression has been in a long time. I hope i can provide some perspective for anyone who doesn't understand these things or help someone who feels alone. Feel free to pm me if you guys wanna chat. I may not be able to talk much tonight or even tomorrow due to long work hours but i would still like to be able to help someone. Or even just be a place for someone to vent about shit without any judgement.</p></p>

        <p>Yup. Felt this way earlier today. I’m not suicidal, but I just... don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t enjoy things. I don’t look forward to things.</p>

        <p>I ended up fleeing to Finland to escape all those stupid restrictions an now I’m learning that they’re forcing masks in public transport starting Monday here as well. There’s just no escaping this madness. :(</p>

        <p>I've told people here that it's going to be difficult to escape these mandates, and most places won't be safe. There's people who claim they moved from their state to another, only to still feel depressed because the place they moved to now has mandates or other restrictions too. This is a global problem.</p>

        <p>It's because we are living in a world without hope. We know our lives can be cancelled at any moment, now. I want my son to have a bright future, but I can't bring myself to hope for anything anymore.</p>

        <p>I went around in my neighborhood and ripped down all the covid signs the city put up all over with “guidance on how to stay safe”. They were on poles at each section of the path running through the neighborhood. Felt amazing</p>

        <p>The world is changing dramatically now.  We have a chance to make a real change.</p>
<p>At the end of this, the people who overreacted (which is basically everyone) is going to have their feet held to the fire in order to justify all of the unnecessary deaths, pain, and more.  </p>
<p>Don't give up.  Hang on to see what's on the other side of this at least.  We're in for a rough year, but very few things in the world are permanent - even the worst of lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Feel you buddy. I hope you can snap out of it. It's gotta be hard dealing with mental health with poor mental health, but I suppose you have something to relate to. I don't know if I have any advice for you other than when you get that urge to do something (not kill yourself) like that momentary spark where you feel like feel like you've got energy act on it. Act on it right away. Run down your street naked with freedom on your chest or something. Scream "fuck you Fauci" at the moon and when your neighbors look over give them the finger.</p>
<p>*Also don't do what I did: Drive to the store and get more wine, because now I don't have a license. Things could always be worse.</p>

        <p>This post is completely within scope, so you're good.  These posts seeking moral and/or emotional support from an audience that doesn't buy into the hype really are helpful all around.  It gives you an opportunity to put your feelings into words, and it gives the rest of us a chance to help a fellow human, even if only a little bit.</p>
