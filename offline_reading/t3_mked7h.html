    <strong>In between a rock and a hard place on this one...</strong>
    <p><p>These "unprecedented times" have me in a dilemma. I'd like some thoughts on this from a sub of people I generally consider to be like-minded. I've just typed it out and I guess I'm a long story teller so if you're bored easily skip it lol. </p>
<p>My college is finally having what was supposed to be my class of 2020's graduation ceremony in May. Masks required, social distancing, all that bs, of course. </p>
<p>Now, I'd probably just be like "Screw em" at this point and just not attend, because I've grown to hate most universities for being annoying hyper liberal nut wards. BUT, I never had an "official" cap and gown/walk the stage graduation ceremony for high school because I was home schooled. So a part of me feels like this is my only and last chance to have that experience, once and for all. </p>
<p>I figured, well, I'll just do the damn mask thing. Generally it goes against my principles, but I consider this a special circumstance. But my parents said they won't wear masks if I want them to attend. Which I support 100% their right not to--even I don't wear one in most of the places I go to--but at my heavily liberal school I know for a fact it will only cause a scene and I don't want that. I can already picture them being escorted off the premises. </p>
<p>The attention should be on the graduates, so this is probably the only instance I wouldn't support them in rebelling. They also said that I can't hold it against them if they don't want to see the photos of me walking the stage because I'll have to wear a mask, of no fault of my own. It's not like I want to, I have to. So that kinda blows because if my parents basically don't care anymore I wonder if I should even go to the ceremony now.</p></p>

        <p>Go to it, wear a thin mask and on your gown wear a sticker or patch that says, “Fuck the New Normal” </p>
<p>Right when you get your diploma, take off the mask and throw it into the air and say “No New Normal and smile” then just walk off.</p>

        <p>I feel that side of the argument a lot. I applaud them in the past year for sticking to their guns and not bowing down to authority about "masking up". In my day to day I walk in and out of stores without a mask. I am not sick. Always been simple as that for me. </p>
<p>I guess it's the selfish part of me that is thinking that just putting on a mask for all of an hour or two to watch me have a prominent life moment is the least they could do when I did 4 years of college. I don't know... I can't even be mad at them at all cause I totally get their reasons. I'm still very conflicted though.</p>
