    <strong>how did i end up here</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone. I discovered this sub recently and just wanted to tell you a little bit about the path that brought me here. I am from Portugal.  When this madness started, amidst all the misinformation and ignorance, I was a staunch defender of all the initial decisions, the confinements, quarantines, the general panic, against a challenge of this magnitude I thought there was not much more to be done.</p>
<p>I'm even in favor of vaccination and I've already had my first dose (don't kill me!) although I have all the concerns about its long-term side effects and I don't want in any way the vaccination to be mandatory.</p>
<p>My whole posture changed completely when the vaccine certificates were officially presented many months ago, still as a remote hypothesis.  But just then I realized that something very bad was on the way. First this idea was presented with a lot of rainbows to allow the return to travel and tourism, but in the tiny letters it was already indicated that "it would eventually be used for other things".  Of course it would be for other things, it was a unique opportunity that governments wouldn't lose. </p>
<p>Within a few weeks, as in many places around the world, the certificate approved in my country is already used for almost everything except travel: rstaurants, hotels, leisure spaces, it has already been indicated that will be used for gyms, and then supermarkets, of course.  Frankly we are seeing the crap happening.  I am constantly shocked by  the speed at which things are happening and the ease with which people, completely brainwashed, can no longer be critical and understand what is going on.</p>
<p>I try to discuss these issues with the few more conscientious friends I have but I find that most of the time they think I'm being paranoid and overreacting. And measures follow one after another.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this summary to say that I recently discovered this sub and I really like the content and discussions that exist here. I do not agree with everything here is said, I think in the midst of realistic discussions there are some unrealistic delusions and conspiracies, but at the base, I find here a group of people who realize that it is not okay, nor will everything be okay.</p></p>

        <p>welcome to the group. And not, here we dont "hate people for taking a vaccine". This group is about discussion and questioning what it is happening around us. If you think you need a vaccine to protect yourself, that is right too. This is about respecting personal decisions and choices, respecting freedom and will. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this thing about " vaxx pass", forced vaccination goes beyond a public health concern. The turn events are taking are an erosion of fundamental rights and democracy. If "suppossed elected democratic" goverments are morphing into tyrannies where any right can be uphold, when goverments removed any autonomy from you, when goverment in some way "owns you" ...where we can go from here. With the excuse of a "terrifying disease", the little freedom we already had is gone forever. </p>
<p>I lived some time in Portugal and i loved the country. It is sad to see it is also taking this turn.</p>

        <p>unfortunately our government has increasingly fallen into the webs of populism in recent years, particularly since the pandemic started, and of course we are influenced by the european union and by everything that is decided at commission level.  the decisions that are taken are always in accordance with what is done in other countries.</p>

        <p>Basically there are only 2 solutions for what we are facing:</p>
<ul>
<li>More and more people will realize what is happening and will oppose this and there will be no digital global "health" pass.</li>
<li>Moving completely out of city.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Can you describe in more detail the situation in Portugal? Do they really not let you in (to restaurants, etc.) if you don't present the "paperwork"? Yes you are right if this is not opposed <em>right now</em> it will be too late later.</p>

        <p>in the last update we had, last week, it became mandatory to present tests or vaccination certificate to access restaurants and all types of tourist accommodation (including airbnb, even if it is a closed house and you are going with your family).  The measure is still very stupid because it is only being applied on weekends (for now) but it will soon be extended to every day.  however they have already indicated that certificates will soon be needed to access gyms and other leisure facilities, and we already know what comes next.</p>
<p>the vaccination rate is still relatively low in Portugal (70% of people have the first dose, 25% have full vaccination) which means that it is a completely discriminatory measure.</p>
<p>however our number of new infections grows exponentially due to the infamous delta variant (even if admissions and deaths are in low numbers) which of course justifies the maintenance of panic and the new measures that will be introduced in the coming weeks.</p>

        <p>Olá! </p>
<p>Here from Portugal as well. Took a trip to the countryside during this last weekend, had to get a rushed antigen test at the pharmacy (actually 2, since the first 1 was inconclusive and they wanted me to do PCR, but I spoke to them and they let me do the 2nd one for free). They asked to see the negative test when we arrived at the hotel, but there was literally no real checking - It's nothing more than a formality - they look at the negative (maybe at the date too) and they let you through. We haven't been vaccinated and we're not planning on it, for many different reasons which keep getting added to every day.</p>
<p>We went out to dinner on that night as well and it was funny, the guy up front told us to show the test to the waiter and then the waiter didn't even ask for it. We asked him if he wanted to see it and he basically said - "oh, you've shown it at the front already, right?" So it made no difference whether we had the test or not.</p>
<p>Went out on Sunday to a bar/restaurant and we asked about it and the lady rolled her eyes and said "don't worry about it"</p>
<p>Business owners have had tons of cancellations because of this disgusting, totalitarian, anti-democratic, anti-constitutional decision.</p>
<p>We are faced with an EXTREMELY complicated problem. Let me see if I can explain it. For example - I know someone who rents a holiday house for summer holidays. He couldn't care less if people were vaccinated, or have a negative test. It's beyond irrelevant to him. If it was up to him, he wouldn't bother with it in the slightest. Especially because it could be bad for business. But because of someone possibly reporting him to booking agencies about it, or because the person booking might actually be a health inspector, posing as a potential customer, he is basically forced to ask for it. He is forced to comply, regardless of disagreeing or not. If you're in Portugal, this is what it's like to live before 1974, afraid of the PIDE, or living in Nazi Germany afraid of the Gestapo.</p>
<p>So herein lies the problem, there are many many many business owners who absolutely despise these restrictions, who despise the whole covid bs narrative and just want to do business normally and provide for their families. But because of this method of coercion, they are forced to go against their own values and ask people for these documents.</p>
<p>This is nothing less than a cycle of abuse, where you're forced to abuse others in hopes that your abuser will take it easier on you.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are still trapped in the toxic abusive mindset that if we all just comply, then we'll be off the hook. This is NOT how it plays out. Compliance is enabling this tyranny to continue. We need disobedience - MASS organized disobedience. We need it quick, we need to show that we do not agree with these restrictions, and we're not less than anyone for not wanting to take the vaccine. </p>
<p>It's unfortunate that we are a very compliant people, even when we disagree. America has a lot of problems, but it has another kind of freedom. I'd love to just move to Florida and be done with the covid bs. If anyone knows of Portuguese Telegram groups that are against the tyranny, please let me know.</p>

        <p>What you say is completely true and it is a very simple mechanism of political and psychological manipulation created by the government. From now on they do not need to police and control situations, because people will be controlling themselves and others, making complaints and exposures, segregating people who do not get vaccinated, creating a barrier of division between "citizens of good and the citizens of evil". We are on this level.</p>
<p>During the confinements I always hear many people, including my family, say that "the police should fine more, have more power to punish people", and I shiver whenever I hear these things. Because people seem to forget what happens when we give too much power to the government, to the security forces, when we surrender our freedoms so easily. But in fact people do not think, and that is why it is being and it will be so easy to institute all the abuses they want.</p>

        <p>This is our country's big problem. I think that from the beginning our government's approach to the pandemic was disastrous, however often they consider us as an example. The only way we had to control the outbreaks we had was total confinement, and that's not control, it's closing the country and delaying the problem. As soon as doors open... out of control. </p>
<p>From the beginning, an endless number of "experts" circulate through the corridors where decisions are made. Experts that no one knows who they are, what they know, what they say, but they are ubiquitous and influence politic decisions. These decisions are always hasty, late, out of context. But there is never a step back from the government once they are instituted, because there is a syndrome of arrogance that prevents the prime minister and his ministers from accepting that they were wrong. </p>
<p>Graça Freitas pities me, and she is nothing more than a puppet that the government uses to bring some "humanity" to the entire fight against the pandemic. Marta Temido has remained firm in her role, once again she is too arrogant and unable to communicate humanly with the people, and cannot build trust with her statements. I'm not even going to talk about the prime minister's posture. </p>
<p>At the stage we are now in, Portugal's next decisions will no longer be based on any basis for the fight against the pandemic, it will only be to follow and implement the totalitarian measures that other countries are already applying. That simple.</p>
<p>But anyway, this is already a very long statement about Portuguese politics, a topic that deserved a post for itself, we can't upset our friends who use this sub with this topic.</p>

        <p>It's not new either
 that the media is completely aligned with the speech. </p>
<p>There are some chroniclers who sometime raise questions, but unfortunately they are overwhelmingly linked to the far right and their discussion ends up getting lost in the midst of various delusions and accusations that do little to help people to read carefully what they are saying. Moderates dare not to comment for fear of being "cancelled". </p>
<p>News of uprisings in France won't reach Portugal unless it's impactful enough to be impossible to ignore.</p>

        <p>And also, thank you for this. I can’t thank you enough, as finally I find someone who actually has an idea of what’s actually going on here.

<p>In Portugal? No away!</p>
<p>Anyone who has an opinion contrary to the majority will talk among themselves but almost with fear, because any attempt to challenge the logic of any measure is seen as an affront to the process and you are immediately accused of being denial, conspiracionist, selfish and wanting to kill everyone around you. Also if you try to dissect any topic they will soon stamp you as anti-vaccines. The position of the people is completely extreme, for them, you either follow everything blindly or oppose everything like a revolutionary. There is no middle ground.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. Please know that you are not alone in what you are feeling. It does not matter if you disagree with some of the posts or even most of the posts here. We do not have the answers, but here  you are welcome to ask the questions that are ridiculed and ignored in most spaces. There are plenty of trolls that hang out here too, no doubt you will encounter them if you are here often enough.</p>
<p>I live in Australia and our government is still tip toeing around the issue of vaccine passports, I think this is mainly  because the vaccine percentage in our population is still too low (less than 10‰ of our population is fully vaccinated). They have raised the idea many times in the last year, and no doubt they will begin to implement the global agenda once they have more numbers and support to make it sustainable. Our military and government have openly reffered to the vaccine rollout as "war games". We are currently in winter here and 1/4 of the Australian population are forced into another 5 week lockdown. Many of us feel this is coercion or punishment for the non compliance with vaccines and the media has told us that vaccination is our ticket to freedom.
Try not to despair. Live your life and try to find joy and love. Tomorrow is not promised to any of us, live for today.</p>

        <p>I'm dead serious though OP. Understand when I say I am very very sorry for what you are about to go through. You have no idea. My wife and I were able to "predict" each step of the way in 2020 regarding masks and lockdowns. It's because we were aware of the documents that stated the dark ones intentions. Again I'm so sorry....I strongly advise against getting your second "dose", btw.</p>
