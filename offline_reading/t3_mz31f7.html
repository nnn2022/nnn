    <strong>Surveys: COVID-19 Perceptions and Role-Play [Repost]</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm hoping I could get your help with two distinct studies, both short; altogether, this should take you less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>First, as a favor to our funding university, you will complete a short 2-minute survey about your perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a second study, you will complete a role-play exercise about a social group meeting up during the pandemic. Anyone living in the United States who is at least 18 years old and has an understanding of the English language can participate in these studies.</p>
<p>Study Link: <a href="https://wcu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3adFtRLZuttNEvY">https://wcu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3adFtRLZuttNEvY</a></p>
<p>Disclaimer (ethical/legal): This research was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board, and it was determined to be exempt from IRB oversight.</p>
<p>Your help is GREATLY appreciated! Feel free to comment with any questions or concerns you may have after you take the surveys and I'll be around to respond as much as possible. Thanks!</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>(P.S. I saw this subreddit had a flair for Academic Research and no explicit rules against posting surveys, but that flair wasn't available to me when I wrote this post so I used the next best option. Related, I see there is a rule about reposts that mentions a "long enough period has passed"; the tradition for social media research is to post every 24-48 hours to maximize reach [e.g. not only hear the input of people viewing Reddit at 12:00 on a particular Monday], and at the time I'm posting this it has been 4-5 days. If I'm breaking any unspoken subreddit rules by posting this, or misinterpreting the repost rule, certainly feel free to delete this post)</p></p>

        <p>Please remember that researchers such as th OP are the problem and they will use you to further manipulate the public.  DO NOT PARTICIPATE.  You might think you are helping but you are not. Researchers very often use their research for purpuses other than what they state and despite their use if the word 'ethics', that is not uncludes under ethics.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you've had some negative experiences with researchers in the past. Based on my interactions with others here and in similarly-themed subreddits, you're unfortunately not alone; some researchers have had ulterior motives to their projects and it's incredibly unethical for them to carry things out the way they have. However, I've taken the time to engage everyone that's commented with concerns such as yours, and they've all ultimately determined my intent to be non-malicious. Obviously those people don't speak for everyone, but I felt it worth noting. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not certain how you anticipate these results manipulating the public, but that's certainly not our intention. For one, the research team is made up of people with differing views on the severity of the pandemic and necessity of masks/etc., as well as differing political views. I enjoy working with diverse teams like this because it helps filter out individual biases any one of us may have when interpreting the results of the surveys. If you have any specific concerns, I'd be happy to address them; otherwise, I want to talk a little about the main ways bias creeps into surveys like these.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A good researcher seeks the TRUTH, and the only way surveys can show the truth is if they hear all of the voices on the subject. Some researchers (like the bad eggs you refer to) manipulate their studies through what's called "selection bias". That is, they don't seek out all the different voices on an issue, only the ones that support their pre-existing idea (and thus no longer represents the actual truth). However, the same problem can occur if the researcher does seek out those different voices but those voice opt against providing their input. For example, if only COVID-alarmists respond to the survey, then of course the results of the survey are going to reflect alarmist attitudes. By posting the survey to this subreddit and others like it, I am trying to hear and be receptive to the voices of the people here; however, it's ultimately up to the people hear to actually provide their voice so I can write a more accurate report. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Second, I agree that a lot of researchers use deception in their studies, but the reason is usually well-intentioned. The reason is that a lot of times in surveys, well-intentioned people will give the answers they think the researcher wants to hear (or if they hate the researcher, the exact opposite), rather than what they actual believe, and this can also skew the results (you may have heard this referred to as "social desirability bias"). So good researchers may use deception to conceal the true purpose of the study from participants for the duration of the survey, but reveal the true purpose at the end with a full explanation. The point of any research should be to pursue the truth, and thus that momentary deception is sometimes necessary to identify the truth. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I certainly can't make you trust me, and I completely understand why you wouldn't based on those experiences you alluded to. But I do hope you'll consider taking the surveys anyhow in light of what I just shared. If you have any further question/concerns, certainly let me know.</p>

        <p>Welp, there goes my record of successfully showing my intentions here are not malicious lol. Can't win 'em all. If you have any questions/concerns I can address, certainly let me know, but otherwise I hope you have a great day! :)</p>
