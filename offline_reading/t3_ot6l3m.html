    <strong>The Origins of Covidian Totalitarianism</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I have to express my gratitude to this community and every member of it, for helping me and the rest of the common sense world maintain a modicum of mental health over the last 18 months of global insanity and hysteria. </p>
<p>The title of this post draws inspiration from a German-American sociologist, Hannah Arendt, who wrote extensively about the development and mechanisms of Nazism in Germany and Bolshevism in the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>For one, I do not believe there was a nefarious clandestine plan for all of this to happen and to usher two-tiered societies, QR codes and absolute control. Everything was hectic and hastily improvised, but during this period several groups in our societies found a way to profit off the mass hysteria, ushering in the governmental nonsense we have to deal with today.</p>
<p>With the recent introduction of dystopian health passports in Europe and ever changing goalposts, I started wondering what is the impulse that is pushing all the countries to adopt such totalitarian measures and constantly invoke fear in population over a disease with a 99.98% survival rate whose symptoms remind of common cold. </p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk of various nefarious plans, the Great Reset, depopulation agenda etc. labeled as conspiracy theories by the MSM, however I believe that the actual mechanism behind all of this is much more complex and uncontrolled and that it derives from innate human fears which have been instrumentalized and manipulated over time by the never-stopping propaganda. It all essentially began with the mainstream media's relentless pursuit for the next big thing, the next sensation, the next shock and horror, in order to ramp up viewership and profit. In this selfish pursuit and blind sensationalism, our civilization and all norms of life began to erode. </p>
<p>When all of this began, with the famous "two weeks to flatten the curve", nobody expected that, within a year's time, we would have been talking of QR codes to go to shops, daily obsessive testing of perfectly healthy people, medical apartheid, forced vaccination or vaccination camps. With the first wave of media-fueled hysteria, governments around the world realized how easy it is to force compliance on people and increase their control over the population with nonsensical rules. However, my thesis is that the governments did not intend to overstep their boundaries and destroy societies for the sake of control (UK started with the laissez faire approach before going into full on 1984 mode) , but they did this because the population, or at least the loudest and most hypochondriac part of it, was clamoring for it. </p>
<p>This is not a question of conspiracy, but of a public policy choice terribly designed by the mass fear and hysteria. The situation we are living in is a product of power-hungry government technocrats, doctors and epidemiologists lavishing in their five minutes (or 18 months) of fame, and political leadership unable to draw a line and take responsibility for its actions. Over the last 18 months we have seen an increased trend of "scientification" of public policy, whereby all major decisions are thrown in the hands of unelected public health czars, which are only concerned with one single dimension in the society - whether the virus will spread or not. Well, if that is of any consolation, scientification of public policy is not a recent invention, it can be traced back to Nazi Germany and its laws on racial purity. </p>
<p>When all of this began, several important groups in our societies realized how to monetize it, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media (explained above)</li>
<li>Public health figures and various "experts" who enjoyed newly found relevance and constant media attention, some of them becoming celebrities with a cult-like following (this will certainly ring a bell for our U.S. users)</li>
<li>Government bureaucrats and technocrats who realized that there are no limits to their power once the population is scared enough and that this wave of hysteria has to be extended as much as possible. </li>
<li>Big profit hungry pharmaceutical companies with a history of drug safety disregard, fraud and false marketing (on the other hand, AstraZeneca offered to sell vaccines at a price it produces them, while Russians had a similar setup with Sputnik V). They came to the realization that by pushing their vaccine and fixing the situation (if mRNA can be classified as a vaccine at all) the cow would run dry. As such, in order to arrange valuable and renewing long-term vaccine supply contracts, a demand has to be artificially induced among the population. This is done in two ways, first by the media fueling hysteria and second, through heavily lobbied governments which are now instituting health passports and other forms of biofascist control in order to incentivize the population to keep on accepting and boosting. This can also explain why AstraZeneca receives so much slack around, while Sputnik is barely mentioned as an alternative and its approval sits with the European Medicine Agency for 5 months now despite overwhelming evidence of its safety and efficacy (BioNTech and Moderna were approved in mere three weeks). </li>
</ul>
<p>In this "war" against Covid, there is no sacrifice big enough and no win meaningful enough in order to scale down on restrictions or return to normalcy as the population simply does not want to accept it. All of this began as a product of the inherent human fear of the unknown and the government pandering to these sentiments due to simple electoral calculations. No one wants to take the blame for stopping the nonsense and returning the society to normal, only to suffer unpopularity at the next election cycle as the person "who killed grandmas" "threw us into chaos and overwhelmed hospitals". This also explains why some authoritarian countries, such as Belarus, Russia or Serbia, had a fairly relaxed approach to this hysteria, while most of the Western liberal democracies fell into a spiral of hysteria and "one upping" each other with nonsensical regulations to make people feel better and feel safer. All of this is done in the expectation that the voters, in the next cycle, would be grateful to the government for saving the grandmas and disregard the immense level of destruction and lives lost in the war against the invisible enemy. </p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that compliance has not been universal across the board in the West, as some societies have shown that swallowing nonsense has its limits (Anti-governmental protests in the Netherlands and Serbia), and governments have reacted accordingly, by hastily removing restrictions and making a path to normalcy with the understanding that its population does not subscribe to this hysteria, instead of constantly threatening and conditioning the population. </p>
<p>The governments, in the initial wave of fear and hysteria, wanted to appear decisive, strong and how they care about the population. After China instituted and showed the world that airborne viruses are to be fought with military and lockdowns, Italy followed suit and then the rest of the world imploded like a house of cards. </p>
<p>The degradation of society to a single topic and of human beings to a single vector, whether they are viral carriers or not or vaccinated or not, poses the gravest threat to our democracy and way of life as we know it. In essence, this will indicate how much are people willing to put up with nonsense and able to deviate from their nature due to an artificially inflated fear and panic, which have been the main accelerators of every fascist and totalitarian regime ever.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, TLDR: Virus appeared, media picked up on it and made it to be the next black plague, governments reacted the way they did because of electoral fears and in order to appear decisive in front of the hysterical population. No secret plan, no agenda.</p></p>

        <p>If this was no secret plan or agenda, then how the hell did so many governments come into locks-step together???<br>
I also don’t buy that all these leaders, media, pharma and “scientists” could all be this stupid with all the run around with this “Covid crap”, toxic shots, useless masks and everything else in the way they handled this mess.  I believe this was all very intentional.  These lying fucks know exactly what they are doing to us.  If “covid” did not happen, the passports would not be coming about, and this is the main plan.  Don’t you worry though, as scumbag Schwab himself tells us all “we will be happy” once this shit comes to pass.</p>

        <p>The reason is was hastily improvised is because it was plan B. Hillary was supposed to win in 2016 and start a war. The epidemic would come after. </p>
<p>They needed to use the virus instead to secure a Biden victory to get back on track.</p>
