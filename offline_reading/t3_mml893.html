    <strong>The straw that broke the camel's back</strong>
    <p><p>With EVERYTHING going on in the world right now and considering the financial oppression for decades, I truly believe the COVID-19 hysteria and lockdowns are on the way to break the masses psychologically.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s already had MAJOR real-world implications on every possible front, from depression and anxiety to rising suicides and homicides to a spike in extreme poverty and starvation around the world to civilians clashing with police and military personnel, all while the top 1% got richer than ever before.</p>
<p>Humans have a collective psyche and this is absolutely a war to destroy as many of us as possible.</p>
<p>But we will NOT give in!! We MUST fight back with everything we have! Every one of us needs to commit the time, energy, and resources to destroy our oppressors, permanently.</p>
<p>And if not for you, do it for your family and future generations. Humanity will look back at this time in history and see that it was the masses that held the REAL power all along. Do not give up and NEVER surrender! This truly is the fight of our lives.</p></p>

        <p>Six months ago my dental office didn't say shit and straight up ignored my comments on the rona. Last week both the hygienist and the dentist were full anti lockdown and anti our governor. The hygienist was so keen on my opinion and told me most of the patients feel the same way. It takes time for some people to wake tf up.</p>

        <p>The 0.1 percent decided to finally separate from the common folk to the absolute.  The problem is, they want to cut us off with all our money in THEIR pockets. Corona is quite simply a scapegoat to all of our troubles. They want us to focus on that while they take everything from everyone. Local businesses shut down by force and demolished, and the land is given to the corpos to make yet another Walmart or tesco or whatever, people being house arrested for no reason. </p>
<p>All to keep us blind and deaf. When we all find out what's truly happening it will be too late. The masses will be powerless, and the select few will become the most powerful people in human history. There has never been a time in whcih the classes were SO separated in such a drastic form. The poorest will have absolutely nothing. Not even their own body (the forced vaccination is a proof) while the richest have the most unimaginable and endless luxury and wealth. </p>

        <p>I'm not so sure about civil disobedience, in terms of things more than just not wearing masks outside. We're up against forces that aren't purely human in nature, they're moreso the end product of technology and social trends that have been going on for centuries. Stand against that in the open and you'll get knocked down and ostracized. </p>
<p>I think the key to surviving these times is focusing on your own mental and financial stability, and being a rock for people around you. Hysteria takes hold the strongest in people who have no one to turn to, you should make sure that those in your life are never in that situation. You should call out bullshit, but only when it's explicitly harmful and dangerous. Otherwise going with the flow, even when annoying is necessary to remain in a position of power/likeability needed to fight important battles.</p>

        <p>Depends on your profession, temperament, how much savings you have, how much things you are ready to give up etc.</p>
<p>Generally I'm not encouraging anyone to break the law. It's illegal.</p>
<p>And maybe there is no too much you can do, but still a lot of things you can "not to do".</p>
<p>Boycott all businesses requiring vaccine passports.</p>
<p>Don't wear mask when you don't have to.</p>
<p>Don't go to a places where you spend your money if they require wearing a mask, if it's not essential.</p>
<p>It may sound unrelated , but it's related. Don't sign up for online services that demand too much of your personal information. Pay in cash as much as possible. If you bold enough, give up your smart phone, and get a dumb one. </p>
<p>Don't agree to participate in any online substitute for a real event. Say no to online concerts, online education, online festivals etc. etc.</p>
<p>Don't fly until all these draconian rules are in order. (I know it's hard, but these companies needs us more then we them, if they loose money they will surrender)</p>
<p>If you know a lawyer, ask about your rights you still have, and if you have this option sue any business that discriminated them. </p>
<p>Cooperate with people you know and trust.</p>
<p>Etc. etc,</p>

        <p>the only way to defund and defeat the democratic party/big tech alliance is to buy and use crypto.</p>
<p>without the ability to print infinite money, governments have a limited budget, and dont have the funds to implement mass scale insane dystopian policies.</p>
<p>crypto is the only thing that takes that power away from them</p>

        <p>That's where I have to disagree with you. Cryptocurrencies are easily trackable and can be disabled or confiscated with technology. Yes, they have a hard limit to the number of coins available, but even in its purest form, cryptocurrencies are a <em>copy</em> of the original decentralized, naturally-limited store of value: gold and silver. Even Satoshi Nakamoto says Bitcoin is a digital version of gold, and that means itâ€™s a copy. There's really nothing like the real thing and gold and silver have been used in civilization for 6,000 years.</p>

        <p>many cryptos are not traceable. BTC is, monero, ethereum, bitcoin cash are all non traceable (if you choose to).</p>
<p>satoshi said bitcoin was peer to peer cash, not "digital gold". digital gold doesn't compete with central banks, but peer to peer cash does. physical gold cannot easily be be used for everyday payments, so it cannot compete with central banks, but certain cryptos (not BTC) can be use for everyday payments, and can replace central banks.</p>
<p>pretty much every scenario where cryptos can fail has already been explored by some of the smartest people on earth, and the conclusion is that it cannot. read this, it covers every single scenario <a href="https://safehodl.github.io/failure/">https://safehodl.github.io/failure/</a></p>
<p>there's nothing wrong with gold, but gold can easily be stopped by central bankers and does not pose a threat to them, whereas cryptocurrencies cannot be stopped by them, and will inevitably eventually replace them.</p>

        <p>I do see the allure of cryptocurrencies, truly. However, it still doesn't change the fact that humans created them. Gold and silver were created from supernovas and neutron stars, not humans. Plus, cryptocurrencies have really only been around for a very short time in all of human history. Gold and silver have been here long before any of us were born and will be here long after any of us are gone. And finally, when currencies are officially reset as they are going to be in the next few years (see the Basel III regulations taking effect June 28, 2021), governments use gold as a peg to determine the value of the underlying currency. Cryptocurrencies simply don't have the history backing them up, so who really knows if they will survive a systemic shock of this magnitude.</p>
