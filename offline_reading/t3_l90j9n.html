    <strong>Are there any pro-maskers that value anti-maskers right to free speech..?!?</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking about this while going to bed last night.. </p>
<p>I completely support pro-maskers right to defend their belief system regarding their position on wearing a mask, but I cannot remember anytime a pro-masker has ever expressed support for anti-maskers to express their opinions. Pro-maskers almost always angrily jump to the extreme opinion of equating not wearing a mask with a preventable death. In other words, we are murderers for not acquiescing to their worldview. And even worse, we are being censored in nearly area of the internet and in real life. Never is their a calm sensible discussion, it's always straight to the blame-game. This cluster-fuck of a world everyone is being forced to live in is all our faults since we can't wear a mask. If we would have worn a mask, then all of these problems would be over. So we are being irrationally blamed for death and a shitty world all while being prevented from speaking our opinions. I don't know about you guys, but I've been in several abusive relationships years prior, and I'm getting de javu regarding this whole mask thing.</p></p>

        <p>Anyone still wearing that shit probably lack critical thinking skills, or are SO TERRIFIED of perceived social stigma that they can’t seem to break away and wake up. </p>
<p>It’s sad. But hold the line! You can make a difference by adhering staunchly to your principles.</p>

        <p>So I guess I'm a pro masker as I have no problem with masks and I wear one in stores because I feel it's helpful, but I joined this sub because I am against the lockdowns and I am very sick of the holier than though people who brag about how excessive they are with mask wearing (in the car, drive through, on walks, running etc) or who act like martyrs bragging about how they "haven't even left their house since March" to seem better than people who go out more often. To virtue signal. It all makes me so angry. I'm also not normally anti vax but I will NOT be getting a brand new rushed vaccine with so many negative side effects and worry for my family who plan on getting it. I recently tried to explain to my Dad the issues with it and he just brushed it off.</p>
<p>I'm actually curious of the anti mask mindset. Masks absolutely suck, and they make me feel miserable to always see instead of faces, and I even once had to deal with having a panic attack in one in the store (I have anxiety issues) and I hated knowing if I took it off to help get through it, even in the back of an empty aisle, I'd get yelled at. Mask nazis don't give a shit, they think in black and white. Just like that situation with the poor little girl on the plane. I believe they help slow the spread, but if someone thinks different and does not want to wear one and stays 6 feet from me I don't care. You do you. I would NEVER be a jerk to them and berate them like I see so many people doing. It's rude. I value opposing opinions, I 'm always keen to listen to the other side, but I understand what you are saying because I am very quiet about my views lest I be branded crazy. Because people do not want to hear outside their echo chamber, especially the far far left, which I have slowly moved from to a more middle road.</p>

        <p>Very well said . I agree with your take on how they see black and white : Mask:good No Mask: bad is how everyone sees the world now . I too will listen to any opposing opinions and not shush them or be a jerk. Thanks for your contribution to this post</p>

        <p>I’m a pro masker (but anti lockdown) and I really don’t care whether other people are wearing a mask or not. It’s not healthy to be living your life so worried about what other people you barely know are doing.</p>

        <p>In all seriousness this is the answer and attitude everyone should be taking. It's no one else job to govern or dictate what people wear, how they wear it or when and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>If you don't wear a jacket outside when it's minus 50 degrees, you will probably die soon. I am going to recommend a jacket. Several times. Passionately because even if you're a far left wing liberal that hates America, I do not want you to die. However I still need to go outside in minus 50 degree weather, so I'm wearing a jacket. </p>
<p>The undeniable fact that severe cold weather will kill a human isn't fact checked by the media, the branches of social media government. it's not marred in inconsistent details and rules that only this or that will kill you. If you go outside in minus 50 degree weather while crouch down below 5 feet, you will still die. </p>
<p>If you go outside in minus 50 degree with temperatures and don't make it home by 10pm curfew, you will still die. It will not suddenly *gasp* and say "damn I missed him by that much!"</p>
<p>When a person dies in severe cold weather the hospital does not get a financial incentive, nor are the tests to confirm cause of death marred with 50% false positives. It really wouldn't matter if I had terminal cancer and went outside in minus 50 degree weather, I would have died from freezing to death. </p>
<p>If I had Covid at the time I died in minus 50 degree weather, without a jacket, in today's society, I would have died of Covid-19. </p>
<p>Clown world.</p>
