    <strong>More misinformation from the vaxxed</strong>
    <p><p>My friend is “fully vaccinated” (2 shots moderna, been the full time between shots and after them) and was trying to convince me to take the shots too. She told me that it would make her immune system better at handling EVERYTHING, not just covid but colds and the flu and things like it. </p>
<p>Anyways, now she has a cold. Could be covid but ironically, she’s distrustful of testing so she won’t get one. </p>
<p>I wanna know who told her she would be immune to everything if she got this vaccine. She’s been telling me I have been misinformed to <em>not</em> get it but it seems like she had some bad info herself that made her get it. </p>
<p>Seems like the censorship only runs one way.</p></p>
