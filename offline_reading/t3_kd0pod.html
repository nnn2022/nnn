        <p>Good, I hope they win! Whereas my priest just sent me a letter telling me not to come to church unless I wear a mask and wear it exactly the way he says we should.</p>

        <p>That's so sad. Our priest was calling people out for unlocking the doors last Sunday after mass had started and we were at "capacity". Which is 15% of actual capacity and no one is anywhere near each other. I was really worried he was going to then point out my entire maskless family in his frustration with people breaking the rules, but thankfully he didn't mention the masks. Dodged that bullet for another week...</p>

        <p>Sounds like mine, we have to sign up the week before to come or else they won't let us in the church. It's sad we have to worry about being thrown out or publicly shamed at mass now, this is so not what the religion is supposed to be. Hopefully they leave you alone!</p>

        <p>Yes, we have to register each week as well. And they were pretty lenient with people if they forgot to register and just showed up. But since the province lowered the amount of people who can attend, again, they're not letting anyone in if they haven't signed up or if they show up late. The priest obviously doesn't like it any more than we do, but he does want the limit followed for numbers or the province may shut the churches down altogether again. Such a sad situation we find ourselves in. Definitely not what Jesus would want happening in the Church. ðŸ˜¢</p>
