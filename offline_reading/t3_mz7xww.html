        <p>No, and I've been calling this shit out since they started pushing this overburdened health care bullshit. </p>
<p>~14.5 billion people, ~800 patients in ICU, ~600 COVID related</p>
<p>They're really trying to tell me thats even to completely overrun our health care system? And if it is, that says more about how faulty our public health care system really is than COVID</p>

        <p>If that timeline is real, I suggest everyone in Canada GET OUT ASAP. I don’t know how but just do it. Get on a plane and fly somewhere open to other countries, or get a boat or something and sail to another country. Anything you can. I have an awful feeling about Canada right now. Like they’re about to become the most dystopian country in the world over covid, other than maybe Germany</p>

        <p>Due to the arms/$/power of the USA, Canada was the primary target for infiltration (southern side's too much chaos and arms), and how ironic Castro's son is overseeing this disaster. The Canadians used to be the sane ones, laughing at us in the USA. Now we're all in bad boats going down -- but theirs seems to be going down faster.</p>

        <p>The military was already used in Quebec last year for long term care homes.</p>
<p>I don't see this as being a check for the military point in the checklist.</p>
<p>If it came to enforce stay at home order and military patrols on the streets, then yes that's crazy. But right now it's not something we haven't seen last year!</p>

<p>“An aboriginal society must specify the area that has been continuously used and occupied…the aboriginal right of possession is based on the continued occupation and use of traditional tribal lands since the assertion of Crown sovereignty.” </p>
<p>– a quote from the Supreme Court of Canada’s Delgamuukw decision (1997). </p>
<p>a question here could be ... asking everyone in time and space ... is it a morally correct behaviour of this crown</p>
<p>( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia… ) to assert sovereignity over territories what have been known to be the traditional territories of indigenous nations ? </p>
<p>who gives this "supreme court of canada" the authority to demand of indigenous nations a proof of their connection to their traditional territories ? who is this crown what is supposed to be responsible for all this enormous and tedious work demanded from indigenous nations ? </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_British_Columbia</p>
<p>thinking along the lines of ... from where does a crown draw its authority ... a crown what is after all the legalese complications made around it ... still a person, a human being believing to be a monarch ... believing to be appointed to govern over other human beings ... </p>
<p>and this line of thinking leads me to the speculation or guessing that the monarch draws its powers, its authority from the continuos belief and admiration the fellow human beings invest into its person, its function as a monarch </p>
<p>lucky me i am born in a space without monarchs </p>
<p>so i feel able to continue this thought experiment : </p>
<p>what if the human beings who identify themselves as citizens of the province of british columbia would recognise the legal structure of this province as centered around </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</p>
<p>and "the assertion of Crown sovereignty" ... and as a following consequence of this recognition would want to spare the indigenous nations living in this area since before the arrival of the type of human beings claiming land to be under "Crown sovereignity" ... </p>
<p>spare the indigenous nations from having to deliver proof of their traditional way of live towards a "supreme court of canada" ... an institution the indigenous nations of this area have never given any kind of authority </p>
<p>similar as they have never given this crown </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</p>
<p>any authority to rule over them ...</p>
<p>of course i am perhaps deluded or ignorant in these matters ... but if it would be correct that the indigenous nations today wishing to exercise full sovereignity over their </p>
<p>traditional territories what are claimed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</p>
<p>to be under "crown sovereignity" ...</p>
<p>then perhaps the citizens of the province of british columbia could if they wanted ... consider diverting their support away from </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_British_Columbia</p>
<p>who is also the one human being who heads</p>
<p>( sits at the top ) </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_British_Columbia</p>
<p>such a diversion of emotional and moral support / admiration / feeding powers to authority ...</p>
<p>could find its simple expression in a wish to change</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act_(British_Columbia)</p>
<p>and consequently also </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada</p>
<p>( i believe this mentioning of stuff via wikipedia links saves me from being accused to meddle with the internal affairs of a foreign nation ... switzerland where i live is just in these days tightening its counter-terrorism laws ... but anyway ... all i am doing here is talking </p>
<p>about the psycho-dynamic flows of how authority to rule gets its powers from and how to possibly divert such powers via using the legal frameworks those have set up claiming "crown sovereignity" of the areas the province of british columbia claims to have the power of supremacy ?</p>

        <p>oh i guess i messed it up here a bit ... playing the idiot ... or more probably being the idiot ... smile ... so the topic is ... could be ... constitutional reforms initiated by the citizens of the province british columbia ... with the intention to free the indigenous nations </p>
<p>of being opressed by "the supreme court of canada" what draws its self-given authority via "the assertion of Crown sovereignty" ... </p>
<p>reading trough </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada</p>
<p>reveals that to get the crown concept removed from it would require "the unanimous consent of all the provinces plus the two Houses of Parliament." </p>
<p>what leads me to </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada</p>
<p>"Members of the two houses of Parliament must also express their loyalty to the sovereign and defer to her authority, as the Oath of Allegiance must be sworn by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seats." </p>
<p>as if that was not a pretty solid construction to make sure the crown would not be abolished by the members of parliaments who have sworn oaths of allegiances to the very person ... allegiance to a human being ... to point that out ... which is referred to as "the sovereign" </p>
<p>the whole thing gets even more fortified when looking at </p>
<p>one of the two houses of parliament </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada</p>
<p>"The Senate of Canada (French: Sénat du Canada) is the upper house of the Parliament of Canada. The Senate is modelled after the British House of Lords and consists of 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister.[1]" </p>
<p>making me think that for a constitutional reform to be sucessfull in removing "the crown" / "the sovereign" ... the whole monarchy part ... it would need the unanimous consent of the members of the senate of canada what have been given their membership in this house of parliament </p>
<p>by one human being ... the </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada</p>
<p>who is impersonating representation of </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament</p>
<p>oh ... and to embark on a side trip here ...</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_of_the_Canadian_sovereign</p>
<p>says: </p>
<p>"Since 1953, the sovereign's style and titles in Canada are, in English:</p>
<p>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.[2][3]" </p>
<p>which is actually so very interesting when one thinks of all this "doctrine of discovery" and "european supremacy" and "christian supremacy" ... all these </p>
<p>super-self-overestimations ... plus the whole history of colonialism and european empires plagueing harassing dominating </p>
<p>i dont know ... 50 to 75 percent of all lands where human beings have been and are still living ... but back to this title thing ... what reveals exactly all of this sickness ...</p>
<p>one person, one human being ... </p>
<p>who is called "the sovereign of canada"</p>
<p>wishes to be adressed as </p>
<p>appointed to this position of being the sovereign over all canada ( or all the human beings who identify themselves as canadians ? ) </p>
<p>by </p>
<p>"the Grace of God" </p>
<p>she also wishes to be given the position of </p>
<p>"Defender of the Faith" </p>
<p>so here we have all laid out ... the whole source of the powers comes from this oaths of allegiance the members of parliaments are sworn into as well as from the members of canadian armed forces, human beings who are handling weapons for canada </p>

        <p>in times where abolishing police and army has become an idea more and more people begin to believe to be a real option </p>
<p>( me too ... i would love to see a reality without courts/police/army/prisons ) </p>
<p>its helpfull to know that in a monarchy, where the human being who is calling her-/himself "the sovereign" demands every human being living under its rule who is handling weapons to defend the governements and or the interpreters of laws ideas of what is okay and what not ... <br>
she demands of all members of parliaments as well as all members of police and army to take an oath of allegiance to her <br>
and she believes that "the grace of god" made her to be "the sovereign" over all people who indentify themselves as canadians ... and if that was not enough ... she also demands to be adressed as "Defender of the Faith" <br>
so ... me feeling real crazy right now, like what am i doing here ... but lets get on with it ... this whole construction is pretty solid ... interweaving christian religion with domination powers of one human being positioning itself as having the authority to rule over millions <br>
of human beings ... and this all happening today ... in 2020 on the occupied space what i might call ... if that is correct ... turtle island <br>
but even when this whole constitutional reform thing looks to be a pretty heavy task ... what could be even more important ... is for this to be dismantled mentally ... to go trough it step by step ... see the flaws and faults in it from a position of a human being who does not <br>
agree with the concept that one human being should be given the powers to rule over millions of fellow human beings ...</p>
<p>there might be other ways how hundred thousands or millions of people could express an eventual disapproval <br>
of the concept of a sovereign appointed by the grace of god defending the faith ... a concept what basicly puts everyone identifying as canadian into a place of being ruled over by a human being who believes to be appointed by a christian god <br>
there might be a multitude of ways how millions of human beings could express their eventual unhappyness with being subjected to such a state of being ruled over by a monarch ... especially as that monarch has never attempted to revoke any of that "assertion of Crown sovereignty" <br>
what is causing indigenous nations to spend a lot of effort documenting their relationship to their traditional territories ... </p>
<p>like ... i have been in sunday school of the christian style ... and i remember ... "say only one word and my soul shall be healty" <br>
"sprich nur ein wort und meine seele wird gesund"</p>
<p>so </p>
<p>if she ...this one person, this human being who claims to be appointed by the grace of the christian god, defending the faith in this christian god...</p>
<p>if this one human being wants the soul of all human beings to be healty <br>
all human beings who live on turtle island ...</p>
<p>than she speaks that word what takes away the "assertion of crown sovereignity"</p>
<p>as clearly no one can truly be healthy in the soul when one is being dominated by an other human being <br>
so even when constitutional reform seems to be a heavy task ... there are still petitions where millions of people could if they wanted ... write their names into a list to express their willingness to end this reign from this crown concept, end this monarchs reign as well as <br>
have no next monarch ...but wish for the nation state of canada to give up its confrontational domination strategy of colonizing indigenous nations bribing them with billions of money what has been promised in exchange of oil, gas, wood,weapons etc. by global investment companies <br>
a simple expression of disagreement ... like ... an anti-thesis to the oath of allegiance to the monarch ... </p>
<p>an oath to a future canada what respects all indigenous nations original territories and their full and undisputed sovereignity on it <br>
a future canada what does not demand any proof from any indigenous nation but is a canada what gives thanks to the indigenous nations for being allowed to make use of some of the lands on turtle islands for those who identify as canadians <br>
despite all the legalese and most complicated encapsulated thousands of pages of laws and laws in several layers of interconnectedness ...</p>
<p>the raw primal magic what is applied in the colonizing ressource grabbing the earth and the human beings exploiting enterprise called <br>
nation state of canada ... this primal raw magic is simple:</p>
<p>set up a human being at the top of the structure ... let her demand all members of parliament and members of police and army to swear allegiance to her ... let her demand to be adressed as appointed by god <br>
and laugh all the way to the bank while the ones who are at the bottom of this set up structure are trying to puzzle the pieces together how to get rid of this colonial empire structure <br>
i guess there are a multitude of varieties how to dismantle this oppressive structure ... how to free indigenous nations of "assertion of crown sovereignity" ...<br>
and all of them different paths are important expressions of ...i or we do not want to live under the rule of an other <br>
human being ... i or we want to live in harmony with the fellow human beings which are neigbhours to us ... i or we wish for our neigbhours to be free from being ruled from above by a sovereign they never have sworn allegiance to</p>
