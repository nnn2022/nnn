        <p>&rt; "If we had not been told that there was an epidemic in the country, you  would not have known there was such an epidemic and you would not have  done anything about it," he said emphatically. "The fact that this issue  runs all day in the media inflates it beyond its natural dimensions. If  black death had raged here, as in the 14th century, you would not have  had to follow the situation in the news, the bodies would have piled up  in the streets. We were not and we are not in this situation today." </p>
<p>That sums it up!</p>

        <p>This is great! The only thing I didn't like was the recommendation concerning masks, but at least that was only something he'd recommend, and for high-risk groups.</p>
<p>&rt;I would also ask children and young people to take off their masks. Of course, it is impossible to force a child to take off a mask, but proper information will do the job."</p>
<p>Is mask wearing normalised to this extent in Israel? Are children scared to remove them? Doesn't sound good.</p>
