    <strong>Post any weird events surrounding the virus in this thread that made you see this virus and response to the virus for what it was.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm making an archive of all of the virtue signalling, government overreach, weird stories, false positives and local governments admitting to using PCR cycles over a 30+ threshold. I will archive everything on archive.org. I foresee a documentary about lockdowns, bad response to the virus, etc. in the future but as of now, I would like to look at what is publically accessible that could wake people up about the plandemic.</p></p>

        <p>for me, the changing point was the vaccine, not so much the virus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once the vaccine became available, things just didn't align anymore and it became very clear there was an agenda that wasn't humanitarian.</p>

        <p>my opinion on Covid itself hasn't changed since early 2020, in terms of risk or concern.  </p>
<p>i do think there's more clear evidence that supports that its man-made and leaked from a lab. but knowing that doesn't change my opinion of Covid.</p>

        <p>When I realized that all these death rates that the media was constantly spitting out was actually people dying WITH covid and not FROM covid. I remember early stages of the lockdown Los Angeles county did a big announcement that they had their first covid death and he was only 17 y/o and absolutely no one was safe!  Yeah the poor kid died of a drug OD and they just happened to run the pcr test on him which is sooooo accurate and got back a positive covid result and so lo and behold he was the first covid death. When I got that bit of background info it was very clear that things werenâ€™t exactly as they seemed.</p>

        <p>Well, my story wont be much help then. Its neither my awakening, because I never bought into any of it, but it was also seen by a whole society and most people kept sleeping.</p>
<p>Place Germany, time roughly March 2020.</p>
<p>Actors:</p>
<p>Dr. Drosten - "Top-Virologist" of the CharitÃ©, Coroan-PCR-Test inventor and government counselor , who already predicted the swineflu to be the worst disease of all time.</p>
<p>Dr. Wodarg - Former Epidemiologist, Politican and Transparency Chairman. Who called out the swineflu hoax and started the EU-commision that looked into (and discovered) the fraudulent behaviour surrounding the swineflu.</p>
<p>What happend:</p>
<p>Dr. Drosten called this the worst pandemic of all times. Millions will die. Media heavily features him, he is the german Fauci. Despite his wrong predictions in prior pandemics (he literally said the same things about swineflu as he said about Sars-Cov2) and massive conflict of interrest.</p>
<p>Dr. Wodarg came out a bit later with a short viedo-clip in which he stated that when something like that happens, the Virologists tend to overreact. He explained it with simple to understand psychologic concepts, like "they feel great getting all the attention, being usually stuck in the laboratory...". He didnt mention conspiracies, he didnt mention ill-intent, just people going a little over board with all the virus-panic and that people shouldnt be too scared of the virus.</p>
<p>This triggered MSM hard. There was a smear campaign throughout germans media-outlets which mostly revolved around calling him a conspiracy-theorist.</p>
<p>This is still my most rememberable "you are all insane" moment. So, most people now only know him as a crazy conspiracy theorist, when a) he never (at that time) made any conspiratorial claims and b) shit, look at that mans history... he is precisely the expert for this shit. He is an Epidemiologist who worked in that field for decades. Then he was a parliament member for almost a decade whos biggest feat was the EU-Investigation into the fraudulent swineflu "pandemic". Then he was a chair-man of the biggest institution trying to fight corruption....</p>
<p>I really, sincerely, with all my powers can not for the life of me comprehend how instead of listening to this Expert you would be running a smear campaign, cancel him, silence him. It is so far beyond me...</p>
<p>But worst part is, it worked. If I mention his name to the sheep, they either never heard of him or only know that he "is a conspiracy theorist", they hardly even know the basic facts of the mans vita...</p>

        <p>I think the way they executed this all went nicely in their eyes, tell people that they're locking them down for 2 weeks to stop the spread but actually planned on what could be months long in some areas. Now we're stuck with a culture obsessed with testing, masking, and v@xxing. Parents are sending their children to school in masks and some schools are actively testing students.</p>
