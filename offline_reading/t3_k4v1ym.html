    <strong>A country that lost many lives to gain freedom is now giving up it's freedom to "save lives".</strong>
    <p><p>Listen, I don't think the other side is bad people. I completely understand where they're coming from; the messaging from the institutions behind this is well constructed and easily digestible.</p>
<p>The problem is not that we have a country of bad people. Our problem is a country of stupid, unintelligent people. Those who were born and lived their lives in peacetime and have never had to take risks or make decisions. These people are especially prone to propaganda and fall time and time again for the pathos-infused messaging directed at them.</p>
<p>That's why the older people are heavily against this all. They know they are in their last years and don't really want to be saved in the first place. I'm convinced there is no fate worse than working and raising a family your whole life and finally reaching a point where you can just do whatever the hell you want - and be forbidden. It's true that the elderly face much higher risks than the rest of us. But they will gladly accept the risks if it means having autonomy. That's why they detest being placed in a home, they want to get out. They want freedom. And in the name of their lives, their freedom has been stolen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you look at the younger generations - unless you're morbidly obese or have an array of unfortunate ailments, you are at virtually no risk. "Long Covid", and especially Covid itself, is not something that anyone under the age of 40, or even up to the age of 60, should have any worry about. And yet those are the people fighting for the lockdowns. They have never made decisions or taken risks in their lives, and this is the result. Bad decisions and no risks. </p>
<p>This is the result of stupid generations. Governors and leaders only have as much power as the people give them. If we want change, we need to not look to the governors, but at the people.</p></p>

        <p>You know what's great about what you said? </p>
<p>First off, I live in a very "freedom loving" part of the USA if you will. Almost everyone is wearing masks, I see maybe 10 people a day without one. </p>
<p>Most of those 10 people are older, by older I mean over 65. </p>
<p>On the flipside, there is a special place in hell for a Mother who puts a mask on their toddler and or baby.</p>

        <p>Hit the nail on the head. It’s incredibly sad to witness this unfold, because these people (advocating for vaccines and lockdowns) ARE good people who believe it’s for a great benefit. </p>
<p>But, as you outlined, we have lived in peace for a long time. And as such, it’s not even in the realm of possibility for most of these folks to consider that evil people want to do evil things to most of us, and really, for no reason at all. </p>
<p>I stick with the analogy of a cake when looking at life at large - there’s many layers to a cake. There’s many layers to understanding life as it is. On the upper most layer, you have your day to day experiences. Most people never really make it past this first layer. </p>
<p>As you dig beneath the surface, you learn of abstract concepts like quantum physics, and beyond that, the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Somewhere beneath the surface lays the evil we’re seeing. And unfortunately, most of us simply either don’t have the capacity to, or are simply too ignorant to peer beyond the surface.</p>

        <p>I used to empathize with these people, but the truth is they aren't the innocent victims we would like to believe they are. It's one thing to be brainwashed but it's another when a person wishes death upon others and that's what they are doing. Like any psychological manipulation it's almost extremely difficult or even impossible to convince someone to something that they don't already possess the propensity for and these people would celebrate your public execution. Not all of them but far too many. Our society is filled with sociopaths who will sacrifice as many as it takes to sustain the current delusion.  They hate themselves and everyone else and the pandemic has served as the perfect solution. As much as they profess how we need these measures to stop the spread, they could no  longer function if the spread actually stopped. This is the frightening truth,.</p>
<p>I left pity for these people at the door about a month ago. When treating people with these types of disorders the worst thing you can do is sympathize with them. It bears the same results as treating an addict. You have to confront them with the truth and stand firm.</p>
