    <strong>The main concern I have at this point is this will be a repeat occurrence. What do you think?</strong>
    <p><p>That this will be a repeat occurrence and the economy and society will permanently shift towards a distanced, paranoid society that spends excessive time online. </p>
<p>What made me start to think this was WHO's recent backtracking and sneakily changing their definition of herd immunity. </p>
<p>What's to stop this all from repeating in 2, 3, or 6 years if anyone pro lockdown is refusing to acknowledge their mistakes? If everyone remains ignorant of the truth, there will be enough cultists to enable these megalomaniacs.</p>
<p>Have any pro lockdowners acknowledged they fucked up yet?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>It will most certainly happen again especially because people love living in fear.  </p>
<p>As much as a $2000 check would have been nice it was never gonna happen.  People are all crying and bitching about it.  </p>
<p>Well you chose to lock down because of your irrational fear.   Now live with it.</p>

        <p>Not just for this. They are already planning how they can do this for things like climate change. They would have tried this before for something like that, but they didn't think people would be dumb enough to fall for it. Now that people have willingly thrown society off a cliff over a disease that's nowhere near as big a deal as the response suggests, the door is open for abuse by any authoritarian seeking an excuse.</p>

        <p>Severely concerned. We have set the precedent that irrational fear is a reason to shut down society. I want vaccine to be successful. Unfortunately it will provide a fig leaf for doomers to justify their actions.</p>

        <p>People think because their governments have shut down society, therefore it must be very bad. A lot of people have this mentality and blindly obey. They will definitely keep doing it for as long as they can get away with it. There are no repercussions. No one has made them terrified for their lives yet and people have the internet now so they are (mostly) comfortably complacent. Certain places will be noticeably more free than others and the cultists will continue complaining about them while people are miserable everywhere else.</p>

        <p>This will repeat.  One of the major points in the study forecasting the impact of climate change is an increase in infectious diseases.  Some of which will come from longer insect range and life cycle.</p>
<p>Something to think about,  in 1918 there was about 900 million people on the planet.  Today, over 7 Billion.</p>

        <p>I can see that happening. Already got the masses scared over a bad flu, all they gotta do is peddle propaganda for the common cold/flu and they can make <em>everyone</em> fear <em>all</em> cold/flu viruses as if a case of the sniffles, a mere cough or sneeze, is certain death.</p>

        <p>The Yellowstone supervolcano is the second largest in the world (I think) and is due to blow any day now (in geological terms).  I'd often wondered, over the years, how much warning we'd get if it did- how much would be detectable, and how much we'd be told.  Now that we know how people react in a crisis, I strongly suspect my first inclination that something was afoot would be when I found myself knee-deep in volcanic ash.  In all fairness, I don't read or watch current media anymore, so I don't know <em>how</em> they'd get word to me, but still.</p>
<p>What makes disease-blamed lockdowns... excuse me a moment.  I have typed those words and now feel an overpowering urge to punch myself.  Ah, that felt good.  Stinging, yet satisfying.  Anyway, what makes this so insidious is that isolating everyone indoors keeps them from being exposed to other, more... let's just say "benign" germs, and thus weakens the immune system, causing numbers to spike and making the next lockdown easier to push.</p>
