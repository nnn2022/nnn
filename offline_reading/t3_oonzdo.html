    <strong>Don't say you're wearing your useless cloth mask to protect others.</strong>
    <p><p>First off don't use other people as an excuse to wear a mask. Most people with a mask off are either vaccinated, unvaccinated or don't care about the virus anymore. These so called people who wear a mask for those maskless have been calling them vaccinated and unvaccinated maskless assholes. You don't care for those unmasked. You want to think that you do, but in reality you're quick to take a photo of someone not wearing a mask and think they are some diseased rodent. </p>
<p>Do everyone who's unmasked a favor and please unmask yourself. You're not doing it for us, you're also scared of the Delta Variant and you think your cloth mask will protect you. Just say it you're much better off being honest and telling people the real reason why you're wearing a mask instead of saying you "do it to protect others" then follow up with "because I don't know their vaccination status".</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs clear that when you wear a mask for yourself, it means you are afraid of something (virus, CCTV, cops and so on). But when you wear a mask "to protect others", it means you are fucking hero who don‚Äôt care on yourself but so much care on others. I.e. you don‚Äôt more need rescuing someone from fire or sharks or criminals. Just wear a mask and you‚Äôre already hero! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™üèºüåü</p>
