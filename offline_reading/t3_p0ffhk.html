<p>"When the fire isn’t raging, it’s not like Americans are known for being careful about what goes into our bodies. We pop ibuprofen like M&amp;Ms, ignoring the fact that too much can cause harm. We think nothing of mixing acetaminophen with alcohol, although that practice can be dangerous for regular drinkers."</p>
<p>That's exactly it. We are the people who have NOT been doing that. If you've been doing this, Celia, maybe that's to blame for your weak immune system, not "anti-vaxxers."</p></p>

        <p>The one thing this confirmed to me, that I suspected for a long time, is that this seems normal to so many people because they are already on several pharmaceuticals. I don't take any at all so it's a much bigger leap for me. I know the effects of pharma and see them as something you only use if you need them to stay alive or are in intense pain. My approach has always been to let a headache or sickness run its course.</p>

        <p>It’s simple , all they have to do is show me a proven safe vaccine that both kills the virus &amp; stops the transmission of the virus. If they do that I’ll choose to take a jab for the greater good of society .</p>

        <p>Way to generalize there, Celia. </p>
<p>Even if this generalization were true, it still isn’t even close to the same. We all know the risks, short term and long term, of the thing she mentioned. We don’t know all the risks related to these new jabs. </p>
<p>Just another hit piece to make people look ignorant for not wanting to take the holy vaccines.</p>

        <p>I take medication for my severe asthma and that's it. Because if I don't, it is for sure a matter of time until I have a bad enough attack that will kill me. But, even if I did drink and even if I did mix it with oxy, I would do so knowing full well the risks and making the decision <em>without being coerced</em> and that does not automatically mean that someone else can try to force me to put something else in my body. </p>
<p>You see, this is like saying if someone is a prostitute, its okay to rape them if they tell you 'no'. After all, they had sex with those people for money, right? Any person that isn't a jackass would tell you that's not the case.</p>

        <p>Good point. That works when people say, "well you got the polio and MMR vaccines," too.</p>
<p>It also sets the bar so low. You need your asthma meds to stay alive. Most people (if any) don't need this vaccine to stay alive.</p>

        <p>Here's a great response to that:</p>
<p>mRNA (Moderna, Pfizer) and rDNA vectored (J&amp;J, AstraZen) vaccines send instructions to your cells to manufacture spike glycoproteins. NYT has very detailed articles explaining how each of the pseudo-vaxxes works.</p>
<p>Polio, TB and smallpox use either inactivated or attenuated whole virus/bacteria to teach your body to recognise the WHOLE pathogen and to mount an innate and adaptive immune system response.</p>
<p>For the first time in a very long time, I would even recommend that you use Wikipedia and its footnotes to get the peer-reviewed sources because these are old-fashioned ACTUAL vaccines.</p>

        <p>Typically people just want to believe MSM and have no ability to think for themselves </p>
<p>Here's one response I gave:</p>
<p>You have the freedom to do your own research at the NIH, CDC, NHC, and reputable universities like Johns-Hopkins and Harvard. They publish the research papers. I can't teach you how to read a research paper</p>
<p>You have to freedom to access those studies or let someone make your decisions for you.</p>
<p>I exercise those rights. But if you want to let someone make your decision for you, don't get ape-ish toward me for making my own decisions.</p>
<p>Just like I don't follow qanon conspiracies but I don't accept when others try to force other conspiracies as Q-anons.</p>
<p>You're welcome to make your assumptions about me though, I'll calmly tell you if you're right or wrong.</p>

        <p>Even then, using those as an example is grossly unfair. It would be like telling someone who isn't in to elective surgery "Well, you are circumsized". Just as with MMR and polio, its typically done as a child and you don't have much choice. It doesn't matter if you survived it relatively unscathed, it doesn't change the point, the simple fact of the matter is it's your body and the only person that has a say in what happens to your body is <em>you</em>. I've had people try to pull that on me, though, and were shocked as all get out that I have had <em>zero</em> vaccines and that I made it past the age of 5. </p>
<p>And it does set the bar extremely low. I on average have at least one full blown asthma attack a day and end up in the hospital several times a year. I don't take unnecessary medications, no one in my family does or ever has (hence my unvaccinated state) but I've experienced enough to know that I have to be on daily medications or it could be a lot worse. Even then, I dont take the "recommended" flu or pneumonia shot because I have yet to be convinced that it's necessary. </p>
<p>I was a presumptive case of COVID when it all started and I ended up in the hospital for two days for breathing treatments and supplemental oxygen, which isn't all that abnormal for me for a respiratory infection. If it didn't kill <em>me</em>, then I'm not worried.</p>

        <p>Just to be clear. I'm not the one using those as an example. I'm saying your response  could be applied to respond to people who say that. I wasn't sure if you were speaking directly to me or more generally about the people who say that.</p>
