    <strong>Anti-mask, Anti-FearPorn, &amp; Pro-Skepticism</strong>
    <p><p>As the mainstream media brings the reporting of supposed COVID-19 cases and deaths to increasingly pornographic heights on a minute-to-minute basis, I feel a pressing need to challenge the incredulous statistics on which this panic-inducing narrative relies.</p>
<p>There are too many discrepancies regarding the recording and publication, via mainstream media, of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
In addition to these discrepancies, incentives and guidelines are offered from multiple entities (CDC, Medicare to name two) that encourage, directly or indirectly, the inflation of cases and mortalities reported to the CDC and the media.</p>
<p>A recent analysis by a Dr. Genevieve Briand (Assistant Director of Economics Program) of Johns Hopkins University suggests critical accounting errors in the processing and publication of COVID-19 deaths:</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19</p>
<p>“Interestingly...the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading.” </p>
<p>This article presents her analysis of COVID-19 death as per mortality data provided by the CDC from 2014 - present, and strongly suggests that the total CIVID-19 deaths reported by the CDC are the result of erroneous, whether intentional or not, accounting methods. Note that Johns Hopkins pulled the newsletter just 4 days after publication.</p>
<p>According to a decades-seasoned physician, Dr. Annie Bukacek, achieving accuracy in certifying causes of death on such a massive scale as is currently being attempted for COVID-19 is impossible to achieve for many reasons. This is not, however, strictly in the case of certifying COVID-19 related mortalities, but also in certifying many varying causes of death.</p>
<p>Below is a link to the Illinois Public Health Director describing the outrageously flexible criteria for listing of a COVID-19 death:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/_5wn1qs_bBk</p>
<p>As related to COVID-19 mortality stats, “presumptive cases” - cases in which no lab testing of a patient was performed - are encouraged to be listed as a cause of death and added to the overall count reported to the public, based on a judgement call of likelihood alone. Again, these “presumptive cases” which are NOT confirmed, are added to the daily death count reported to the public. This is public information - here’s a link to a CDC memo on guidelines for certifying COVID-19 deaths to physicians/COD certifiers:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-1-Guidance-for-Certifying-COVID-19-Deaths.pdf</p>
<p>As far as “current case” statistics are concerned, I can personally attest that one can enter a clinic and be recorded as a “presumptive case,” and in the same week be tested negative for COVID-19. All the while, that presumptive case is added to the daily tally and posted in the mainstream media’s panic-inducing ever growing case-and-death-count meter. </p>
<p>Many states, if not most at this point, have for months included “presumptive cases” in daily new case as well as mortality statistics reported to the public. </p>
<p>Illinois Director of public health, very broadly defining qualifications for COVID Death:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/ljpHugKNcoI</p>
<p>The CDC document above certainly does NOT encourage accurate accounting of total deaths or total cases. Nor does the fact that hospitals are financially incentivized via Medicare to inflate COVID-19 cases, as even “presumptive cases” are included in the criteria for Medicare awards. This is also public information.</p>
<p>So despite the fact that certifying deaths caused by COVID-19 is essentially impossible to do with reliable accuracy on a large scale, we are being terrorized by media death tolls every day, or we are shamed if we decide to speak out against the fear-mongering.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that countless experts across multiple fields contest the legitimacy of this narrative, and despite the fact that their concerns are being muffled, their professional careers at risk, and their contesting voices of reason are being scrubbed from the internet, we’re told that to act out of anything besides the fear of spreading this virus is selfish, dangerous, and must be the inclinations of one without capacity for rational thought or empathy.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the CDC insists on guidelines and Medicare offers incentives that encourage the inflation of the COVID-19 case and death rates, despite the fact that seemingly overly generous criteria for the qualification of a COVID-19 death all but guarantees unreliable information dispersed for public consumption, we are told that we must be part of some lunatic tin-foil hat fringe group for seeing that information as unreliable. </p>
<p>This is not simply a matter of refusing to “trust science,” as many would so easily write it off. </p>
<p>This is in large part a matter of trust. Who we trust plays a major role in the decisions we make as a individuals and as communities.</p>
<p>The information being presented by the mainstream media and delivered by the CDC has not proven itself to be trustworthy, so it’s time we stop giving it the credibility and trust it has craftily taken from us. If we can do this, I believe we can start to reclaim the rest of what has been taken.</p></p>
