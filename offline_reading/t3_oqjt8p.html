    <strong>Analysing VAERS deaths (long read)</strong>
    <p><p>This is long and I'm posting it more to work out my own thoughts so be forewarned. It probably won’t match what you expect or want to hear so you may also reject it out of hand. I am vaccine hesitant and do consider the risk/benefit assessment to make them unsafe (with possible exceptions for the elderly/infirm). Also, my math may be wrong so feel free to point out any flaws.</p>
<p>So, according to the CDC's own rules:</p>
<p>&rt;<em>FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.</em> </p>
<p>This is the the primary excuse for having so many death reports for Covax.</p>
<p><em>Note: This could only work if other vaccines have</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>used the same standards for reporting.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>So far in the USA there have been 385 million doses administered.</li>
<li>0.8% of the US population dies each year.</li>
<li>Assuming even distribution (though I know its not, these are rough estimates) 3 million of those doses would be administered to someone who would die anyway this year, (1.5 million during the six months vaccine rollout).</li>
<li>The chance of them dying within a month of receiving a dose is 1 in 12.</li>
<li>So we should expect 125,000 people who die from disease, car accidents, homicide, etc. to have it happen within 1 month of getting a vax.</li>
</ul>
<p>If every death is reported (even if no clear connection exists) we should have 125,000 reports. Because of VAERS notorious under-reporting we seem to end up with &lt;5% of these.</p>
<p>This might be a plausible excuse IF the VAERS reports matched the leading causes of death: 20% heart disease, 20% cancer, 6% accidents, 5% respiratory, etc. and had no significant connection to the injections.</p>
<p>Looking through the VAERS death reports, this is <strong>not</strong> the case. There seem to be an excessive amount of reports related to strokes, clots and haemorrhages and a large number explicitly mention bad reactions to the vax and a progressive decline in health leading to death. There are also <em>very</em> few cancer deaths (less than 5%) and while some other major causes are included (there are several suicides, a car crash and even a plane crash) they are far below the proportions such causes typically account for. Also, it is not immediately clear that even things like the plane crash are unrelated as the pilot might have had a vaccine related event.</p>
<p><em>Note: I didn't read all entries but have examined at least several hundred, maybe more than 1000, and scanned the full set for specific terms and trends. I haven't seen any clearly fabricated troll entries and the clear majority seem to made by health professionals or reps of companies.</em></p>
<p>What is clear is that you CANNOT take 6000 reports as 6000 vaccine deaths. Many of them are much more likely to have other causes.</p>
<p>You also CANNOT say that “very few” of the 6000 are linked to the vaccine. Anyone trying to do that is really saying they have not been <strong>proven</strong> to have a link.</p>
<p>A very large number of reports have a very plausible link. Someone would need to do a proper analysis but if we say that 50% have strong alternate explanations and 50% have a plausible link, I think that would be fair. Let’s say half of the latter turn out to be true links - that would give about 1500 deaths linked to the vaccine.</p>
<p>People are focusing on 6000, or 12,000 or even 45,000. It isn’t necessary to look for higher numbers. Even 1500 deaths would be a massively unsafe vaccine that did not deserve an EUA. However, these would still only be a fraction of total deaths. Many of the VAERS reports are coming from doctors at hospitals, and a smaller amount (10%) seem to be coming from the vax companies in reports that refer to the dead as consumers rather than patients. There is a possibility this would cause double-entries (if doctors receiving such patents also report it) but I think any occurrences would be outweighed by under-reporting.</p>
<p>On the extreme side you could say that, if 4500 are natural and 1500 vax-related then the reported natural deaths are only 1/30 of the total expected (125,000), then perhaps total vax deaths are also (x30) or 45,000.</p>
<p>While this would match with the whistleblower claims, I would say that vax-related deaths are FAR more likely to be reported to VAERS. You would still have a potential range of 1500 to 45000. Globally (with 3 billion doses administered) this would be x8 the US total, so from these would make the range from 12,000 to 360,000. Some would say the lower number is an acceptable cost to curb the virus (some maniacs would probably even accept the higher figure). However, it hasn’t curbed the disease, the vaccines are being shown to have less and less effect, this is only short term-deaths, no informed consent was given, and in many situations people are still being forced to take an unsafe product.</p>
<p>The key weakness in the above is if the 1500 (1/4 of current VAERS reports) is an overestimate for US deaths. This is <strong>my</strong> conservative assessment not the <em>most conservative one possible</em> (which would be that any deaths without a clearly PROVEN link don't count - such a link may be impossible to provide). If you read through the reports and look at the number of cases where immediate reactions lead to sudden rapid declines in health, I think my assessment is fair but make up your own minds.</p>
<p>The key point is that you <strong>cannot</strong> take VAERS as a total of actual related deaths. There is a very vague, grey area where the natural coincidental deaths and the vax-related deaths need to be separated AND then you need to calculate the level of under-reporting. A secondary point is that you do not need huge numbers of deaths for this to be judged the most lethal vaccine roll-out in history. Whether or not it was justified in terms of saving more lives than it cost, these deaths raise serious legal and human rights questions regarding the issue of informed consent and mandated vaccination.</p>
<p>Be aware when discussing VAERS that exaggerating the death count or failing to take into account factors such as coincidental deaths will leave you open to counterattack that could destroy your whole set of arguments.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't read or digested the whole thing yet, but doses administered does not equal people since most people have had 2 doses (from pfizer or moderna).  So the first calculation of expected deaths is off.</p>

        <p>How so? As far as I can see its irrelevant whether they have had one or two. Whether a death occurs after a dose is the only relevant factor and as such you compare the number of doses (not complete vaccinations/number of people) to the expected deaths. If someone had two doses a month apart it gives them twice as much opportunity (a two month span) to have adverse reactions that would be reported.</p>

        <p>My thoughts are that: A) most people stopped reading when they reached 140 characters.</p>
<p>I think for the most part what you write makes some sense, analytically.  However, and it is something I see occurring with this, the total number of doses does not equate to the total number of people vaccinated.  Somewhere around 180M US people have been vaccinated ( at least 1 dose).</p>
<p>And I think this is the biggest problems about VAERS data: Some people love to claim that VAERS data is wholly inaccurate becaw any homeless person can submit adverse data</p>

        <p>Most of the deaths reported are within 24 hours of receiving the shot.  It isn't as if they are distributed as you would expect from random chance over that time period. Also, though 0.8% of the US population might die in a year, most of those are old people, so it's probably more helpful to consider the demographic risk of the deaths. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since they are vaccine adverse deaths being reported and not covid cases, there's no reason for anyone to report things like car accidents or being shot by a gun, which would also be part of the general death count.  In fact, it might just be better to compare how many deaths would be expected in a demographic of that cause within that window of time for better results.</p>

<p>This is not the case. If you read the VAERS reports you will clearly see that very few deaths are so immediate.</p>
<p>&rt;there's no reason for anyone to report things like car accidents or being shot by a gun</p>
<p>There are few accident reports but there are specific cases within VAERS where people have committed suicide via gunshot, or been killing after being hit by a truck and doctors reported the case because that's what they were supposed to do.</p>
