    <strong>This is not about a virus...</strong>
    <p><p>Lets face it. This is not about a virus, the lockdown or masks. This is about divide and conquer while the powers that be run around behind the scenes looting us, taking whatever they want while planning a future for you and your kids. </p>
<p>This is a process of elimination. A seperating of the wheat from the chaff. </p>
<p>People want to eat fast food, be obese, wear a mask, let them. Let them eliminate themselves from the equation. Save your energy for the real threat.</p></p>

        <p>A several hundred acre forest near me has still not reopened because they say they can't keep people apart. They plan to open in a few days, but you have to reserve a spot. They closed the restrooms in the visitor center and are instead providing portable toilets. I don't get any of it.</p>

        <p>I don’t get why these places think port a potties are a better idea than public restrooms. </p>
<p>The arena in my hometown that usually hosts a minor league hockey team and other concerts etc. is having a parking lot concert in a few weeks to benefit arts organizations who are struggling as a result of the shutdowns. You can’t go inside to use the bathrooms but there will be portable toilets on hand. My mom said “And you’re telling me they’re going to clean them after every person uses them?” </p>
<p>My younger sister had an outdoor wedding last year in her father-in-law’s backyard and we had portable toilets. I used them because I had no other choice, and they were pretty clean, but it’s just not a desirable means of hospitality.</p>

        <p>This is becoming much clearer with each day. Regardless if everyone abides mandates. Every time they start to open back up, it will be okay for a month or so, but the instant any cases pop up even without deaths involved, it will be grounds to lock down yet again. Possibly for longer durations, with sticter mandates imposed each time. The goal post will keep being pushed back further and further, with the expectations becoming even more unrealistic. Even with no deaths there will be an excuse each time that they have "discovered a new long term effect" in order to retain the justification. They are not going to stop until forced to do so.</p>

        <p>This is bigger then behavioural modification tho, I explained my thoughts in another thread.</p>
<p>The silent war is about democracy and free market economy vs socialism/communism that is currently being played out globally... The global deep state seems hell bent on communism, the great reset article by the davos creator says it all. He called it stake holder capitalism, the rest call it socialism. There is this massive push to increase government control on our movements/rights and on the economy itself.</p>
<p>Free market and capitalist old guard vs the European/American socialist... Look at the amount of " late stage capitalism " being tossed around or how universal basic income and socialism is great all of sudden... Like Jamie Dimon said, I don't think people understand what socialism is, it's not only about governments controlling entire economies, it's also about the lack of voting and democracy.</p>
<p>You cannot name one country in the world who went under a socialist or communist banner and held elections. Debate anyone about why communism never worked anywhere in the world even one time, there response seem to always be that it wasn't " true " communism.</p>
<p>Communism is a much bigger threat to the human population then the lockdown hoax and yet so few are talking about it. Don't get me wrong, the global lockdown hoax is crap and there push to mandatory vaccines and other oppressing shit is non sense, but socialism is the end game. By the time 2030 rolls out, the technology available to governments will make oppression a cakewalk. Look at china, you can't even fart without a camera observing you.</p>

        <p>The term for private entities benefiting off the monopoly on violence institution is "crony capitalism". It's not market competition -- it's using the State to do things you'd never be considered justified doing yourself, like providing some benefits and getting rewards kicked back that were seized from people politically instead of economically (tax dollars).</p>

        <p>As long as the Leviathan exists, there is no way you can realistically prevent someone from acting on its perverse incentive structures and manipulating it for their ends. That's the nature of the beast. It will be a problem with or without a market system. The only thing you can try to do is destroy the power center itself, making it as inaccessible or limited in scope as possible so there's nothing for other entities to wield against each other.</p>
<p>Cronyism will always be possible. Even policies created in the name of protecting consumers can be functionally cronyist, like onerous licensing and regulatory schemes that only established market players can bear, but which effectively bar smaller competitors from the space and ensure an undeserved hegemony... that can all happen without any direct lobbying from an industry.</p>

It is real. Yes. However, there are possibilities of something else that we are seeing unfold that could have adverse consequences for all, and while not to denounce what is happening in the moment, this is something to be aware of. Not everything that our leaders do is for our best interests. So I likewise

        <p>No maskers were largely vocal during the 1918 pandemic and even ended up causing large infection spikes in San Francisco but what they didn’t realize was once the pandemic was over things went back to normal. Masks aren’t forever. Don’t take Reddit comments too seriously. The government isn’t ran by Reddit. Just wear a mask and stay safe man. We’ll be back at it soon enough.</p>

        <p>Those geniuses are too preoccupied with stroking their own egos to use their intelligence for anything good. The thing about pride is that it makes you act stupid. Watch as no "experts" admit that they royally fucked up with this response. They can't allow themselves to consider that they're causing more harm than good or they might injure their self-image as "saviors and architects of humanity". They're slaves to their egos.</p>
<p>Do you really trust the science of someone who is such a narcissist that they can't bring themselves to look at data that might discredit their precious theories and models? Such a person is literally incapable of doing science.</p>

        <p>You don't know anything about me. But I can tell many scientists and doctors are prideful by observing their behavior. Just the fact that they keep demanding laymen respect them and their institutions when they've done so much to undermine their own authority makes that clear. They should be begging for another chance, not chastising people for disregarding them.</p>

        <p>According to all authorities' own numbers, I and those close to me are at essentially zero risk. I myself already caught it -- I'm sure my wife did too, though she was asymptomatic, as we were always in close proximity. Were we not already in a heightened state of awareness, we would likely have not noticed. The most bothersome symptom was the lost senses of taste and smell, the latter only returning a couple weeks after other symptoms diminished.</p>
<p>This is the reality for the vast majority of people alive. The mortality rates are nowhere close to the same realm as what was forecasted, shown to be less and less as testing gets more widespread, and absolutely <em>negligible</em> for anyone who does not normally need to be cautious of respiratory diseases. This is not worth what we've turned my country into, how people are treating each other over it, and some of the nonsensical or downright vile policies people keep trying to enact in reaction to it. It's a pile of hysteria and political maneuvering, and we should be better than this.</p>

        <p>Nothing I say is the case? Let's see. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#the-case-fatality-rate">current case fatality rate</a> in the U.S. appears to be 4.33% and still dropping. The case fatality rate is the rate of deaths amongst <em>confirmed</em> cases, not amongst total cases. If we look at the trends of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age">case fatality rates by age</a>, it's clear that the venerable easily dominate and contribute the most to the figures, by a very large margin. The same goes for people with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-preexisting-health-conditions">pre-existing conditions</a>, which tend to apply again to venerable populations.</p>
<p>The latest estimates from the CDC now claim <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-says-covid-19-cases-u-s-may-be-10-n1232134">a case rate 10 times higher than actually reported in the U.S</a>. If we presume that US deaths follow the age and comorbidity trends set by measurements of other nations, and we consider that the vast majority of people who've contracted the virus were never confirmed (which means likely never suffered serious enough symptoms to warrant testing), then the real US fatality rate is likely <em>exceptionally</em> low by comparison to the current case fatality rate, and this is especially true of any age group below the venerable population, which is the vast majority of us. If you took only the total rate of 4.33% and assumed that the real number of cases is about 10 times higher, you're closer to a 0.4% estimated real fatality rate. If you remove the compromised venerable populations from consideration (say, below age 70), that number will drastically fall again. For most of us it's downright negligible.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to hear your figures and counter-argument.</p>
<p>&rt;I know you’re using this mentality as a coping mechanism but please keep taking this seriously.</p>
<p>That is honestly quite condescending of you. With what do you believe I'm coping? What do you believe I'm not taking seriously? I'm taking all of this incredibly seriously. But I do not see the greatest risk to myself and those I love as being from the virus -- not by a long shot.</p>
<p>At first I didn't want to make any assumptions and just followed the developing news like anyone else, but it's becoming more clear with each passing day that we've chosen a cure worse than the illness, so to speak. By mere edict, we've destroyed enough livelihoods to bring unemployment filings above 30% in one fell swoop, and trigger permanent job and production loss with the closure of thousands of businesses. We've seen suicide, drug overdose, and domestic violence rates continue to explode far above normal. We've reallocated resources in an attempt to control an entire populace that would've been much better served simply identifying and protecting those few who are most at risk -- instead our wise leaders stacked them together and let the virus ravage nursing homes. We've had to suffer politicians taking advantage of the crisis to maneuver against each other at the expense of the people they're supposed to be serving, and not question it because of the COVID banner they fly. We've become hysterical and dare I say tyrannical against our neighbors in the name of this thing, and have let the fear undermine the principles upon which a nation of free people is supposed to be based. The hysteria has grown so bad that publicly begging for even more State enforcement is a common sight now.</p>
<p>This isn't right, and it isn't warranted. If you just want to say I'm coping, fine. But I'd rather hear your arguments and see your evidence to counter my points, and be met with a little respect.</p>

        <p>Honestly man it seems like you’re just burnt out and are willing to risk other people’s lives to get back to normal. I understand that feeling but this isn’t going to get any better over the next year. You can see it in several states already who will reach NY level of death rates within the next month. I just hope you’re not personally affected.</p>
<p>Just hang tight and ride this out best you can without sacrificing others and wear a mask please. I firmly believe if everyone wore one then we could open up the economy without much restriction.</p>

        <p>So, no actual argument from you? That's unfortunate. Aren't you going to even attempt to defend your claim? And why are you saying I'm "willing to risk other peoples' lives"? What's your metric by which to judge this? Isn't anyone advocating for the policies we've endured so far not only risking but directly spending the lives, livelihoods, and futures of others without their consultation? How can this not take primacy in the discussion? Or does consideration and concern for my fellow humans begin and end solely with deaths directly attributable to coronavirus and nothing else, the way so many seem to behave these days?</p>
<p>I appreciate the well-wishing, but the greatest threat I or the vast majority of the population currently faces is from the actions of the local monopoly on violence -- not the virus.</p>

        <p>There’s honestly nothing I could link that will change your view. You’re as deeply entrenched in your view as I am, except I’m following orders given by infectious disease experts and you’re following you’re gut.</p>
<p>If people listened earlier then these hardships wouldn’t be this bad. If everyone wore masks from the start in March and continued to do so, not nearly as many people would have lost their jobs. If the CDC didn’t mess up their initial message about masks then things would be way better. If testing and contact tracing were widespread and funded, then we wouldn’t be where we are today. You people have to fight every single step of the way whenever a new guideline is put in place and now we are facing tougher decisions and more hardships. </p>
<p>I just hope you are personally unaffected by what is to come and come out ok. Nobody deserves to experience this but the reality is it’s spreading and getting worse.</p>

        <p>The thing with the death rates too is that many people are having covid listed as their cause of death when, in fact, they died of something else.</p>
<p>I believe the death rate is lower than .26%</p>

        <p>One blog made an interesting observation, that we believe only in "one germ one disease", when actually there could be many different combinations working together. Virus/bacteria, virus/virus, virus/environmental toxins, the combinations could be many.</p>
<p>It's been speculated that the major lung damage seen in the worst-off covid patients could be caused by a co-infection of mycobacteria. Which are prevalent in crowded Chinese cities, Northern Italy, and poorer parts of New York City.  But who knows?  All I know is that it's not at all as simple as it's being by explained by public "health" authorities.</p>

I'd take my odds with the virus over the vaccine any day. I don't know how anyone could look at Gates and his history and believe he means us well.</p>

        <p>Microsoft was predatory and vicious, constantly skirting the edge of legality, and certainly not concerned with business ethics.  They set the computing world back by decades.</p>
<p>Now because he set up a "charitable foundation" he's suddenly a great guy and a savior of humanity.  Sorry, I don't think he's changed a bit, he's just got a bigger group of victims.</p>

        <p>This has proved that my country is absolutely primed for an attempt at radical authoritarian takeover. The number of people is <em>legion</em> who will not exercise independent thought, will engage in absolute hysteria to the point of willing violence against those who do not agree or participate, and will support and defend the establishment without any need for investigation. These are the kinds of regular people who would "just follow orders" and provide the blind support that the worst leaders of the 20th century relied upon to carry out their disastrous ideas.</p>

        <p>Yes most of the news and social media news with regards to people who don’t wear masks is negative and meant to demonize those who reject the “new normal”. It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if many of these were fake/staged for an agenda.</p>

        <p>There's a post floating around of some doctor who rode a stationary bike for 60 minutes rotating between three masks, one of which was worn incorrectly, which a finger oxygen monitor. Which showed her having normal oxygen levels the whole time. So if can ride a bike for an entire hour with a mask, so can everyone else. Any reputable doctor would never say "my body acts his way so everyone else's acts exactly the same as mine". She also managed to bike for sixty minutes in perfect hair and makeup without a drop of sweat.</p>

        <p>Oh no, I’m on the same side as you are, and I’m sure this guy probably had an underlying condition or something too... A friend of my husband’s uncle died of kidney failure and they ruled his death as covid and wouldn’t allow them to have a funeral with more than 10 people... I’ve actually been staying off of Facebook for the most part, but today, when I looked on there, that seems to be the “repost of the day”... I stay off of there lately because I’m sick of the mask selfie’s</p>

        <p>No, what I'm saying is, there's more modern things that have occurred, for us to relate to "happening in our lifetime" events. For example, 911, where immediately after, there were bills and things drafted up and passed so fast, our heads were spinning. </p>
<p>I don't feel like giving a history lesson, but, I do recall the "patriot act" among there.</p>

        <p>If it's about divide and conquer, wouldn't you want to look at the divide and conquering parts? How the anti mask, anti vax, anti whatever rhetoric is pretty well tied to the right who are so in power even the Dems are kind of right wing? The position of probably the worst president in recent history? You know, the same side that is planning other peoples' futures? Pushing a puritanical, patriarchal, christian family dynamic? Spinning civil rights as some how oppressing people who are entirely free to live as they always have? Ya know, creating conflict? The people that push militarization, and try to hold healthcare and education hostage in part to not hurt recruitment numbers? Ya know, conditioning? The people that vote unanimously against transparency in political finances, the people giving bailouts to churches and family member's businesses? Isn't it more logically sound to look at the organized long lived systemic issues in the government and recognize it's not scientists but the insular political/corporate interests against scientists who might have the wrong end of this?</p>
<p>Like isn't the divide part about making a huge deal over the orders? The only real world - as in not some twitter fights - divide and tension I've seen is like Bar Lives Matter style protests.</p>
<p>Presumably most of you think masks can work in a legitimate risky situation right? Like doctors have worn masks for ages. No one was protesting doctors having to wear masks. All the studies in the world to show effectiveness, it's easy to test it yourself at home. The thought is that it's not that serious, and the order is some kind of mind game - like, as you're saying - something to divide the public over. So if it <em>was</em> a real pandemic, masks might make sense. Maybe you'd still prefer individual rights and find it important that something like this never be a mandate, but masks hypothetically work in fighting spread of disease if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>So that aside, where's the occam's razor in this? That scientists all over the world from conflicting countries conspired or were duped into skewing data in order to justify pushing masks and social distancing to mentally condition the public for vague leverage over the public. Or is it the historically, well documented trend of anti-intellectual GOP politicians motivating their voter base by making a 'freedom' based controversy around the biggest thing in the news? Regardless of the seriousness or lack there of with covid?</p>
