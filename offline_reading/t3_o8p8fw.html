    <strong>Help. Any other ladies experiencing this?!?</strong>
    <p><p>I (24F) have not taken the vaccine, nor am I planning on taking it and I‚Äôve noticed that every time I go out and I am around large crowds of people, I end up spotting (light bleeding) for a day or two afterwards...</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a coincidence, but then I noticed it happening more and more often. The first time it happened was after my friend‚Äôs birthday party (majority of the attendees were vaxxed), then after a busy day at the beach, another time when I went to a beach, and most recently after an outdoor event. All of the times were not near my period, lasted only a day or two and I was around vaccinated people prior. </p>
<p>I heard of the spike protein shedding theory and I know nothing has necessarily been confirmed, but I‚Äôm just trying to make sense of it all... I‚Äôve heard of this happening in post-menopausal women but not with women my age and I‚Äôm just looking to see if anyone else has been experiencing this?</p>
<p>I appreciate everyone‚Äôs input and opinions!</p></p>

        <p>There's something going on. I feel malaise the next day when I'm around them and a few weeks ago I got a cold with sinus and chest congestion after being in contact. Very strange and unsettling. When they brag about vax only concerts - you couldn't pay me to be that close to so many of them.</p>

        <p>Is it happening just once a month about midway through your cycle or is it random throughout the month.</p>
<p>I've heard it's can be normal to happen around the middle of your cycle when you ovulate. </p>
<p>It's been happening to me the past few months, but I am super close to mentalpause.</p>
<p>Just to be safe, you might want to schedule an appointment with your doctor.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs been happening really randomly, the only correlation I‚Äôve been able to make is when I‚Äôve been going out. But not every time I‚Äôm out, only around larger crowds. When I go see family or go out alone with my boyfriend, I haven‚Äôt really noticed it happening... it‚Äôs so odd! I‚Äôm thinking of going to see my doctor, it will probably take a few months though, it‚Äôs been so hard to book appointments lately where I am, especially with specialists üòî</p>

        <p>I'm not saying it is or isn't the vaccine. I'm saying stress could be a factor. There are a number of reasons why a person could spot between menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>I've started spotting the past few months. Only places I go where there are vaccinated people are stores. And who knows who is and isn't vaccinated and when they got the vaccine, because I live in Texas and both vaccinated and non-vaccinated have been going without masks for a few months now.
What I do know is that I am getting close to menopause and I've also been stressed the past couple of months due to almost becoming unemployed due to this stupid scamdemic.</p>

        <p>I have heard other women talking about this happening. So with the ‚Äúshedding‚Äù I have no clue. :( The first time I was in close proximity to a few vaccinated people I got a severe headache and clogged sinus (which never happens to me). </p>
<p>When you‚Äôre around a lot of women your cycles can interact and become irregular and change to ‚Äúsync‚Äù up with each other. Are you on any birth control? Is the spotting happening when you are ovulating?</p>

        <p>She has been a victim of a smear campaign for a while now. She committed the biggest sin a doctor can make, she spoke out against the Gardasil vaccines back in 2006. There are a lot of concerning safety parallels in how the Gardasil vaccines were ‚Äúapproved‚Äù similar to the current Covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>Same here with the headaches.  Happened literally by the end of the day after being right next to a newly vaccinated guy all day.  I really really hope this shedding stuff is just a coincidence and not real, because it‚Äôs freaking scary.  I don‚Äôt mind a headache so much but if it‚Äôs messing up people‚Äôs fertility that freaks me out.  I can‚Äôt help but think about Bill gates and his overpopulation goal and that maybe those vaccines are actually engineered bioweapons intended to disrupt the fertility of those around the vaccinated and effectively sterilize everyone even if only half the world is vaccinated</p>

        <p>My wife and I are not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>We have been trying to have our second child for over a year now, our current child took over two years to conceive as my wife has fertility issues, and we ended up needing medication to jump start things.</p>
<p>Sadly, we FINALLY got her pregnant in February only for her to miscarry in April.</p>
<p>We were fucking devistated. Her miscarrige came at a time when many of her co-workers and parents got thier jabs.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the jabs caused it, but it's a pretty big fucking coincidence.</p>
<p>She has not had a normal menstrual cycle since. We have been to the emergency room several times in the first month to confirm that the miscarrige has indeed passed and it has.</p>
<p>She has not gone more than two weeks without experiencing a few days of spotting, with random bouts of light or heavy bleeding... But nothing substantial enough to consider a full period. It also took her TWO MONTHS after the doctors confirming she has completly passed her miscarrige to get a negative pregnancy test.</p>
<p>Needless to say, she gets pretty fired up when people nag her to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I haven't heard of this issue before, and as a guy don't really feel like I can ask around too much, but I think there is something to the spike protein shedding thing: when I'm around people who just got vaxxed I'll often get chest pain a few days later.</p>

<p>After staying with my bf parents post their vaccine I had 3 periods in 2 months</p>
<p>After spending more time with them I developed an ovarian cyst that ruptured for the first time in my life</p>
<p>It happened a second time a month later while I was staying at their house</p>
<p>It happened a third time after staying with my dad post his vaccine, spent a 2 hour car ride with him to a hiking spot- half way up the mountain it ruptured</p>
<p>Maybe this is all coincidence .. I have not gotten the vaccine.. But this has been the weirdest 6 months of my life and maybe coincidence it lined up with me spending time around vaccinated folks idk</p>
