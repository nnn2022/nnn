        <p>These injections are still experimental- they are not approved as vaccines, they are authorized for emergency use- opening up the population to mandatory participation in what amount to human trials- skipping much of the time intensive experimentation that usually precedes an approval.</p>
<p>Proselytizing about what a vaccine is and following with a treatment of these experimental serums as though they were vaccines is profoundly dishonest.</p>

        <p>It's pretty much well understood that the <a href="https://stateofthenation.co/?p=52286">numbers have been cooked</a>- in part because of financial incentives in the form of <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/coviduninsuredclaim">extra payouts to treatment attributed to "Covid"</a> as well as <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/covid-funeral-reimbursement-now-9000-heres-how-to-apply-today/">other incentives</a>... so while there may be that number- even more that differ with me, the sad fact is that many of them could well be misinfo0rmed.</p>
<p>Of course your wonderful "vaccine" <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-news/thousands-of-americans-have-experienced-severe-reactions-to-covid-vaccines-cdc-report.html">isn't exactly as safe as advertised</a>.</p>

        <p>You do realize every single piece of fruit or vegetable that humanity has consumed for the last 500 years has been made possible by gene-altering various strands of plant seeds to make them survive in various weather environments. This is known as botany.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci#HIV/AIDS_epidemic">HIV/AIDS epidemic</a> </p>
<p>&rt;Fauci was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. In 1981, he and his team of researchers began looking for a vaccine or treatment for this novel virus, though they would meet a number of obstacles. In October 1988, protesters came to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute's director in 1984, bore the brunt of the anger from the LGBTQ community, who were largely ignored by the government.</p>

        <p>Why did it take said top minds six months to admit that masks reduce the spread of coronavirus?</p>
<p>Because Donald Trump was in office and he decided to make it a political issue. And went to great lengths to ignore it and thus creating the current situation we are in now of too much misinformation.</p>
<p>Historical, really? above mentioned top minds still call HIV a global epidemic, with 700 thousand people dying from it every year.</p>
<p>Correct: However we caught the Coronavirus <strong>EARLY</strong> while it hasn't mutated yet. Therefore with all the collective will of all of the modern technology at our disposal science was able to develop a vaccine quickly.</p>
<p>BUT in the 1980s HIV and AIDS were largely ignored because of the stigma of being the "Gay Sickness", it was not taken seriously until almost a decade later in the 1990s. By that time the virus has mutated so much and developed so many different variations, it becomes harder every year to find a cure/vaccine for the disease.</p>

        <p>So what the top minds are saying has nothing to do with science, and instead is dictated by political reasons. That's why I make my own decisions rather than blindly believing what I'm being told.</p>

        <p>This is hilarious "because of Donald Trump"</p>
<p>You answered Donald Trump to why scientists from AROUND THE WORLD didn't do something?</p>
<p>You seriously are making yourself look really dumb. I'm not even going to call you dumb in real life. But you are being absolutely obliterated by facts and its pretty awkward to watch you continue to eat your own foot.</p>
<p>Listen, it's great that you don't want people to die. We don't either. But please go learn about this stuff from somewhere other than high-school biology and mainstream media. You may still not agree with us, but at least you'll have an adequate understanding of your own position.</p>

        <p>So he wasn't the President in charge of the entire country who said such idiot things like.</p>
<p>"hydroxychloroquine can cure covid"</p>
<p>"Injecting yourself with bleach and light can cure you"</p>
<p>Who was so against wearing the mask he made it a political issue and ended up getting covid anyway.</p>
<p>Who, because of his ineptitude was responsible for the death of 606,000 dead Americans.</p>
<p>That very desperately wanted to sweep this under the rug as quickly as possible because this might make him look bad and hurt his reelection chances.</p>
<p>Hmm, why would I blame Donald Trump, oh that's right because this occurred under his watch and he fucked up so badly as a leader, we ignored him and started listening to Dr. Fauci as a trained scientist who a few decades earlier was warning us that an event like this was going happen and we need to take the threat seriously.</p>

        <p>the vaccine is designed to instruct your cells to make the spike protein<br>
the antibodies that your body is learning to make are for the spike protein, not covid<br>
The antibodies find the spike protein on covid, attack it and destroy it, but what about the covid inside?<br>
the covid inside is now considered to be harmless<br>
What? How can covid in our body be harmless according to the theory behind mRNA vaccines?<br>
the spike protein is what enables covid to enter membranes where it can be dangerous<br>
So, without the protein, covid is contained?<br>
that's the idea. the vaccine has nothing specific for covid, it teaches your cells to make the spike protein, your cells make it, antibodies start attacking your cells<br>
Wait, what?<br>
yeah, now that protein is on your cells, slicing through membranes, which in serious cases is causes blood cots, which if not treated immediately, could definitely kill you<br>
Well, how long will our cells continue to produce these proteins that slice through membranes and have our own antibodies attack our own cells?<br>
when we teach our cells to make antibodies in one place, then, all the cells, everywhere are able to make it, forever<br>
So, you are saying that this is teaching our cells to make a spike protein that can slice through membranes and it might go on forever?<br>
no, that's what antibodies do when they learn to make something. this is new, we don't know</p>

        <p>The best part about this post (other than the condescending tone) is that you will be banned from so many other subs for posting here to "prove a point". </p>
<p>Something pro-vaxxers need to understand is that you will NEVER reason with an anti-vaxxer in this kind of holier than thou manner. It's the same way that an anti-vaxxer will not be able to sway the opinion of a pro-vaxxer. There are strong opinions from both sides and I feel like there are too many people operating on extreme ends of the vaccine-choice spectrum. </p>
<p>I will identify as COVID-vaccine hesitant. That does NOT mean I am opposed to science or vaccines in general as the media will often try to paint people like me. In fact, quite the opposite. I think the vaccines we have developed are one of the most significant advancements in human history. I even agree that MRNA technology is absolutely fascinating. </p>
<p>With that said, I think that the way basically the whole world has gone about rolling out these vaccines has been shameful and bordering unethical. There has been an increasing amount of censorship as well as silencing and discrediting of highly decorated medical and scientific professionals who have raised questions regarding the use of these new MRNA vaccines. </p>
<p>My hesitancy stems from the number of times I've heard that they are "safe and effective" despite red flags and alarm bells sounding from experts in the fields of vaccine development, immunology and virology. Furthermore, any opportunity for discussion exploring both sides has been shut down. This is worrisome to me. We are acting like the science is completely settled on these NEW vaccines. Well, that unfortunately is not how science works. Science needs to be constantly challenged....otherwise it becomes dogmatic. Science is not a religion. It's not something you "believe" in. I always thought that science was better than religion in this sense and would elevate humanity, but here we are. </p>
<p>So yes, I have a healthy dose of skepticism because I genuinely care about the well-being of other people potentially being harmed by short-term AND long-term side effects we don't know about yet. ALSO I am weary of big pharma (and health organizations/governments that are heavily influenced and funded by them) given their past history of unethical behaviour, the fact they have zero liability for vaccine injuries and are making BANK on this pandemic. </p>
<p>And although I would automatically be labeled as selfish these days for saying this, I care about my own health so I will absolutely be weighing my options here. </p>
<p>And lastly, something I want to express here is my disappointment with how pro-vaxxers have gone about trying to sway people to do the right thing and get vaccinated. I have witnessed very little compassion and patience, but have seen an awful lot of loathing, belittling and harmful speech. I have seen people wish disgusting and horrible things on those who are hesitant and against the COVID vaccine. It's honestly despicable. You know why? Because people like me who are hesitant don't give a crap what pro-vaxxers do and we just go about our business treating everybody with kindness and love. </p>
<p>So OP, I'm sending you lots of love and light because you sound very triggered by stupid, ignorant idiots like me.</p>
