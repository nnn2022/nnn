    <strong>My Schools Hybrid Option</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I go to a fairly big high school, 2500 kids and its probably tough to keep up with the crazy guidelines in my state... but this is insane.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" While much remains uncertain, there are some conditions that we know will have to be in place to accommodate both in-school and at home learning. <strong>Those who have selected the hybrid model will find instruction to look much the way it does online now. On the days that students are assigned to come into the building, they will report to a single classroom and log onto their computers for the day to engage in their learning from their laptops. A faculty member assigned to the classroom will monitor the room while teaching their own classes online; headphones will be worn by all to minimize the noise distractions. Students will not transition from room to room</strong>, as this increases the risk of potential exposure and is not possible due to the large numbers of students in each cohort. To remain socially distanced and to ensure the ability to contact trace if necessary, we must keep students in stationary classroom cohorts. Everyone will be required to wear masks throughout the day with the exception of assigned seat lunch, which will function as a mask break. Windows in classrooms must remain open for ventilation irrespective of the temperature or weather outdoors. We want to be transparent and forthright about these realities so that you can make the best decision for your student and family. "</p>
<p>They're basically saying just don't come to school. It gets to -10 degrees Fahrenheit, no way its safe with the windows open.</p>
<p>RIP senior year</p></p>
