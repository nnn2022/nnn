\&rt; Dear REMOVED,<br>
I want to provide you some very important information. I'm a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt; I need to start off by saying that I'm not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt; The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt; - Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.<br>
\&rt; - Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.<br>
\&rt; - Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.<br>
\&rt; - Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 - early January 2021<br>
\&rt; - Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 - Q2 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.<br>
\&rt; - Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt; Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided<br>
\&rt; to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada's HealthPass) .<br>
\&rt;<br>
\&rt; Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told "the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details". Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen.</p></p>

        <p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. 
The debt relief scheme also makes no sense. Why would anyone agree to debt relief if they could never own “assets or property” ever again? Why does the IMF never want them to own property again?</p>
<p>Anyone making financial decisions based on this nonsense gets no sympathy from me.</p>
