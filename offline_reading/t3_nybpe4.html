        <p>I've been closely watching the vaccine debate for many years, and here's what i see...</p>
<p>1) they tell 100 people they need to vaccinate, because this 1 guy can't be vaccinated</p>
<p>2) they vaccinate that 1 guy anyway</p>

        <p>These people are willing to ruin the lives of millions to POSSIBLY save the life of 1. The logic behind it makes 0 sense. In the first few months of covid, the government policies caused the world poverty number to DOUBLE. That is insane yet people think that this virus with a less than 1% death rate is worse than the millions who can’t even get basic needs like food, water, and shelter</p>

        <p>The only number they care about (even though it’s very likely embellished due to inaccurate reporting) is the <em>total</em> number of covid deaths. </p>
<p>They don’t care about the percentage or death rate of covid deaths. They don’t care about deaths from other diseases or circumstances. They don’t care about poverty numbers. They don’t care about care about depression. They don’t care about waste/pollution made from an over production and overuse of masks. They only care about <em>total</em> covid deaths. It’s literally the only number they pay attention to and care about. </p>

        <p>But the irony is that the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from contracting or transmitting Covid… it just lessens the severity if exposed post-vax. My  personal risk factor is 0.000003% (ranked 7/100) therefore, clinically, I would be an idiot to take a vaccine that has documented severe adverse reactions when the actual disease poses an essential 0% risk. If you can’t tolerate that level of risk, or if your personal risk factor is higher due to age, comorbidities, blood levels, etc, by all means take the vaccine because that is you taking into account YOUR risk factors.</p>

        <p>The vaccine not stopping people from contracting or transmitting covid makes separating society based in vaccination status not only monstrous, but pointless.  You’re just as likely to catch it from someone who has been vaccinated as you are from someone who hasn’t.</p>

        <p>Thanks for confirming that you can still contract and transmit Covid post-vax. Exactly like I said; which is common knowledge for anybody who scratches below the surface of mainstream narrative (suppression of honest risk:reward ratios, which is a central tenet of bioethics). </p>

        <p>This was well published and the fact you missed it it speaks as to how little you bothered trying to be accurate in anything you’ve said. </p>
<p>It is reduced fairly significantly post vax , no one has tried to say you are fully immune and cannot pass it on after it. The significant reduction however has a huge impact if you understand how viruses spread through a population.</p>
<p>Honestly demonstrating you aren’t a health worker more with each post though. New account time?</p>

        <p>We’re both saying the same thing. You can still contract and transmit Covid post-vax. That’s exactly what the article says. Does it reduce the transmission rate? Yes. Does it eliminate it? No. </p>
<p>The issue, which is what NNN in large part protests against, is the dogmatic nature in which the vaccine is presented as the cure-all without an honest representation of what the vaccine does, does not do, risks associated, contraindications, etc. It is medical malpractice to coerce consent by obfuscating potential risks or lying by omission when there are known risks.</p>

        <p>That would have merit if there was any effort from the scientific community to present it as that but they haven’t.</p>
<p>You hasn’t even bothered doing the smallest bit of research to see there is a link between transmission and vaccines and when presented with that tried to spin as somehow supporting your position. </p>
<p>There are clear benefits to the vaccines and that is what people have said, politicians may be more keen to spin them as an easy solution but that is a bone to pick with the political system rather than anything from the scientific community.</p>
<p>Edit: not to mention they are the ones publishing the numbers behind reactions etc, you are acting like they are trying to cover this up which is literally the opposite of reality.</p>

        <p>Here’s the deal. If I asked in question form my original statement “can I still contract and transmit Covid post-vax?” you would have to, based on the evidence you cited, respond something to the effect of “Yes, but…” which is a valid, and I concede necessary, response. However whatever follows the “but” is a qualification, not a refutation. That’s because my original statement is both technically AND practically correct, meaning that it can actually happen in the real world, which is why I thanked you for confirming my position. If there was evidence to suggest the risk of transmission post-vax in the study was in the order of 1%, as an example, I would happily concede that my original statement was technically true but practically incorrect (true but misleading, if you will). </p>
<p>And as far as the political vs scientific communities, I think there is a nugget of truth there. However I’m still puzzled as to why after data has been presented that post-Covid patients still have sufficient antibodies (a la Cleveland Clinic preliminary study) that the WHO/CDC recommends they be vaccinated - a reasonable process would be to at least check for antibodies prior to vaccination. I’m also alarmed and concerned why the CDC and pharma companies are rushing to extend the EUA to children and adolescents when there’s abundant evidence that children don’t contract and transmit Covid like older members of the population. As more and more data become aggregated, it is also becoming increasingly clear that the boogey man “asymptomatic spread” is exactly that: an, initially precautionary and useful, tall tale that has outlived its practical utility. </p>
<p>So in a sense I agree; the science is catching up and debunking a lot of “slow the spread” precautionary measures, but that, in my opinion, has not swayed many people in political positions.</p>

        <p>Sorry but this is just a long bench of often nonsensical rambling. It again further demonstrates more lack of any knowledge on what you’re talking about, why would you pull 1% as some arbitrary number? If you understood how transmission works the amount of people infected by 1 person affects the amount of cases exponentially. If you reduce transmission in vaccinated people by 50% you aren’t just halving cases for example once a significant amount of the population is vaccinated. Secondly there are also many studies showing a strong link between vaccination and the severity of infection in people thus reducing hospitalisations. 
You’ve set a completely arbitrary ‘target’ if you want to call it that and are acting like if it can’t meet that then there is no point in getting vaccinated whilst ignoring the actual benefits. </p>
<p>I threw you a bone with the political system comment because I can genuinely understand why people may want to criticise governments over the handling. For the U.K. alone there has been massive corruption in handing out contracts, accusations that elderly people were not tested before being sent to care homes and other issues. There are also debates to be had about the reopening (again U.K. examples but it’s all I can really relate to being from here) strategy and whether venues like cinemas etc could not open earlier. I fully agree there is discussion to be had on that front and although I used U.K. examples I’m sure there are similar issues in the USA and beyond. Where people lose all credibility though is when they set their sights on something they demonstrably do not understand even basic concepts of and continue to try make this about vaccine science. The only part where there is a discussion to be had in that regard is the need for children to be vaccinated though it’s a far more complex topic than people here would want to paint it as.</p>

        <p>This thread has lost its utility because you’re not going to CMV nor vise versa, compounded with the fact that nobody else seems to be reading it anyways. But here’s another answer anyways. </p>
<p>Implicit in my reasoning, and absent in yours, is risk analysis concerning the vaccine. Let’s pretend we were in a parallel universe where Covid = Flu and like in our universe, we already have the technology to manufacture a tried and substantiated vaccine. In that parallel universe, I would have absolutely no trouble getting and advocating for that vaccine writ large because the reward is hypothetically high and the risk is verifiably low. Back in our actual universe, I think it’s worth mentioning that I’m not anti-vax, nor even anti-CoVax across the board. But I’m actually gauging risk:reward across the population. There is a broad subsection of the population I absolutely think SHOULD get it based on available data and informed risk:reward: those 50+ (although I think it should be more towards 60+ because the CDC’s cross-section is 50-64): nursing/elder care homes, those who have 2+ multi-system comorbidities, those whose bloodwork shows specific Vitamin and mineral deficiencies, obese people, and you get the picture. </p>
<p>There has to be a separate conversation for those under 50 (and quantifiably healthy) because the risk:reward structure changes drastically. In our real life, we have several still-experimental mRNA vaccines available. An mRNA vaccine has never made it to market due to adverse reactions, and still technically hasn’t because it’s provisionally released under a EUA (which should give us all pause). The reason EUAs get approved is because a risk:reward ratio has been calculated for the vulnerable that it purports to help; and I agree, by the way, with the calculation for the above-stated population group. </p>
<p>However, for a large subset of the population (under 50 and healthy) my argument is that the risk:reward structure is dubious: A theoretically low personal, moderate population reward/benefit (via decreased transmission rates) to a currently uncalculated/unknown risk. (Our current flu shot is a low-risk, low-reward shot for me, so it’s a wash, and more years than not I’ll get the flu vaccine). </p>
<p>The issue, that I’ve noted before, is that the risks of the vaccine are being propagandistically (by politicians moreso than scientists) ignored and/or obfuscated while simultaneously being coerced to take the vax at the risk of social and career ostracization. </p>
<p>And to revisit, a central tenet of bioethics regarding experimental treatment is that the <em>voluntary subject</em> has to be apprised of their risk:reward for said experiment. A quick read through Covidvaccinated sub and VAERS (yes I know the pro’s and con’s of referencing VAERS) will quickly let you know we don’t know the full picture on the risk of being vaccinated, despite being told it’s “safe and effective” ad nauseum. </p>
<p>So I stand by my original statement because I’ve performed the requisite informed risk:reward assessment. A virtual 0 risk of Covid weighed against an unknown risk for the benefit of a decreased contraction/transmission rate is not in my favor, especially if actually-vulnerable people have been vaccinated. </p>
<p>So a clarifying statement that may help you understand is to a question of: under what circumstances would I take the vaccine? And the answer is: after I, and the researchers, have an actual understanding of the long-term risk profile BECAUSE the vaccine does not behave the way it was designed to. I.e., it was designed to stay local to the deltoid (it does not, and concentrates in the ovaries, lymph system, blood stream, bone marrow, etc) and it was designed with the assumption that the spike-protein would be inactive (it is known now to be active and reactionary, hence the variety and severity of post-vax adverse reactions). So the answer, in a time-frame would be no sooner than 9 months and likely 2-3 years. </p>
<p>And BTW, 60+ y/o’s and post-menopause woman don’t have to worry about the long-term consequences because they will likely be dead before they have a chance to manifest, so another notch in their favor to take the vaccine that is not in ours. </p>
<p>If you’re tired of arguing with me and want to hear a comprehensive argument for everything that I’ve put forth, perhaps you can listen to this and start writing letters to PhDs, MDs, and researchers. </p>

        <p>At least they could make that case about it being contagious when there wasn't a vaccine. These are the people who say the vaccine absolutely works, and I don't even really disagree. But we are in the situation where who cares that it's contagious if there is a vaccine? And frankly even if there isn't a vaccine, there are ways to treat this, it simply is not a death sentence especially for most people, even those who are at greater risk have a good survivability</p>
