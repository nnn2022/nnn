    <strong>Why I haven’t talked to a therapist about the feelings that are truly bothering me</strong>
    <p><p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’ve made a few posts here in the last month and a half or so when I’ve felt really down &amp; had suicidal thoughts. I’ve realized somebody recommends me for RedditCareResources about every 10 days based on my posts. For those who don’t know, RedditCareResources sends you a bunch of suicide hotlines if somebody reports a suicidal poster to Reddit. Here, I’ve realized I actually have a serious problem with suicidal thinking.</p>
<p>However, if I disclosed this problem to a therapist, I’d probably be locked away in a mental hospital. As most of you can definitely empathize, the reason WHY I constantly feel this way is precisely because I feel trapped &amp; like my situation is inescapable. If I were to be locked away in a mental hospital, this would compound my feelings of being locked away in an insane asylum &amp; not being able to do anything, ironically depriving me of the very things I need to cure my feelings: freedom, courage, &amp; confidence. I’d probably have to go on medications, and we all know that’s not really living (if ur on meds &amp; they help you, i apologize).</p>
<p>At a fundamental level, I feel suicidal because I feel trapped in a situation that torments &amp; oppresses me in every sense. Society, you want to cure my problem? Let me live. Let me live without fear. Without scaring me every goddamn minute. And get the fuck out of my way.</p>
<p>Of course, if I mentioned my feelings to my therapist, I would be immediately sent to the mental hospital because according to my parents, that’s just how it works.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll ever be happy again, even if this situation did magically resolve (which it likely won’t). This is no way to fucking live. I want to be free. But in today’s world, I will never be free, always hounded by the psychopaths (who are a majority of the population) ready to cancel &amp; torture me on a moment’s notice. When you see the world from this point of view, death seems like a much better option than life.</p>
<p>People like those in this community are the only ones that seem to truly get WHY I feel the way I do &amp; try to offer solutions that relieve (if not solve) the problem, instead of compounding it. I hate that institutions that are supposed to help people like me actually actively make them sicker &amp; make their conditions worse.</p>
<p>If only the people in my life understood this, I would’ve never been driven to this level of mental agony in the first place. I would be healthy &amp; happy. But no, that’s too good for someone like me.</p>
<p>And when the world operates like that, maybe death will give me more freedom than life.</p></p>

        <p>You would be involuntarily put into a mental hospital if you mentioned suicide. It happens all of the time. Happened to one of my clients way back when. He was old and in a wheelchair and just made an offhanded comment about using his gun on himself. My coworker legally had to report him, so when I showed up for my shift I found out he was taken to the hospital mental facility for three days. When I finally see my patient again, he has a bite wound from another mental patient. </p>
<p>But you can still see a therapist for help. Just don't mention suicide. Deny it if you have to. But definitely let them know how you feel otherwise. If the therapist tries to make lockdowns and mask seem normal and necessary, find a new therapist. If they try to offer meds that you don't want, tell them you would prefer how to learn good coping  skills. Maybe they can help you find some outlets that will help. </p>
<p>I'm mentally sound, but this shit had a huge affect on my for the first few months. I survive by tuning it out, hoping things get better, and living in the now as much as possible. </p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>&rt; according to my parents, that’s just how it works </p>
<p>Everyone's parents say this. It's how they avoid critical analysis of how their own life decisions have made disaster almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Sod 'em.</p>
<p>Talk to your therapist, then look up the link between unrest and the solar minimum and crack open a beer.</p>
