    <strong>I'm selfish and I don't care</strong>
    <p><p>Today I had my mask on, but under my chin. I went into a convienence store and the man in front of me in line threw a fit that I was wearing my mask improperly. He straight out called me selfish for "endangering him" and told me that this was all my fault and it's because of people like me that we'll have to go back into lockdown. This guy was probably about 30ish, easily 300+lbs, was buying Doritos and soda, and made sure to buy three packs of cigarettes... </p>
<p>This guy is a danger to himself. I have no respect for anyone anymore who plays into Covid bs, yet drinks alcohol, eats junk food, is overweight, smokes, ect. Not only do I not have respect, but I don't care about you. I am 100% selfish. I care about myself, that's why I've always cared about myself. I eat healthy, workout, don't drink or smoke, and rarely if ever get sick. </p>
<p>I don't owe anyone any kind of protection. That's your job.  I don't owe my livelihood  or happiness to complete strangers. No one does. Don't wanna die of Covid? Go the fuck outside without your mask, start running, put down the chips, lose some weight, quit smoking, and stop drinking. I don't fucking care if you get sick because you're already unhealthy, you were sick before Covid. </p>
<p>So sorry guys, if we get locked down blame me for being selfish. I'm living my life and I done with this. I don't care if anyone gets sick. Why? Because there's a 99.9% chance you'll be just fucking fine. We should all be selfish and move the fuck on.</p></p>

        <p>No, I believe he roasted you for being a Democrat lackey and a shill, because those are the only people who are on r/politics. It doesn't make you smart because you "read" a bunch of TDS invested propaganda.</p>

        <p>News flash: Even Trump's wearing a mask now. Corona isn't a political issue, it doesn't care what side of the isle you or your loved ones are on. It's a fucking virus, it doesn't have ideological motivations.</p>
<p>Trying to roast me for my political beliefs about completely unrelated topics because I said you should you know, wear a mask and not draw out the pandemic further might be even more ignorant than what I actually accused him of. </p>
<p>So congrats, just when I thought the arguments here couldn't get any more ignorant, you show up to let me know I haven't seen nothin' yet!</p>

        <p>I don't think your political beliefs are unrelated here. </p>
<p>I know, I have said in other threads. I always voted for Democrat, bought all of the hype. The gun control narrative, the Republicans are the party of money and greed and the Dems are for the people narrative. It's all BS though. </p>
<p>Both parties are the party of money and greed, it's just they have sometimes different donors. Guns aren't the problem, atomization, alienation and mental health is and you don't seem very mentally healthy. You should find a friend, take your masks and gloves off, have a chat with that friend and hug them. </p>
<p>Bonus points is that friend has different opinions than you on some things. </p>
<p>You won't die and neither will grandma, I promise... You'll probably feel better.</p>

        <p>Yup, I don’t care if I’m selfish at this point. Do I care about others? Absolutely! I worry for the kids who are having their childhoods taken from them, I worry for those small businesses that are struggling, I worry for those who struggle with their mental health. And so much more. </p>
<p>And I’m also selfish. No I don’t care that x amount of people died from covid. I really don’t. Every death is a tragedy, yes. But we cannot prevent all deaths. And everyone is going to die at some point. </p>
<p>I don’t care if you’re scared. I don’t care if you’re content to stay inside all day, because I’m not. It’s not my responsibility to take care of you. I don’t care if I get the virus, and I don’t really care if I endanger you if I’m not wearing a mask. Unless I am either symptomatic OR in direct contact with someone who I <em>know</em> is high-risk, taking care of you is not my responsibility. I’m not going beyond one level of separation either, because we can’t account for every hypothetical for goodness’s sake. And if I’m symptomatic, I shouldn’t be out and about anyway. </p>
<p>I take decent care of myself. I work out for 2 hours a day. I sleep 7-8.5 hours a night. I don’t eat that healthy, but I at least try to minimize soda, eat one fruit and vegetable daily, and get protein. I have OCD and I’ve always been meticulous about hand-washing and sanitizing. I should not have to derail my entire life because other people aren’t willing to do these things. </p>
<p>Do I get the flu shot every year to try and do my part to minimize spread? Yes. Do I stay home when I’m sick? Well, I will now; I just haven’t been sick in a very long time. But that’s at a low cost to me. This BS we’ve been putting up with since March is <em>not</em>. And yes, I care about the cost to me. My dad’s small legal business is getting wrecked. I lost my software engineering job. I’m done playing this stupid game.</p>

        <p>Sounds like Grandpa lived a full life, and already cheated death once. If he wants to he can hide in his home for the rest of his life for all I care, I'm done making sacrifices. Other people deserve to not have their lives and hard work destroyed just because some people suddenly can't deal with the idea of dying a natural death at a normal age.</p>

        <p>Oh, but YOU get the right to decide that millions will get pushed down into poverty, that millions of children lose out on an education, that others suffering from cancer and other medical problems can't get screened or treated anymore, and that god knows how many people are on the edge of losing their homes and life's savings that were dependent on their small businesses? THATS how society works all of a sudden? You NPCs can fuck right off with that.

        <p>It means that people are sitting by their TVs waiting with bated breath for the talking heads to tell them when the risk is gone so they can pretend they analyzed the statistics and calculated that risk themselves, just like they are now. World renowned epidemiologists have already stated the risk is isn’t worth the damage of the precautionary measures that are being forced on us, that this isn’t a pandemic but an epidemic.

        <p>It is unconscionably evil to threaten people with lockdowns because of mask noncompliance. That is undemocratic and quite frankly abusive. It’s not like they’re threatening us with fines and such, which is a normal response to noncompliance — they’re threatening to destroy lives due to noncompliance. And yes, I mean destroy lives: hundreds of thousands of people will die of suicide, overdose, alcohol poisoning, domestic violence, starvation, etc. And for what? To make a point?? That’s criminal.</p>

        <p>Ah. I wouldn’t be surprised if that were the case (primarily referring to your latter statement). The trouble is, to me this sort of threat just feels kinda manipulative, i.e. be good or else we’ll punish you again. Maybe that wasn’t the intention, but I don’t think politicians should have that much control. Lockdowns set a dangerous precedent IMO. Costs outweigh benefits. But, I suppose I’m getting off-topic. </p>
<p>In your opinion, if everyone wore masks: would you consider it ok to open up everything fully? Also, would distancing still be necessary? Just trying to gauge people’s opinions on this sort of thing.</p>

        <p>Depends on what you mean by "open up everything fully." If you are saying all businesses could at least <em>open</em>, I'd be willing to try it as long as masks are always worn correctly except for stuff like eating and drinking. If <em>all</em> restrictions besides masks were thrown out, I wouldn't be on board with that. Some places like restaurants require customers to take off their masks when eating. If we open to full capacity and too many people are around each other at a time where masks can't be worn, that could be a very easy way for the virus to spread.</p>

        <p>I wear masks too. On its own, I agree it’s just an inconvenience. When coupled with indefinite social distancing, travel restrictions, loss of cultural events, lost educational opportunities, and lost hopes and dreams and livelihoods, it’s a helluva lot more than that.</p>

<p>A. another mild inconvience. </p>

<p>This is what cracks me up, you guys call us all doomers and talk about how afraid we are of this virus but the one thing you keep making abundantly clear is it has nothing to do with <em>us</em> being afraid of the virus and everything to do with <em>you</em> being afraid of change. </p>
<p>No one is enjoying this, the things you mentioned are unpleasant for EVERYONE, this difference is some of us are willing to suck it up and quit acting like spoiled children about it.</p>

        <p>&rt;Who has lost educational opportunities? Do you think people can't learn things unless they a part of a crowded classroom? </p>
<p>Just chiming in here to say yes, there are many people who cannot learn outside of a classroom, or at least whose opportunities for learning are drastically diminished if schools are not open.  In an ideal remote-learning world, everyone would have equal and stable access to computers, high-speed Internet, and whatever programs or tools needed to participate in and complete their school assignments.  </p>
<p>Of course, we know that's not the case.  Even in a single class of 25 or 30 students, there's typically a wide discrepancy between those students in terms of access to those things.  Some students go home after school and get on the computer to do their work, while some of their peers have to rely on computers at the school or local library to complete their assignments.</p>
<p>Now, that last paragraph is about physical classes.  Remove the physical part, and now everything must be done remotely.  That first group, the students who have easy and unlimited access at home, will generally be fine.  Their peers?  Not so much.  If schools are closed, so is access to the computers there.  Maybe libraries are still open, but in the age of lockdowns and social distancing, it's also entirely possible that they aren't. </p>
<p>This is to say nothing of other parts of education that rely on physical presence, like hands-on learning, science labs, purposeful group work, and others.  </p>
<p>I have no interest in engaging with your other points right now, but I couldn't let slide the notion that nobody has lost educational opportunities.</p>

        <p>I disagree with a lot of things said on this sub: I think face masks are a very minor inconvenience and don't get why they are so controversial, and I think social distancing in places like the streets and supermarkets is also a minor inconvenience. Furthermore, travel bans are only temporary and short-lived, as inside Europe travel has resumed between most countries once case expansion has been controlled.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, I don't believe social distancing is free either: If places like bars, restaurants, nightclubs, theatres, etc. have reduced capacity for a long period of time due to social distancing, as it seems will happen, then this will inevitably either affect the consumers or the businesses, as it's an inevitable consequence of offer and demand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also believe education will be affected badly if it has to go be done online for a long period of time. At least the software I have been exposed to simply doesn't allow the same kind of fluid communication patterns between students neither inside nor outside the class times. And I believe this is a fundamental problem and not simply a limitation of the software than can be overcome. Formal education is more effective and motivates students much more than self-learning. Furthermore, I don't know if this has just been my experience or if it's a general pattern, but the classes I have taken this semester have been pretty hasty, as if the teachers were unmotivated and wanted to get over the job as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About the "and lost hopes and dreams", I agree that it sounds melodramatic, but I think there's a background of truth: A lot of people are not able to see their friends with the same frequency or search for a romantic partner as they used to. A lot of people in this sub are young, and I understand the prospect of spoiling a good chunk of their youth in this way is daunting.</p>

        <p>My first thought reading your comment about social distancing being a minor inconvenience was : Did you ever HAVE a life? And then I read further and found out you are some kind of student, so I'm going to guess you are from some kind of helicopter parent background, or something. Otherwise you would not think social distancing was a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p>You know that social distancing is not a minor inconvenience if you have ever:</p>
<p>Had friends, made friends, made acquaintances, gone to a restaurant, gone to a deli, taken a IRL class that is participatory, done something in a group, taken a bus / train / plane especially on a daily basis, lived in a city (!!!!), carpooled, did or watched sports, had a job (!!!!), ... I can't even go on, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>"Social distancing" is not compatible with life, much less with modern society or industrial society or jobs or functioning at all...</p>
<p>I'm sorry to get personal but "social distancing" being a BIG PROBLEM in EVERY facet of REAL LIFE isn't something you have to thoughtfully consider.</p>

        <p>I am indeed a student currently, but I don't believe I am an helicoptered child. Rather the opposite, I left my parent's home way sooner than most people do in my country , where many or most don't even do it during their studies. I have been financially independent from my parents for 5 years and counting.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Probably I am below average in the amount of social interaction I normally do, but I have done pretty much everything who mentioned. Including living in a city and holding a job, both things for years.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe I wasn't very clear in my post. I pointed out that I find social distancing in supermarkets and streets is not very inconvenient IMO, since in those situations you're mostly among strangers. But among friends and relatives, yeah, social distancing would suck. I say "would suck" because most social events are not happening anyway, and when something does, in my experience, people don't do much social distancing anyway among groups of friends. It's like an unwritten rule, it seems.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am currently not living in a big city and there haven't been so many cases where I live right now, so maybe I'm just in a bubble. I'll be moving to a huge city soon which has had a lot more cases, so I may have a "culture shock" there...</p>

        <p>I’d say it’s fair to be upset that your hopes and dreams have been affected. Just read the consequences on your life megathread in the other sub. People have lost job and internship offers (in some fields, you pretty much HAVE to intern or you’ll never get a job) and/or may own a business that had to close forever or is suffering financially with still no timetable of when they can fully reopen. </p>
<p>And while they can apply for other jobs in the meantime, that’s not to say they’ll be hired in a crowded job market. They may have to take a significant pay cut just to keep working. They could try to change industries but would have to compete against others who are already experienced in the new field they pick. </p>
<p>Yeah I would say I have no problem with people being worried that their futures are heavily affected.</p>

        <p>&rt; I think face masks are a very minor inconvenience and don't get why they are so controversial, and I think social distancing in places like the streets and supermarkets is also a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p>This comes down to the person.</p>
<p>I am fairly extroverted and really vibe off the people around me. Masks and social distancing have been really hard on my mental health. Not even that I have to wear them so much as being surrounded by people wearing them. Being surrounded by people that I can't tell what they are thinking or feeling because I can't really read them. </p>
<p>I tell a joke at the cash register, does it look like the cashier found it funny or is annoyed? I accidentally cut someone off coming around a corner, do they smile about it and let it go, or are they pissed? Someone is approaching me like they are about to say/ask something, are they doing so like they are upset or happy? This person looked at me as they passed, did they smile or grimace? What the fuck is happening right now? Am I being funny or making an ass of myself? Are they being nice or are they being mean? with the mask on, I don't fucking know.</p>
<p>Being an extrovert, it is the most normal thing in the world for me to engage with strangers. With the mask hiding their demeanor from me, I have no clue if they are receptive to it or not, so I just never say anything which depresses me pretty bad. I am collapsing in on myself and quickly becoming introverted against my will and it makes me feel alone and isolated and depressed.</p>
<p>If I feed that hard off of strangers, imagine how affected I am by someone I care about, like my wife. I throw out a suggestion to my wife in the store and can't really gauge her reaction to it aside from what she says. Or if she goes along with something I want to do, is she having fun or does she look bored? I see her looking at that dress, is it that she likes it or that she thinks it looks weird or is she just looking? We all have those times were a person says "Sounds good" but their face says "i'd rather not though". Or vice versa and they say "I'm fine not doing that" but their face says "But I'd really like to". I can no longer pick up on that when we're in public and become insecure and worry about whether she is happy or not. Or I try to give her a reassuring smile in a stressful situation but it is just gone, or she does the same to me. All kinds of little forms of non verbal communicating built over a 15 year relationship are diluted and restricted and it feels like there is this barrier when we're in public and both wearing masks.</p>
<p>Wearing the mask also fucks with me a bit and can make me panicky. I've always been that way though. I remember being in the military and doing gas mask training and that really fucked with me, but that was much worse, but still comparable in the feeling. Even this would be a thousand times more bearable if I wasn't already being fucked with and feeling isolated by everyone around me being masked, but the isolation feeds the panic and the panic feeds the isolation. Now I can last about 15 minutes in a store before my stress levels are through the roof and I just want out. </p>
<p>That is not a minor inconvenience.</p>

        <p>Yeeeeup. I’m selfish. I have no problem admitting it because I am not responsible for anyone else’s health.</p>
<p>Can you just fucking imagine how many people alive would be responsible for murder if you tallied up all the people who’ve gone to crowded places with a light sore throat during flu season and most likely spread a germ that ultimately ended in someone dying from it? And old people PLUS young babies and kids are far more susceptible to the flu and actually dying from it. No one wonders who spread it or who was responsible. That’s not a conversation people have.</p>
<p>But I’ve literally seen people say that someone who doesn’t wear a mask or goes to a restaurant and potentially, unknowingly spreads Covid should be charged for murder. DOES ANYONE HEAR THEMSELVES?!?!?! I would rather get covid than the damn flu. The flu took me way closer to death than covid and I was 10 years younger when it almost did me in. Covid was a 3 week nuisance that felt like prolonged bronchitis. At least I wasn’t delirious with a 105 fever.</p>
<p>I am not responsible for anyone’s health. It is not my responsibility to RUIN my life for a stranger. I have given up everything. Everything I lived for, that made working hard worth it, that gave me a zest for life, that gave me something to look forward to, has been taken. Time with my niece that I can never get back has been taken, and I was really goddamn excited to hold that kid and be there for so much of her infancy but nope. Taken. For complete strangers, a huge amount who wouldn’t just as soon succumbed to the flu. Sure there are outliers regarding Covid. No doubt it has taken some prematurely. Shit like scarlet fever still swoops in and kills otherwise healthy 35 year olds sometimes. We don’t take everything from the population when that happens. </p>
<p>The people who are most scared just seem to regurgitate the same lines and they seem so completely mentally confident in their decision to give up absolutely everything and getting that pushed on me is mind numbing. I am selfish and I am so fucking tired of being asked to give up my life because someone else doesn’t want to take responsibility of their own perception a current event and personal risk assessment.</p>

        <p>Tell these people to straight up fuck off. It’s a hard road ahead of us. Mask hysteria is only growing stronger. I won’t have the government tell me what I need to put on my face. That’s my line and I’m happy for it to be the hill I die on at this point. It’s not selfish. That’s the wrong understanding. It’s selfish of other people to expect you to wear a mask so they can feel safer. </p>
<p>Tell me what is selfish about not wanting your government to push our lives slowly into dystopia? It’s the opposite of selfish. In 20 years time they will also be trying to claim they knew it was all a load of rubbish. Humanity needs us right now. Don’t let the hoards of idiots make you think otherwise.</p>

        <p>One wonders why the public health response to Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and Doritos is not the same as that to Covid.</p>
<p>I am sincerely in asking the question. Modern society is full of slow lethality but as long as Big Money foists it upon us, government ain't too worried (in general).</p>
<p>Here's a thought: would the population be more upset if a) the government mandated mask wearing at all times or b) the government said potato chips and sugar soft drinks are now illegal?</p>
<p>Why is the former more supposedly "justified" than the latter? As with all arguments about freedom, at some point you really do have to ask "where does it stop", and with what I see of government policy in the western world now, <em>they are never going to stop</em>. The European Union is a great example. Democracy has been, and will increasingly be, a meaningless fig leaf while unelected bureaucrats creats regs for <em>everything</em> such that an individual is a complete subject of both large guv and large corporations at the same time.</p>
<p>The truth is that if a small businessman had just invented potato chips last week, or shall we say invented the concept of snack food, there is some chance the guv would make snack food illegal or regulate it to death for the good of public health. But since big corporations own this space, the government has to exert power against easier targets.</p>

        <p>I do, despite being a western Canadian lol.</p>
<p>So, where were leftist "right action" types on that one? It's a regressive tax on lower income people including undoubtedly disproportionately Black people, yet it is surely a "government 'right action'" from their POV. I can't guess where they would fall on that issue. Probably silent, which is what happens when their principles lead to internal conflict. (Same way big media truly doesn't on report on some stuff.)</p>
<p>It is interesting to imagine a bunch of rabid progressive lecturists shaming people for drinking Pepsi. And entirely reasonable to imagine it, I think, until they realize half the people they're shaming are Black.</p>

        <p>I always think it's funny when I see people wearing a mask in the store buying cigarettes (not a rare sight since masks are mandatory in most stores where I live). It's like, you're so afraid of getting a virus that attacks the lungs, but you're evidently not afraid of getting cancer, COPD, heart disease, stroke, or any of the other countless diseases caused from smoking. Or maybe you are afraid of those things, but you just don't care because "quitting is hard", which I don't buy at all because many people have quit smoking before. I was a social smoker and quit back in 2016. There's a shit ton of products and resources out there to help you. </p>
<p>Plus, there's secondhand smoke which exposes several other people to inhale toxins from your cigarettes and cause cause significant health problems for them somewhere down the line and that's not seen as selfish, yet some random person not wearing a mask in the store is selfish? It's just pure irony. You're afraid of a virus while indulging in one of the worst habits a human being could possibly indulge in from a health perspective. And no, I don't think that cigarettes should be banned because people should be allowed to make their own choices, even if those choices are risky, but it's just the fact that the irony is completely lost on these people that astounds me. </p>
<p>Besides, human beings are selfish to a fault. Everyone has done something selfish at some point. It's part of our evolutionary drive to survive. Occasionally, someone does an act of selflessness and it makes headlines, like that Glee actress who died while saving her son from drowning, but for the most part, a good majority of people wouldn't stop to help some random stranger who is in trouble. Someone could have stopped George Floyd's murder by forcing that police officer to get off of him, but they didn't because they're selfish and would rather watch a man die than be charged with assault on a police officer. It's probably one of the biggest flaws in our species, but it is what it is. Sometimes being selfish is okay and other times, it is harmful. It's just dumb to shame someone over it when it is a character trait that damn near everybody has.</p>

        <p>I don’t feel strangers’ health (and the health of their families!) is my responsibility. I wear a mask in stores and don’t make a scene for the Facebook camera. But the way I see it, I’m responsible for myself and my family’s health. It’s not my problem to alter my entire way of life because of the grocery store worker or the Domino’s delivery driver who could get the virus and go home and give it to an immune compromised parent. </p>
<p>No one except a very small select group of people has cared how much being alone during the shutdowns has made me depressed. Why should I care about someone I may see once in public and never again? Everyone needs to decide what risks and precautions they want to take. I shouldn’t have to make months worth of sacrifices because the lady who lives down the street from me who I’ve never talked to might be afraid of COVID.</p>

        <p>This has been my stance from the start. I don’t worry about COVID because I take excellent care of myself and so does everyone in my family. Those that are truly worried should have spent their time in quarantine changing their bad habits. I’m not responsible for other people’s health and wellness. If they want to be obese and lazy and smoke or whatever, so be it but be prepared for the consequences.</p>

        <p>I wish the majority was selfish like you, seriously.  </p>
<p>The only reason I wear a mask because I would not be able to eat or get what my family needs without it, and that includes my job (the one day a week I work in the office).   That's it.  I rip off the mask when possible.  What a bad time for me get a new heart valve, to start anew only to run into this shit.    </p>
<p>Also, I'm not afraid of handshakes and hugs; two things I think are needed the most right now.   </p>
<p>When did caring about humanity and wanting to be human become so "selfish" and demonized?   I'm sad of what this world has become and I no longer want to be part of it under any circumstance.  </p>
<p>I'm also tired of the political nonsense especially on the discourse on social media.  I plan to almost completely  withdraw from social media, limiting time to just mathematics and astronomy.  </p>

        <p>Whatever happened to "you shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm?" I'm not torpedoing my life so some monstrously obese person who has never cared for his health can feel better about gorging himself on chips and soda. I've put in the time and care to keep myself as healthy as possible and it's not my problem other people refuse to do the same.</p>
<p>I've been selfish in the following ways: tugging my mask under my nose when it gets too difficult to breathe in the summer heat, quitting the gym over their mask policy, going out to eat in restaurants, seeing my family, and booking a vacation to the opposite side of the country.

        <p>By the 'selfish' logic all the lockdown idiots keep spouting, anyone who drinks alcohol and contributes to the drinking culture that kills millions per year around the world is selfish. If you weren't selfish you would stop drinking and demand a permanent ban to alcohol. </p>
<p>In my opinion we are all responsible to some degree for each other, but not at the cost of personal freedom/personal responsibility. I don't demand everyone around me stop drinking, but I will draw the line if someone wants to drive blind drunk. In the same notion, I agree with the notions of staying home if sick and not going around coughing in people's faces, but I do not agree with forcing healthy people to wear masks or stay inside and stop living their lives or earning their own livelihood because some people are shit-scared of a a virus.</p>
