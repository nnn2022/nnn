    <strong>Update as to how regions of the US are doing outside the hot zone and/or lockdown trigger happy cities [Bay area, LA, NYC, Detroit, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Madison and Twin Cities]; how are they functioning?</strong>
    <p><p>I've done this before as part of a routine inquiry on how American states are doing and figured I would do another inquiry as to how US states, including those in more shutdown happy states outside the most problematic cities, are functioning.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So this would include the Midwest, the South, Texas and Florida as well as Upstate NY, Northern California outside the Bay Area, Michigan outside Detroit, Illinois outside Chicago and so on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What is the culture currently like in terms of fear of Covid?  Are businesses being coerced into closing or having limited capacity or are in regular fear of being shut down?  Are they at a point where most of the businesses that were open before the pandemic are functional?</p>
<p>And what is ublic feelign about this?  Are they operating as if this is genuinely Spanish Flu 2.0 ?  Looking to shame  others for not staying home all the time except for grocery and pharmacy purchases?</p></p>

        <p>The last I’ve seen is mayors and governors around these places are gradually lifting lockdown restrictions and business closures... Right after the inauguration of Biden. Doesn’t seem suspicious at all...</p>
