    <strong>The simplest example about why masks don't work</strong>
    <p><p>If you have ever worked in a body shop or are familiar with it, the people sanding cars wear an N95 mask, because it keeps the dust out. An N95 would never be acceptable to wear in the booth when you're painting a car. 
A respiratory virus is much more akin to the paint vapors than the dust from sanding. So why does anyone pretend that N95s are the ultimate protective mask, or even defend that something less effective has any meaning at all?</p></p>

        <p>I literally had a store employee pinching his store-issued-and-branded cloth mask to direct attention at it, while yapping at me that IT is the reason nobody who works at the store got the flu this year, all while it kept falling under his nose the entire time. Twice I waited a few seconds before just interrupting him to say "you know your mask isn't covering your nose right now right?"</p>

        <p>I agree on the mask thing but I do have to say that I think they have different ones that you buy at the hardware store for construction stuff from the medical grade ones that you would wear in a hospital. But no matter I feel the same way. People are not wearing masks correctly and now they have these idiotic nose masks that they want us to wear while we are eating. Can't even believe that sentence came out of me but there you have it. Enough with this bullshit. I wish more people would start resisting and stop doing this. It's not going to go away until people stop complying. They're going to keep cranking this nonsense up and people are so conditioned to it they're just letting it happen.</p>

<p>Because it's all symbolic, and it's all theater.  It's not a filter, it's a flag.  It doesn't protect from virus, it's a social control device.  When politicians ask us to mask -up, they are trying to invert the relationship between us.  They work for us, not the other way around.  But now they want us to do what they say, and to trust them implicitly, like a doctor.  But they're all a pack of liars, and we already knew that.  To make  matters worse, now doctors, who we used to trust, have turned into liars, like the political class, because this is all a coup - an attempt to get their needles under your skin, because that's the last surface on the Earth that they don't yet have control over.</p>

        <p>An N95 isn't the "ultimate protective mask". I'd recommend educating yourself on respirators and masks. A P100 is rated higher in efficiency, at 99.97% and you have PAPRs and APRs with even higher efficiency with filters being used. </p>
<p>An N95 cannot filter out paint because a lot of paints are oil based. You'd need to find an N95 that is oil rated, either an P95 or R95. But typically someone painting cars (not your uncle cousin Leroy) would wear a respirator. </p>
<p>Your post is fucking stupid and it shows you lack enough brain cells to understand the basics.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to get into your whole rant there, but I didn't myself say an n95 was the ultimate. Thats what the general public keeps repeating. 
I've worked in the automotive refinishing business my entire adult life and have been a spray tech myself,  so I get the respirator thing. We use a PAPR in my shop. 
Also,  a good portion of that was working in an automotive paint store where I literally mixed the paint,  and no,  modern auto paint is solvent based.</p>
