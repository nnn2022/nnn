        <p>Civil disobedience. Do what Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, and MLK did. At the time, many people looked down on them as they are us right now. In the future though, everyone will see we were the reasonable ones during this shitshow.</p>

        <p>Are you so desperate not to be "controlled" by your government that you blindly refuse everything they say? Maybe you should think about the reasons for things before going "hurr durr gubmint can't tell me what to do"</p>
<p>Tell me what rights are being infringed. Tell me one thing that's even remotely comparable to what MLK et al. we're fighting against.</p>
<p>Covid-19 is a pandemic. An international crisis. Hospitals are full and people are dying in the hundreds of thousands if not millions. What do you think we should be doing?</p>
<p>Imagine what people like you would be like during WWII. Another international crisis. Blackouts? Rationing? You'd refuse to see the bigger picture and whine about your own petty selfish wants. "Daddy government can't tell me not to run around outside during an air raid sweetheart!"</p>
<p>This is a horrible thing that's been visited upon us all, and people like you are making it worse and just prolonging the agony. All because you're more scared of looking like a government bootlicker by following simple common-sense restrictions that save lives and protect healthcare workers than looking like a selfish contrarian moron by flat-out refusing anything anyone says. Just because you "won't be told what to do". You've had a comfortable life up until now, with more rights and privileges than responsibilities, but nature doesn't give a shit about that. This pandemic exists whether it suits you or not. We've all had to sacrifice. You're not special. Grow up.</p>

        <p>Yep. Government shouldn't be able to force people not to go outside, that's exactly what I'm saying. If it was WW2 people would stay inside on their own choice. There's a difference between a virus that only kills old people and a bomb that dosent discriminate. There's a difference between the government reasonably telling you what to do, for example laws against murder technically tell you what you can and can't do.</p>
<p>Death by age percentage:</p>
<p>0-19: 99.997%</p>
<p>20-49: 99.98%</p>
<p>50-69: 99.5%</p>
<p>70+: 94.6%</p>
<p>Nothing i should be concerned about. Maybe grandma should stay at home? This has nothing to do with me looking like a "government bootlicker". I don't like being forced to stay inside my own home by force</p>

        <p>You should be concerned because you can still contribute to the spread of the viruses without dying from them. Old human lives are still human lives, and life is sacred. Your wanting to leave your home isn't. Stop whining and do your bit and it'll be over sooner.</p>
<p>That said, many governments have shown gross incompetence in handling a pandemic. Hopefully it's shown people that scientists and doctors should be in charge of public health matters, not career politicians, lawyers and demagogues.</p>

        <p>I'm not staying inside just because you tell me to. I wear a mask when I'm in crowded spaces out of respect because they actually do stop you from giving a virus you may have to other people, something i am under no obligation to do. Your health isn't my responsibility. Grandma should stay at home if she dosent want a less than 5% chance of dying for a virus she may not even get.</p>

        <p>It's not "just because I tell you to". Stop willfully ignoring the reasons behind things.</p>
<p>Grandma needs food and supplies too. She can stay at home, but viruses spread. Which is why we need to do what we can to minimise that spread.</p>
<p>My health isn't your responsibility, but the government is responsible for public health. Hence the government actions.</p>

        <p>Yeah thats why I don't care about the governments actions. I still went out and got as much excersize as I could during the lockdowns, it didn't actually affect me all too much other than not being able to go to my favourite places to eat. It will continue to not affect me, other than the times I chose to wear a mask out of respect of the people around me. If grandma wants her shopping so bad she should order it, like how regular people are forced to order from amazon because the shops they frequent are closed. Again its not really my problem, I'm not required to light myself on fire to keep someone else warm</p>

        <p>People have no idea of the damage done by a singular focus on a disease slightly more dangerous than the flu. It is current estimated the 1/3 of all excess deaths are caused by the response to Covid. Things like an estimated 6% increase in suicides of children as young as 9.</p>
<p>The global impact will far exceed the approximately 2.3MM deaths so far. </p>
