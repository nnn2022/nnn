        <p>Purely looking at the “death toll” isn’t really the right way of looking at it either. </p>
<p>The average person who dies from covid is 80 with multiple significant comorbidities. </p>
<p>The soldiers that died in WWII were almost exclusively young and healthy, in the prime of their lives. </p>
<p>These comparisons also ignore all the collateral damage, including non military personnel. Most estimates for total deaths attributed to WWII estimate the total mortality at between 60-80 million. That was 2.5%-3% of the entire population at the time. </p>
<p>Equivalent to around 200-240 million people dying when adjusting for today’s population. </p>
<p>WWII was about <em>100 times</em> as deadly measures purely by total number of deaths.. Again that is not accounting for the total years of life lost. When you take into account the ages of those who died, WWII was about 500X as deadly.</p>

        <p>I got downvoted straight to hell in my local subreddit for pointing out that that bullshit completely erased "collateral damage" (aka the murder of innocent civilians, including children), as well as deaths on the opposing side of war. Fucking despicable. I find minimizing and erasing the horrors of war to gas up a spicy cold to be the opposite of a virtue signal. Anyone who engages in it has made a choice to yeet their humanity and morality in favor of shilling for big pharma, the military industrial complex, and their discontents. Vile.</p>

        <p>To be fair, you also get down voted to hell for being an unapologetic TERF. Maybe folks would take you seriously if you weren't such a hateful bigot.</p>

        <p>Dude, you give off serious "I'm going to murder you for your skin" vibes. Log off and stop being an unrepentant misogynist. Doesn't matter which order you choose to do this in.</p>
<p>Also, most of my comments end up being positive scored. I know you obsess over internet points and me because you have literally nothing better to do than that, but seriously. Get a fucking life. You're fucking pathetic.</p>

        <p>The only way to count is years lost. Persons is tragedy for the family only. Even if it's sad to see some 89 year old actor die, not a big deal as it was coming anyways.</p>

        <p>I agree only looking at “deaths” is completely wrong. </p>
<p>These people seem to think that an 89 year old person dying of covid is somehow equivalent to a child or young adult dying. Completely absurd.</p>
