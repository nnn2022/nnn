        <p>As much as people hate Donald Trump, he's a businessman so he has some real world experience, unlike most elected.</p>
<p>And his covid restrictions are much saner than most of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The big issue with him, and the issue people have is the way he addresses himself. Thomas Sowell said that he turns off the TV when Trump is on, but he agrees with his economic policies and is actually among the better presidents.</p>
<p>People can hate you simply because of presentation, even if you have the best way of dealing with things.</p>

        <p>I stopped believing in the two party system quite some time ago. To me, it is an illusion, a show. Our elected officials play their roles as instigators. One side steps to the podium and tells their supporters to believe this. The other side steps to their podium as tells their supporters to believe that. Both sides head back to their tower and, together, laughing while they watch us peasants fight over which is side is right. </p>
<p>Whoever is president is the lead role. Every four years they act out their scripted play just well enough to keep most people believing its actually real. </p>
<p>I don't vote. Everything that is happening with the upcoming election, the trashed ballots, the mail in voting option, the millions of dead people on voter roles, it all happens during every election. We just haven't been lucky enough to see it front and center until this election. We have very little say in who ends up in any position of power that matters. It feels like we do, we are supposed to but, we don't.</p>
<p>If I were to vote. If I bought into the idea that we have say in who leads our country, I wouldn't care about their personality. I wouldn't care about how they dress or what they tweet. None of that matters. I would vote for the person who I feel will do what is best and right for this country and its citizens. I would vote for the one that I feel believes in most of what I believe in. </p>
<p>This is all that would matter to me. Party wouldn't matter at the end of the day. It just so happens that my morals and beliefs are considered conservative but, again, party wouldn't matter. </p>
<p>I am not looking for a best friend in a president. I am looking for a leader that is going to whats best for me, my family, every US citizen and for the country as a whole. </p>
<p>Sadly, I don't think we have had anyone deserving of my vote or the presidency in a very long time.</p>
