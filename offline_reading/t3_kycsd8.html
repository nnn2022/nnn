    <strong>We are sleepwalking into the new normal.</strong>
    <p><p>By locking us down every few months, we're making the new normal more "normal".   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But the reality is the new normal is here to stay unless we all do something about it. But no one wants to talk about covid anymore as it's too negative. But by doing this,  we're sleepwalking into the New Normal. I will admit I'm not an optimistic person. But I think that optimism can bring a lot of false hope, especially with something like Covid-19.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These lockdowns aren't working. With the new B117 strain here in the UK that spreads much faster (we are worse in January 2021 than we where in April 2020 in terms of daily deaths and new cases). But has it mutated because instead of building a herd immunity, we're just letting it mutate? There are also new variants in South Africa and Brazil. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Over the next couple of months we are going to see more and more mutations. Then one of these mutations that spread more quickly will then become resistant to the vaccine, then we are back to square one. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People are forgetting what "normal" is like. Realistically, we won't be able to go abroad any time soon. And even if we do, it won't be "normal" anyway.</p></p>

        <p>Well said. I wonder if the masses will ever realize? I think we will definitely know by Spring. That's within the time frame politically, after that it's for sure never ending.</p>
<p>However, it feels like way more people than the media lets on are actually fine going back to real life. With the narrative being so well controlled these days it's a toss up but I think a very healthy majority people are over it.</p>

        <p>Super pro democrat leaders (Lori Lightfoot and Andrew Cuomo) are already doing an about face on lockdowns.</p>
<p>In the US, they are basically throwing how much of a political facade this is in our faces.</p>
<p>Trump is gone, they want their economy to make them look good.</p>

        <p>Investment banks made record profits during the first 3 quarters of 2020, except the last one at the end of the year. I guess Wall Street is becoming unhappy about lockdown too and Cuomo is better to do something about it...</p>

        <p>I made huge profits in 2020 (20% gain as of last close plus dividends) as well.  Funny as a good portion of those was with a hospitality stock that had cut it's dividends in early 2020.</p>
<p>The stock market isn't hurting as bad as they say it is if one does proper research into company financials.</p>

        <p>Yeah the stock market is fine now but I feel they can't go on with more lockdown... Small businesses will crumble and it could hurt badly the real estate market in big cities. They already see coming a bunch of sour credit derivatives. Combined with some new radical inflation models it could degenerate more quickly than we think. I bet they want to avoid that.</p>

        <p>Just to follow up on my other comment:</p>
<p>https://i.redd.it/v87nfjuhomb61.jpg</p>
<p>The media is going to start downplaying the death rate and start to justify opening up.</p>
<p>Other nations will follow suit.</p>

        <p>Only for a while...</p>
<p>This is just politics, wanting to show that Biden has the best intentions for the people. After that, a new mutation or whole new Covid is 'suddenly' in the USA, which means lockdowns again.</p>
<p>Also, other nations (except maybe from South-America) do not look at the USA <em>at all</em>. Even if the US is out of the lockdown, Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc. are all running their own show.</p>

        <p>Well...I guess when they lift the lockdowns we should start doing some pre-emptive planning for the contingency of future lockdowns.</p>
<p>Of course...what reddit conservatives will do is sit on reddit and cry about the inevitable while the left go out and pre-emptively plan for the future and we will just stay here talking about how dumb they are and how smart we are.</p>
<p>I like this plan.  A sure winning strategy.</p>
