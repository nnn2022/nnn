    <strong>What kind of logic is this?</strong>
    <p><p>All along we've been told, wear your mask to protect OTHERS. Now, only unvaccinated people have to wear masks to protect the vaccinated? I have to wear a mask forever to protect people who are protected by a vaccine? If we are going by the original logic here, the mask wearers are protecting the non mask wearers. Isn't the vaccine supposed to be doing this? Why are people getting this vaccine? Yes I know.....it reduces symptoms and prevents death allegedly but really? A miniscule risk is enough to torment and control over half the population forever?  To think you have the right to force people to take an experimental vaccine with no long term data, not approved by the FDA and still in a clinical trial? Because of your fear... And your dishonesty. </p>
<p>Then there are vaccinated people who are afraid not to wear their masks because they don't trust unvaccinated people to not be taking advantage of being unmasked and they think unvaccinated people will be "cheating"? If you are wearing a mask because of this and the fact that you are scared then that means you never wore the mask for others to begin with you wore it for YOU. This is about YOU and your fear. You don't give a shit about others or you would be paying attention to all of the non covid problems that are destroying this world. </p>
<p>I was out earlier and went to a produce stand here in NYC for some vegetables (something they should be telling people to eat instead of free donuts, fries, burgers and beer).. Nearly EVERYONE still had their masks on and it's in the 70s. A vast majority of people in my neighborhood are vaxxed. I walked past a young woman in her 20s standing with friends on a corner eating ice cream together and they had their masks off because they were eating. When I came back from the store the exact same group was standing there and this time they all had their masks on and they were talking. I wish I could have asked them what the reasoning was behind this. Do you think covid is not going to attack you when you're eating? Do you realize that you've touched your face and mask a million times taking it on and off? Just so many questions here. And Now I'm being viewed as a tinfoil hat wearing Trump supporting Republican anti-vaxxer anti-masker because I never wear my mask outside.</p>
<p>When I sit here and think about all of the inconsistencies, flip flopping, random rules and orders with no solid facts behind them I want to scream. I cannot be the only person feeling this level of intense anger and frustration here. It doesn't even take a deep analysis or anything to see how stupid this is. Do these people even hear themselves? I expect the government to be tyrannical and make no sense but when I see ordinary citizens acting like this it makes me feel completely hopeless. They really think this is just about a virus. </p>
<p>Having a very bad night tonight and feeling like we will never get out of this. People are out of their minds. I wish there were places where people who are not terrified of life could live, thinking for ourselves and not following this crowd of lost terrified people. I am fine with the risk of illness and even death. I'd rather die while really living than be a shell of a person feeling like I am dying a little bit day after day after day like this. Part of me is hopeful after seeing some large cracks in the narrative, hoping maybe more people will start to realize this isn't what they thought it was and they will start waking up and resist. Then I go outside into this bizarre dystopia and my hope is dashed again</p></p>

        <p>You're not insane, they are.  People are just too stupid to ask questions.  That's all.  You're in a bad state.  I'm in a bad country (Canada).  But hey, aren't you happy that some states said fuck you to Biden and the CDC and dropped all mask mandates altogether - nevermind this vaccinated/unvaccinated bullshit?  I know it doesn't benefit you where you are, but at least it shows the insanity is not ubiquitous.</p>

        <p>That's true I hadn't thought of it that way. When you are surrounded with insanity and it's coming at you 24/7 it's really hard to see that not everyone is completely out of their minds. Where I am there are very few people that I encounter that are not terrified and running around double-masked up to their eyeballs. After over a year of this it really chips away at you. I wish I liked hot weather but I despise it, if I did I would have moved South by now to a more normal place. Honestly though I think if what the government wants is really pushed through it's not going to matter where you live at a certain point.</p>

        <p>I was living in brooklyn last year, never wore a mask on the subway, never outside, never anywhere but in stores.  Used to see people with literal gasmasks on in the subway.  People are insane.  Im hard libright and have always had a negative view of people as a whole, but rona has definitely convinced me a libright world is an impossibility.  People dont want personal responsibility, people dont want freedom, people dont want to live and let live, people want an authority to take care of them and make decisions for them and force others to do the same.  The vast majority of humanity is pathetic and disgusting.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you. I am so sad about all of this. I am glad I'm older and I had my youth when the world was normal. If I was a really young person I cannot imagine what I'd be thinking right now. I'm not afraid to die... I don't want to right now but I'm not fear based at all. I now see most people as overgrown babies who want the government to parent them. I heard a North Korean defector once say freedom is scary. Its a lot of responsibility if you aren't used to it. When the government controls you and you don't make any decisions for yourself you have less stress in a way. I see what she meant now.</p>

        <p>Exactly, the North Korean Defector who talked about it said for example if you decide you want to be a dancer you have to live with that decision for your entire life. It's a big responsibility. What if you made a mistake and you don't like it? You have pressure to maintain it to some degree if it's your career and you spent years training for it Etc. If the government makes the decisions for you it relieves the pressure of you having to take responsibility for your life.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. None of it makes sense but ppl just follow along. I seriously don’t know why. Why why why??? I am as perplexed as you. Twilite zone. I’m in Toronto Canada. It’s insane here. But I went to the protest today and 100,000 ppl were there (I’m guessing) and it made me happy to see all those ppl coming together MASKLESS. It really made me feel joy.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU. This has been pissing me off for days. I can’t wrap my brain around the fact that people want to force me to wear a mask so that I can protect vaccinated people. And if it’s for people who are unvaccinated, they can literally sign up and get a vaccine today if they want. That’s not my responsibility at all. </p>
<p>You are correct, by this logic of wearing masks to protect vaccinated people or people who choose not to get the vaccine, we would literally have to wear masks forever. At what point would they say we can stop?</p>

        <p>There are days when I honestly feel like they want me to go crazy. Especially living in New York City where I am, it's very intense. To not go along with all of this and to see through it is painful at times. People that are reality based and redpilled over this really deserve a lot more credit than we're getting. This is not the easy road to take. It's difficult to be aware of what's going on all the time. There are many days I would rather just be asleep over all of this like the majority of everyone else. I saw something somewhere that said 1% controls the world 4% are their puppets 90% are sound asleep. 5% know and try to wake up the 90%. The 1% use the 4% to prevent the 5% from waking the 90%.</p>

        <p>I have thought of that too..... Then I got to a point where I started thinking that they were letting the shedding speculation leak into mainstream media because that was their way of getting people that aren't wearing masks to wear masks and get vaccinated out of fear again . My mind is constantly spinning at this point, this is the biggest psyop of our lifetime. I feel like I'm constantly trying to figure out what the real reason is behind everything because nothing Is What It Seems!</p>

        <p>I have a feeling the intention is that the unvaxxed mask to protect the other unvaxxed or those still waiting for the shots.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my state ended its mandate completely... it's up to individual businesses now, so mixed bag.  My friends still plan on excluding and hating me forever unless I get the shot though, but I do have a health issue that makes that unlikely to ender favorably unless I finally replace my doctor and dope myself up.</p>

        <p>The way I see it, if we weren’t divided before, we are now.  I wouldn’t be surprised if unvaxxed people are physically beaten up and stoned like in biblical times.  I predict this will happen- unvaxxed people have to mask, vaxxed don’t.  Any place of business will be divided to the point where fighting will occur as unvaxxed people will be harassed and vaxxed people will be praised.  They will find a way to implement vaccine passports so only vaxxed people can go back to normal.  Again the divide is clear and it makes me sick.  I whole heartedly agree that if you are vaccinated, not only should you stop wearing your mask, you should also not give a damn if unvaxxed people choose to stay unvaxxed and not wear a mask.  The irony is any of my liberal vaxxed friends I’ve spoken to say they are keeping the masks on because they don’t trust unvaxxed people not to lie.  Umm..that literally defeats the whole purpose of the vaccine.  It’s nonsensical and I can’t take it anymore.</p>

        <p>Let me ask a question that I keep continuosly asking myself as I read a bunch of these threads on NoNewNormal.  Why do you all care so much about what other people are doing now?  Even in your post above, you talk about people wearing masks after eating ice cream bothering you, something that has zero effect on you or your life.  </p>
<p>is it really that hard for people to live their own lives now and worry about themselves instead of what others are doing?  If people want to continue to wear masks, great.  If people don't want to wear masks anymore, great as well.</p>

        <p>There is so much more going on here than just masks or no masks. This is about compliance and where that compliance is leading us into. Compliance without really even knowing why you are complying because your government and tv and social media tell you to. Thinking, using your brain and reasoning. I am not going to make a long detailed account about the events we have experienced this year, you lived it you know it. It's just two weeks, it's just hand washing , it's just social distancing , it's just working from home, church on zoom, no holidays with family, no hugs, no contact, just a vaccine, just a vaccine passport, let's just add all your other medical information, let's add your banking info etc etc. It's not just about the mask it IS about people waking up and truly asking themselves why am I doing this?what exactly is going on here? Why is the government telling me how to do everything from celebrating holidays to how I should be having sex (they have done this). That's why.</p>

        <p>The main problem I have with your argument is that for most of the items you mentioned, they released general guidelines on ways to stay safe and left it up to people to follow them or not (outside of state-funded instituitons or business which were required to follow social distancing and capacity limits).  Nobody was checking your hands to see if you washed them after the bathroom or walking into a store.  Nobody was stopping you from hugging your friends, relatives, or kids.  millions of families across the US had holidays together (myself included) albeit probably a lot smaller to protect the more at-risk family members.  Nobody is forcing anyone to get a vaccine, get a vaccine passport, or give up any banking information.  </p>
<p>Now you may disagree with some people's decisions in regards to how they chose to react to the pandemic but if you expect them to do only what you think is right, how are you better than the government you claim is trying to do the same?</p>
<p>That is why this whole mask mandate rant makes zero sense.  If you want to wear a mask, then wear one.  If you don't want to then don't.  People are free to make up their own minds and make their own choices (and it seems you are for people making their own choices, in sex or otherwise) and if that choice has no direct impact on you, then why care, just go on and live your life.</p>

        <p>You and I are on completely different ages. We will never agree on this. I am in NY. We DO have a vaccine passport and if I want to go participate in activities like concerts, sporting events.. I have to download an app on my phone and enter my vaccine info or get tested before and pay for it out of pocket. I cannot even enter a sports stadium or concert hall without this or any other business that has signed up to participate in this dystopian nightmare. . Our governor also made an announcement that he has decided we are not going to be following CDC guidelines after he has bragged about following them since the beginning. Vaccinated people are NOT "allowed" to take masks off here like the rest of the country. </p>
<p>My governor also made announcements that if there were more than the allowed amount of people at your house you would he subject to enforcement by police or Sherrifs. Some people reported their neighbors after seeing extra cars in driveways. People were scared of being fined or arrested. Several Towns upstate refused to enforce it and said it was unconstitutional but others went along with it.</p>
<p>There HAVE been lawsuits here from people who were being forced to take this vaccine in order to work. I imagine you will say well no one's forcing you to work there but you know what? In case you haven't noticed jobs are not easy to come by right now. As of now children are being mandated to take this vaccine in order to go to school.  Same thing with many state and with all state and city universities.  There are  no exemptions from this. They did away with the religious exemption and a medical exemption has to be a lot of rigid standards. </p>
<p>If you can't see that this is a very slippery slope and what this is leading to you we are just not going to understand one another. I honestly wish I was as laid-back about this as you are but living where I live I have seen some absolutely abhorrent abuses of power. People here have been terrorized for over a year now. Millions have left. Everyone is not in a position to pick up and leave and they know this. If it's happening here it will happen in other states.</p>

        <p>Not discounting any of your points above and some may be perfectly valid criticisms but it feels like we are 500 miles from where we started and it's tough to have a one on one discussion when what we are discussing keeps changing.</p>
<p>The original rant was around people who are still wearing masks and taking precautions.  I brought up the point that what does it matter, these people are doing things that have no effect on your life so just go on with your day.  The conversation then got shifted to compliance.  I pointed out that in your examples, many of those things were guidelines and not enforced (though as you mention some things like negative tests are now being enforced via the vaccine passport which is brand new).  Finally, we shifted to the current topic which is vaccine passports and government control.  If you had started off the rant here (which seems to be the true source of a lot of your angst) there could be meaningful discussions on the pros and cons of the system and discussions on each one of the points you bring up.  Instead, your original post insinuated that somehow people who are still choosing to wear a mask are the real problem, when in reality they have no effect on anything.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I don't know enough about NY's new passport system to make any kind of judgement on it and would leave something like that to other NYers who are more directly affected.  I would be willing to bet though that if I knew the new passport system in depth we would probably agree and disagree on a number of points and it wouldn't be one-sided.</p>

        <p>In the end their compliance DOES affect my life and everyone else's. If they would use common sense and logic they would see there is no reason to act like we did a year ago yet everyone here is still acting line this to a pathological degree.if everyone took their masks off the government could not enforce this anymore but they keep going along with everything they are told and this is how we have progressed to a two tier society here where those of us who are not complying cannot have a normal life. There is nothing good about needing to upload your medical records to listen to music or get into a random establishment. At the rate this is going here it could be even grocery stores at some point. Think I'm exagerrating? I guess you aren't living under these conditions. I am done. I am not going to continue connecting the dots here and explain myself in minute detail clarifying every word and meaning behind what I'm saying. A rant is a rant. It's not a discussion. If it was a discussion I would have flared it as a discussion.</p>
