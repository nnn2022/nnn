    <strong>Asymptomatic Transmission Studies</strong>
    <p><p>The question of asymptomatic transmission has been bothering me since the very beginning.  So I started doing some digging to find out where we came up with this ludicrous idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/id/documents/COVID/AsymptCOVID_TransmissionShip.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiXoOfox_PtAhWmB50JHdmeBGoQ6sMDMAJ6BAgGEAY&amp;usg=AOvVaw12aTQADK2o5SuvzH7kF9jM">This is the original Mizumoto study</a></p>
<p>Using the data taken from the Cruise Ship Diamond Princess, they conclude asymptomatic spread is not only possible, but probable.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, this is the same data set they used to determine the expected death rate of covid-19, which was also grossly exaggerated, but nevertheless was used on the mother of all fearmongering documents, the London Imperial College Report.</p>
<p>One may be forgiven for considering conditions on a Cruise Ship are not exactly representative of real life.</p>
<p>Now, here are the more modern studies.</p>
<p>September 1:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219423/</p>
<p><strong>"In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak."</strong></p>
<p>September 22:</p>
<p>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/09/studies-explore-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-racial-inequities</p>
<p><strong>"The investigators found that only 20% of coronavirus patients reported no symptoms at follow-up, and these patients appeared less likely than those with symptoms to infect others (relative risk, 0.35)."</strong></p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>This is a stark difference in understanding from the original document from February 20:</p>
<p>Of course, we also have the <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/news/asymptomatic-transmission-of-covid-19-didnt-occur-at-all-study-of-10-million-finds?fbclid=IwAR0AGG3xmf8G3tYbPL5Kpk6L5OHp8kGd7BDueemZnuidKgPu8UbjuSSGCKI&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Nature Communications Study</a> with which we are all familiar by now.</p>
<p>In other words, this "asymptomatic spread" nonsense, was gleaned from a study done treating Diamond Princess Cruise Ship data as real life data.  This was back on February 20, 2020.</p>
<p>From this study and this data set, our governments concluded we must lock down.</p>
<p>As early as September 1, 2020, and later on a number of occasions now, it has been shown asymptomatic spread is extremely rare.</p>
<p>Yet, we're still using the study from February 20, using data taken off a fucking cruise ship.</p>
<p>It is simply asinine to believe a perfectly normally healthy individual could suddenly become a vector for a deadly virus, so deadly you don't even know you have it, and one from which even if you do develop symptoms, you have a 99.97% survival rate.</p>
<p>And yet, that is exactly what we are expected to believe.</p>
<p>It is utter insanity.  I don't understand how people are still falling for this.</p>
<p>Folks, we're being played.  My advice for right now: Never Forget.  </p>
<p><strong>Never forget the liars and the criminals to humanity who have done this to our society.</strong></p></p>

        <p><em>Here are some more links if you're interested. I just cutout a section of my laundry list for the last comment.</em>  üôè  <em>I'm doing well, hope you can say the same</em> ü§úü§õ</p>
<p><strong>[START]</strong>
Everything¬† like Covid "cases" or "deaths" are literally based on a lie. One can look at either the case guidelines, the coding protocols, the 94% cormorbitites, contact tracing inventing cases, or the monetary incentives to begin questioning things. <strong>(all included and sourced below:)</strong></p>
<p>Blindly believing the MSM without doing any research is about the stupidest thing one can do, as they are legalized liars.ü§ò</p>
<p>https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736</p>
<p><strong>Sourcing w/ summaries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Covid Coding</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/covid19/en/</p>
<p>&rt;An emergency ICD-10 code of ‚ÄòU07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified‚Äô is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 <strong>where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Both U07.1 and U07.2 <strong>may be used for mortality coding as cause of death.</strong> See the International guidelines for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death following the link below.</p>
<p><em>so basically you can be diagnosed at anytime without a test, which is the opposite of how medical errors are coded:</em></p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error</p>
<p>&rt;Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch for the CDC, disputed that the agency‚Äôs coding is the problem. He said complications from medical care are listed on death certificates, and that codes do capture them. The CDC‚Äôs published mortality statistics, however, count only the ‚Äúunderlying cause of death,‚Äù defined as the condition that led a person to seek treatment.
<strong>As a result, even if a doctor does list medical errors on a death certificate, they are not included in the published totals. Only the underlying condition, such as heart disease or cancer, is counted, even when it isn‚Äôt fatal.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>i think the problem lies in people's unwarranted faith in the healthcare system, when it was designed since the prohibition of hemp/marijuana to become a "for profit" industry that creates patients rather than cures them. this makes it much harder for people to realize they are being lied to</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Covid Guidelines to determine cases:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html</p>
<p><em>so a test is not required for a positive case or a Covid death statistic</em></p>
<p><strong>Covid Case Guidelines</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>which states the same thing</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>aka if you display any common symptoms for any common illness (like a cough) or maybe went to a place where someone might have coughed, you could be determined positive through contact tracing. Contact tracing assumes all people are positive, due to potential asymptomatic cases which is why the case count is inflated</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death year after year according to an 8 year Johns Hopkins study (doctors are people too and make mistakes):</p>
<p>https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us</p>
<p>https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/</p>
<ul>
<li>covid case and death counts are inflated medical errors and assumptions! (as well as contact tracing which literally invents cases, as well as hospital's monetary incentives)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctors take bribes and kickbacks to prescibe medications, even if it's known to be deadly like Fentanyl, so why would Covid be any different:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/another-doctor-charged-taking-bribes-kickbacks-to-prescribe-fentanyl-alleged-insys-scheme</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-prescribe-more-of-a-drug-if-they-receive-money-from-a-pharma-company-tied-to-it</p>
<p><strong>convid</strong> https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/20/coronavirus-covid-medicare-payments-hospitals/</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄúThe idea that hospitals and doctors are falsely inflating COVID numbers and even putting patients on ventilators to drive up their payments is not just ridiculous, but it‚Äôs insulting to the doctors who are putting their own lives at risk,‚Äù said Joe Hanel, spokesperson for the Colorado Health Institute.</p>
<p><strong>interesting, because nationally, the next link shows how MAYBE 21% would be under the age of 65 and not on Medicare, everyone else was a senior citizen:</strong> <em>(38,000 out of 180,000)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>94% of Covid deaths involves 2.6 comorbities, is this akin to medical errors and they just report the statistics however they want?</em>
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</li>
</ul>
<p><em>this is just a continuation of dishonesty. Today we live off the byproducts of the oil industry rather than using hemp...which is why it and MMJ was made illegal...because corporate profits suffered. Following this trail, tobacco industries created the roadmap for funding bias in science and medicine, and it's never been trustworthy since. Nixon solidified "for profit" healthcare with the HMO Act of 1973 for his buddy Edgar Kaiser, then CEO of Kaiser Permanente</em></p>

<li><strong>PCR Testing</strong> (can go into more detail upon request but it's common knowledge they're BS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The PCR test is for research not diagnostic use.
<em>Dr Fauci</em> interview describing how PCR test can be innacurate and after the 35th cycle is pointless, which many doctors do. False positives are rampant. https://lbry.tv/@mkey:1/This-Week-in-Virology-Fauci:6</p>
<p><em>Look into how nefarious the company is that makes these PCR tests</em> and how their CEO(Rick Martin) was sued and fired (over the Florida fake tests), how their parent company, Baxter/Travenol, <em>historically has created illnessness to cure and has been sued over 7 times</em> for this...

        <p>Take a listen to what Dr. Fauci himself had to say back in the early days of all this nonsense: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1orSO094uY">The one thing historically people need to realize- that even if there is some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks.  The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.  Even if there's a rare asymptomatic person that might transmit, an epidemic is not driven by asymptomatic carriers</a></p>

        <p>I remember going down this rabbit hole months ago. What's super interesting is all the original studies from that cruise had nothing to do with asymptomatic spread but quantifying asymptomatic cases. From the article on the cruise ship: </p>
<p>"Currently, there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 asymptomatic persons can transmit SARS-CoV-2, but there is accumulating evidence indicating that a sub- stantial fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are asymptomatic [10-12]."</p>
<p>For some reason people conflate asymptomatic transmission with asymptomatic cases. The two are definitely not the same.</p>

        <p>From the Nature Communications study:</p>
<p>"With the centralized isolation and treatment of all COVID-19 cases during the lockdown period in Wuhan, the risk of residents being infected in the community has been greatly reduced. "</p>
<p>"Public health measures for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, including wearing masks, keeping safe social distancing in Wuhan should be sustained."</p>
<p>The lockdown and prevention measures contributed to the 0 cases of asymptomatic transmission.</p>

        <p>Are you a moron? You believe a part of the study you already agree with, and disagree with the part you don't. What's the point of studies then? Just keep believing whatever made up nonsense you want.</p>
