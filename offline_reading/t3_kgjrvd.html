        <p>I have bipolar disorder. 20% suicide rate, nobody gives a fuck, in fact people actively avoid me if they know so I don‚Äôt tell anyone. Yet I am supposed to suck it up and watch my life be destroyed by a virus that has a 0.0002% chance of killing me. I have never hated the human race as a whole as much as I do now, absolutely fucking pathetic sheep who are scared of death like children, everyone has turned into that neurotic overprotective 50 year old mom. Our ancestors would be utterly and absolutely ashamed of us, the meek have certainly inherited the earth and it won‚Äôt be long before it collapses under the weight of our collective cowardice.</p>

<p>Being meek isn't the same as being a weak coward. It means having self-control and getting royally pissed when it's necessary. If the population was meek, none of these atrocities would stand.</p>

        <p>Thank you!! I have bipolar as well and having just had a severe manic episode for the last week, I‚Äôve started to crash just as UK news announces Tier 4 and a cancelled Christmas. When I told my friend (who had a go at me for saying I‚Äôd rather live life than be holed up in my house for months on end because of COVID) I‚Äôm scared of what this depression is going to hold, he said it was ‚Äòjust a valley in the hills of bipolar‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him the suicidal thoughts have already started and if they continue, I may not see him again whether the lockdown has ended or not.</p>

        <p>Never thought about suicide until lockdowns. Was never even sad, actually. But I‚Äôve definitely changed.</p>
<p>90% of my friends graduated last year and I will never see them again. Every girl I liked at school was a year older than me and will graduate by the end of this year, and I haven‚Äôt even gotten a chance to talk to them. I thought I was attractive before the lockdowns, but I now have little hope for finding any relationship in the future. Intrusive thoughts of hurting innocent people and animals. Feels like I‚Äôve been living in a nightmare/Twilight Zone for the past 10 months. </p>
<p>If someone gave me a gun, by the end of the week I‚Äôd work up the courage to pull the trigger. If someone gave me sleeping pills, I‚Äôd take the whole bottle. If someone gave me the chance to peacefully euthanize myself, I‚Äôd do it immediately. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm being punished with solitary confinement, and for what? For how much longer? Fuck the weak-minded cowards perpetuating this shit. I‚Äôd say it to their faces if they ever left their basements. </p>
<p>No matter what advice I take to be happy again, I feel completely numb. Taking a walk in the middle of winter isn‚Äôt going to give me my life back. I‚Äôm not excited for the holidays like I was last year. I didn‚Äôt even ask my parents for anything, because what‚Äôs the fucking point? I don‚Äôt play video games or go to school anymore. All I do nowadays is stare at the wall fantasizing about living a normal teenage life.</p>

        <p>I feel you man. Most adults are disconnected from teenagers they think just because they like Video games they could just play them for basically a year straight with no In person contact/School when it does not work like that At all. It's because half of the doomers on reddit have that lifestyle they think they could just force it upon others and Critique them when they don't follow the rules. Me personally I can't even play basketball anymore because 1. It's winter in NY now 2. Covid but I could not even do it over the summer and even IF I wore a mask I still couldn't üòê. IMO I feel like this generation is just so depressed and sad most of the time and Social media is a huge cause I mean I saw it all around me even before Covid Kids are just Sad and depressed and I get I don't know what your going through but some people fake depression more than I've ever seen and it's sad and now you throw Covid on top of that. If you want my advice I've just Honestly started to not give a fuck and I try to voice my opinion around regardless of the pushback. Fuck Them bro Make your voice heard You are a person too not some machine you can just plug out for 9 months and expect the same machine Make your fucking voice heard üí™</p>

        <p>When I was 19 (I‚Äôm 30 now) I really really wanted to end it. I got therapy and can honestly say I‚Äôm so glad that i didn‚Äôt do it. Don‚Äôt want to talk to you like I know you or your situation but it will get better.</p>

        <p>I just hit 30 and haven't been more mentally stable. I think the demands of the modern world are rough on teenage brains. They receive so much contradictory influence and information that it's hard to keep up with what the world wants from you. The worst question you can ask a teenager is "what do you want to be when you grow up?" They're already grown up enough to need purpose but between 50 different influences they have no idea what they'd excel at.</p>
<p>tl;dr homie needs to chill. That whole neuro plastic thing sucks, my late 20's was like a breath of fresh air. Finally my brain made sense, the feelings and impulses chilled out and became manageable. If anything that should be a relief.</p>

        <p>I've had suicidal thoughts throughout most of my adult life, but usually they never lasted too long and I was able to overcome them. This year has been a completely different story. With everything that's happened over the last few months, these thoughts keep creeping back in more and more. I'm not at that point yet where it's getting really scary, and I hope I don't get there, but I'm desperately looking for positive news somewhere and they're becoming more and more difficult to find.</p>

        <p>I went through a serious trauma a few years ago which resulted in severe anxiety and depression. I seriously considered suicide and even had a couple plans. In writing. </p>
<p>But I started to realize that there‚Äôs no guarantee it would work. Plenty of people survive suicide attempts only to be paralyzed or scarred or some other awfulness for life. That and, who knows where our souls go after they leave this dimension? The other dimension could be worse than this because if you think about it, things can always ALWAYS get worse. </p>
<p>Think of all the bad stuff in your life and add paralyzation or 3rd degree burns or daily torture. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm being so negative but this reality hit me hard and scared me away from suicide. We really have very little control over our lives and what happens to us. üòû</p>

        <p>Every day is a battle. </p>
<p>I have BPD and mood swings are way worse when I feel isolated. It's a frustrating attachment disorder. While missing friends "for just a year or two" might make a typical person sad, I'm barely functional because I'm grieving them like they've died. </p>
<p>I also have agoraphobia, which requires exposure therapy to improve. I have to get out of my comfort zone regularly or I'll become a housebound hermit again. </p>
<p>If I lived alone, I already would have done it. I just don't want to traumatize my roommate. She's a good person.</p>

        <p>I'll put it this way: I'm a strong proponent of gun rights, but I've never owned a gun because I went thru 2 serious suicidal episodes pre lockdown. </p>
<p>I made an attempt on my own life in late June and I hurt myself really bad but I got lucky and I'm still here. Having realized right after this that I got lucky, it served as a wake up call and I've largely decided to persist despite the misery. By now in mid December, I dont actually feel better, I feel worse in fact and still have suicidal thoughts. But I'm not gonna do it for a few reasons;</p>
<p>Firstly, things very well may get better for myself and the world, but maybe they wont, I dont know. But that's the key, I don't know,  I gotta stick around to find out. Secondly, I do wholeheartedly believe in reincarnation and multiple lives, my thoughts on suicide is that you wont actually end the pain and suffering, you'll just end up reborn in extremely similar circumstances all over again to learn whatever lessons you're supposed to be learning here. Lastly, I'll fucking persist out of pure spite. You want me gone? Fuck you. You want to control every aspect of my life? Fuck you. You want to break me? Fuck you. The last thing you ever want to do is fuck with someone who has nothing to lose. And if you really want to kill yourself, you've got nothing left. So if they want me gone and my life ruined for their bullshit response to a flu like virus, I'll stick around to be the fly in their soup and make lots of noise with everyone else who wants to do the same. Even if it is the universe itself that is trying to fuck with me, I will gladly stick my middle finger high in the air and scream "fuck you" into the void at this point.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of box-breathing?  It will help you feel better and healthier.  It‚Äôs easy and you can do it anytime, anywhere.  Except don‚Äôt do it while driving when you first start.  </p>
<p>Anyone feeling down, please check <a href="https://nexusnewsfeed.com/article/health-healing/have-you-tried-box-breathing/">here</a>.  It‚Äôs easy and fun.  They should teach proper breathing in school, but unfortunately we are run by a bunch of nut jobs.</p>

        <p>The toll this has taken on my mental health is absurd and continues to be so. I'm always trying to move forward with something and found a supplement that helps me since I wasn't all there all the time anyways because of brain damage that I only recently got a little more under control. The depression is bad, every week is the same and super late holiday work hours are slaughtering my spirit. Less money, needing to buy masks I can wear more often that won't immediately make me ill that I feel such shame for even hitting the "place order" button on in the first place. Completely limited in where I can go in public and it's so stressful now just to go shopping in many places. There's little I look forward to anymore and it gets harder when the Winter limits you as it is especially when the snow starts comping down. I feel like I have no room to breathe anymore, this isn't a world I can live in forever.</p>
<p>The things that previously helped keep me together were weekend trips with a family member to a couple places I liked eating at that sort of served as a little meeting place where sometimes we saw other people we knew too. More mini road trips to visit stores to see if they had any interesting stuff or the mall just for the hell of it. Firepits outside with friends and family all year. More get togethers and communication in general which when that fell apart it's like the family isn't really even there anymore, everything is divided so much now unnaturally. This one has cut themselves off in fear of everything, that one doesn't want to associate with that one anymore, blahblahblah. Things that otherwise would never have happened if the plandemic didn't descend upon us.</p>

        <p>I'm going to break the mold here and say nah, I'm perfectly content.</p>
<p>I love my life. I have a lot of great things going for me overall. Despite unemployment and a fundamentally hermit lifestyle everything that I have brings me great joy. I have my cat, I love cooking, my house is cleaner and better organized than it's ever been. I probably reddit a bit too much.</p>
<p>Other people are other people. My wellbeing isn't dependant on other people's happiness but I do worry that things will escalate instead of improve. The virus is a joke. My parents believe they've already had it, and seem just fine. I think I've had it, I'm fine. There are bigger threats to my family's health and safety than this virus in our daily lives.</p>
<p>If anything the chaos has only proven to me what I already knew - most people take the path of least resistance and cognition. It's sad, but having a sub like this is reassuring that I'm not alone in seeing things for what they really are.</p>
<p>Oh well, enjoy life. Don't let other people tell you how you should feel any more than how you should behave.</p>
