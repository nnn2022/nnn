    <strong>A vaccine so effective and safe they gotta REQUIRE it as a term of employment...</strong>
    <p><p>There's already an extensive list of companies that are going to require the jab as a condition of employment and it seems to only keep growing... thus there's gonna be a SLEW of people who get vaccinated not because they actually WANTED to for their own health and safety (or for the sake of others if they live with and/or are caretakers for someone elderly and/or immune compromised) or even that their doctor advised them to do so... but because "no jab, no job." If they greenlight it for kids returning to school (which sadly it looks like it's to be so) it's going to be the same thing with them. Quite the timing with this, no? It just so happens right as unemployment is stopping, rent moratoriums are about to end, and their parents/guardians are worn out by having to homeschool them (especially if they still have to double duty as "essential workers") big pharma MANDATES these things so their kids can go back to school and they can go back to work... a vaccine that doesn't even GUARANTEE IMMUNITY and has had only about a year of actual TESTING... it's rather morbid that they think THIS is enough for the WHO and CDC to claim "There are no long term side effects!" I mean, point is "be a test subject for Big Pharma or no job for you!" Even the most oblivious BlueAnon SHITLIBS of 2 years ago would NOT be OK with this, yet here they are BEGGING for it, thinking it'd be such a GOOD THING... and over and over I just wish I could tell them "Be careful what you wish for!" "Beggars can't be choosers!" However, I could have it written as a prophecy on stone tablets carrying them with me down Mount Sinai and these shitlibs wouldn't listen or even care if on those tablets were also ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC DATA about breakthrough cases and VAERS reporting. Why? Because DISINFO BAD and MUH FACTCHECKERS... well, unless Jen Psaki and Dementia Joe are saying it!!!</p>
<p>I unfortunately was ostensibly forced into the vaxx... it was that or homelessness but after getting my first dose I'm not so sure it was such a hot deal. These side effects (while mild) really suck, and I can't even tell anyone else it's safe since people have been having TONS of different reactions. If I could go back, I would've rather been homeless instead... even if I had to give up most (or almost all) of my stuff, be starving, drift aimlessly across America to look for someplace pre-clown world that actually has the STONES to reject vaccine passports and take a very low-level low-paying job that at least doesn't vaxx mandate and do everything I can to support the Agorist markets that still support free banking... even if I had to move to a red state (I'm civil/social libertarian but feel both sides of politics have been irrelevant for a long time,) died starving or was the unlucky %0.02 to die of the plague, I'd rather that than be a test subject for big pharma. Many sadly don't even have the PROSPECT of this choice, especially if they have children and NEED to make that money... THAT'S what they do all the time... make it so the poor/working/middle class have no choice either through force (which is nigh impossible) or economically. I mean how the HELL do we know which high-ranking politician/scientist/celebrity even TOOK THE JAB for REAL? Yeah we might see it on TV or HEAR ABOUT IT on the radio or READ ABOUT IT in an article but it's like... I'm not smart but last I checked SALINE STILL EXISTS!!! How the hell do I know if it's THEATRE or not!? This kind of totalitarianism was predicted and predictive programmed many times... however I had no idea that an overblown virus would be the impetus to put a dystopia into place...</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, yeah. I know the quote, and yes, it's true. </p>
<p>My point is, it's pretty arrogant of people in this sub to assume their shotguns can withstand the military's fire power, and win. Waco is a pretty good indicator of how that whole scenario would go down, and before people here argue this, no, Waco was <strong>not</strong> a fucking win for our side. You'd have to be insane (which many here are, it seems) to believe Waco is an example of us winning.</p>

        <p>Oh no doubt, I concur with all of this... Not just Waco but I mean look at what happened to Bill Cooper (who I never liked... he was an unhinged, abusive, probably racist asshole) who with his massive weapons stash tried gunning down the Apache County Sheriff's Department that got called to his ranch because of tax evasions and threats of violence.</p>
<p>Point is you are correct, anyone who thinks they can out-gun the global elite and their expensive masses of military and firepower with their 9milli and boomstick is fooling themselves on a level beyond Hollywood fantasies. Sorry to those who think so, but it's true.</p>

        <p>Can a lawyer write a contract for anyone to bring as a counter negotiation stipulate that if the employer force you to do something to keep your job that they should in conterpart be reponsible to any illment resulting of the forced internal politic? That would be fun to see a dicution like, ok ill get your jab if you force me to do it but, because you force me, you will be liable to any consequences related to it...</p>
<p>make it short and understandable and presenting some point like this</p>
<p>something like this...</p>
<p>because the employee, to keep is job, is constraint to undergo a medical procedure suggested by the employer</p>
<p>knowing that the said medical procedure, as any medical procedure, imply risk</p>
<p>considering that the employee do not consider the risk of the said medical procedure being advantagous nor necessary</p>
<p>considering that the employee would not undergo that said medical procedure if it was not mandate by the employer</p>
<p>considering that the employee, has, for the duration of his employement, has been performing at least in a satisfactory manner and, if the context of the covid-19 was not in effect any demand of medical procedure would have never be done</p>
<p>and considerjng that the employee is ready to accept the demands of the employer to submit himself to the said medical procedure but, because it is the wish of the employer and not the wish of the employee, the employee cannot be hold responsible for the consequence of an act asked by the employer, </p>
<p>considering that the mandate of the medical procedure is of an extraordinary ask for an employer to an employee int the context of the work normally performed by the employee, the employer recognized the the cost and consequence of that medical procedure should be taken by himslef, </p>
<p>as a consequence, the employer is by this contract, legal and binding, take full responsability for any illment, lost of advantage, beit physical, psychological or moral, for a period on twenty years, relative to the medical procedure madated by the employer if suffered by the employee. In exchange  the employee will submit to the mandate and submit to the medical procedure of taking one of the generally authorized vaccine treatment before the date <strong><em>_</em></strong>__.</p>
<p>Like if you get a memo to get vaxxed, instead of saying no you send that contract (not this one but a real, well written contract made by my fantasy lawyer) and say ok, but as it was not part of our original agreement when you employed me, here is an amending contract for our work agreement...</p>
<p>No fucking employer would never ever sign that, but now, it could be argued that you did not quit the job because you did not accepted a vaccine, it the the employer that decided to terminate you because no agreement of the responsability of the consequence related to the mandate could not be attined which put the employer at fault, not the employee... (for unemployement benefit, etc.) I dont know, im not a lawyer... but if one stomp on this, does it make sense?</p>

        <p>All the links that do address this (that I've seen) say that the vaccine mimics the body's response to having a covid infection, and that the result is getting antibodies in the same way that surviving an infection would. I've seen comments from authorities saying it's still necessary to get vaccinated even after overcoming the infection, but not any clear reason why.</p>
