        <p>Once flu season is back up and running we might see some hard propoganda calling us plague rats and a threat to the "social contract". This summer is the summer to meet with like minded people and plan for what is most likely coming.</p>

        <p>Just another demonstration of how petty and worthless people are.  Basically, she's denying her husband and children the company of their family based on religious grounds.  </p>
<p>This should be cast in the same light as antisemitism.  No wonder "Suzanne" didn't want her real name used.  She's a horrible person.  People like  her are the ones who should be isolated from the rest of society.</p>

        <p>Here's a question that perhaps has been asked countless times, yet it is good to be asked again:</p>
<p><strong><em>If the vaccines work, why worry about the unvaccinated people around you?</em></strong></p>

        <p>I can confirm that i have vaccinated members of the family that are paranoid to the extreme. They do things like kick a package that has just been delivered into to garage not touching it until four days have passed. Masks are worn everywhere. </p>
<p>They won't allow unvaccinated folks over to their house. I haven't seen them in 2 years now and likely never will again.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my spouse has a normal non-paranoid family that we can socialize with. Some are vaccinated. Some are not. We all just get together normally now.</p>

        <p>Wow hold on: </p>
<p>"Everyone has to navigate their own comfort level and to advocate for <br>
their own personal safety and feelings of security," Tishman, <br>
vice-president of operations for the New York City-based Cobb Psychotherapy,<br>
 tells Yahoo Life. "That might look different for each person based on <br>
their own lived experiences, health history and personal beliefs and <br>
values. Everyone has had a different experience during the pandemic, <br>
some experiencing a higher level of trauma than others. <strong>It's important</strong> <br>
<strong>that we come from a place of understanding and not judgment when we</strong> <br>
<strong>learn of others' choices regarding their vaccinations.</strong>Â </p>
<p>"What makes one person feel safe may make another feel unsafe, and visa <br>
versa," she adds. "There are strong feelings involved as we recover from<br>
 the pandemic and it can be helpful to express what makes you feel safe <br>
and your own needs to loved ones, <strong>instead of projecting what you expect</strong> <br>
<strong>from others onto them."</strong></p>
<p>Fake news ends an article with a quote from a voice of reason. Personally, I actually find this refreshing to read - because it works both ways - we respect each others choices, as should have been the case from the beginning.</p>

        <p>Will an antibody test smooth things over in cases like this? âTesting also has a clinical role, given the varying symptoms of covid-19 and false negative results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, particularly when swabs are taken more than five days after symptom onset and sensitivity of RT-PCR tests starts to decrease.23 In May, the UK government announced that antibody testing should be offered to anyone having their blood taken who wants to know whether they have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if there is ânot a specific clinical indication,ââ <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3325">the bmj</a></p>
