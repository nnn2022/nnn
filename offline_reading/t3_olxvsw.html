    <strong>Something deeper than the virus itself;</strong>
    <p><p>Three weeks ago I got sick, had an elevated temperature, and work required me to leave and get tested (luckily my employer supports that vaccinations are up to the individual, not what the media says). My test came back negative, despite having all of the “symptoms.” Last weekend my sickness ramped up, started coughing uncontrollably, had a constant low-grade fever, and after a few days, lost smell and taste. I thought for sure this was finally Corona, after a year and a half of evading the “impending” virus.  Then, our babysitter informed us she tested positive for corona, and I had to text my boss. Had to take yesterday off, and have another test done. Today my results came back negative. I’ve now been coughing horribly for almost a week, cannot taste anything or smell anything, yet I’m considered safe to go back to work Monday. Here’s my theory; either 1) The tests are coming back negative so people spread the virus, thus, an increase in numbers, thus, incentive to push further shut-downs and mask-mandates, or 2) (Now this is where my conspiracy side may be getting the best of me) Perhaps, the loss of smell and taste IS the end goal, and the entire virus and vaccine BS is just to mask this. We know the vaccine doesn’t stop one from getting virus, and we know people can have the virus without having any symptoms (so they say). What if they’re trying to implement something that would affect our air quality, and without smell or taste (how 100% of humans detect a foreign gas/chemical) we’d never know. And, the people who haven’t gotten the virus, or the vaccine, would be saying “How do you not smell/taste that weird chemical?” And they would be called the new conspiracy theorists. I think the virus is a cover-up for something larger, and even more sinister. I may be crazy, which I’m totally fine with, but I’m convinced I have this virus, yet the tests say otherwise. </p>
<p>TLDR; 1) Tests are coming back neg. so virus spreads, thus encouraging shut downs, or 2) Loss of smell/taste is the main goal, covered up with corona, to implement some sort of chemical attack that wouldn’t be traceable by humans.</p></p>
