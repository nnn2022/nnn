    <strong>Question: why do people get angry when you say Covid is like the flu?</strong>
    <p><p>Oftentimes in conversation when I compare Covid to the seasonal flu people get weirdly upset. They immediately say that Covid deadlier than the flu and blah blah. </p>
<p>The assumption here is that I’m implying that the flu is completely harmless. I’m not. The seasonal flu kills thousands of vulnerable people each year. It’s just a fact of life. Before 2020 nobody ever talked or cared about this. Any reasonable person stayed home when they felt very sick (not that they had enough energy to be active anyway) and we didn’t put the entire planet under house arrest. </p>
<p>Saying Covid is like a flu is not downplaying the seriousness of it (to at-risk groups mainly). Why do people clutch their pearls when you even mention those two in the same sentence?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it’s to the point where it’s easier to stick with the masses for most people. Most everyone I know is not worried at all about getting sick, but worried about how other people  in the community will perceive them if they don’t wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Fuck have I ever grown tired of people who base their 'principles" and behaviour on merely <em>not being conservative / right wing / Trump Supporter</em>. At least where I'm at, it's always groupthink and allegiance to wokeshit and there's no greater social death sentence than 'conservative' (regardless of whether the label is actually applicable or if any particular policy provides better results). Fucking Canada.</p>

        <p>I don’t even think of it as a partisan thing. In America all this happened under trump. He allowed it. The opposition to tyranny are just vocal but they never do anything. All I want is the damn government to get out of my life.</p>

        <p>Because they're still stuck in March 2020. They were told covid was a lot deadlier than it really is and fully bought into that assumption. Thing is, both have similar symptoms, similar incubation periods, are spread the same way, and have similar periods of sickness. It's only natural to compare covid to the flu.</p>
<p>Yet they'll be the first ones to claim anti-flu measures helped against covid and Anti-covid measures eliminated the flu. Not only that but you'll hear many a comparison of the Spanish Flu.</p>

        <p>I bought it in jan 2020, was one of very few people wearing a mask at airports back then. 
Luckily i sought out truth and found it.
Now to their 'measures eliminated the flu' bollocks, their brainwashing is so strong that they don't ask themselves "why did the measures totally eliminate the flu but worsened clovid?". A simple debunk i use is reminding them that if i were to catch the flu pre-2020 and masked up, i wouldn't recover from it and would most likely die. 
I go to covidiots sub from time to time to see any admissions of being wrong, i don't see admissions (probably scrubbed) but they only seem to talk about us NNN champions, what a bunch of losers are covidiots.</p>

        <p>When you make a test that gives a 90% false positivity rate, a bunch of random stuff is gonna get tagged as symptoms.</p>
<p>That said, of course a loss of your sense of smell is a covid symptom. Because only people who can't smell obvious bullshit are falling for it.</p>

        <p>A prison is a sustainable way to live too, people live for decades there (not without "mild irritation", probably, but no one is going to care). The question is, do you want to sustain your life like that.</p>

        <p>Technically, "the flu" is short for influenza, caused by one set of viruses. Covid-19 is of the corona virus family, which causes the common cold. The cold is also caused by other viruses, but as far as I understand, they don't overlap with those of influenza. Obviously, it gets a bit confusing because "the flu" is often used interchangeably for the common cold and influenza.</p>
<p>As for why people get angry, I think others have answered that well. We're way beyond bringing logic and reason into the discussion.</p>

        <p>One thing that differentiates the cooties from regular flu’s, as per my experiences and the experience my dad’s bar buddies confirm, is pretty serious headaches reoccurring at intervals. Other than that, almost the exact same kind of sickness, you could just remain under the assumption that you have a cold and choose to treat yourself at home and you would be better off not trying to get shoved into isolation and forced to take the dose.</p>

        <p>Largely because it's not like the flu...</p>
<p>Yes both share many similar symptoms, and both can be transferred by air (aerosols and droplets releases while breathing or talking for example).</p>
<p>However, the flu is:
1. A different virus (influenza A and B, not SARS-CoV-2)
2. Has been around for a very long time, and as such we know much more about it and how to fight it
3. Has proven, readily available annual vaccines (3-4 strains typically targeted in shots/nasal srpay)
4. Less likely to result in severe illness
5. Had a lower mortality rate
6. Flu symptoms typically appear much sooner after infection (1-4 days) versus the more initially asymptomatic Covid19 that is 2-14 days, thus reducing chances of someone unknowingly spreading it.
7. By all reports (that I know of anyways, feel free to correct if I am wrong) Covid19 is significantly more infectious</p>
<p>Also, to help paint a better picture for the ignorant, the flu in 2019 infected 38mil and killed 22000 in the US, where as in 2020 Covid infected 16+ mil people and 290000 have died from it. Thats a VERY significant increase in mortality rate from infection.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: people get upset because it is both incorrect and very dangerous to treat Covid as if it is the same as the flu. Covid is, case in point, deadlier, newer, were still learning more and more about it, and much more of an impact on society (we've been in a pandemic for a year after all).</p>
<p>Post Script:
Not to downplay the flu however, and you are very much correct in stating that the flu can also be very dangerous if not treated seriously enough. That is why people if you feel sick, stay the fuck home and rest, cover you coughs correctly, and I genuinely hope that mask wearing while ill or during high risk times like known 'flu seasons' becomes a more common practice in America.</p>

        <p>Covid1984? How.... original.</p>
<p>Also, didn't say global. I purely spoke of US 2019 Flu reported deaths versus the US 2020 Covid reported deaths. Also even then let's say the estimated 0.23% is correct (not saying its not btw), still more than .1% especially when considering worldwide with covid there have been numerous ongoing strict lockdowns and with Flu people tend to just say 'screw it' and go about their daily lives. So we have one tgat has a higher mortality rate worldwide while much of the world has had some form of lock down in place versus the other that has a lower mortality rate when most of the world does not have a lock down. Based on that logic I think it would be safe to say one of those is not like the other.</p>
<p>People already treat the flu as 'no big deal' and as such then think 'oh the flu isn't a big deal and neither is Covid1984, its all blown out of proportion and people just need to move on!'. And then hey guess what all because my redneck family thinks is just some liberal hoax and no big deal just like the flu weve now lost 3 grandparents, my mom is 6 months down STILL trying to recover half her strength and my Aunt hasn't been able stand up for 4 months without intense vertigo. </p>
<p>COVID is a more serious threat, and while yes the Flu is also potentially very dangerous and yes people need to treat it with more seriousness, we need to be very careful on how we treat covid and compare it because the general public are a bunch of idiots, and we don't need them downplaying Covid like the do with the flu.</p>

        <p>Yawn. This argument doesn't match the facts. Even in the fucking states the survival rate is 99.68%. 99.68%! Your fear mongering doesn't work here. I never said it was a liberal hoax you dipshit. Explain how this is deadly af when according to the cdc you have to have 4 comorbidities to die from it and 95% of the covid "deaths" in the US are were over 80 and half of those were in nursing homes.</p>

        <p>Well, while I do appreciate being called a dipshit, having my personal  tragedies brushed off a fear mongering and inconsequential (and heavily alluded to as being fake - a true kind soul, you), and my comments being clearly unread and cherry picked (if you HAD actually read you would have realized I said MY redneck family called it a liberal hoax, not you...), it seems that with you're responses and my comments getting down voted to oblivion its pointless to keep going. </p>
<p>Despite your very crass attempt at clever comebacks, I do genuinely I hope you don't encounter what my wife and I did this past Christmas when our families made a foolish and costly decision. I know it may not seem like a 98% rate isn't a big deal, but when that 2% does end up being you or a loved one it hits hard.</p>

        <p>Ahhhh so sorry. My mistake. I didn't realize how clearly confusing my statements were. Here let me help.</p>
<p>ELI5 edition:
Things I said: flu bad. Covid worse. Should not compare, not the same. If compare, we need to be careful with how because people idiots and think flu not bad already, and covid is more bad then flu. Also, here is a personal story about what can happen when people think covid not bad. Because covid is bad. </p>
<p>Things I did not Say: government should take all our rights away. Being free is bad. We should all stay in little hole in ground and never leave and just let space lizards be in charge!</p>
<p>That was sarcasm btw. Since you didn't understand anything I've said so far I want to make sure you knew that, and all this was just stemming from an explanation about why people get mad when people try to compare the flu and covid when we really shouldn't.</p>
<p>Hope that helps. If not, well who really gives a fuck at this point.</p>

        <p>Do you believe that masks eliminated the flu this year like the “news” says?  Or is it more likely that there were still 30-40 million flu cases labeled as covid?</p>

        <p>Neither. And I'm not aware that the news (or anyone else either) that did say that masks eliminated the flu to be honest, though I typically get most of my news from AP news, occasionally NPR and Politico, and local stations. The bigger news companies I'm not a huge fan of so I don't follow them, too much biased cherry picking from CNN and MSNBC and Fox is... well Fox.</p>
<p>I do believe that masks do help prevent the spread of both the flu and covid, and I do believe (and I've read some studies though to be honest can't recall their titles as it was more of a passing read) about how the amount of flu cases were significantly reduced this year due to Covid precautions. But, the same studies were also warning the dangers of that due to the vaccine manufacturers for the flu using the previous years strains to help develop and determine what the following years shots will be. So there is a possible chance we may be screwed when it comes to the flu this season, so yayyy....</p>
<p>But yeah no, we did not eradicate the flu, its still around, just not as bad. And masks when used properly definitely help reduce the risk of spreading the flu. While masks are a newer trend stateside there is a reason Asian countries have used them for a long time during things like flu seasons. </p>
<p>Are they a cure all, no. Do they help though, yes.</p>

        <p>Just wanted to say I appreciate your comment.</p>
<p>The difference between a 0.05% mortality rate for the flu and a 1.8% mortality rate for COVID in the US is a massive difference. While the flu is still a serious illness COVID managed to kill six times as many people in 2020 as influenza and pneumonia did in 2019 and that was with some levels of precaution to reduce the spread of COVID while flu cases also plummeted.</p>
<p>If precautions hadn't been taken against COVID things would have been far worse and it still remains to be seen what the implications of "Long COVID" will be for people that survived COVID.</p>

        <p>If you really wanted to know the answer to that question, then why are you asking this sub? The answer is that never in the history of the flu has it killed 580,000 Americans in one year. It's like comparing a screwdriver to a jackhammer.</p>

        <p>The only way that you can numerically justify a statistic like that is by looking at reported data from hospitals. That data is then aggregated by the CDC and published. As of today it is reported to be 579,000. Whatever you were asking for has nothing to do with the observed and reported data. Subtracting deaths of people in specific categories you deem unimportant isn't scientifically legitimate. Obese and elderly casualties don't count is idiotic. It's not how we measure any other death statistic, so the comparison would be illegitimate.</p>

<p>Mandating me, a healthy mid 30s person with no risk categories to mask up and lockdown for a year, then take an EUA vaccination for a virus that I have probably already caught and recovered from because I have a functioning immune system is just north of retarded.</p>

        <p>Overreporting is an issue that can't be addressed without the raw data and a strong understanding of the mechanisms for reporting. This is not something that someone in this forum can do, especially with some haphazard methodology of subtracting old and obese people. Even if that 25% statistic translates to the US, that's 445k American casualties. The death rate for the influenza on any year in the past falls between 12k to 61k. A magnitude of \~10x again doesn't remotely compare.</p>

        <p>Lol, that also is a poorly conceived conclusion. Just because the the death count was reportedly high, that does not remotely mean that the policy we've implemented is ineffective. The effectiveness of policy would be measured against some alternative or lack of policy (i.e. control groups in scientific studies). It is very possible that our policy measures have been effective and that we still had a high death count. Looking to other countries would also only prove that their policy was more effective. It is also impossible for you to know that the 25% would "just be the start". A detailed forensic analysis of the data would bring us to a more accurate number. You can't know if the actual number would be much lower without the forensic evidence.</p>
