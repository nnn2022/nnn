        <p>&rt;”Before Edward Jenner introduced his smallpox vaccine around 1800, smallpox deaths in England had fallen from 500 to 200 per 100,000 population over the preceding two centuries. By the time compulsory vaccination was introduced in 1852, the mortality had fallen to 40 per 100,000 population. <strong>It is significant to note that between 1867 and 1880, the period when compulsory vaccination was strictly enforced, the death rate leapt from 28 to 45 per 100,000 population.</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;A report appearing in Medical History, 1983 concluded that <strong>vaccination could not have been solely responsible for the decline of smallpox in Britain:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The history of smallpox in the later years of the 19th century does not support the contention that vaccination was fully or finally responsible for the eventual disappearance of the disease in Britain."</p>
<p>&rt;Leon Chaitow, in his book Vaccination and Immunization points out: </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“The credit for the decline in the incidence of smallpox could not be given to vaccination.</strong> The fact is that its incidence <strong>declined</strong> in all parts of Europe, <strong>whether or not vaccination was employed."</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Australian doctor, Dr Glen Dettman</strong> states in Health Consciousness, October 1986:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"It is pathetic and ludicrous to say we vanquished smallpox with vaccines, when only 10 per cent of the population were ever vaccinated".</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”Even the much-heralded success story of smallpox vaccination was not what it seemed. The enforcement of the compulsory smallpox vaccination law in 1867, when the death rate was already falling, was accompanied by an increase in the deaths from 100 to 400 deaths per million.” ^2 </p>
<p>&rt;”The number of inconsistencies that arise from the theory of death-bringing viruses is illustrated by the smallpox epidemic, which even today people like to draw upon to stir up epidemic panic. But was smallpox really a viral epidemic that was successfully overpowered by vaccines? “Medical historians doubt this,” writes journalist Neil Miller in his book Vaccines: Are They Really Safe &amp; Effective ? <strong>“Not only were there no vaccines for scarlet fever or the Black Plague, and these diseases disappeared all the same.”</strong> ^3</p>
<p>&rt;For example, in England, prior to the introduction of mandatory vaccinations in 1853, there were two smallpox deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year. But at the beginning of the 1870s, nearly 20 years after the introduction of mandatory vaccinations, which had led to a 98% vaccination rate, ^88 England suffered 10 smallpox deaths per 10,000 inhabitants annually; five times as many as before. <strong>“The smallpox epidemic reached its peak after vaccinations had been introduced,” summarizes William Farr, who was responsible for compiling statistics in London.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;From an orthodox view, the picture on the Philippines was no less contradictory: the islands experienced their worst smallpox epidemic at the beginning of the 20 th century, even though the vaccination rate was at almost 100%. ^90 <strong>And in 1928, a paper was finally published in the British Medical Journal that disclosed that the risk of dying from smallpox was five times higher for those who had been vaccinated than for those who had not.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.”</strong> ^5:110</p>
<p>&rt;”<strong>William Howard Hay, M.D</strong>.,who needs no introduction to the medical or drugless professions: ^6</p>
<p>&rt;”The true figures on vaccination for smallpox have never got before the public, though they can be seen in the files of the various departments of the army as well as the government, if one cares to ask for them. <strong>If the record of vaccination in the Philippines alone were ever to become matter of general knowledge it would finish vaccination in the whole country,</strong> at least among those who are able to read and think for themselves.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”After three years of the most rigid vaccination,</strong> when almost every Philipino had been vaccinated from one to six times, <strong>there occurred the severest epidemic of smallpox that the islands had ever seen, with a death rate running in places to almost seventy per cent, and in all well over sixty thousand deaths. Did you ever know this before? Assuredly not.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”Yet it is found in the government records in just this form. Manila and the surrounding province were vaccinated most thoroughly, also they showed the highest case record and death record of the whole archipelago, while some of the outlying country was not so thoroughly vaccinated and escaped with proportionately less disease."</p>
<p>&rt;“<strong>George Bernard Shaw,</strong> the illustrious poet and <strong>also an ardent campaigner on public health issues, once stated:</strong> ^6</p>
<p>"During the last considerable epidemic at the turn of the century, <strong>I was a member of the Health Committee of London Borough Council, and I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases (of smallpox) as postular eczema, varioloid or what not - except smallpox".</strong> ^1</p>

        <p>There are major differences between covid and small pox.  1) small pox did not mutate significantly 2) small pox did not have a natural animal reservoir.</p>
<p>Because of this, it was possible to eradicate small pox from the planet.  There is no hope of doing this with Covid.  Covid jumps to other animals.  Coronaviruses spread via different animal populations.  So, if we could wake up tomorrow and vaccinate everybody with a vaccine that was 100% effective, it would just go to an animal reservoir, spread, mutate and re-emerge in humans.</p>

        <p>&rt;..the Jacobson decision also provided judicial cover for a Virginia law that authorized the involuntary sterilization of “feeble-minded” individuals in state mental institutions. In the 1920s, eugenics enjoyed wide support in scientific and medical circles, and the Supreme Court justices were not immune.</p>
<p>Ended up sterilizing 60,000 women because of this decision 🙄</p>
