    <strong>Who here has had COVID and got red pilled by how mild the experience was?</strong>
    <p><p>I've never had COVID myself (that I know of).</p>
<p>But I'm curious who here actually had COVID?</p>
<p>What did it honestly feel like if you were to compare it with a common cold?</p>
<p>If it was mild, did that experience help open your eyes to how the media is exaggerating this and causing fear?</p>
<p><em>edit: I should also note that it's impossible to ask a question like this anywhere else, because the vaccine nazis who are complete hypochondriacs will describe it like a near-death experience and exaggerate every single symptom.</em> </p></p>

        <p>As someone who follows sports (especially NBA) regularly, can confirm. Usually they’re back in game shape (which is extremely demanding physically) in a month or so.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the player who suffered worst from covid was jabbed. He missed an entire month of playing time (while nobody else missed more than 20 days)</p>

        <p>It was more of a flu for me. Nausea, cough, aches, and lack of appetite. I kicked it in 3 days. Spent the following 4 being exhausted. Completely back to normal in two weeks after the first symptoms. It was just being tired that lingered, but I had a 6 month at home as well, so there is that.</p>

        <p>Fear? Never once. It felt different than the usual flu, but nothing to make me get overly concerned about. I can also understand that it could be terrible for someone like my 96 year old grandmother. Or someone with an immune disorder. But they would be at higher risk with any disease.</p>

        <p>My opinion for you, and I'm an engineer not a medical doctor, is this: </p>
<p>If you have conditions or a medical history that would cause complications from a bronchitis or flu, I would actually suggest getting a vaccine. At that point, do your research and pick the one you feel safest about.</p>
<p>If you have a normal immune system and no underlying conditions, I would stay the course and avoid getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>From my experience, the media is definitely fear mongering that shit out of this.</p>

        <p>I was already the skeptic I am (thanks Dad!) but I did have it in December. I also had influenza strain A in 2018. They were almost identical except the serious flu symptoms lasted 6 days and the Covid symptoms lasted 2. I was tired and not quite 100% for longer with Covid… maybe three weeks versus two. But I never Googled “signs that you’re dying” with Covid which I certainly did in my fever delirium with influenza. My fever was much higher with the flu. </p>
<p>Interesting notes. I did not get a Covid test. Someone I had been around called me and said they had it and I said yeah, I know, I have it now too. It was later confirmed when I gave blood. </p>
<p>I was tested for influenza and confirmed at the urgent care. And the doctor told me that strain wasn’t in the most common vaccine that season so it wouldn’t have helped.</p>

        <p>I got a taste of the red pill in the beginning. So I went to a quarantine pool party to get a Lil bit o' nature's original vaccine. Felt tired with a fever for 2 days, and used it as an excuse to sit on my couch for 2 weeks, just in case I was wrong. Then I slammed a whole bottle of red pills when I won my own version of the "vaccine lottery" and Big T-rump gave me Hella gun money. It was a pretty sweet deal for me, until 14 days to flatten the curve turned into shitting on the constitution.</p>

        <p>I did have Covid back in December.  I would say it was really intense for about 24 hours and then when it broke it was like nothing.  The only thing that does somewhat suck is my taste and smell still being off.  I do firmly believe though that eventually it will be back to normal and actually not sure it was Covid that caused this damage, but rather the test for Covid when they rammed that fucking stick into my sinuses.  I was tested for Covid a few days after my symptoms peaked and wish that I hadn't gone for the test because it was that moment that I lost all smell and taste.</p>

        <p>I had it shortly after flying through Detroit airport right before they admitted that it was in the USA.  It sucked pretty bad, it was a very nasty flu.  My husband and I (in our mid 30s) both had fevers and felt like shit.  We never needed to see a doctor, kept hydrated and alternated tylenol and ibuprophen.  Our toddler (who was still breastfeeding at the time) never had so much as a sneeze.  He took a week off of work and I WFH.  The worst part was the cough that stuck around for about a month.  However, we have had no long term affects and never got sick again throughout the pandemic.</p>

        <p>I’m having to self isolate at the moment due to testing positive for covid. I’m a fit and healthy 19yo male. The first few days my only symptom was a sore throat. Then I developed a temperature, muscle and headaches and a slight blocked nose. I had a virus a couple of years ago that was worse although I must say the sore throat has developed into the worse I’ve probably ever had and I’ve lost my sense of smell and taste which is weird because I can breathe fine through my nose but after 5 days those are the only two remaining symptoms</p>

        <p>I had the virus bad in February 2020 and treated it with highly concentrated oregano oil (oreganol). It's expressive for a tiny bottle, but each drop is like liquid gold of pure natural antibiotic. I added it to a carrier oil (almond or jojoba oil are good) and rubbed it on the outside of my chest, swollen throat, and sinuses (do not get in the eyes!). I also dosed 3 to 10 drops in a small amount of water a few times a day. </p>
<p>If you go this route, be sure to get probiotics afterward, since oregano oil destroys good and bad bacteria, and your gut will need an extra boost. Even kombucha will work for this. Hope you feel better!</p>

        <p>Thanks for the advice! As I can’t go to the shops I’ve had to make do with what I have in my house. Luckily my pine needles arrived a couple of days before I tested positive and I’ve found pine needle tea to soothe my throat.</p>

        <p>I had it early on, near the start of February 2020. </p>
<p>I was bed-ridden for 3 days, sick for about 1.5 weeks. I've only had a flu/fever once in my life before as a young teen. This was comparable.</p>
<p>Most of my friends has mild symptoms; obviously I spread it to everyone I came into contact with, no one got anywhere near seriously ill because we are all young.</p>

        <p>I finally got it 3 weeks ago, after 15 months of zero precautions. I haven't worn a mask once, and occasionally I even stand 5 feet 11 inches away from people. Back in the early days I figured if this is circulating, I should go out of my way to get it and get it over with ASAP.  I still maintain that instead of wearing masks, we should have been coughing and sneezing on each other from Day 1. Sharpen the curve instead of flattening it. </p>
<p>The bug laid me out for 10-11 days. (I'm in my 50s, in great shape, neither smoke nor drink and I go to the gym every day.) I didn't leave the house except to go to the clinic and be told yeah, you have it, there's nothing we can do, go home and keep resting. It felt like a flu that took a lot longer than usual to correct itself. </p>
<p>I felt like crap but certainly never feared for my life. More to the point, I never thought that society needed to stop and people needed to close their businesses and lose their jobs because I felt weak and lost my appetite.</p>

        <p>I think I had it back in Feb 2020. I was mad because it was new and people were freaking out but I only cared because I was supposed to be on a cruise the next week and they were checking if people had fevers before they got on the boat. It was basically the flu. I can’t be positive that I had it because I have yet to be tested but I lost my sense of taste which people didn’t know was a symptom until a few months later. I felt like shit, didn’t want to eat and was passing every ounce of water I drank. I basically slept for 2 days and woke up groggy on day three. Felt good enough to go to work though.</p>

        <p>I havent personaly (that I know of. Its possible I had it without noticing, as my immunity was always really good), but my brother had.</p>
<p>He is cardiac (was born with a hole in the heart. Its fixed, but his heart is forever weaker), so I was worried for him, but he said he only had mild fever, mild headache and lost smell and taste senses. That was all. </p>
<p>My mom (healthy) had it too, or so she thinks. She had a 10 days long “cold“ with slight fever, and only afterwards found out that it appeared after she took care of a patient who had covid.</p>
<p>So much so for a “deadly“ virus, huh.</p>

I've had bronchitis before and I have asthma but that was probably the worst my lungs have ever felt, super sensitive and irritated. I missed one day of work. Felt 100% after about 3 days.</p>

        <p>I most likely had this in April. It was just like any other flu which lasted for 3 days. When recovering, I lost my sense of smell for 4 days and also had some pain in my legs when at rest. I'd rather choose to experience this temporary discomfort again over potential long-term health issues that we don't even know yet.</p>

        <p>I got home in the early morning and developed a stuffy runny nose and was sneezing. I went to bed and woke up in the afternoon feeling pretty sick. Same nasal congestion but no cough or sore throat. No fever. I had just gotten a text from a co worker with whom I work in close proximity saying she tested positive so I went and got tested.</p>
<p>I felt sick the rest of the evening with some body aches but never any coughing or difficulty breathing. I went to bed and woke up the next day feeling fine. I was shocked! I figured this was the big show since it was going around my work place but I felt fine except a bit tired maybe. I also lost my taste smell for around 5 days?</p>
<p>So overall I was only sick for about one day. I would not compare it to the flu at all. My experience with the flu was so so much worse. It just felt like a nasty case of the sniffles that lasted for about 24 hours. I wasn't afraid of covid to begin with and it took about 3 days to get my positive result so I was totally recovered by the time I got the news lol.</p>

        <p>It felt like pretty much nothing. I only had a loss of smell and taste, cough and little fever. All of these lasted for one day.</p>

        <p>Had Covid. Whole family had it, I had it second-worst. (Dad had it worst but he's doing well now). It was like a very extreme cold. For one or two days my chest really hurt but went over quickly. Not a good experience but it was more uncomfortable than it was agonizing.</p>

        <p>Headache, mild fever (one night), aches, recovered. Took about a week. One thing I will say though is I developed an annoying case of tinnitus very shorty after, with no obvious cause.</p>

        <p>Was visiting my family when suddenly my grandmother got sick. It got a bit worse and sure enough she tested positive for covid and was admitted into a hospital. (She was fine after about 1.5 weeks). Being a contact person I was forced into 14 days quarantine.</p>
<p>After about 7 days of being alone, sure enough I became sick. Felt mostly like the flu, but still a bit different and weird. </p>
<p>I couldn’t get tested cause everything was completely overwhelmed and they just didn’t send anybody, but since the only person I had had contact with in the week before becoming sick I just assumed I had covid. Especially cause it felt a little different to me and I had completely lost my sense of taste. I remember eating a banana and it just felt like a weird must without any taste at all.</p>
<p>Months later I go make an antibody test. Guess what. It wasn’t covid. Just a regular flu.</p>

        <p>I had it in January, first week a mild cold after day 10 I had a bit of fever and no taste, asthma kicked in for a few days and was very wheezy maybe 3 days.... Not the worse cold I've ever had by a long way.<br>
Was just considering if I had to have the vaccine, then I got it, now not for me. 
BTW at the time I got it I was working in a hospital with Covid patients, some symptomatic (but medically fit to leave) some asymptomatic. I was very hot on infection control, masks are useless for sure.  When I started the work (I had a four month secondment) I was a bit anxious, but the more patientss I saw who had it and we well the better I felt. Mostly patients caught it from being in hospital rather than coming in with it.</p>

        <p>I was sick in January 2020 before it all started. I thought it was a bad flu. I remember thinking i was never so sick in my life. Lots of people around me were too. Two weeks were really bad, just like a bad flu then couple more weeks to get back to normal. Maybe it was a flu or maybe it was this virus. In april this year my husband got sick and had to get tested, ended up positive. I just had a headache and was tired for a few days. That was it. U tell me what it is.. im thinking i probably had it that first time and now when i was exposed the second time it didnt do much bc i was already immune.</p>

        <p>I believe we all got sick in March/April of last year. It blew over within a week. Whole house caught it. </p>
<p>I kept working cause my job had a bunch of people "out with covid." </p>
<p>Months later, the guy that was the most diligent about masks and sanitizer lost his sense of smell. Worked with him the entire day prior.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is why the media stopped talking about THAT. THAT actually worried me. Losing a sense? Like wtf?</p>
<p>They had a much better chance of convincing people if they kept reminding them of that.</p>

        <p>Husband (43M) and I (43F)think we had it Feb. 2020 (there was no testing in our state at that time). He had it bad - couldn't walk from the bedroom to the bathroom (no energy, couldn't catch his breath). He was in bed for 3-4 days and then slowly recovered. Not sure if he had lasting effects or not, but in August he was really struggling to breathe, even when at total rest. After some testing, it was revealed that he had an arrhythmia and needed an ablation. Doctors were surprised, had no idea how/why it happened (he's incredibly fit and relatively young), but the surgery went smoothly and he recovered well!</p>
<p>We think I had it about a week after he recovered. I spent a weekend in bed sleeping, that's about it. I'm a HS teacher and at about the same time that we got sick my kids were dropping like flies with "the flu," which was probably covid... (they're all fine!).</p>

        <p>I thought it was delayed Con Flu,attended New York Comic Con in October than started getting more fatigued than usual (Multiple Sclerosis) the last two week of December 2019 and horrible left shoulder pain that I had to go see a sports medicine doctor in January,because the throbbing pain became unbearable. </p>
<p>But two night before my appointment,8pm second Sunday night in January I developed 103.4 fever out of nowhere,chills,shakes and teeth chatter.</p>
<p>Took Excedrin and spent half the night drinking water and taking my temperature. </p>
<p>Was fine for a week,than a nagging cough took over and it was game on.</p>
<p>I tried Rubbitusin,Mucinex,Tylenol Cold/Flu nothing worked than it seemed to stop the last week of January and than I couldn't breathe (sinus) out of my nose and couldn't taste anything first few days of February.</p>
<p>Made a doctor's appointment and she said "some bug" is going around NYc and everyone is getting sick.</p>
<p>Was prescribed antibiotics and started feeling better by mid-March.</p>
<p>This "virus" literally gets into your body and tries to find a spot (inflammation/tendinitis as an example which I was dx in that shoulder) inside your body to burrow in like a damn rat.</p>

        <p>I experienced one night of "fuck, I feel like death, I wish my mom was here" and then a few days of mild flu symptoms (fever, aches, exhaustion) followed by a week or two of a lingering cough and sniffles (let it be known I am a smoker). Basically classic flu. I even got it during the normal flu season so... 
This was 3 months ago and I haven't experienced any long term affects that I'm aware of. My olfactory system is intact although my biz partner swears his is still screwy half a year later. If covid is the cause of that then honestly its the worst outcome I've been privy to via my first/secondhand experience of the virus.</p>

        <p>I believe I had it March of 2020, since then my nose will randomly get an off smell as in loss of smell BUT since then, and been over a year the episodes went from lasting hours to lasting now 10 seconds or less. I'd rather of delt with the bad cold like symptoms and my loss of smell issues than take a vaccine that has given even my own mother worse adverse symptoms. Something fishy is def up here!</p>

        <p>I know 7-8 ppl that got it. Most of them were asymptomatic. One of my close m8ts had it, he told me he lost his smell, and had small but persistent headache for a couple of days. His wife and children had no symptoms at all. Some neighbor couple got it also. The man is struggling since 1 year with lung cancer (is therefor considered weak), but was only mildly sick. A week later, he seemed "ok" again, at least for someone having lung cancer. His wife was asymptomatic. I'm still not aware of anyone that has been really sick of it.</p>

        <p>Mine was no taste/smell and a persistent headache and felt tired all the time but it wasn't the death sentence I was led to believe. Hell, two days after I was diagnosed, I was drinking beers on my deck. I had Pneumonia 3 years ago and THAT made me feel like I wanted to die...</p>
