        <p>This is hard to answer, because I very much expected these things to occur. </p>
<p>Increased suicidal ideation and substance abuse. Extreme depression to the point where there were days I didn’t even leave the house to check the mail. </p>
<p>What is unexpected is that, despite living in a state that never did a second lockdown, I am still extremely anxious about doing “normal” things now, to the point that it has disrupted my ability to function.</p>

        <p>I experienced severe panic attacks for the first time in my life because lockdowns forced me to spend entire days with my toxic family and I didn't have a driver's permit at the time (I was 17 and my dad didn't really care about teaching me how to drive). My mental state is so bad right now and I even banged my head on the door really hard one time and felt pressure where I hit it for like three days.</p>
<p>However, I'm 18 now and am moving out in 4 more months and I couldn't be happier. I can't say this experience was a waste of time- I learned more about myself in a year than I did in my entire high school career and will move out way sooner than I originally planned to. I don't care if I end up doing college online, I'm just glad that things should be getting better soon for me and I'm glad I didn't kill myself so far</p>

        <p>The most prevalent effect I experience is that many online seem to lose their wit. Locally, I am in Northern California, I think the vast majority can deal with the situation just fine and they follow the rules without too many problems.</p>
<p>It's best to simply deal with the situation, cope!</p>
