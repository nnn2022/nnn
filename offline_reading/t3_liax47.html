        <p>Glad to see you’re throwing your support in for the small businesses getting drowned in financial bullshittery because people don’t want to take preventative measures to avoid spreading illness. The doctors being worked to death on overtime with little to no compensation in overfilled hospitals with barely enough supplies, having conspiracies screamed at them by the patients they’re trying to save. The retail workers trying to pay off their rent working jobs they’re stuck with who are constantly berated by deranged lunatic snowflakes who look at them following policy as an assault on their freedoms. The people who can’t even bury their loved ones who’ve died during these times because doing otherwise would risk those who still live...</p>
<p>Those are the underdogs you’re fighting for, right? I mean, surely someone as profoundly spoken as you has a post history that is more than just being a conspiracy-ridden crybaby snowflake who does nothing but complain, right?</p>

        <p>But it's not one person. It's a fuckton of deluded conspiracy theorists who had been sheltered their entire lives too frightened of the real world to leave their bubbles. I wouldn't mind letting those pathetic people lash out and whine as much as they like as time moves on without them, but the issue begins when it starts hurting other people- and it has.</p>
<p>One person cannot change the world. This much is true, and to believe otherwise is folly. It, however, does not take away from the fact that every individual has a responsibility to do the right thing. Let's assume that the pandemic is a hoax, and people like me who <em>do</em> wear masks turn out to be the fools. Do you think I'm going to lament wearing a mask? No. I work every day of the week except weekends loading dusty trucks full of boxes in a facility that couldn't give a hoot about safety beyond what's legally obligated. I have to wear that mask the entire time. My glasses fog up, and it is hard to breath at times. But I am happy to inconvenience myself if it means that one way or another I am taking a precaution to avoid bringing harm to my friends, my family, my neighbors, or even complete strangers.</p>
<p>I might be a fool but at least I'm not a selfish asshole.</p>

        <p>I see what mental gymnastics you're trying to pull here. Trying to turn it around on me because you don't want to be held accountable for anything I've said about you here- none of such which you've tried to dispute. I remember when I used to be like you; perfectly fine with picturing myself a piece of shit as long as whoever I was butting heads with went down with me. There was a reason I used to be a person who was always miserable. Maybe you'll figure out the reason you are here soon.</p>
<p>To address what you've said, I was too young to really get what was going on during the Swine Flu pandemic, and honestly my parents didn't really take precautions either. We didn't suffer for it, fortunately. Sometimes that's how fortune has it, and that's not a bad thing. The less people who suffer the better. I would be happy if you never got Covid despite your disposition too, if you can believe that.</p>
<p>And the Flu season? I do something else in response to the Flu. I get vaccinated. In the case of Covid however, vaccination only became a very recent option, one that has a distribution rate that isn't ideal and takes multiple treatments. I intend to get vaccinated, but until that happens I take what preventative measures I can afford to take.</p>
<p>Do I like the masks? No. Do I like the lockdown? Fuck no, my father's business is in shambles because of it- and you have no idea how much I'd rather it be otherwise. Do I like getting shots? No, they waste my time and they sting.</p>
<p>But it has to be done. One cannot exempt themselves from their responsibilities simply because others choose to. I will not stoop to your level, because while I can go on and on about doing it for other people, at the core of it there's an even more serious thing for me to consider; If I get covid, this bad financial situation becomes only a billion times worse.</p>
<p>You don't consider that, however. You're safe enough in your bubble, safe away from the real world. You don't care about what happens to other people, nor are you able to consider what could potentially happen to you. It's not living in fear; it's being cautious.</p>

        <p>Actually I care about other people that's why I'm not going along with this charade. When governors can travel and vacation but tell their constituents that it's not safe I stop trusting what I'm seeing. When people can go to protests and political celebrations I stop trusting what I'm seeing. When I see young people killing themselves because they are depressed (i work in healthcare) but your government did this to them I stop trusting what I'm seeing. My bf at the time got swine flu and my husband now had covid. What I witnessed with swine flu was 50x worse than covid so no I don't trust what I'm seeing. When nothing with any of these measures make sense I don't trust what I see. I refuse to be gaslighted like you've been. You must be younger than me so you probably don't get it. No one ever did anything for other people until last year when the government mandated you to. Your health is your responsibility. Not mine and vice versa.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you're saying, but, just block this person.  I looked at his comment history and it's all angry vitriol.  I doubt he'll listen.  He's getting high on fake moral superiority, when in reality he hasn't had any real moral formation.  Why feed it?  He needs prayers instead.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck. You have the mental capacity to recognize true problems, yet you are too so far up your own ass to consider them the way you need to. Instead of actually putting your mind to the "why" of these problems and what needs to be done to address them, you just use them to justify your shitty attitude and would rather just blame someone for it and retreat further into your own snowflaked shell, offering absolutely *nothing* to anyone or anything to try and help work against the issue in what little ways we individual people can.</p>
<p>You don't care about these problems and how they affect others. You only care about yourself. You said it yourself. They are nothing more to you than tools- no, worse, they are *excuses*.</p>
<p>You don't fight for the underdog. You walk upon them as stepping stones to your own petty satisfaction. You might be older than 22, but I've lived in the real world far longer than you.  </p>
<p>Edit:<br>
And you're too much of a coward to dispute all the ills I've said about you because you know deep down in your cold heart they're true. And even if you don't, everyone around you does.</p>

        <p>Sorry you’re too selfish and paranoid to realize you’re wrong. While I can get on board with healthy and young people not being so much at risk (unless they’re immunocompromised), I find it pretty disgusting that you guys are cool with possibly infecting an elderly person who has a high risk of dying from this. As someone who almost lost their (very republican, anti mask) grandpa to covid, it makes me furious that this sub even exists, allowing misinformation to spread to impressionable people like yourself.</p>

        <p>All of this has happened before. Read some contemporary accounts of what life was like as totalitarian collectivism took hold.  The Gulag Archipelago, New Lies for Old, and Darkness at Noon are all good books.  I've been looking for similar books about the Chinese Cultural Revolution but they're harder to find.</p>

        <p>The strongest trait human beings have is the ability to adjust to their circumstances. Your rejection of that trait in a time as uncertain and even ruinous as today is exactly what makes you the “insane one” to your peers. You aren’t enlightened, you’re just stubborn. Time doesn’t care about your pride; in the end, to stagnate is to die.</p>

You’re not wrong, you know you’re not wrong but the battle is wearing on you. Been a lurker for years but I couldn’t take the BS anymore, one day I replied to some Branch Covidian on Reddit. Haven’t looked back since. We need to lean on each other in times like this as cringey as it sounds, because we can’t afford to lose a single critical thinking person in this fight, NOT ONE. Idk how this DM thing works and all but I’ll figure it out and tell you stupid jokes and lift yourself spirits. YOU CANNOT GIVE IN PLEASE!</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you. I still strongly believe we are correct in our belief that while covid is real, it has been massively overblown. It has ruined some relationships and has caused me to move back to Ohio from CA (moving to CA was a dream of mine for 10 years and after 3 I'm out because of their response to covid). </p>
<p>I am scared to speak about things to potential new friends or significant others as I know most don't see things the same way. While that used to not be an issue, currently it feels like if you don't fall in line with a specific narrative you are automatically the enemy and cannot be talked to. </p>
<p>This has led me down a path of further seclusion (still have friends but the numbers are dwindling and it's especially hard to make new connections during lockdown). This seclusion and viewpoint that differs from the norm is also leading to a more general state of depression in my every day life. Part of me thinks it would just be better to cave and get the vaccine and pretend I agree with everything while another part is scared of this whole thing. </p>
<p>Why is a vaccine being pushed so hard when most of the at risk people are in a single age group (above 70). Why are we (we meaning the group that is going along with the covid scare) okay with the idea that the vaccine merely reduces symptoms experienced, but doesn't keep you from contracting or spreading the virus. This means masks and social distancing are here to stay even with the vaccine. Why are we okay with a vaccine that isn't even FDA approved being given to people who are not at risk at all based on the past year of data. I could continue on but the point is made.</p>

        <p>So let's roll with that for a minute then. A large majority of conversations I have with people lack sources on both sides of any argument. Often as a result I apply philosophical razors to streamline my thought process. The two I find myself using most often are Occam's Razor and Hanlon's Razor. There are others, but let's start with the two. First, we'll start with Occam's. As far as things like death tolls, restrictions, and general decisions that have been made so far it trends toward those being valid and accurate. Many countries that enacted similar rules and restrictions have basically eradicated the virus in their country. New Zealand being a prime example. Now, Occam's states the simple answer is USUALLY correct, but not always. However, that means that to disprove the razor we need evidence. The more complex concept requires more complex proof. I'm not saying you're wrong, but to convince others, you'll need to have hard hitting evidence and facts to back it up.</p>
<p>As for the second, we have Hanlon's Razor. Do not attribute to malice that which can be attributed to incompetence or stupidity. The government and CDC have gotten things wrong. More than once. And more than likely they will again. That does not necessarily mean that everything is done with negative intentions, simply that they lacked information and that as they realized they made mistakes, they tried to adapt.</p>
<p>Again, this makes it difficult to convince somebody that these restrictions are being created with malicious intent. I'm still not saying you and others here are wrong, but it hopefully explains why the other side tends to be the "default" position. That just means you have to work harder to overcome those assumptions. Having strong facts and evidence that isn't anecdotal is a must for overcoming a strong bias.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is a terrible example as it is a secluded island and homogenous population and authoritarian response. We are now inviting people to invade us without even checking for covid so that argument is useless.
Government instead uses people who are objective like you you to believe there are no ill intentions,  when if you instead look at that as the reason everything fits into place and makes sense, thereby following Occams perfectly.</p>
<p>Stay home:  reduce carbon</p>
<p>wear masks:  follow orders </p>
<p>Close businesses for no scientific reasons: transfer money and power to large corporations who lobby politicians and reduce the middle class wealth so they are also dependent on government. </p>
<p>Covid relief bill (dems):  pay back the states and unions for putting the boot down for control at the cost of lost tax revenue.</p>
<p>Censor and cancel opposing views: control the government and media (same thing these days) narrative under forced coercion to control the population.</p>
<p>When you consider that the goverment should be reducing fear and not making it greater, it is very clear what is going on.</p>

        <p>Yes, admittedly NZ had a very distinct advantage in that their response could be much more thorough and that some of the same measures would not be as effective here.  But it was meant to illustrate that some of those measures when followed and enacted swiftly, they did manage to work in that particular instance. That being said, it's very clear that is not working here for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>That being said, I still patronize my local businesses and try to avoid large corporations as a general rule. I think we can agree that corporate lobbying is an issue and that the CEOs and billionaires are a far greater enemy than each other. Infighting is the enemy of the people.</p>
<p>But back to the issue at hand, I ask a question relating specifically to masks. If by wearing a mask you could prevent 1000 vulnerable people from getting COVID and assume that all of these people are compromised and if they got it they would die. Is it worth wearing? I can't say for sure if it will help. I do know that I lost a great aunt and a cousin both to COVID and it has made me a little more strict about my actions than I was before. I think there's an issue where people are not willing to meet in the middle. I don't think we should shut everything down and lock people in their houses. But I also think that wearing a mask as an example is a very minor inconvenience and honestly doesn't affect me in any real negative way so it's something I am willing to do. So, if nothing else, that's my stance on it all. I think there are reasonable measures we can take for the benefit of my fellow Americans.</p>

        <p>This is an unhelpful comment. I'm attempting to play devil's advocate to help strengthen his arguments as well as to help alleviate some of the stress by providing some understanding of the "default." You're engaging in the exact kind of hostile actions that the OP was condemning in their post. Why are you attacking me for attempting to help another person here. I've not even made a statement on which side is right because frankly I'm not 100% which side I'm eventually going to land on, but this hostility does not endear me to this side of the argument.</p>

        <p>I agree with you about the objective approach but it's becoming increasingly more difficult if you step back and look at the systems as a whole. What has been happening recently with global economics would suggest that wealth is becoming more centralized. Look at how large corporations have profited greatly from this situation. Is that just a result of societal restrictions or was it the <em>reason</em> for them? </p>
<p>Just one source among many:
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/07/covid-19-crisis-boosts-the-fortunes-of-worlds-billionaires</p>
<p>Also, let's not forget that there was a meeting on global pandemic response very shortly before the global pandemic actually occured. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Contagion</p>
<p>&rt;Crimson Contagion was a joint exercise conducted from January to August 2019, in which numerous national, state and local, private and public organizations in the US participated, in order to test the capacity of the federal government and twelve states to respond to a severe pandemic of influenza originating in China.</p>
<p>Coincidence? I don't know. Seems odd, though. </p>
<p>Also, looking at the media response to the protests last summer versus their response to other, less concentrated gatherings is also fairly telling regarding the politicization of the covid restrictions and response in general.</p>
<p>Any of these things by themselves might not constitute skepticism (though they would for me).  But you put them together, along with many other discrepancies in response to the virus, the types of testing (polymerase chain reaction testing with extremely high cycle thresholds), the methods of classifying deaths and even the disagreements on the r0 of the virus, the efficacy of the vaccine (which providers of have been exempted from blame if it causes issues) and you can begin to see another picture forming. One in which there <em>is</em> a virus but it's severity has been magnified to achieve another goal, one which has nothing to do with public health and everything to do with the manipulation of society.</p>

        <p>And depending on the lens it can definitely look that way.</p>
<p>I caution though that as with anything, if you look at something long enough, you may see what you want and not what is. Not saying that's what's happening with your view, but it's why I try not to spend too much time buried in it.</p>
<p>But so the alternative that we have to look at is that there are some who may have the opposite agenda and are playing down the severity of the virus for one goal or another. Both could be true. One side playing it up to get what they want, the other downplaying to get what they want. There could be even a third party playing both sides to stoke conflict. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle as it most often is. As far as which side it is closer to, we the people will likely never know, so we have to decide for ourselves what to believe.</p>
<p>So my thought is this. I'm hoping it's way better than it's being made out to be, but being prepared that the worst is true. And if there are some small changes I can make without any real negative impact on myself, then I'll make them. If it helps, all the better.</p>
<p>I personally don't think there's anything nefarious about the vaccine. I do know that the COVID relief bills along with literally every other bill that goes through congress has so much crap stuffed in it from both sides along with the things people actually want/need. It is the perpetual problem we face in this country, a bunch of shit packed in that benefits companies and politicians because there's a couple things the country NEEDS so the bill must pass. Frankly, it's a fucking mess and has been for decades. I think this particular issue is just something that people can easily latch on to and happens to be particularly polarizing. The timing is a factor as well. Trump was the most divisive president we have ever had and regardless of which side people were on, there was a TON of hate going out. I'll say this about him, his presidency changed this country forever. What the final outcome will be remains to be seen, but I doubt that if this happened 20 years ago that we'd be having the same conversations under Bush.</p>
<p>There's so many layers to all of this right now that it's frankly hard to take in.</p>

        <p>Then stop overreacting, jeez. You’re just like my father. Your denial to the pandemic stems from your fear from the unknown. Just accept the pandemic is here, follow the restrictions to the best of your ability, and live normally.

        <p>The innacurate death tolls really get me. I live in a small Michigan farmtown around a lot of amish folk, majority of which are great family friends. </p>
<p>Over the past year, 4 of them have passed away, all from different illnesses, all un-related to covid, in fact every one of them had tested negative before their death.</p>
<p>Come to find, they were ALL recorded as covid deaths. Just goes to show that this whole thing was blown out of proportion. </p>
<p>And yet, you're insane when you even slightly question the fact that mother government might not be totally honest about their intentions with this pandemic?</p>

        <p>Do you think a complete audit or investigation into the death toll would even be possible, given the numbers?  </p>
<p>I've heard of people fighting to get death certificates changed for their own integrity and family medical history being accurate.    </p>
<p>I'd hope asking questions doesn't rally the "people died, have some respect!" crowd, as it's respect for those lost that fuels the need for investigation, instead of them being used for manipulation.</p>

        <p>That's one hypothesis but it's just not born out in the data. Which illnesses in particular are driving delayed medical care deaths? Why do the lockdown deaths have essentially no correlation with the degree of lockdowns? Why did the vast majority of NYC's deaths occur in March-June and then fall off dramatically even while lockdowns largely continued?</p>

        <p>What? That study has nothing to do with what you said it did. There’s also a bit of basic logic that for a given person, your odds of dying in the next month are extremely low, even for old people. Most people who are 79 and 2 months will live to see 79 and 3 months! Likewise, the odds of having Covid at any given time are also low, even in the height of the pandemic, only a few million people had Covid at once. So it’s extremely suspicious when all these people having Covid start dropping death for whatever reason! Sure some of them will be car crashes and overdoses, but the vast majority will not</p>

        <p>All cause mortality is still consistent with the previous decade, it rises and falls every year but there’s not some massive spike. Over 50 million people die every year, a few hundred thousand up or down isn’t significant.</p>

<p>I can link you to a paper with statistical hypothesis testing but this pretty clearly constitutes a spike and it is clearly much larger than any variation we have seen in recent memory. The data is also consistent with how the story developed over time; for example, look at <a href="https://episphere.github.io/mortalitytracker/#cause=allcause&amp;state=New%20York">New York</a> where there was a massive spike that peetered out around June versus a state like <a href="https://episphere.github.io/mortalitytracker/#cause=allcause&amp;state=North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> that avoided the earlier wave and then began really hitting the pandemic in the fall.</p>

        <p>In all likelihood those are bogus stats created since COVID. Just pull up a chart of deaths per year since 2000. There was an equally large jump from 2012 to 2013 and I don’t remember a global shutdown then.</p>

        <p>It's not just one group coming up with these figures though. This is compiled based on the numbers of state governments, which get it from the hospitals, etc. It is not just blue state governors making up these numbers.

        <p>Yes. Because anything post COVID is being manipulated to make you think it’s killing us all when it isn’t. </p>
<p>I didn’t provide my stats because you can literally look them up and choose ANY result you like based on your preference, they will all show the same thing. There is no ‘spike’ in 2020. There is a rise consistent with what we have seen in other years when there wasn’t a pandemic or other disaster to attribute it to.</p>

        <p>You're right. These stats aren't adding up the way I thought they would. I see an increase of nearly 120 deaths per 100,000 from 2019 to 2020, which is a 13% increase when in previous years it is typically a rise or fall of less than 1%. I see that this is deadly.</p>
<p>Here are the sources I just looked at: <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">one</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/189670/death-rates-for-all-causes-in-the-us-since-1950/">two</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm">three</a>. These totally proved me wrong.</p>
<p>I think I've been seriously misled by this sub. This is the first time I went and crunched the numbers myself rather than being told what they are, and they are absolutely not what I was told they were. And you're right, it doesn't make sense that they can all be altered when they come from so many different places. I'm so sorry that I went with this narrative. Thank you for questioning me enough to make me rethink it, seriously. I'm getting out of this group.</p>

        <p>Don't believe me if you don't want to, I honestly don't give a fuck.
Sure, it may not be totally accurate, I'm just saying what I was told. I'm not gonna come here and say "this is probably fake, buttttttt," I wasn't in the situation, I didn't die, I wasn't the doctor, and I wasn't the one that inaccurately labeled their deaths as covid deaths. 
And your a fool if you believe everything that the government has been telling you about covid is 100% accurate, anyway.</p>

        <p>This is me today. I'm so tired of this. My husband and I are looking at a house tomorrow and our agent made a point to tell us that masks are REQUIRED and there will be a $100 fine if we are seen not wearing one. Okay, who is giving out this fine? Or are they just making shit up to scare people? We can't even afford this stupid house so I don't even see the point in going but my husband wants to go. Houses in our area are overpriced and are flying off the market, and people are literally waiting in line to view a house (gotta social distance!).</p>
<p>It isn't even just that. The Karens in my neighbor badgered the parks and rec department so much that they finally agreed to put signs up in the local parks about wearing masks. So I'm sure I'll start being harassed about not wearing a mask outside - the one fucking place I was "allowed" to breathe freely. I am going to start carrying mace with me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I could just be a sheep and actually believe in all of this bullshit - lockdowns, masks, security theatre. But I can't. I can't get into the virtue signaling, the mask hysteria, destroying of small businesses, and keeping schools closed forever. And I feel like a crappy person but I just want to live my life. If I were a sheep, it honestly would make things easier.</p>

        <p>The masks outdoors is what really gets me. I live right in the middle of LA where it’s close to 100% compliance of people wearing masks <em>while alone</em> outside. And while I’ve surprisingly never had anyone say anything to me (I will never, ever wear one while walking outside) it’s just so fucking depressing seeing it that it makes me never want to even take a walk in my neighborhood. </p>
<p>I would put up with the mask thing a lot more if people were reasonable about it. But in places like LA, it’s way past reasonable. And I don’t know how much more of it I can take.</p>

        <p>Exactly - I could put up with the masks if people were reasonable about it. Wear it in a medical building or when you are sick. Okay.</p>
<p>But wearing it outside with no one else around, while exercising or playing sports (except for the precious college and professional athletes, of course), wearing it for 8-10 hours a day while going to school or working at a grocery store, requiring 2 year old babies to fucking wear one - all of that is unreasonable.</p>

        <p>Like requiring masks inside a business is one thing as a precaution to people that have no choice but to be there, but like if you see someone outside without a mask why not just....stay away from them?</p>

        <p>You're incorrect on that one. The Karen meme was absolutely improperly co-opted by pro-mask people.

        <p>No, you're wrong. The Karens are the ones who are obsessively calling HOA, parks and rec, the county, the police, etc because someone outside is not wearing a mask. Literally the definition of Karen - let me speak to your manager. The people who are enjoying a park and minding their own business are not Karens.</p>

Im not trying to scare anyone im not pushing a belief but what I see happening here is the start of an authoritarian society forming. Look im not the most politically aware. Im 19 years old for gods sake but when I see people, even people my own age who were once the best of friends suddenly hate each other, talk down to each other, physically harm one another, harm each others children even, over a political opinion is just.... sickening. It really makes me wonder what we as people have become.</p>

<p>Shut up bugman. Everything is political and you can't change that. Back when this shit first started, there was little opposition to locking down. People agreed that maybe it <em>would</em> be a good idea to quarantine for 2 weeks.  </p>
<p>It's been 11 fucking months. You know why this has suddenly become "political"? Because we're tired of this bullshit. The virus itself hasn't affected enough people to justify locking down. It was reasonable to lock down <em>back then</em> because we all had an <em>expectation</em> that we'd be affected somehow, plus we expected it to last only a couple weeks.  </p>
<p>Stop taking all cues from TV and social media. Look outside. Look at the bizarre idiocracy you're living in. Nobody is dying in the streets. Hospitals aren't "overwhelmed". There's no sense of urgency anywhere. A stark contrast to the world you see online. It's not "under control" because of plexiglass barriers or 6ft circles taped to the floor. The threat of covid is just negligible, and you're being played.</p>

        <p>First off, bad ad hominem arguments, secondly, if you recall, many of the very same types of people on this sub were refusing to comply because of "mah personal freedoms".</p>
<p>We never had a compliant society hence why nothing has worked. I still see people refusing to wear a mask. It was made political when anti mask politics were introduced. That was practically from day one.we needed to do it swiftly and correctly but some of us (roughly 30% or so) didn't want to play ball and still don't.</p>

        <p>I've already posted somewhere else in this thread that the economic damage could have and should have been mitigated with both a massive short term stimulus and lock down. We keep trying to straddling  a line between distancing measures and short term shutdown when we should have made sure everyone got a lot  money up front for one maintained shutdown.</p>
<p>But staggering it, we aren't stopping spread AND it's costing us much more in the longterm.</p>
<p>I referenced the New Zealand model. They gave everyone $7000 in thier Bank accounts and had one big shutdown. Now they have very few cases and thier society is mostly back to normal. Had been for a like year now.</p>
<p>So no. I'm no fan of the governments response. But what yall are advocating for is even more rediculous and counterintuitive.</p>
<p>This would be mostly over in one shutdown if we shut down travel legit and let all existing cases come to term good or bad. You choke it by letting all existing cases play out in a no spread environment. But we kept trying to straddle for the short term maintaining of profit.</p>
<p>Small businesses could have taken a 1 month mass shutdown. They can't take an off and on distancing. Instead I'd weathering one massive storm they have to survive an elongated drought. </p>
<p>That cat is sadly out of the bad now that infection rates are so high. We blew our opportunity because nobody took it seriously and now we have the choice between the economy and grandma. </p>
<p>If we took it seriously from the start those wouldn't be our options.</p>

        <p>That's what the disagreement is. Deep disagreement. There are those who do not believe wearing a mask provides any benefit whatsoever. None. Zero. I am one of them. They also likely know that "Lockdowns" are an unprecedented NPI cooked up by the CCP, advised <em>against</em> by almost the totality of the medical and scientific literature pre-March 2020 including the deeply compromised and corrupt WHO. I've been genuinely searching for relief since the beginning of all of this from the clear awareness that this whole situation is a hyper aggressive attack against the whole of humanity. The scale of the fraud beggars belief. It seems that was the point all along, hence the meme of OPs post. This is not easy knowledge to carry. To be shunned by friends and family. I'd rather be wrong. Genuinely. But there's nothing I've seen so far (and I'm looking and searching) that has even made me doubt how clearly this whole "pandemic" isn't calculated, malevolent and sinister at it's very core. I don't think any of us have all the answers as to "why". That's a separate issue and question. Yes people have died. People always die in great numbers. Masks are in fact the political and who knows what else "cult" imposing muzzles on humanity with glee. That's reality. Because masks simply <em>cannot</em> physically reduce the spread of viruses. This isn't just my opinion. This is the opinion of some very reasonable, qualified and rational people in areas of medicine and science. Their voices are openly censored, silenced and removed from the internet, from discussion. They are ridiculed. This is sinister. Surely everyone, deep down, smells a very large stinking rat but if they would acknowledge it, their whole perception of the world would be shattered and they're not willing to go that route. The emperor has no clothes and me and many others are willing to point it out. We are all at risk from whichever groups are at the helm of this historically grandiose deception. Their aim is tyranny, control, harm to all of us and the generation of children we live amongst. This should be the fight if our lives yet they've got us by the balls begging for more restrictions, more masks, more distancing, harsher punishments, more ridicule, more censorship and so it goes on. So be it, but some of us will never stand by, <em>cannot</em> stand by silent and watch this shitshow unfold. Join us. You have nothing at all to lose.</p>

        <p>There's no such thing as "conspiracy theory". It's a meaningless label of ridicule. Either there's evidence for an idea or there isn't. There is plenty of evidence masks are not and cannot be effective for reducing viral spread. There is plenty of evidence Lockdowns are a CCP response to a viral outbreak imposed in the West and not a recommendation of medical science. There is plenty of evidence Lockdowns don't reduce mortality or illness. There is plenty of evidence vaccines are potentially dangerous and have caused both harm and death. There is plenty of evidence of censorship relating to all of the above. This evidence is credible, it's reasonable, it's authoritative, it deserves consideration. If you haven't got an open mind then no, you shouldn't bother replying to threads here.</p>

        <p>Solid evidence that isn't clearly and obviously biased or rooted in deep conflicts of interest. Despite the opposite being true in this currently upside down world, the onus for proving masks are effective and Lockdowns are effective <em>and proportionate</em>, both unprecedented and catastrophically destructive measures, is firmly with those who want them. Lockdowns have many peer reviewed papers and lots of other authoritative scientific and medical discussion concluding that they cannot (and are not) correlated with reduced infection or mortality. This is clear from having forced the aggressive experiment down the worlds throat for the past year, an experiment on a scale scientists could never normally dream of. The results are in and <em>extremely</em> clear; Lockdowns do not help in any way to reduce mortality or infection in a meaningful long term way and they cause unfathomable destruction in a social, psychological, medical, economic and global level. It's not a rational debate. The problem of course is that governments simply <strong>cannot</strong> admit this. It's impossible. They can't say "Sorry guys, we had the best of intentions, but it doesn't work and isn't working". They cant say this from a psychological perspective and lose face and voters and power and authority. They also can't say this from a legal perspective as it would open them up to court cases, prosecution and very likely jail time if not Crimes Against Humanity charges. The "checks and balances" we grew up believing in do not exist in reality. The media is utterly controlled by government and corporate interests, this is obvious and relatively uncontroversial although the implications are very significant. I could go on. It's the same with masks. They <em>cannot</em> work for reducing viral spread. This was <em>well understood</em>, agreed upon as consensus and uncontroversial for 40ish years pre-March 2020. Its not even a debate in reality but we've been lied to in such a grandiose way that we are now with a straight face being told to wear 2 masks! This is clear mockery and deception for anyone willing to see it. It's so obvious and blatant the only question, and it's a big one, the real rabbit hole, is why. There are many plausible and outlandish ideas.</p>

        <p>Literally gtfo of here with this bullshit grandparent rhetoric. I am so fucking tired of hearing a society of mostly selfish as fuck people suddenly grow a supposed conscience, hold hands, and sing kumbaya because "we're all in this together." If we're all so suddenly concerned with other people's health and fucking Uncle Joe whose 99 and on a ventilator is gonna be my responsibility for the rest of my life, then I want to see major tobacco companies shut down right now for causing legit lung cancer, and while they're at it I'd like every smoker to fucking personally apologize for passing along second hand smoke and ENDANGERING my life and the lives of sick and vulnerable children and old people. Like where does it stop? Where does other people's health stop being my responsibility? The means need to justify the end, and if the end is living like muzzled up dogs denied of the basic freedom to breathe for the rest of our lives, then I'm sorry but the ends do <em>not</em> justify the means. If that makes me a sociopath then goddamn I'm a sociopath, but the answer is not this "new normal" BS, and those who are ok with this shit honestly deserve the fear mongering they live in. If you want to mask up go ahead, but dont expect everyone to comply. 4 masks should be more than enough to stop the spread and I don't believe for a second that it only stops it one way. People have literally traded in common sense for the new religion of science. I bet this is how people who thought the world was flat felt when heliocentrism was introduced, clinging to their "science" and killing/ostracizing anyone who suggested otherwise.</p>

        <p>Im not going to debate or argue the rest of this here. Nobody is forced at gunpoint to buy and/or smoke cigarettes. Smoking is a choice to each their own. Some choose to smoke and again thats their choice. Their choices and actions shouldnt have any effect on you whatsoever. By you choosing to let it bother you is only hurting you in the end, pal.

<p>Ok, so lockdowns you love MIGHT save some high risk already venerable people, but DEFINITELY harms almost everyone in the general population, including children. This includes food shoratage, mental health and denial of basic hospital care for preventable things that have become death sentences, cancer and other rates have sky rocketed and so have addiction, alcoholism and domestic abuse.</p>
<p>If we end the lockdown, some high risk venerable people MIGHT die. But they were going to soon anyway. </p>

        <p>In all seriousness, this is completely true for me and I'm sure many other people. I feel like every day is a breaking point and I won't be able to take any more, just thinking about the state society is in basically all over the world and how it's very possible that the old normal is in some ways gone forever, and I don't know how I could stand to live in a world like that. I have to believe that it will go back to normal eventually, but I feel like this just sets a precedent that people in power can take away our rights whenever they please and cover it with "for everyone's safety" or "the greater good" and everyone will be totally fine with it. I'm scared that some of this will not go away just like the stuff that happened after 9/11. Especially since many of the young people are all for this, and mostly older people from what I could tell are against it. This generation (that I have the displeasure of being a part of) is the future. I will never give up, but it wears so much on me being able to see something so plain and being surrounded by people who can't and won't and being called a conspiracy theorist just because I think people are overreacting to a virus.</p>

        <p>The virus has killed hundreds of thousands of people. The people who actually have more than half a brain who wear masks are much smarter you will ever be. What you are calling “overreacting” is actually taking the necessary steps toward getting rid of the virus. You and all the other people who refuse to wear masks are absolute pieces of garbage. Downvote me all you want, you know I’m right and you are just too deep in denial to admit it</p>

        <p>No.. I'm pretty sure I'm 'grown up' at my age and I won't even get into conspiracy theories.  I'm going to go straight to abject stupidity, fear, and cowardice.  </p>
<p>'Oh my God something might kill me.  Please don't do that Mr (non mask wearer, climate change, killer asteroid, cancer, aids, total accident).  You guys choose to not take risks and die when you can stand walk and breathe.  We choose to live under the same circumstances.</p>
<p>If you're so afraid of getting sick the solution is simple. Stay home.  I don't see that as a difficult decision.  But oh wait it is your 'right' to go out and subsequently your 'right' to tell someone else how to live their life. No you have chosen to take a risk.  My God if you leave your house you might run across an anti masker.  The HORROR!!!  </p>
<p>How about you and your kind keep your masks on, just stay home, and let the people who are not afraid either kill each other off or live and laugh at your cowardice?  Sounds like  win win to me. Either you're right and we'll all die or we're right and you can all emerge from your shelters in a few years feeling like the fools you are.</p>

        <p>sorry but that's where you are wrong.  You are telling me that I have to do something I think is foolish, ineffective, and uncomfortable, so YOU can go out in public.  No sir.  How would you feel if I told you that in order for you to go out in public in a highly starched bright red shirt because I wanted to avoid stupid people for fear of getting stupid myself?  Bet you wouldn't like that one little bit would you?  Get over yourself. You nor I are not that fucking important in the big scheme of things.  If you or I die be it from a virus, cancer, car wreck, asteroid mishap, or any number of things, will not affect about 7 billion other people on the planet.</p>

        <p>you are telling me it isn't my right to feel safe in public. you are allowed to essentially make me fear for my life, in your absurd view. just admit it, you're a rightie scumbag who only cares about himself and can't be fucked to sacrifice anything for his countrymen.</p>
<p>your stupid example about a red shirt is childish and laughable. science has nothing to say about how one could catch stupid, but it has lots to say about how people catch covid. and masks are known to reduce that chance.</p>
<p>it's more like if we forced people to wear seatbelts so that we could save the lives of occupants and those who get hit by ejected humans or out of control vehicles due to ejected driver. and that's what we do. but eh, you'd probably argue against seatbelt laws too</p>

        <p>I'm telling you that if you are so afraid of a virus that has a 99% survival rate then that's on you.  Don't project your childish fear onto me.  And if you want to call me a scumbag that's fine.  I've been called way worse.  I'll sacrifice a lot for people but not my ability to live my life the way I want to.  </p>
<p>If you are SO afraid of dying then quit living.  And by 'quit living' I mean stay at home, order in, don't go out, and live like a hermit. That is your right.  But don't take away my right to live the way I want to.  That is NOT your right.  </p>
<p>And while science has nothing to say about 'catching' stupid I can assure you that the more smart people you hang around the smarter you become. The more stupid people you hang around the dumber you become.  People tend to adapt to their surroundings.  I guess we all know what type of people you hang around.  The types that let social media, fox news, and their friends, tell them what to think instead of thinking for yourself.  Then you come over here and try to project your beliefs on people who don't share them.  So instead of being a violent terrorist you're an emotional one.  There is no difference.  You go where you're not wanted and try to cause trouble.  </p>
<p>And as far as seat belt and helmet laws you're right.  If you're dumb enough not to wear one and get in a wreck well.. probably shouldn't have been in the gene pool anyway.  It's polluted enough with your kind already.  You know the people who are absolute drains on society and expect government to protect them?  You just need an all protective daddy because you don't have the stones to stand on your own. </p>
<p>You, sir, are a coward.  Best of luck in life because when rona is gone something is going to punch you squarely in the nose and you're going to go cry to daddy instead of punching back.</p>

        <p>your whole mentality revolves around precaution. you are taking action against presumed threats. when it comes to virus transmission there is no immediate threat! there isn't even any guaranteed threat! there is only the potential for transmission. and then, even if the virus does spread, there is a 99.8 percent survival rate. and most people have zero symptoms anyway!</p>
<p>I am healthy. but I might be "asymptomatic". so I might be contagious. and the virus might spread. and wearing a mask might help a tiny bit in preventing transmission. should every single fucking person on the entire planet wear a mask then?
that's too many fucking maybe's. living with constant worry that something might happen - that is fucking exhausting. it's irrational. it's paranoia.</p>
<p>you can live in fear. but don't expect everyone else to. and don't expect other people to take action to fight against your own fear.</p>
<p>driving a car means I might cause an accident. should I never drive then?</p>
<p>living is dangerous. you can't diminish every single potential risk in life. every action has consequence. don't pretend like lockdown and masks don't have a price. because they do.</p>
<p>contemplate this:
maybe the selfish ones are the people who are arguing that healthy people should mask up and quarantine and destroy their businesses.</p>

        <p>Masks do not protect the user, at best they reduce the chance of transmission for others, which is already quite low in asymptomatic individuals. So yes, security theatre was a clever choice of words.</p>

        <p>Quit whining. Grab those bootstraps. Get an essential job. Learn to code. Time to take some personal responsibility, you lazy welfare queen. You’re unskilled labor now. You can go make minimum wage until you learn marketable skills. </p>
<p>Oh, is the system rigged against you? Like we’ve been telling you for decades it was rigged against the poor? Why should I have any sympathy for you now? You’ve clearly learned nothing. The beatings will continue until solidarity improves.</p>
