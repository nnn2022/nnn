        <p>It will work out in the end. More testing is helping to show how low the death rate really is.</p>

        <p>Except it isn't. For those of us who see through the misinformation, we don't need more test results to get the point across. For those who live in fear of COVID, simply catching the rona is just as bad as dying from it, and more cases will only stoke the flames of mass hysteria no matter how mild or asymptomatic the infection. COVID testing is just another tool in the arsenal of our corrupt medical industry. If anything can deprogram the rona doomers, it is most certainly NOT more testing or more cases.</p>
<p>EDIT: And nevermind the risk of house arrest and regular harassment by medical personnel if you test positive. This is why my husband and I refuse to get tested, and why we're skipping town if anyone we know or even anyone THEY know might get tested. We've had near-zero contact with medical personnel in the past decade, not even the most life-threatening condition could convince us to go to the hospital, and we're in the process of moving off-grid primarily to preserve our bodily autonomy and medical freedom. We ain't about to get quarantined.</p>

        <p>As long as they keep treating it like its ebola, and acting like every case is a big deal, then this nightmare will never end. Every single time there are a few cases it's seen as a reason to keep wearing masks, social distance, and shut down again. If they treated covid as if it were the common flu, all those dystopian measures would be preposterous. But as long as the masses believe it's more like ebola, then this mass psychosis will continue and society will be permanently restructured  into a dystopian hell to "control" a virus that's nothing but a new common cold. This is how bad and unreal this whole shit show is.</p>

        <p>Ebola is the best comparison to how people are treating it. Kinda. Remember the mass hysteria over ebola? It wasn't nearly this bad, although ebola is way more deadly than COVID, because it wasn't so contagious. While COVID is quite mild for the vast majority of people, it is also quite contagious. So the rona."went viral" not because of how deadly or dangerous it is, but how easy it is to catch it. More testing is one of the worst possible solutions.</p>
<p>I had a similar discussion with my mother-in-law today. Yesterday was her first real AA meeting in months, her Tuesday night women's group and AA "birthday" party, which she "enjoyed" because she got to see her friends yet also found "miserable" because of masks and social distancing. When another woman came to the church crying and looking for the minister, my mother-in-law was the only person with enough courage to hug her and hold her hand. The rest of the group treated her like a pariah for the rest of the meeting. Then she mentioned the temperature check as an aside, a temperature check that almost resulted in an overheated little old lady's banishment because of her "fever" of 99.7 from standing out in the hot sun. She would've been left out in the hot sun to fry like a pancake if my mother-in-law didn't intervene.</p>
