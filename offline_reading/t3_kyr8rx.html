    <strong>Can everyone post a quick summary of their current local/national lockdown restrictions?</strong>
    <p><p>Ireland here. </p>
<p>-5km travel restriction - you cannot travel over 5km from your home without an essential reason. </p>
<p>-All non-essential businesses closed to the public</p>
<p>-Restaurants, bars and gyms completely closed</p>
<p>-Schools closed until the end of January</p>
<p>-Covid Checkpoints on roads - possible fines if you don't comply</p>
<p>-Mandatory face masks in public places - possibility of on the spot fine of €80 if not wearing one</p>
<p>Pretty hellish. Overwhelming compliance as well.  What I have described is referred to as Level 5. We are in a never ending cycle of rolling lockdowns. We will be brought back to Level 3 which will allow the gyms and restaurants to operate with facemask and social distancing and the travel restriction to be lifted so that you can travel anywhere within the boundaries of your own county only, but I don't see this happening until March at the earliest. </p>
<p>Very likely possibility of a COVID passport being required here. Look at this video, this type of hell is coming to all of your countries as well. https://youtu.be/AFerXipG-t0 </p>
<p>What about you guys</p></p>

        <p>Austria:
We're in our 3rd Lockdown since December 26th. All non-essential businesses and schools are closed. Take aways are possible. 24h curfew (except of grocery shopping, physical activities, taking care of those in need, etc.). Some borders to other countries are already closed. If you enter Austria you need to register online and quarantine for 10 days.
Tomorrow will be new restrictions announced.</p>

        <p>We've been in the current lockdown since December 26th as well, and it's until January 31st officially, but this will almost definitely be pushed back. Sounds pretty similar to here.</p>

        <p>Honestly aside from masks in public buildings, I don't know what my state is doing? Nobody seems to care other than mask wearing. Nobody even social distances anymore. My sons school is about to go full time in person (right now it's 4 days in person, 1 day distance) and we still visit family and have friends over. Aside from tourism being a little slower than usual, we are pretty much free to come and go as we please. 
I don't see that changing either. All this and supposedly it's a hot spot? I can still count on one hand the number of people I personally know who has (have?) gotten it. In UT.</p>

        <p>I live in upstate NY and it has never been that bad. I honestly don't and can't keep up with the rules, but we only had that one lockdown from like end of March to May. Restaurants served takeout all through it. My kid went to summer camp mask less. Schools are on a half in person/half virtual schedule. They opened Sept to Nov then closed then reopened two weeks ago. 
I'm across the state from NYC. Not sure what it's like there. </p>
<p>No covid checkpoints ever although in March I was given an essential work letter from my company director. No fines for masks ever. Never saw anyone complain about people not masked. </p>
<p>I've never been more happy to be in America. I'm shocked at how other countries' governments are acting.</p>

        <p>I believe so too and don't understand Americans on here talking about wanting to move to other countries. There aren't any better ones right now. We even had someone from Sweden explaining how it wasn't all sunshine and roses there.</p>
<p>Even if one of our cities goes crazy, we can just drive a little ways to a smaller town or the next county over. It seems so much more free.</p>

        <p>I’m in East Tennessee. I haven’t done anything differently. I refuse to wear a mask. I’ve always been diligent about hygiene and hand washing. I never really went out to eat much anyways. I worked through this whole period (I work in the building trades). I’m doing my part to buck whatever bullshit mandates are put in place to try to encourage others to think for themselves and live according to their respective consciences. If I’m sick, I’ll stay home and isolate just like normal but I’m not wearing a muzzle and I refuse to live in fear.</p>

        <p>Tennessee has no state mandates but “counties that have a health department” are authorized by the governor to implement “guidelines”. </p>
<p>I live on the border between two counties. One has “guidelines” the other doesn’t. The “guideline” county requires masks indoors and tries to police distancing. The other county is business as usual.... guess where we shop and go out to eat and where we switched our gym membership too??</p>

        <p>In Greece it's bad too. </p>
<p>- Travelling inside the country is restricted.<br>
- 9pm - 5am curfew (6pm - 5am in some places)<br>
- Masks everywhere, indoors and outdoors even if you're walking alone</p>
<p>- Everything is closed except pharmacies, grocery stores and only takeaway food or coffee shops.</p>
<p>- You have to text the government everytime you go out, telling them your name, address and the reason you want to go out</p>
<p>- Police checkpoints,  €300 fine if you don't wear a mask or haven't texted the government.</p>
<p>All that since October.</p>

        <p>Southern Arizona...most things are open (restaurants, bars, gyms etc). Schools are a mix (some open, some closed). Mask mandates in all metro areas (which covers most state residents). There is a curfew in my county from 10PM- 5AM but I don’t think it is enforced. No travel restrictions.</p>

        <p>Goa, India. We are basically having normal tourist season minus foreigners. Lots of Indian tourists. You can spot them because they have masks on when they arrive, but when they realise nobody else wears them they take them off. </p>
<p>Have been having yoga classes and ecstatic dances and cacao ceremonies and all the other hippie shit this entire time. There was a two week period at the very beginning where everything shutdown and we were buying black market veggies, but since then it's been very normal and we feel incredibly fortunate. Same was true in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Dharamshala in the Himalayas, and Ragpur where we went for a wedding. Only Mumbai and Delhi seem to be taking it very seriously.</p>

        <p>Ontario, Canada. Stay-at-home order, but it's quite loose in comparison to others I've heard of (not that it's great, though!). There are 29 essential reasons you can leave your home, and there are no travel restrictions in kilometres or police checkpoints. Schools in hotspots are staying closed until at least Feb. 10, but some northern schools are open now, and some eastern schools will be open after January 25. Masks are mandatory indoors. Gyms, restaurants and bars have been closed completely (except for restaurant takeout and delivery) since December 26 in all zones, and they've been closed since November in hotspots. Non-essential stores (non-grocery, non-pharmacy) are only open for curbside pickup, until 8 pm.</p>
