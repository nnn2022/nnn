    <strong>Lockdowns and Climate Change</strong>

<p>I keep hearing about lockdowns being used for climate change. I believe that to be a real possibility because of the precedent sent by the covid lockdowns. I across this interesting campaign that demonstrates how this is clearly already in the works.</p>
<p>There is a network of advertising insiders called the Purpose Disruptors who say they are working together to tackle climate change. One of their projects is curiously titled The Great Reset. They try to reframe the Great Reset as some sort of grassroots cultural movement, instead of the dream of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum. They want to maintain certain aspects of lockdowns that they deem environmentally positive and embed them into society.</p>

<p>They held a <em>creative competition,</em> where people could submit their artwork to support the  Great Reset and have their work featured in outdoor spaces, digitally, and on the radio. Here some of those propaganda posters on their Instagram...</p>

<p><strong>Anyways, here is a real goldmine about future lockdowns and climate change..</strong></p>
