        <p>He's talking about flu there. And it is a good point. We never had this reaction to flu, which also can be very dangerous, even more so than Covid. So the conclusion is, masks and lockdowns - unneccessary.</p>

        <p>Your argument is the flu can be dangerous so we don't need lockdowns and masks? The last time the flu (I think) was more dangerous than covid was 1918</p>

        <p>whilst I think covid is likely to be more harsh than the flu in general it's hard to compare the diseases as they've been treated entirely differently in terms of how deaths are defined and the amount of testing that's been carried out for corona</p>

        <p>Well in the UK deaths are defined as any death within 28 days of a positive test unless there's another obvious cause of death e.g trauma so to me the deaths here are pretty accurate and they're much higher than any flu season in the past 100 years and that's with lockdowns, increased hygiene, masks etc. </p>
<p>Also testing doesn't change the deaths</p>

        <p>whilst I've seen the trauma clause in I think australia's definition I've never seen it in any of the uk's definitions. whilst obviously there will be deaths due to covid related complications the definition is still super vague and the anecdotes of people saying their loved ones got marked down as covid deaths despite showing no symptoms implies somehting is wrong with the system.</p>
<p>you have got to remember that pcr tests can basically say asymptomatic people who just have dead covid cells are positive</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54000629</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/qualityofmortalitydataduringthecoronaviruspandemicenglandandwales/2020">ngl, didn't read the whole thing as it's kinda long but this is our own government admitting the standards in determing a death has dropped, and even though pcr testing is shit not everyone who had corona on their death certificate was even tested.</a></p>
<p>testing does change the deaths because the more you test everyone, the more you'll get positive results, which means more corona deaths. with the test being faulty it also means more false positives, and since you only have to die with covid rather than of it to be counted as a covid death, it becomes harder and harder to distinguish who actually died of covid or because it triggered something off in them and who just died of something unrelated whilst jsut so happening to have covid.</p>
<p>like you gotta remember the average age of someone who dies of covid is 80, and a lot of them have comorbidities, people not too far from death/quite vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Yup, masks and lockdowns don't work when it comes to Covid. Flu can be very, very bad, not as contagious anymore as it used to be. Covid, even though more contagious, mostly mild or NO symptoms at all lol. Respiratory viruses can suck, especially since sometimes it takes months to fully recover from them, also sometimes they leave you with permanent issues but that's rare and definitely not worth stopping the world over.</p>

        <p>I don't want to have false hope here but this sounds like it might be the start of easing the population back to normal? We'll do what we do for the flu, well all we do for the flu is offer vaccinations ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
