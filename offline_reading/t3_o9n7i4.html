        <p>No one outside the United States gives a flying fuck about fauci or any of the ridiculous US ‘libtard’ vs ‘alt-right’ bs.  It’s a global pandemic you clown.  We needed lockdowns to stop muppets like you infecting or getting infected and swamping hospitals because you needed to be kept alive on a ventilator or take up a hospital bed to get treatment.   No government anywhere gives a shit about you individually but they do care if the entire medical system collapses.  (See India a couple of months ago where people died because hospitals literally ran out of oxygen). Who’s going to stop you dying from a heart attack from eating all your Doritos if every single hospital bed is taken up by a covid patient ? No one. You’ll die. Not from covid directly but because of covid indirectly.  Stop being a selfish prick - wear a mask and get a fucking vaccine.  You guys bang on about ‘I don’t want a new normal’ but won’t do Jack shit to get us back to normal. Stop being a bunch of pussy conspiracy snowflakes. Jesus Christ. Wear a mask. Get the vaccine.  Simple stuff.</p>

        <p>We need lockdowns LMAO… I stopped reading there.</p>
<p>Maybe in the first few months, remember 2 weeks to flatten the curve? That’s how it should have been done. Repeated lockdowns a year after, or after vaccines are out is beyond stupid. </p>
<p>All 95% of these lockdowns have done is prolong the pandemic. We could have been over this in 6 months if we let it run it’s course through healthy populations.</p>
<p>The longer you keep it here with lockdowns, the more variants we will have, you absolute fucking muppet</p>

        <p>Lol at Bill Gates. Wtf? What the fuck has gates got to do with this?. If you think science and medicine is some kind of partisan issue it’s because you’re a dipshit hick town American who can only see the word through American politics.   A mask does limit you spreading or getting covid. The vaccine stops a % of people from ending up hospitalized from covid.  In the UK right now the link between cases and hospitalization appears to have broken because most people are now vaccinated despite the delta variant cases surging. </p>
<p>Tbh you guys are exactly the same as the flat earth crowd or the guys who think reptiles run the world in a secret global cabal.  You’re a bunch of marginalized fuckwits who think google and YouTube gives you more information than actual medical professionals and actual science.  You all huddle round the fire on nonewnormal convincing each other you’re right and everyone is an idiot and against you or that they hate trump or freedom or whatever.  You’re enlightened.  You’re smart.   Everyone else is a sheep. </p>
<p>The reality is you’re none of those things but it helps to feel that way because it gives you a purpose and an identity.  Just wear a fucking mask and get a vaccine so we can get back to normal. Ironically the very name of this cancer subreddit that is funny to poke occasionally. </p>
<p>“You changed the way your body deals with a virus because bill gates told you to”. Fucking legit lol. </p>

        <p>When my father was dying from congenital heart failure the two best hospitals in the area were full to capacity with patients suffering from a disease with a 99% survival rate.  He had to go to the small less equipped hospital.  I lost a cousin and my great aunt was in ICU for two weeks with it. Yes it has a 99% survival rate, but that small amount of people getting severely ill was enough to clog up hospitals.  This was in Henderson East Texas back in February. The hospitals that got full to capacity was Nacogdoches and Mother Francis in Tyler.</p>

        <p>Media failing more than science failing.</p>
<p>But first a couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm anti lockdown before people accuse me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm pro vaxx choice (if you don't want it, don't get it and no one should ask or tell you to, no one should have the right to ask if you've had it either)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the answer:</p>
<p>We knew it would simply reduce symptoms since day one of development. Fully preventative isn't really possible with any virus that mutates at all. Which is most of them.</p>
<p>The issue was that it doesn't make for good propaganda to say "it'll make it kinda better if you catch it" and on the flip side the media has been fear mongering asymptomatic spread hard core.</p>
<p>Less of a "scientist and doctors are deliberately lying to you" and more of a "some scientists and doctors are more worried than may be necessary about asymptomatic spread being a big issue and the media blows it the fuck up" while "the vaccine is better than no vaccine for people who could have a severe reaction" gets blown the fuck up by the media AND politicians.</p>

        <p>Science has utterly failed to confront media at every junction. Science is now discredited along with the MSM they allowed to cow them. So is medicine, statecraft\politics [even more], medical\social watchdogs, the ACLU, etc.</p>
<p>All totally discredited. The scientists and doctors ARE DELIBERATELY LYING. They are doing it to protect themselves - a way of saying 'just following orders'. Not a good defense when you are engaged knowingly in human rights violations on an epic, global scale.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are some that speak out anyway, or are independently wealthy enough to have no such fear. They are censored to no end of course...</p>

        <p>if science confronts the media, the media attack the institutions that employ them and get them fired, or all their funding taken away. its just like that woman scientist thats the foremost expert on polar bears on earth ( cant remember her name) the global warming alarmists were claiming its so warm up north that its killing all the polar bears. she chimed in and stated that there are more polar bears now than ever in recorded history. she had to publicly "apologize" for her comments because the news media picked it up and ran with the headline "so and so now climate change denier" and tried to get her funding completely shut down. same thing has happened with other scientists as well. when the doctors gave a press conference about covid and showed skepticism they were labeled quacks and each one had to defend their medical license.  </p>
<p>scientists are inherently weaklings and will be the last people on earth to fight for anything. theyll just shrug their shoulders and go with the flow no matter how many people they kill. M.I.T. staff withheld  information about the wuhan lab so no one thought they were siding with trump...the list goes on and on. at this point if a scientist says it, i'm automatically skeptical of the subject no matter what they say. hell, if they agree with me, i question myself its that bad</p>

        <p>i'm with you g, i agree with preddy much everything you said. the media handling and politicization of this whole thing is just too much to take sometimes.</p>
<p>i was saying the same about the mrna vaccine technology, how it's so unfortunate that they decided to push it through in an emergency situation that was already so politically fraught and tense, when they could have gone with more traditional vaccine methods that are familiar to people and that they understand better. they could have debuted mrna therapies for cancer like they have done research for decades to do. people love miracle cancer cures.</p>
<p>instead they were like uhhh how about we debut this amazing new technology for something totally different and rife with controversy instead lol? now there will be people who will die from cancer because they won't trust a technology that could have actually been their miracle cure. the marketing folks really fucked this up.</p>

<p>Nope, this is incorrect. It has nothing to do with mutations.  It has to do with how these experimental cov19 "vaccines" work.  They are NOT vaccines. They are treatments, or gene therapies if you will.</p>
<p>They do not wipe out the virus as vaccines do. They are "leaky" protection. the mNRA tech they're using just ensures that later exposure to the live virus allows it to piggyback on the immune system, and infect the person even faster. </p>
<p>This has been shown in all previous animal testing. This kills the lab rat.</p>
<p>They even have a name for it: Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)</p>
<p>And that is why there are more "vaccinated" dying than anyone else now.  And it will only get much, much worse. :-(</p>
<p>Next flu season, when masses of "vaccinated" come in contact with the virus, is going to be a horrific disaster.</p>

<p>Also, how do you feel about the idea that vaccinated people don’t have to wear masks if the masks are meant to protect others and the vaccine doesn’t prevent someone from getting it</p>

        <p>If that’s the case which I agree with you, then in your opinion why are teens being coerced into getting the vax when they had extremely low rates of covid deaths especially under healthy individuals? Why aren’t they allowing previous infections to count towards their herd immunity goals?</p>

        <p>Actually, yes. If you’re asymptotic you have less of a chance of spreading it due to your fluids not being expelled constantly. This is regardless of if you’re vaccinated or not. Now, if you’re vaccinated, you have less of a chance of showing symptoms. Thus, less of a chance of spreading. I don’t really understand what the confusion here is…</p>

        <p>Yea but by that logic we're just waiting to make everyone asymptomatic, which most people were this past year anyways.  What is the difference between an asymptomatic vaccinated person and an asymptomatic unvaccinated person?  If we're eventually going to get to the point where 80% of people are only at risk of asymptomatic disease, then we're admitting that there was no point in quarantining healthy asymptomatic people the entire past year.</p>

        <p>Sure, I’ll have a spin.   If you don’t have symptoms, you are less likely to transmit the virus in a given period of time. Note that I said “less likely” not “unlikely.”   It’s an issue of the amount of viral load you are carrying.  If you are displaying symptoms then you have a higher viral load than someone who is not.  The higher the viral load the more more viral shedding you are capable of.   It’s not that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people can’t transmit the virus, it would just take them more time to shed as much.  To become infected, you have to receive a certain initial viral load threshold otherwise the virus isn’t likely to take hold.  You may remember that imprecise 15-minute rule guideline from last year.  This is where that idea came from.  </p>
<p>So the reason why asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals are worrisome is that they don’t know they have the virus and are out and about spreading it.  Hopefully, most of the people who have symptoms are staying hope and not spreading it in the public.   </p>
<p>So most of the time the vaccines will keep you from getting infected.  However, some people can still become infected, but most of them will still be asymptomatic,  and then a few of them will be symptomatic.  </p>
<p>It’s also important to note that this isn’t like last year.  We (in the US) have vaccinated a large percentage of our population especially the most vulnerable.  This makes a big difference which is why restrictions in most of the US have and are being lifted.</p>

        <p>The degree of asymptomatic spread really is "unlikely" not just "less likely", although it is orders of magnitude "less likely" if you want to argue semantics.</p>
<p>From this <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102">study</a> last year looking into household spread of COVID, they found that asymptomatic transmission (they used a term called "secondary attack rate") was 0.7% whereas symptomatic transmission was 18%.</p>
<p>The study referenced looked at over 77,000 participants in the household, which is the most likely setting for COVID to spread, and still only showed asymptomatic spread at a 0.7% rate.  The emphasize this, the household is by far the highest risk setting for spread, with maybe only hospitals, nursing homes, and factories comparing.</p>
<p>Now you'd have to compare this incredibly low rate of transmission with other settings that are lower risk (movie theatre, sports stadiums, etc.) and judge that asymptomatic transmission likely occurs at some rate between 0-0.7%, more likely on the lower end especially when outdoors.</p>
<p>The fact is that cases and deaths plummeted this time last year even before we had vaccines, and when the majority of the population hadn't even been infected yet, leaving more COVID naive people susceptible to infection.  We need to stop testing asymptomatic people and focus only on symptomatic individuals where the cycle threshold values are under 25.  This is even more obvious now that the majority of high risk individuals are vaccinated (96% of COVID deaths in Canada were 60 years and above, 70% total in nursing homes).  Although I don't really trust the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext">effectiveness of these vaccines</a> overall, let alone the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm">known/unknown safety risks</a>.</p>
<p>I like your optimism and I don't like when people get downvoted for expressing different opinions, but I disagree with your explanation based on what I've read and observed.</p>

        <p>From the study</p>
<p>&rt;It’s also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious</p>
<p>PCR testing is extremely unreliable so we're just finding cases in  healthy people rather than confirming a diagnosis in a sick person</p>

<p>I disagree.  It still looks like close to 60% of cases are probably due to asymptomatic transmission.  The best study I continue to find is this one: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707</a>  The study has problems, but it's probably the best we'll get for awhile. </p>
<p>&rt;From this study last year looking into household spread of COVID, they found that asymptomatic transmission (they used a term called "secondary attack rate") was 0.7% whereas symptomatic transmission was 18%.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The study referenced looked at over 77,000 participants in the household, which is the most likely setting for COVID to spread, and still only showed asymptomatic spread at a 0.7% rate.  The emphasize this, the household is by far the highest risk setting for spread, with maybe only hospitals, nursing homes, and factories comparing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've seen this paper before.  "Secondary attack rate" does not mean asymptomatic transmission. A secondary attack is when one person becomes infected and then infects someone else in the same household, dorm, etc.  The secondary attack can be done either symptomatically or asymptomatically.  </p>
<p>So now onto the problems.  This study is actually a meta-analysis of 50+ smaller studies.  The aim of the paper was to show that households are a significant location of transmission (Which is like yes, of course, it is.  Respiratory ailments are often like this.)  It's not meant for the purposes you're trying to use it for.  If you look at the limitations section of this paper, you'll see why.  For one thing, it's a meta-analysis so they have to try to account for the differences in methodology for each study.  They literally say that "Given that studies cannot always rule out infections from outside of the home (eg, nonhousehold contacts), household transmission may be overestimated."  They tried to reduce this impact by removing antibody-only testing studies but the impact is still there.  18 of the studies they used looked at only symptomatic households which would purposefully exclude asymptomatic cases.  </p>
<p>There are two more issues having to do with this being an observational study.  First, many of these smaller studies were done under lockdown conditions and restrictions.  In such a scenario, you will less asymptomatic spread from outside (things like masks and distancing work).  Second, you will naturally have higher occurrences of symptomatic vs asymptomatic.  People in households that don't get sick, won't go and get tested whereas people who are sick do get tested.  They will end up missing a lot of these asympotatic only cases.  </p>
<p>You can see a study like this one that refutes findings like this study although it too is far from perfect. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.20225573v2</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Now you'd have to compare this incredibly low rate of transmission with other settings that are lower risk (movie theatre, sports stadiums, etc.) and judge that asymptomatic transmission likely occurs at some rate between 0-0.7%, more likely on the lower end especially when outdoors.</p>
<p>So this is different than asymptomatic vs symptomatic transmission.   Outdoors has always been safer than inside.  Less than 1% of the transmission has been shown to occur outside. Also, a movie theatre is very different from a sports stadium, just FYI.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The fact is that cases and deaths plummeted this time last year even before we had vaccines, and when the majority of the population hadn't even been infected yet, leaving more COVID naive people susceptible to infection.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure what this has to do with asymptomatic vs symptomatic transmission.  The reason there was a drop this time last year was because we were coming off 2+ months of lockdowns and restrictions and it was the summer time so people were outdoors more than inside.   If you look, rates started back up by late June and into July when the effects of the lockdown were ending.  If you look, the case rate this year has been going down fairly consistently this spring.  The pattern is very different.  I also wouldn't assume that the majority of the population has been exposed yet it either.  The early prediction that 80% of cases would be asymptomatic turned out to be wrong.  It looks much more like only 17% of cases are asymptomatic.  https://doi.org/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;We need to stop testing asymptomatic people and focus only on symptomatic individuals where the cycle threshold values are under 25.  This is even more obvious now that the majority of high risk individuals are vaccinated (96% of COVID deaths in Canada were 60 years and above, 70% total in nursing homes).  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Assuming you are meaning PCR testing, I disagree.   Without extensive testing, we can't track how effectively we are curtailing transmission and how well the vaccines are working at removing the virus in totality.   Another reason too (at least for the US) is to continue to watch for the delta variant (or any others) on our shores.  It is unclear at present how well vaccines will work against it.  These findings will have definite implications on public health policy. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Although I don't really trust the effectiveness of these vaccines overall, let alone the known/unknown safety risks.</p>
<p>That is definitely a different discussion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I like your optimism and I don't like when people get downvoted for expressing different opinions, but I disagree with your explanation based on what I've read and observed.</p>
<p>And that's fine.  People can disagree so long as we do it respectfully.</p>

&rt;  The study has problems, but it's probably the best we'll get for awhile.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from the study you cited "The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are <strong>75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms</strong>" </p>
<p>That is one hell of an assumption that has no data to back it up.  That study uses a model with tons of assumptions rather than empirical data.  The study I referenced at least dealt with spread that actually did/didn't happen, not just a model that's loaded with assumptions.</p>
<p>&rt;I've seen this paper before. "Secondary attack rate" does not mean asymptomatic transmission. A secondary attack is when one person becomes infected and then infects someone else in the same household, dorm, etc. The secondary attack can be done either symptomatically or asymptomatically.</p>
<p>Yes "secondary attack rate" is split into both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with asymptomatic being 0.7% and symptomatic being 18%.  Therefore they are reviewing the secondary attack rate of both sets of individuals and asymptomatic spread is essentially negligible.</p>
<p>&rt;The aim of the paper was to show that households are a significant location of transmission (Which is like yes, of course, it is. Respiratory ailments are often like this.) It's not meant for the purposes you're trying to use it for.</p>
<p>Just because the paper aims to show one thing, it doesn't mean that results can't shed light on other points.  This paper aimed to show that the household is a significant location of transmission, but in doing so they showed that asymptomatic spread occurs at an extremely low rate, even in an intimate setting like the home.</p>
<p>&rt;You can see a study like this one that refutes findings like this study although it too is far from perfect. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.20225573v2">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.20225573v2</a></p>
<p>From the study, "Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 0.30 times the odds (95%CrI: 0.12-0.67)<br>
of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms consistent with COVID19 (Figure 3). The difference was larger (OR=0.24, 95%CrI 0.10-0.56) when only considering those<br>
who reported symptoms more than two weeks before blood draw as symptomatic infections (Table S6)".  This study does have many limitations too, but it also shows that asymptomatic spread is significantly less than symptomatic.</p>
<p>&rt;So this is different than asymptomatic vs symptomatic transmission. Outdoors has always been safer than inside. Less than 1% of the transmission has been shown to occur outside. Also, a movie theatre is very different from a sports stadium, just FYI.</p>
<p>I was making the point that if asymptomatic transmission is 0.7% in the most intimate of settings (the household) then nearly all other settings will be less than that.  I understand that movie theatres are different than sports stadiums (no need to get snarky), but both will still be less intimate than a household and therefore even more reason to open them up as people without symptoms will have essentially 0% possibility of spreading.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not sure what this has to do with asymptomatic vs symptomatic transmission. The reason there was a drop this time last year was because we were coming off 2+ months of lockdowns and restrictions and it was the summer time so people were outdoors more than inside.</p>
<p>I made this comment in response to your original post addressing how vaccines have helped to make things different this year.  We had no vaccines last year yet we saw the same seasonal changes in cases and deaths, that's the point.</p>
<p>You seem to believe that lockdowns and restrictions really did lower cases and deaths but that's just not the case.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cesifo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cesifo/ifab003/6199605">Here</a> are a few <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2019706118">studies</a> that <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28930">refute</a> your belief in lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;Assuming you are meaning PCR testing, I disagree. Without extensive testing, we can't track how effectively we are curtailing transmission and how well the vaccines are working at removing the virus in totality. Another reason too (at least for the US) is to continue to watch for the delta variant (or any others) on our shores. It is unclear at present how well vaccines will work against it. These findings will have definite implications on public health policy.</p>
<p>I think we both know that the PCR testing is extremely unreliable, especially when the cycle threshold values are higher than 25.  We are finding cases in otherwise healthy people rather than confirming cases in sick people.  The delta variant is also very clearly more mild with its most common symptoms being runny nose, sore throat, and headache.  It does viruses no good to become more deadly because they'll kill their hosts too quickly and not be able to spread.  Variants will become more and more mild as time goes on.</p>
<p>&rt;That is definitely a different discussion.</p>
<p>It's a crucial discussion when we're trying to vaccinate every human on the planet despite only a small fraction actually being at risk of complications from COVID.  You referenced vaccines in your original post so that's why I addressed them too.  There is no reason for young people to get vaccinated seeing as we know the short-term risks (heart inflammation, blood clots, etc.) and we don't know the long-term complications but they don't look promising as we now know that the lipid nanoparticle that carriers the mRNA accumulates heavily in the ovaries and bone marrow.</p>

<p>It's good to see that you know the difference between the liposome, the spike protein, and the mRNA strand. So many people read that table and didn't understand what it was saying.  If it helps, the liposome residues are not accumulating in the ovaries.  What you are witnessing is just the dispersion of the lipid molecules through the body for the first 48 hours from the injection area. The ovaries are not out of line with the rest of the body based on size.  There are a number of organs that have higher concentrations than the ovaries.  The spleen, the intestines, and others, but especially the liver. None of this is unexpected especially for the liver as that's one of its functions to process fatty acids and remove them.  What that table leaves out is what happens next.  Within 300 hours the lipids are out of every organ in the rats except for the liver.  The liver continues to have trace amounts for up to 6 weeks.  The rats were injected with a substantially larger dose than a human will get. </p>
<p>As for the blood clots, it is still unclear if J&amp;J and AstraZeneca cause them especially J&amp;J.  The myocarditis is probably caused by the Pfizer vaccine.  Both blood clots and myocarditis are potential side effects from vaccines and viral infections.   Blood clots and myocarditis are very rare side effects though.  In the US, there were 393 cases of myocarditis post-vaccine.  I did the math and that works out to .0003% (If you use the unverified number of 616 that's .0004%). At that rate, even young people have a greater chance of myocarditis from the virus than the vaccine.    It's also true that no one in the US has died from vaccine-related myocarditis and the average discharge rate was 1 day.  Right now young people are making up 33% of all new covid cases.    <br>

<p>&rt;That is one hell of an assumption that has no data to back it up.  </p>
<p>I think if you re-read the study more closely you'll see where they get the range of their numbers from.  It's not that big of a jump as they base their numbers on a meta-analysis of eight datasets (same as your household-only study). The number they arrive at is about the same as several earlier studies [1] [2] for pre- and a- symptomatic.    You can't really knock this as being a model when the paper you provided is also a model based on meta-analysis numbers.</p>
<p>These models based on prior datasets are about the best we will be likely to get.  They can't test presymptomatic vs asymptomatic vs symptomatic empirically under lab conditions.  Intentionally infecting people is highly unethical.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Yes "secondary attack rate" is split into both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with asymptomatic being 0.7% and symptomatic being 18%.  </p>
<p>Glad we agree on the definition of secondary attack.  If you check your phrasing, hopefully you'll see why it appears that you were calling asymptotic spread second attack.  I was making sure you understood the difference.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; This paper aimed to show that the household is a significant location of transmission, but in doing so they showed that asymptomatic spread occurs at an extremely low rate, even in an intimate setting like the home.</p>
<p>Yes, but again if you look at how they collected their measurements you'll see why they would never find much asymptomatic spread to begin with. This is literally in the paper's limitation section. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;From the study, "Seropositive household members not reporting symptoms had 0.30 times the odds (95%CrI: 0.12-0.67)of infecting another household member compared to those reporting symptoms consistent with COVID19 (Figure 3). </p>
<p>Yes, no one is disputing that a symptomatic individual is more contagious than an asymptomatic person. This was in my initial comment.  You were claiming that there were orders of magnitude difference. The studies I gave show that this is not true (hence the 0.3 times, so just about a 1/3)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I was making the point that if asymptomatic transmission is 0.7% in the most intimate of settings (the household) then nearly all other settings will be less than that.  I understand that movie theatres are different than sports stadiums (no need to get snarky), but both will still be less intimate than a household and therefore even more reason to open them up as people without symptoms will have essentially 0% possibility of spreading.</p>
<p>I wasn't being snarky, sorry if I came across that way.  I just wanted to make sure the difference was clear.  Not everyone understands the difference between fresh air in a large area vs recycled air in an enclosed space.  The CDC was caught misestimating the chances of outdoor exposure because they counting mixed environments.  This is why they dropped the number to 1% from 10%.  I would not discount movie theaters as less of a threat than a household per unit of time.   In a household, you're exposed to a static set of people probably under 10 typically.  In a movie theater, you are exposed to many people you've never been around before both in the theater and in other theaters depending on how the air is cycled. People in movie theaters are also more densely packed than your typical household (arm to arm vs people spread around 2 or 3 couches when watching tv).  It's hard to have numbers for comparison because movie theaters were pretty much shut down in most places. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I made this comment in response to your original post addressing how vaccines have helped to make things different this year.  We had no vaccines last year yet we saw the same seasonal changes in cases and deaths, that's the point.</p>
<p>Yes but that's not the case which is what I was saying [3] [4]. The case curve and especially the death curve are very different.   In the prior year, you had a small case-rate tapering leading into June from April 13th before climbing again.  This year in the same time frame, it was plummeting. The death rate is even more starkly different. Since its peak in late January, it has done nothing but drop. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You seem to believe that lockdowns and restrictions really did lower cases and deaths but that's just not the case.  Here are a few studies that refute your belief in lockdowns.</p>
<p>They don't really refute it though.  What they said in a couple of places is that people were already doing this by the time the government ordered SIPs so it's more of a semantic argument over people doing it themselves vs. being ordered to do so.  Also, I get the impression from the first paper, that really the governments were too slow to implement SIPs (I can't really blame the governments, though, this hasn't happened in 100 years.), but that they were successful in flattening the curve and helping to prevent hospitals from being overloaded initially which was the point. I like the second paper too because it states that the SIPs only had a small effect on the pandemic economic disruptions (this is a point I have argued with others).   I have a few critiques but one I find interesting in the second paper is that they critical of population weighting adjustments and the exclusion of New Jersey and New York.  I would argue that by the time New York and New Jersey implemented SIPs it was already too late.  They were the first hard-hit locations and provided an advanced warning system for the rest of the country. Also, you have to address population density. Population density is everything in disease transmission.  The more population-dense states did tend to have higher death counts despite having longer SIPs, but I would argue that's due to their population density.  This same argument is true for Sweden vs. France, Sweden didn't (and couldn't) mandate a SIP but Sweden didn't lose as many people as France.  However, when you compare Sweden to their other similar Nordic neighbors they did really, really bad.[5]</p>
<p>When I look at the curve for the US [6], I see a definite impact of people not staying at home, masking and social distancing.  About a month out from the lifting of SIPs, you start seeing a rise in cases around June 15th.  A rise in respiratory diseases over the summer is very atypical.  Something was definitely holding it back beforehand.   I can also see that around mid-July, when less harsh restrictions starting going back up (masks and social distancing) you start a decrease again. </p>
<p>For the record, I am not an advocate of having another lockdown.  If there was a mutation that allowed for widescale immunity breakthrough, I would only want a mask and distancing restrictions back in place.  The first lockdown was only necessary to give the health industry and industrial complex time to ramp up.  They would be ready at this point. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I think we both know that the PCR testing is extremely unreliable, especially when the cycle threshold values are higher than 25.  We are finding cases in otherwise healthy people rather than confirming cases in sick people.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that it is unreliable. I would say that you get a high number of false-positive owing to people already having been asymptomatic and then testing positive for several weeks afterward or having very low-level infections.  I think that it provides a valuable trend line to follow and a decent way of sampling for variants.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  The delta variant is also very clearly more mild with its most common symptoms being runny nose, sore throat, and headache.  It does viruses no good to become more deadly because they'll kill their hosts too quickly and not be able to spread.  Variants will become more and more mild as time goes on.</p>
<p>I agree.  It's a basic rule in biology that parasites tend to become less lethal over time.  The problem is though the "over time" part. It can take a while.  As long as there are ample hosts there may be no evolutionary inducement.  As for the delta variant, it's not the effects I'm so concerned about but its transmissibility which seems to be greater.  There are still large parts of the world not vaccinated and it does show some capacity at vaccine escape.  In Israel, half of their cases are now vaccinated people with this variant. Most of those people only have minor symptoms, but they are carriers again.  *If* it were to find another successful mutation or two to evade immunity, then it could be a drastic reset.  I doubt this will happen, but I'm keeping a watchful eye.</p>

        <p>If posting factual information is trolling then sure:</p>
<p>Asymptomatic, presymptomatic, or low-symptomatic spread has been, and will always be, a thing. COVID has a massive range of how peoples bodies are reacting to it. As you are aware many people get the disease and have no or very few symptoms, while others have life threatening symptoms. Either way the virus is replicating and released from your lungs during regular activities like breathing and talking.</p>
<p>One of the cool things the human body can do is called the adaptive immune response. When your body is exposed to an antigen after developing an adaptive response, your immune system mounts a larger and faster response the next time you’re exposed</p>
<p>Which means that if you get sick after being vaccinated (and typically post-infection) you are much less likely to be infectious because your less likely to have a high viral load and will have that viral load for less time meaning you’re less likely to pass it on.</p>

        <p>You idiots do realize that they never said the vaccine was preventing you from catching the virus, right? Not everyone that had COVID was asymptomatic. The point of the lock down was to slow the spread so hospitals weren't being overrun with people in the ICU, not to get rid of the virus completely.</p>

        <p>I have been wondering about this for a couple of weeks. The Doctors are saying you are most infectious during the 4 to 7 days before you start showing symptoms. This makes the Covid vaccine useless in stopping the spread.... or at most it will only slow it down slightly. When I asked my Dr about whether Covid viruses typically spread before showing symptoms, she said no. I asked her if there is any scientific backing for the claim that you infect others before you show symptoms and she said she doesn't know. Anyone have any info to share?</p>

        <p>Indeed, they just admitted they've been lying.</p>
<p>There  was never any science behind the theory of presymptomatic infection.  In fact, there are HUGE studies on this.</p>
<p>Over 10 million cases examined, and not one instance of asymptomatic infection was found.  Even though they were explicitly searching for such.</p>
<p>No symptoms means EXTREMELY little chance of passing it on. They don't want anyone to catch on to that though. But the OP reference explains it in clear and unavoidable logic. </p>
<p>Also, there are many peer-reviewed studies that prove lockdowns are completely ineffective. Also something  corrupt "doctors" and politicians know full well, yet continue to lie about constantly and consistently.</p>

        <p>They act pedantic about it and say that vaccinated people who are asymptomatic have less chance of passing it on as opposed to an unvaccinated people who are asymptomatic. Total fucking bullshit basically 😂</p>

        <p>This right here boils my blood SO much. At work vaccinated don’t have to wear masks because ‘studies say asymptomatic vaccinated people don’t spread Covid’ but then don’t even mention that asymptomatic non vaccinated ALSO don’t spread Covid. So unvaccinated have to wear masks… with no symptoms. It’s just punishment at this point</p>

        <p>In Canada on CHTV hamilton Ontario news @ 6pm they announced the city had there first death of someone who was fully vaccinated and contracted Covid 19 and dies they went further and stated that Canada has 33 people that have died the same way fully vaxxed and contracted Covid and now deceased they went further and implied that majority was over over 80 years  I have a million questions but feel like I’m not getting any real truthful answers as drs are muzzled here by the college of physicians the letter was made public for anyone who wants to read up on it but I think we all know there is no health trust now at all except for the few who went public. My experience today at Jurvinski cancer centre I came in contact with 2 nurses and 2 drs a oncologist and and a virologist everyone had a diff opinion the nurses we recommended shot one tried to push more than other I wonder who we is  virologist told me they isolated the virus she also stated it was licensed and not under emergency use only the oncologist says it’s about risk and benefit but unable to say how mRNA would affect my lymphoma I have read so much asked questions  also touched on stigma of not following the crowd I feel like overload lol I’m no dr but I researched the immune therapy it’s not a vax im sick enough I look up everything and every drug before I take it I don’t like surprises there is no science on this as more was said this is about money and huge amounts of it I’m not a human trial</p>

        <p>Yea this is the huge point that really drives home why it's absurd for low-risk people to get vaccinated.  What is the difference between an asymptomatic <em>vaccinated</em> person and an asymptomatic <em>unvaccinated</em> person?  </p>
<p>From what I've read, I don't personally believe that asymptomatic spread happens to any considerable degree (nearly 0% of cases, if at all), but even if it does, how will a vaccine, which makes everyone asymptomatic, help the cause overall?</p>
<p>I've been saying this for months to friends and family, but I believe that the only ones who should even <em>consider</em> the vaccine are those over 60 years of age + other high-risk individuals, but they should still have a choice in the matter.  I also don't believe we ever should have been locked down, but once those at risk are vaccinated then open everything up.  We are well past these points in Ontario and only entering Stage 2 of reopening on June 30.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know why (or what the “official” BS reason was given) Hydroxychloroquine stopped being used in June 2020? It was working and the only side effect was rapid heart beat whereas vaccines are killing ppl and being pushed as the only way to stop this.</p>

        <p>Probably gonna be down voted to oblivion but here we go. </p>
<p>First in a normal healthy cell, DNA is stored in the nucleus away from the rest of the cell. The cell then uses enzymes to transcribe the DNA into RNA which then moves out of the nucleus into the endoplasmic reticulum. In the ER the RNA is translated into an amino acid chain by ribosomes. The amino acid chain then folds into a specific protein based on the AA chain.</p>
<p>A virus is unable to replicate by itself and needs a host cell. Thus why viruses are not living things. A virus injects it’s genetic material into a cell, mostly RNA which is then translated into new viruses. A viruses uses a host cell to replicate itself.</p>
<p>However every cell in your body with a nucleus has a defense mechanism against viruses called an MHC class 1 defense. The cell basically degraded viruses inside it and then presents particles of the virus on the cell surface using MHC. These particles are called antigens and your body’s immune system, specifically B cells and T cells, can recognize antigens not from the body and start an immune response, mostly creating antibodies. </p>
<p>Your body can take up to 10 days to recognize that there is a viral infection and then produce the appropriate antibodies. With all viral infections there is the possibility that your immune system is affective and is able to fight it off with no symptoms, being asymptotic.</p>
<p>However being asymptotic you CAN STILL SPREAD THE DISEASE. </p>
<p>The vaccine is a mRNA vaccine. The mRNA is injected and absorbed by your cells. Once inside the cells they are translated into a specific Amino acid chain that then folds into a protein. This protein which is HARMLESS has the same antigens as the covid 19 virus. Your body recognizes the antigens on the protein are foreign and creates the necessary antibodies for this antigen. There are symptoms when your body creates antibodies, even for something as harmless as this protein. MOST SYMPTOMS FROM VIRAL DISEASES ARNT CAUSED BY THE VIRUS BUT BY THE BODIES DEFENSE AGAINST IT. For example fever and inflammation are designed to kill foreign microbes, not necessarily caused by an infection.</p>
<p>Once your body has antibodies from the vaccine, if you do contract covid your body will fight it off so quickly that you won’t even realize you have it and will be killed off before you are able to spread it to others</p>
<p>This how you can be asymptotic with the virus and also reduce symptoms after getting vaccine. The vaccine doesn’t stop you from contracting the virus it just makes your body extremely affective at fighting it. </p>
<p>For those less educated individuals, the vaccine isn’t a fence to keep people off your property, it’s a a giant heat seeking target following missle to kill things once they are on your property</p>

        <p>I'll give you an upvote for explaining the main idea here, why having your immune system primed can make the difference between being asymptomatic and spreading, versus not spreading.</p>
<p>But you did get a critical detail very wrong: the spike protein is not harmless, it is a serious toxin itself.  That is why the vaccine is causing serious complications in a bunch of people, including blood clotting, strokes and heart attacks.  This was not expected when they were designing the vaccines, they thought the spike protein was harmless.  They have now proven that to NOT be the case.</p>

        <p>I will also provide an upvote for your effort to explain some science. However, as u/exploderator explains, you are incorrect about the spike protein being harmless. See http://openvaers.com/covid-data for some unknown percentage of adverse effects from the vaccines - currently over 6,000 deaths among the many problems reported so far. Supposedly they did not know the spike protein was harmful and they also designed the vaccine so that the spike protein antigens would stay in the transfected cells, but that failed and the spike protein is circulating throughout the body.</p>
<p>Also - yes it could be POSSIBLE for an asymptomatic carrier to pass the virus along, but not likely, since if you had millions of virus particles sitting in your throat or lungs, you would have some symptoms. And if you only have a small amount, you are not likely to be spewing that out. Every case has a different viral load (the initial exposure) and every person's immune system is different. The WHO told us last year that they had not seen any cases of asymptomatic transmission. Just as the CDC announced last summer that they had not seen any cases of infection from surfaces. It COULD happen, but not likely.</p>
<p>There may be some crazy and misinformed people here. Lots of crazy posts. But I think the majority of COVID skeptics are quite up on the science, generally more so than the majority of people who are not skeptical.</p>

        <p>Believe it or not, many of us actually know basics of biology and have read up on how the mRNA therapy works. You're not impressing anyone.</p>
<p>The condition that you're describing is not "asymptomatic"; it's "presymptomatic". Moreover, the risk of being around someone who has contracted the virus is directly proportional to viral load, and we know that viral load is highest in those who are presenting respiratory symptoms.</p>

They are now deflated meat suits whom sold their souls to the almighty ad revenue paradigm. If it doesnt make someone hige profits (hdx invermectin) you can bet they'll rally against it for the more marketable abd profitable experimental medicine that can be strictly controlled in price and supply by a few shady individual companies.</p>

        <p>Y’all are really unhinged bc she doesn’t even know what she’s talking about. Being asymptomatic when vaccinated doesn’t reduce the spread to other people. The vaccine means that you are much, much less likely to get covid…if you can’t get it, you can’t spread it. If you do get it, the vaccine makes it so that your symptoms are lesser or even none, so that you don’t literally die. What’s not clicking?</p>

<p>Asymptomatic=less or no symptoms, leaning none. </p>
<p>And if you have the vaccine you are less likely to get covid..but he’s the thing, a vast majority of people who did get covid and continue to get covid are asymptomatic sooo?</p>

        <p>Wow, this entire comment section is pathetic. Goes to show you what happens when people don't bother taking highschool biology.</p>
<p>This really isn't that hard to understand. The vaccine teaches your body how to mount an immune response to the COVID-19 virus. You may still get infected though, depending on how effective your immune system is. In such a case, you may end up exhibiting symptoms. Remember, not all people that get infected with the virus end up being asymptomatic. Given that your body already has the lymphocytes capable of producing the necessary antibodies, your symptoms won't be as bad. </p>
<p>None of this information is particularly hard to come by. It's amazing what a baseline amount of education can do for you.</p>

        <p>Ha! In what way was my rudimentary explanation incorrect? Please explain to me how it differs from the definition given by an authoritative source. Say the CDC's:</p>

<p>Get vaccinated -&rt; memory lymphocytes learn how to produce antibodies against the COVID-19 virus's spike protein -&rt; the body can now mount an effective immune response should it encounter the virus in the future.</p>
<p>I know that arguing with you conspiracy theorists is a waste of time, but it just astounds me how little you people know about biology.</p>

        <p>Because the definition of a vaccine is that it CONFERS IMMUNITY. Yes, it prompts an immune response so that when you encou ter the infection <em>you do not get sick</em>.</p>
<p>If it simply lessens symptoms, it is not a vaccine. It's a treatment. And by that definition, Zicam is also a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Is this supposed to be a game of semantics? If you want to insist on using the word CONFER, go right ahead. But that doesn't change the way vaccines work.</p>
<p>To borrow your term, vaccines confer immunity by priming your immune system to respond to a specific viral antigen. Your body ends up developing a pool of memory lymphocytes that will remember this specific antigen as well the structure of the corresponding antibody. (More on lymphocytes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6102609/). However, the effectiveness of your immune response will ultimately depend on how well your immune system works.</p>
<p>A vaccine may not be 100% effective for the entire population. People that are immunocompromised (either due to some underying condition or due to specific prescription drugs) have weaker immune systems. In this scenario, a vaccinated immunocompromised person might end up exhibiting symptoms should they get infected. But that does not mean that vaccine is useless for these people. Since their immune systems have already been primed, their bodies will still be able to mount some sort of response, though maybe not as effective as that of a healthy person. In other words, there is a good chance that the COVID-19 symptoms won't be as severe as they otherwise could have been.</p>
<p>&rt; If it simply lessens symptoms, it is not a vaccine. It's a treatment. And by that definition, Zicam is also a vaccine.</p>
<p>Sorry, but you're just wrong. You really have no idea what you're talking about. If you're a university student, I seriously suggest making use of your campus library and borrowing a biology textbook. If not, your local library should also have some good material.</p>

        <p>If you're really a doctor you'll no doubt be familiar with the RCTs regarding masks and their lack of efficacy compared to just keeping one's distance (primary measure). At least where I live, every turkey wearing a mask thinks they're a super hero who can rub shoulders with everyone else. So yes, the irony is astounding, but not in the way you seem to think.</p>

        <p>Your statement is true, but I don’t understand how you got to that conclusion? 
The individual anti masker will spread more virus without a mask and the people around him with masks arent protected while they protect you if they might have it. 
So they blame him for not wanting to protect them.</p>

        <p>No it did not imply that… as he said its ironic that the person who is not willing to protect others gets sick themselves. 
You know it didnt imply that, I‘m assuming you read it however it fits your believes to then harass that person about being wrong.</p>

        <p>I stopped wearing masks when I realized I am immune after being around countless infected and never having gotten sick myself. I even made sure to get tested after every encounter and they all popped negative.

        <p>Doctor here—Doctors are correct. If you are vaccinated and exposed to corona, you will either 1) not get it or 2) will get it with very minor symptoms. Bc youre coughing less, youre less likely to spread it. </p>
<p>For the “last 12 months when they called you asymptomatic” that was because it was safer to assume everyone was contagious in the early stages of trying to figure out this virus. In a country where half of people believe in the pandemic and the other half think it’s a hoax, it’s smart to have more people afraid of the virus to protect the most amount of people. </p>

        <p>So I was pretty interested in the fact that you were a doctor. Normally when I see a doctor on here I like to check out what they got to say. It is usually pretty enlightening. However in your case I can’t help but question if you are even a doctor. Nothing you talk about is really all that scientific, you are just repeating stuff that I have heard on CNN. Not to mention that you said 5 days ago that you were a medical student. Idk if that means you just recently became a doctor or what but you definitely don’t come off as credible, whether you are a doctor or not.</p>

<p>So, you're just a shill of big pharma.  Got it.</p>
<p>And just because you're a doctor, doesn't make you automatically right.  The Science(tm) doesn't work that way.  </p>
<p>&rt; In a country where half of people believe in the pandemic and the other half think it’s a hoax, </p>
<p>You're wrong.  It's more like half the country blew COVID outta proportion and the other half that it wasn't as big as we're making it out to be.  </p>

<p>That's actually a strawman. Very few people, even on this sub, believe that the pandemic is a hoax. You are conflating skepticism about the pandemic with skepticism about the <em>response</em> to the pandemic.</p>
