    <strong>What was with all the weirdness with the testing in the beginning?</strong>
    <p><p>In Feb of 2020 I joined Reddit because I was worried about the virus and wanted to try to get some inside info that the mainstream media wasn't covering. The first sub I joined was r/coronavirus. I head stories upon stories of people being refused tests. Some of these people had all the symptoms and some of them recently travelled to Wuhan China. This was the time where you had to get special permission from the CDC to get tested. The outbreak in Washington state was only caught because a doctor defied the CDC and ran a test anyway. </p>
<p>What was this all about? Was it about conserving tests, or was it an attempt to spread it as far as possible before the lockdowns? I don't trust the CDC and I sure as hell down trust the US government.</p></p>

        <p>Canada didn't close its borders and the messaging was that covid wasn't dangerous or transmissible.  Wouldn't surprise me at all if there were early efforts to get it going across the world.</p>

        <p>The tests were mostly non existent in February and early March, followed by botched/recalled testing machines. I forget what the exact problem was, but there was a huge problem that delayed the testing. They were mostly reserved for healthcare workers. </p>
<p>As a side note, most of the early nursing home deaths weren't positive cases, they are just presumed</p>

        <p>Ok, so I think you’re right is that they tried to spread it as much as they can before the lockdowns. Back in Feb 2020 we were holding people from Wuhan who were sick at Lackland Air Force base. We didn’t have any covid cases yet. They let someone go to North Star mall who did test positive for covid, then tested negative, then tested positive again. They had to shut down the whole mall for a day and spray everything with disinfectant. It was oddly peculiar that they would let someone who was covid positive go to the mall.</p>

        <p>What a theatrical production! And I bet spraying the mall was done by people in hazmat gear, and blasted through all the tell-lie-visions that night, right?</p>

        <p>That's very interesting. There just seemed to be so much flip flopping with precautions. I remember saying "there's no way this isn't going to spread like wildfire." It's like they were doing everything possible to spread it. And I think they thought masks did prevent the spread at the time, so that's why they said not to wear them. Then they told people to wear cloth masks, which they knew would be a disease spreading petri dish.</p>
<p>Another thing I thought was funny is when they were saying stuff like, "the US has 3 cases, 4 cases, etc". They were acting like they knew precisely how many cases, meanwhile there were people with symptoms all over the place that couldn't get tested. I don't think they wanted to test people. Because if a person tests positive, they are quarantined, and then they can't spread it.</p>
<p>I think the original plan was for it to kill millions. When it didn't, they started helping it along by fudging numbers, making executive orders that caused unnecessary deaths in hospitals &amp; nursing homes, and giving financial incentives to hospitals with covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Tests equal cases which equals fear. They would never deny testing unless they were short on tests, which was the case at the beginning.</p>

        <p>Didn't the first tested patient in the United states test positive on January 21, 2020. How in the hell did they test for it? I've always wondered that. Another thing that made me go.....hmmmmm...</p>
