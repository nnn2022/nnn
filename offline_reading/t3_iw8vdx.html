<p>I'm not saying, I'm just saying. If it was a conservative justice, rumors would be swirling around how their last major public appearance, where they openly flaunted covid precautions, was just over one incubation period before their sudden death. Have we forgotten how gleefully the media reported on Herman Cain's covid death, assigning blame (without evidence) to the fact that he attended a maskless Trump rally?</p>
<p>But, no, we're not allowed to utter such wrongthink and speculation about her liberal majesty...</p>

        <p>Which is why I'm not sad that she's gone. She's a hypocrite who should have retired and isolated years ago.</p>
<p>RBG is the prime example of the flaws of having a supreme court justice get unlimited terms.  Multiple times, RBG couldn't perform her duties due to her medical conditions especially in the latter 2010s, where she'd always have some new form of cancer or heart condition or whatever, that also <em>just</em> conveniently happens when the Supreme Court needs to make some major decisions.  </p>
<p>Even more damning was when this plandemic hit, people all over where RBG worked and lived kept planting signs around saying to wear a mask, social distancing, so they can protect her, then when she attends a wedding maskless, people just forgot about that.  So not only does that hypocrite not only is allowed to live without working from a job that SHE OWNS FOR LIFE, while I'm here scrambling to get what jobs I can get, but she, despite having all this medical shit thrown at her way, but she can also attend a wedding, maskless, while sitting on her high pedestal of a job while real people like <em>literally everyone else</em> who are trying to do our best to stay afloat have to struggle and play in this maze that people in power like her made?</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm not sad that she kicked the bucket.   If she wasn't female or a liberal icon, she'd be ripped for being a privileged asshole who used her political power to do as she pleases at the cost of the country.</p>

        <p>Well the liberals care more about the seat itself more than her death. They are so scared of losing some power, and them saying that we need to wait after the election to pick a new supreme court justice is hypocrisy that we once again see from the left, because if hillary was president, no one would bat an eye at her picking someone before the election, no matter how close it would be. It’s all a political game, and these assholes are trying to pretend it’s not. As for what this will have on covid, they will stop reporting on it for a few weeks and then go back to doing it after it’s all done. It’s the default news for the MSM, although the election will see it being over, with the vaccine coming in October. People will wake up when they hear that a vaccine is not enough, because it’s bullshit and it’s another way to move goalposts even with the end in sight. The election will happen, trump wins again, and then the virus is done. Even if they keep going, Trump will finally be able to intervene because election year will be over and the decisions against the governors won’t lose him popularity. He’ll finally do it.</p>

        <p>That seat is lost.  It might be too contentious to fill before the election (I'm not convinced Mitch will even try) but it is surely getting filled during the lame duck session after the election.  They'll have over two months and literally no incentive not to fill it.</p>

        <p>I guarantee most people in the US didn’t know who she was, it’s just quickly became the new thing to post on social media to make yourself seem like you care. Ask someone a week ago who RBG was and they’d have absolutely no idea. </p>
<p>She was a female Supreme Court justice who supported woman’s rights and equality, at least that’s all I’ve heard on the news. The extreme mourning and sadness over her death definitely seems like a media narrative for some reason, just like BLM</p>

<p>She had a pretty important career and has been a patron saint of lefty feminism in this country for decades. If a person can only name one Supreme Court justice, it's probably her. </p>

        <p>No, it's because of what comes after. Denocrats and the left in general, especially those who care about women's reproductive rights, have been terrified for years that she would die while Republicans had control of the presidency and Senate, because then a Republican president would replace her with a conservative judge, a Republican Senate would confirm him/her, and the Supreme Court would lean right for decades to come. Her death is an important news story for that reason, regardless of whether you personally liked her or knew much about her.</p>

<p>Even as someone who believes it’s not appropriate to delay the appointment of a new judge, AND someone who doesn’t want Biden to win the election, this news is still upsetting to me, as a woman who cares about reproductive rights (in the same breath as I care about other rights involving bodily autonomy). </p>

        <p>She sort of unironically was a big deal.  Long legacy of pioneering women's rights in the US.  Probably the only Supreme Court justice who is a true household name.  Lots of women have been looking up to her as a role model/hero for years.</p>
<p>She was also 87 damn years old and had been battling cancer, so I'm not really sure why people are so shocked by her death, or why they're acting like it's the worst possible think in the world.  "wHaT iS 2o20 gOiNg To ThRoW aT uS nExT?1??!?//?"  If you view an 87-year-old cancer patient passing away as a tragedy on the same magnitude as raging wildfires or a pandemic disease, (or the social and economic collapse that followed), your perspective is seriously out of wack and your hero worship is unhealthy.</p>

        <p>Of your examples, Trump is the most obviously doing it for the attention and spotlight.  And despite what CNN wants you to think he does have a lot of energy for his age, I doubt he has any desire to retire.  I'm sure once he's out of office he'll use his presidency as the premise for some sort of TV show, or maybe he'll write a book.</p>
<p>Fauci is certainly enjoying the limelight now, but he wasn't much of a public figure before 6 months ago.  He probably just genuinely enjoys the work (and the paycheck).  And again, he is surprisingly energetic and alert for his age.</p>
<p>The one I don't get is Biden.  He looks like shit, he sounds like shit, he can't put together a complete sentence...once upon a time maybe he was having cute little oratory gaffes, but these days he literally doesn't even know where the fuck he is half the time and his "gaffes" have evolved into the incoherent ramblings of a mental degenerate.  Propping him up for a presidential run is straight-up elder abuse.  If anyone should be allowed to enjoy retirement in peace, it's him - he should have left the White House in 2017 and never looked back, and just hoped that he still had enough mental facilities left for a round of golf with his buddies every weekend.</p>
<p>But on the whole, you're absolutely right.  Older generations are so confused about why younger people are seemingly incapable of finding decent jobs or experiencing more rapid career advancement, did it ever occur to them that maybe that's because there's an artificial ceiling there created by all the octogenarians who are clinging onto all the good jobs and inexplicably still working a full generation past standard retirement age?</p>
