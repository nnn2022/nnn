    <strong>Remember when?</strong>
    <p><p>Remember when they over amplified the PCR test over 35 cycles, and created a casedemic, and used it to justify a lockdown or how they started counting vaxxed/unvaxxed cases differently, thereby making it seem the vaxxed were less likely to catch a case of sniffles?</p>
<p>I member. </p>
<p>Member when Fraudci said masks don't work, and then wear four, all while his emails showed he knew they were ineffective, and his paper about the Spanish flu mask wearing caused many cases of bacterial pneumonia?</p>
<p>I member.. </p>
<p>Memeber when, you could die of a skydiving accident, and they called it covid death? </p>
<p>I member...</p>
<p>Member when the CDC quietly changed its numbers of the actually death total to being only 5% of what they were originally claiming? </p>
<p>I member....</p>
<p>Member when they tricked everyone into thinking you could be sick, even though you aren't, and you could spread the coof to my gam gam, and kill her too soon, but then fraudci said that asymptomatic illness has never been the driver of an outbreak? </p>
<p>Yeah.... I member. </p>
<p>Member when they politicized science and censored and counter narrative? </p>
<p>I member.... </p>
<p>Member when they said a Texas man died, and with his last dying breath, he  wheezed out, ''Please, take this vax, for gamgam'', and we seemed to forget all the times they lied before this? </p>
<p>I don't believe them. They probably killed him with their protocols from fraudci, using remdesivir and other garbage to shut down his kidneys, causing him to drown, and threw him on a vent, and blew out his lungs. </p>
<p>But DeLTa VaRiAnT is soo scary!!!! oooooohh. Im not scared, nor should you be. </p>
<p>They lied time and time again, and you think they aren't full of it here, bless your heart sweet summer child. Lmao. </p>
<p>They are full of shit. Fuck them. I won't forget this. He was right, this gene therapy filled with graphene is poison.</p></p>
