    <strong>Why did western countries abandon their pre-2020 pandemic guidelines?</strong>
    <p><p>Before 2020, no western country planned for lockdowns, mask mandates, or border closures in the event of a pandemic, not even close. In fact, if you read the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/community_mitigation-sm.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0DiNfCTdB5alhJaOq3VtxhfymddjvDBCjJG7QPM55-nZ3YHNbAFYT1wio">CDC's 2007 planning document,</a> it only says to consider social distancing and school closures for no more than 4 weeks. It merely recommends voluntary isolation of the sick, and it doesn't even mention closing businesses.</p>
<p>The UK's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf">2011 planning document is similar.</a> Overall, it states:</p>
<p>&rt; During a pandemic, the Government will encourage those who are well to carry on with their normal daily lives for as long and as far as that is possible, whilst taking basic precautions to protect themselves from infection and lessen the risk of spreading influenza to others (see Chapter 4). The UK Government does not plan to close borders, stop mass gatherings or impose controls on public transport during any pandemic. </p>
<p>And by basic precautions they mention things like staying home if sick and washing your hands. As for masks, they say there's no good evidence for their usage in the general public. And again, they make no mention of closing businesses. They do mention closing schools, but only temporarily, and explicitly say they won't close large events, because there's no evidence that would have any effect. In fact, they go on to say they're important for keeping a sense of normalcy and morale, and that the social and economic costs of closing them might be too high.</p>
<p>Almost no restrictions, preserving normalcy, concern for social and economic harms, this all seems very sensible to me. So why have governments ignored these long established, evidence based plans and gone the complete opposite route?</p></p>

        <p>The simplest answer is that these people are idiots and don't have a clue what they are doing. </p>
<p>They have gone against every major public policy that they've presented and done a 180 on everything. </p>
<p>They have no exit strategy either.</p>
<p>Throw a dart at a board and you'd be better off in contrast.</p>

        <p>Because we got caught up in the largest wave of mass hysteria in human history. In 60 years it'll be a case study in high school history and social studies classes. I can just imagine it.</p>
