        <p>Paul-Ehrlich-Institut in germany release a report. 351 as of 12th or march. outdated.<br>
they only release the data every 4 weeks now. used to be weekly or biweekly.</p>
<p>its more like 400+ at this point. EASILY.</p>
<p>its not killing more people than COVID, just a different demographic.<br>
I would not take the vaccine if I was below the age of 60, personally.<br>
unless I had health problems. then maybe.</p>
<p>COVID kills the old and sick, mainly<br>
Vaccine may kill healthy and young aswell</p>

        <p>Nope, the CDC counts a COVID death when there is:</p>
<p>&rt; A death certificate that lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as an underlying cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death.</p>
<p>https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/08/05/</p>
<p>Some of the early numbers counted a COVID death as someone who died when they had COVID, but that changed nearly a year ago and the numbers have been <a href="https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2020/05/16/colorado-changes-how-coronavirus-deaths-state-counted/5198485002/">adjusted</a> since.

        <p>Not op, but my thoughts:</p>
<p>The distinction is preventability. Those 500k are preventable if society wears masks and social distances (two things that have very low cost). The other deaths are due to things that are not nearly so easily preventable. What's your proposal to stop cancer and heart disease? If you care about people dying, what are you doing to help? </p>
<p>Second, issues are not mutually exclusive. I can care about the 500k dead due to covid and about the 2.5 million dead due to other reasons. I can work to help both. Our society can work to help both.</p>
<p>Third, those 500k are excess deaths (they are 500k more dead than the average number of American deaths per year). If the average number of Americans die in a year, there's not much cause for concern. Sure, you can work to reduce that average and it's a noble cause. But if 500k extra die, from something preventable, and you didn't do everything in your power to prevent it? I don't know how you can justify that morally.</p>

        <p>&rt;The distinction is preventability. Those 500k are preventable if society wears masks and social distances</p>
<p>What makes you say that? There is no evidence of this in the US, as there is no statistical difference between strict lockdown, loose lockdown, and no lockdown states. </p>
<p>&rt;(two things that have very low cost)</p>
<p>Masks might have low cost, although there is still some cost for no discernable benefit. Social distancing depends on what you mean. If you mean suggesting staying apart, it wouldn't likely help as people wouldn't listen. If you mean forcing isolation, it has quite a destructive cost</p>
<p>&rt; The other deaths are due to things that are not nearly so easily preventable. What's your proposal to stop cancer and heart disease?</p>
<p>Diet, exercise, and don't smoke. Of course, I would never force those things on people. You are allowed to live your life as you will, both wrt heart disease/cancer and wrt COVID.</p>
<p>&rt; If you care about people dying, what are you doing to help?</p>
<p>I care about people dying because I care about individuals. However, I also care about individuals enough to let them have the freedom to make their own choices, even self-destructive ones</p>
<p>&rt; Second, issues are not mutually exclusive. I can care about the 500k dead due to covid and about the 2.5 million dead due to other reasons. I can work to help both. Our society can work to help both.</p>
<p>It can, largely by encouraging diet and exercise and not promoting obesity as an acceptable or even good lifestyle choice. Maybe by not applauding a corporation giving out a free donut a day for each Rona vaccine. Hell, these kinds of societal encouragements would also help with COVID deaths, as obesity is a significant risk factor.</p>
<p>&rt; Third, those 500k are excess deaths (they are 500k more dead than the average number of American deaths per year). If the average number of Americans die in a year, there's not much cause for concern. </p>
<p>Why not? Why don't you care about deaths?</p>
<p>&rt;  But if 500k extra die, from something preventable, and you didn't do everything in your power to prevent it?</p>
<p>This applies to obesity and smoking as well, and car accidents. These are all preventable, but you don't care because they are all part of the plan.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't know how you can justify that morally.</p>
<p>Because 'everything in my power', in this case, includes imprisoning people in their homes indefinitely and destroying the basic human rights of their communities. I care about people too much to turn them into robots that must obey my every whim just because it is 'for their own good'.</p>

        <p>Hi! Thank you for taking the time to respond, I think discussions like this are really important for civic growth. </p>
<p>Responding to your first point, here's an article published in a medical journal that I like to use: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40258-020-00596-3 . It comes to the conclusion that the lockdowns were helpful. </p>
<p>To me, a very important distinction between diet, excercise, lack of smoking etc, is that they are all things that only affect yourself. Your decisions surrounding Covid have the potential to affect people who did not consent. I fully agree that an individual has the freedom to make choices destructive to themselves. But they have no such freedom to make a choice that is destructive to others. </p>
<p>You make an assumption that I don't care about obesity, diet, and excercise. I, in fact, am actually a big advocate for health. I try to live as healthy a life as I can. I plan on being a teacher (currently in college), and I think teaching children about the science of nutrition and how to have a healthy relationship with food an exercise is exceedingly important. I say this as proof that I really do care about lowering the average number of Americans who die this year, and not just the ones who died from Covid. </p>
<p>I agree with you that some aspects of the lockdown were too strict. I also agree that the government should never force people to stay indoors. However, I maintain that wearing a mask and staying 6ft apart from people, avoiding parties and gatherings etc, are all harmless ways to drastically reduce the odds of catching Covid or, more importantly, giving it to someone else.</p>

        <p>You say that diet and exercise only affect yourself, and that is true. However, I am talking about <strong>government-mandated</strong> diet and exercise, which effect everyone under that government mandate. You might say that that is too extreme, and I would agree, although I would make the case that it is less extreme than indefinite lockdowns.</p>
<p>Remember, you said "But if 500k extra die, from something preventable, and you didn't do everything in your power to prevent it? I don't know how you can justify that morally." Presumably, everything in my power includes using the government to force people to eat right and exercise. Again, all of that might sound extreme and authoritarian, but, again, nowhere near as extreme as the never-ending lockdowns we have been forced to endure since the minute that this panic set in. </p>
<p>I don't actually think that you do not care about diet and exercise; I am merely using your own standard against you. You say that I cannot morally avoid doing 'everything in my power' to stop COVID, up to and including extreme authoritarianism. By your standard, you actually don't care about obesity, heart disease, cancer, etc. because you won't resort to rampant authoritarianism to stop it. I am not basing this on my beliefs, but on the beliefs that you imply with your lockdown-support.</p>
<p>I, of course, applaud you for not wanting to resort to government-mandated obesity prevention. However, I still want to know why the same aversion to force that keeps you from going there will not stop you from supporting lockdowns over a disease that is way, way, way less deadly over the long-term than poor cardiovascular health.</p>

        <p>Same reason I comfortably allow the government to use force to stop me from murder, or to stop me from shouting fire in a crowded theater. I am not allowed to harm others with my actions unless they consent, and the government is allowed to stop me from doing so. </p>
<p>Covid actually has tremendous long term health effects, especially cardiovascular health. I'm away from my laptop rn but when I get back I'll edit this comment to include some sources.</p>

        <p>Conflating murder or even shouting fire in a crowded theater with being a completely healthy person who lives their life normally is just not remotely reasonable. </p>
<p>First off, you are comparing outlawing an action to outlawing an action with removing rights based on possible future actions. The more appropriate comparison to lockdowns would be preventing someone from buying a hammer or going to a theater, just because they might use the hammer to kill someone or they might shout fire when they got to the theater.</p>
<p>Secondly, both murder and shouting fire are intentional actions. A totally healthy person unknowingly spreading COVID is not international, nor even particularly negligent unless you are actively experiencing symptoms.</p>
<p>Third, there absolutely is consent in spreading COVID that does not exist with the others. When you enter a room with another person, you are implicitly consenting to the idea that that person might have a disease. If Person A and Person B meet for a beer, both of them are mutually accepting the risks that come with interpersonal interaction.</p>

        <p>Okay, you're right to say that my examples were exaggerated. But covid is equally different from a hammer, because it spreads exponentially. One hammer  murderer does not cause 12 others. One covid case though? I think the government made a reasonable decision. They saw a way to reduce the spread and they took it. </p>
<p>Second, the government already removes rights based on possible future actions all the time. Take driving a car. Like covid, it is dangerous unless you follow certain precautions. This is why we have speed limits and drivers ed. The system works if everyone follows the precautions. Or, take for instance becoming a teacher. An untrained teacher is a detrement to a classroom and harms the children. Thats why the government doesn't allow you to teach unless you're certified. The same applies to covid. One person not obeying safety guidelines is a detriment to society. That's why the government doesn't allow you to participate until you've fulfilled those requirements. </p>
<p>No intention != blameless. Criminal negligence is a crime. I can drive drunk without the intention to kill, but I still get imprisoned when I kill someone. </p>
<p>In an isolated group of people who have all agreed to a certain level of risk, its fine if you don't follow guidelines. But if you meet someone with whom you have not discussed their level of risk, that conversation takes place under the assumption that you're being safe, not that you're being reckless. No person lives in such total isolation that their actions would not affect strangers. Take riding in the subway. Everyone there who wears a mask is consenting to a specific -- and low -- level of risk. If you walk in without wearing a mask, you're in violation of that implicit societal agreement.</p>
<p>Also, and this is the one I never understand, why not help others? If I was told lockouts had a 10% effective rate, or if masks only had a 10% effective rate, I would still do it. I've worn a mask for a year without any discomfort, and I plan to continue wearing it now that I'm vaccinated. It doesn't harm me, and if there's the slightest chance it helps others, I'll do it.</p>

        <p>Driving laws are only applicable on public property. If the government wanted to enforce masks and social distancing on their property, that is fine. Roads, City Halls, and the DMV are one thing. Private stores and homes are another. You are totally free to drive drunk on your own private property AFAIK. </p>
<p>It is not negligent to go outside if you do not have any reason to believe that you are sick, not in a criminal sense nor in a general sense. Human interaction is necessary, real human interaction, and seeking that out when you are healthy is not in any way immoral.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, and this is the one I never understand, why not help others? If I was told lockouts had a 10% effective rate, or if masks only had a 10% effective rate, I would still do it.

<p>Because this entire paragraph implies a degree of choice. The minute the government locked us down, I believe that the best thing for humanity was ignoring them. Long term, the precedent that the government can just shout 'Emergency!' and lock us in our homes indefinitely</p>
<p>Take tithing. I am a religious person, so I give 10% of my income to charity. However, the minute that the government decided that they were going to make tithing a legal requirement, I would stop paying it. The greater good, imo, would be served in ignoring authoritarian orders on that level, even if the orders are to do things that would otherwise be moral.</p>
