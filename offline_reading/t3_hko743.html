    <strong>My gym is now requiring masks to be worn at all times</strong>
    <p><p>I’m cancelling my membership Monday and investing in some home weights. I have always loved going to the gym but I will not wear a mask while working out.</p></p>

        <p>I’m afraid my gym (in Georgia) is about to start doing the same. It’s been open since late May and had never required masks or even had any signage regarding masks. Then this morning, I walked in and there’s a big sign by the check-in counter that says “For your safety and the safety of other patrons, we encourage you to wear a mask at all times.” Just one more step until they start requiring them</p>

        <p>Does the government require them to require masks? If so, consider working out without a mask and waiting for them to enforce it. If they do, maybe you can get away with the chin-strap mask. Of course, I understand if you object in principle to putting a muzzle on your face in any form.</p>
<p>But if they're requiring masks of their own volition, then yeah, they can go to hell.</p>

        <p>That sucks but I have to say I'd take anything right now. I've been trying to work out in the park but it's shit let's be honest.</p>
<p>Gyms have been closed here since March. Pubs open tomorrow but no word about gyms, it's fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p>I know about how "mask enforcement" actually turns out because I "have to" wear them at work and on the underground every day. The moment people sit down or talk to each other the masks come down or off. There really is no way to make people wear them at all times. I put one on when anyone asks (mostly) and then it comes straight off again.</p>
<p>I hate going along with this shit more than anyone but if I can half-heartedly-not-even really-attempt to wear my mask properly and actually get to stay healthy in the same way I used to then I would jump at the chance in a flash.</p>
<p>I feel you though.</p>

        <p>I told my mom today that there will never be 100% compliance. Governors and health officials (I’m in the US) can make orders and harp on it until they’re blue in the face, but people will always wear chin straps or ignore the order. My state’s language also says if you see an individual not wearing a mask, don’t take matters into your own hands with the person or try to enforce it on them.</p>

        <p>Nice to hear that's the message being pushed. </p>
<p>Not one member of public has confronted me about my (lack of) mask so far, just TFL workers and a policeman for the first time today. I asked him if they are planning on handing out fines and he said no. I also pointed out his colleague on the opposite platform wasn't wearing their mask which made him turn a nice shade of red. I didn't push it though. I'm tired of fighting with people to be honest. They're going to win.</p>

        <p>They won't win. The fact you pointed it out was enough. You defeated the person who confronted you today by not getting a fine. They chose to not try and enforce it. Once the police start to wane it's game over. The more challenges they get the more they'll hopefully realise that they are on the wrong side of history.</p>

        <p>This shit happens everyday to me. I didn't defeat anyone. I gave up and put my mask on (until I sat down). I was asking in general if they are planning on fines in the future. </p>
<p>I also started a fight on the tube this mornng because I accused someone of taking a picture of me which I really shouldn't have done but I'm losing it a little here. I'm normally good at keeping calm but I guess I gave us a bad name today. IDGAF if someone takes a pic of me normally. </p>
<p>Wednesday was a woman screaming at me for being too close in a sandwich shop. </p>

        <p>No, don't beat yourself up. You're not giving anyone a bad name. They have taken control, destroyed people's lives, turned society into a dystopian hellhole, and also get to ridicule, bully, shame, and dehumanize us, all while bragging about it and jerking off to how righteous they are...but we can't fight back? Don't fall for that "turn the other cheek" crap. You will never win freedom against fascist oppressors by being timid, walking on eggshells, and being afraid of what they think of you.</p>

        <p>No you aren't over the top at all...you are 100% right about all this. I had a bad feeling right from the beginning in March, even though people kept saying surely it will be over soon. Now here we are four damn months later, and the dystopian nightmare has only intensified. An uncovered human face is now taboo and dangerous and the mindless masses believe in more absurd bullshit than ever...all while cheering on the dystopia while gleefully doing their fascist duties by ridiculing, blaming and shaming those who dare question the narrative. So don't let anyone make you doubt what you know to be true. There is an immense amount of gaslighting going on. I just went to the conspiracy sub, and someone was getting downvoted and getting comments about how he's wrong and the repliers were saying they actually believe covid is as dangerous as the media says it is. It's so unbelievable. There is literally tons of scientific data out there now that shows the cold hard truth, that covid is nothing but a mild respiratory virus with an IFR and danger that is similar to the common flu, and that the response to it has been not only way out of proportion, but downright insane. They can ignore, dismiss, and silence all they want, it doesn't change the truth. The media has lied, misinformed, distorted, and manipulated every step of the way. Unbelievable that on a conspiracy sub where people claim to be freethinkers who are distrustful of government and mainstream media, they have bought into the covid bullshit. It's a psy op on a whole other level and it needs to end.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I can't wait to meet someone like us in real life. Do you have anyone? My parents let me say what I want and don't judge me but they're just old hippies who think that everything will be alright if you just meditate a lot. There's truth in that but I think some things take a good fight too. </p>
<p>I'm seeing lot's of "we're winning" positive posts from our side and I'm totally not convinced. Feels fishy too. I will fight this for the rest of my life if I have to. Mask nazism is ramping up and they are locking down random cities here now. </p>
<p>What is the point in striving for a safe society if our children still grow up in fear? I'd rather bring my children up in Cambodia than have them be faceless disease spreaders. I'm one bad day from preaching in my local town square I swear to god I don't give a fuck what any of these morons think of me anymore, that's the one good thing to come out of this. I'm finally free to be however I want. Funny what effect losing respect for every human around you has.</p>

        <p>The only person I really have long discussions about this in real life is my brother. He is a great critical thinker, and is on the same page. In addition, he's in the medical field, so he really knows the science (I wish he would post on here more, but he says he's trying to stay offline these days). He is the one who was showing me all those scientific papers/studies back in April. When I saw the data, I thought this would surely be over by May. The media and politicians would have to admit they made a horrendous mistake...but the complete opposite happened.</p>
<p>The more real science and data came out, the more it was ignored, then ridiculed, then dismissed, then silenced. The more the media brought out their quacks to say ridiculous things, scream about science and data, while never actually showing anything resembling science and data. The more Fauci told absurd lies and became the high priest of the covid religion. That's when I realized that this was not really about a virus...something nefarious was going on. It is undeniable. The media, politicians, and anointed "experts" are running the show and the virtue signaling libs and general public are the flocknof faithful followers whose lives have become 100% devoted to this cult. </p>
<p>This is why it's enraging when they all regurgitate the word "science" and call us "science deniers"...2020 is the year that science was murdered, mutilated, and thrown into a fire. Science is now nothing more than a buzzword they spew for their cult's agenda. If anyone listened to the science, Dr. Ioannidis would be up there instead of Fauci, there would have never been a lockdown, and this whole dystopian nightmare would have never materialized.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how absolutely wack this whole fiasco has been right from the start, I was having a conversation with my brother and he explained to me the whole ventilator craze back in February/March/April. He said it was so unbelievable and how he never thought he would see anything like that in the 21st century...how all of a sudden doctors and medical professionals everywhere threw decades worth of knowledge down the toilet, and started accepting absurd quackery. Patients that were talking being put on ventilators just because they had some congestion or shortness of breath. When the most basic medical knowledge says that ventilators are only for those who have no respiratory function...the amount of medical malpractice that has taken place is astounding. And look what happened to the few doctors that spoke out against it...they were fired, shamed, silenced, by the media, the public, and their fellow medical professionals. Literal Orwellian/Twilight Zone type of stuff. Absolute lunacy.</p>
<p>This is why I wish more people would pay attention to how insane this whole thing is and ask what is really going on? Who has the most to gain from this. It's definitely deeply political. Look at the smug and fake wokeness...in March/April it was #stayhomesavelives now it's the mask bullshit. They feel like they're having their WW2, their "resistance". Social media is a cesspool of spreading lies, stupidity, and mindless groupthink. I had already been alienated by and ostracized by liberal circles years before this. And I don't miss any of it. The ignorance, superficiality and artificiality of those people is sickening and I will never associate with any of them again. Look at the example I gave in one of my other comments...the exact same people who defended nasty idiots who were licking ice cream and putting it back in grocery store freezers are the ones who are now ridiculing and bullying us about masks and how "caring and selfless" they are for wearing them, and we're the "ignorant, selfish, stupid irresponsible murderers". It's enraging and disgusting beyond words. This was never about "safety" or "compassion" or "science" or any other empty meaningless buzzword they spew.</p>

        <p>Thank you I appreciate the sentiment but I literally started a ruckus on the tube and mouthed off to an officer today so I don't have much problem with turn the other cheek crap. </p>
<p>I actually need to make sure I calm myself and direct my frustration at the right people, calmly. Like the policeman today, I had him on the back foot and totally could have capitalised, pointing at other people's chin straps and saying that I can't breathe properly in one (or something) but after the incident in the morning, one publicfreakout a day is enough for me. I'm getting pretty consistent.</p>

        <p>My area has had a 100% mask mandate since March, and you can't go anywhere without one, except outside +6 feet from other people. However, even in what has to be the literal doomer capital of the country, where we can be fined for not wearing one and the social pressure is massive, I would say about 1/8 people or so wear theirs under their nose.  </p>
<p>I don't think I could wear one in a gym. And I don't like not seeing human faces. It makes ME feel more indifferent towards others (the same feeling I have on Zoom), which tells me I am dehumanizing other people and thus they are also dehumanizing me. So far, I wear a really, really lightweight mask made at home first out of the thinnest possible cotton and now out of two-ply lace. No one has said a damned thing about that half of my mask is obviously see-through because that would be too complicated since no one ever said what the mask had to be made of. I recommend super flyweight, non-stretchy cotton, or a medical mask with the interior layers removed if you have no other options.   </p>
<p>I'm tempted to really, seriously screw with people all the time by wearing a giant lace veil that goes down to my waist, no eye slits. I mean, why not? It would be fun to watch people look uncomfortable by their embrace of discomfort, no?</p>

<p>Plenty of places don't have a choice but to put these rules in place. I don't even know why I'm saying this. I hate this enforcement of masks, I think I'm just jealous that you actually get to go to the gym.</p>

        <p>I think that’s how the powers that be are manipulating us into complying, by making us feel we’re lucky to have the gym at all. We’re lucky they “let” us go out in public, enter a grocery store, be allowed to work, etc.</p>
<p>I’m forced to wear a mask at work and my city has passed a mask ordinance. I understand the gym is probably just doing this because they have to, but to the extent that I have a choice in how I spend my money, I am going to choose not to support them at this time. I hate working out at home, but I hate the idea of being forced to sweat into a mask even more.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you. I am just really desperate to get back to the gym. That shit keeps me sane. </p>
<p>I'm tempted to say I would do the same as you. I will definitely not ever be wearing a mask to do squats but I will definitely go and see what I can get away with because I'm that desperate. Sad huh? If they literally try to remove me or put the mask on then I will 100% leave.</p>
<p>At this point I'm just imagining shit because as far as I'm aware there isn't hardly even talk of opening gyms. Pubs open tomorrow. </p>

        <p>I understand where you’re coming from. I’ve put the mask on because it grants me access to things I want to have access to, because I’m tired of sitting at home. I hate to say that it’s been easier to just roll over and comply than stand my ground, which is the crux of the whole situation.</p>
<p>I ordered some equipment online. It will take over a week to get here, so in the meantime I’ll probably go on Monday and see how it plays out. If it’s just something they’re saying in order to cover their bases and are not enforcing it, I will consider not cancelling.</p>

        <p>Is this a chain gym?(Planet fitness, LA fitness, Golds etc)? I would email corporate and complain and go ape shit. I used to work at and manage a gym for a short while, gym employees are not supposed to interact with people working out at all for any reason. They aren't your parents. The gyms are OBSESSED with their monthly sign ups and they need people in the gym to keep it open. 100% call corporate and say you and a bunch of people you know are canceling people the gym manager confronted you about masks when the state says they optional. Guarantee he will be gone within a week.</p>

        <p>Yep, LA Fitness was doing this even a few weeks ago before the most recent order.  I immediately canceled my membership and don't plan on going back until this shit is no longer required.</p>
<p>I actually saw an article yesterday saying that it was perfectly safe to work out in a mask and it just requires "getting used to it".  I can't believe how hard they are pushing this mask issue.  It's getting insane.  Someone is going to get injured working out this way.</p>

I have eczema on my hands and I simply cannot use alcohol based anything without making it 100 times worse (I'm talking cracking skin with open wounds) - so yeah, no thanks.

        <p>I went for a brisk walk up and down my street earlier this week and had to rip my mask off about ten minutes in because I could barely breathe. And every time I tried to gasp in air my mask came into my mouth, which I think kind of defeated the purpose. My very mask-enthusiastic friend I was with even said fuck it and took hers off as well, which really said something about how difficult it is. So then how the FUCK are they expecting people to work out with them on without struggling to breathe? </p>
<p>I work at a gym and we don’t require masks while working out, but I worry that that’s next. And don’t get me wrong, I’m fine with masks as a TEMPORARY measure against spread, but there’s definitely a time and place for masks. At a store, fine, at a bar, fine, anywhere indoors where it’s crowded, fine. But a gym is unreasonable. I hope they have people trained in first aid on hand to help, because as someone who’s been trained for similar situations (someone not being able to breathe and still trying to work out), they’re looking at some real problems.</p>

        <p>I have to wear a mask to ice skate now. I love skating so I guess I’m going to have to suck it up and deal with it, and the temperature check before going in. I hope these rules change when the rink reopens to the public because right now it’s private ice and the renter can set the rules. (The rink management originally said masks were optional.) </p>
<p>A local YMCA doesn’t require masks for group fitness or when on a cardio machine or swimming, but people lifting weights have to wear them. I have no idea why.</p>

        <p>I called my gym today which just reopened to ask about their policies (CA). They do require masks at all times indoors even while working out. They have a pool outdoors, no mask required even while sitting by the pool. I told them that we would stay members for the next couple months so my son can swim, but if the mask policy stays in place after that we will quit- I'm not working out with a mask.</p>

        <p>I do too. Whenever NJ opens gyms I’m sticking to home workouts or outside until it’s over because Murphy will surely require masks at all times (although a bright spot is that he admitted he’s slow on gyms bc he knows working out with a mask is difficult at best-probably bc he’s actually in good shape and knows firsthand).</p>

<p>I have trouble breathing with a mask on - I cannot envisage working out masked. I hope such nonsense does not occur in the UK when our gyms open.</p>
<p>Such lunacy worries me - I do not want a masked future and will be fighting against it if the same insanity permeates the UK.</p>

        <p>Scotlands not far behind. They're making us wear them in shops and enclosed spaces from next week (which honestly, I'm not happy about but I kindaaa get) wouldn't be surprised if they started requiring them everywhere.</p>
<p>The most we can do is keep taking them off. Wear it to get past the 'bouncers' take it off again. I'm making one out of sheer material so people can still see my face and I can breathe. It would still catch 'droplets' which is what they seem to be concerned about.</p>

        <p>Yes, also longterm phenotypic shifts as our bodies attempt to compensate for the changes in pressure and air.  During my time learning about what caused my myopia I learned that the stimulus from over-correction (simplifying this but pretty much what happens when you get glasses for what is usually just a simple muscle eye spasm) causes the eye to lengthen over time slowly and increases myopia.  Reversing it is reversing the stimulus the other way.  I can only imagine what could happen to our lungs/lung tissue and cardiovascular systems.</p>

        <p>I owned and operated a local gym for 5 years (4 years, 11 months to the day), and I voluntarily closed and refused to resign my lease.</p>
<p>I'm not playing this game I cashed the fuck out now, got a fat insurance reimbursement, and I'm transitioning to online coaching only. Fuck that red tape bullshit; owners will be working three times as hard for one third the revenue. See ya!</p>

        <p>I would've made sure if they were actually enforcing it first. I'd go without a mask and if they ask you to wear one, leave. Some places aren't and just have to put the signs up to avoid public criticism/fines.</p>

        <p>Another reply mentioned this but I just to reiterate a warning before you make that decision - home gym equipment is quite hard to come by right now. Things are better than 2 months ago, but many manufacturers are sold out of a lot of their equipment for the next month or more, and some people have been reporting lead times of that long or longer even for equipment that's in stock (with certain manufacturers, anyway).</p>
<p>It also probably depends on what kind of equipment you want, but it could take several weeks to get any DBs, KBs, a bar or plates. Benches have also been in pretty short supply, but looking positive in the near future. You need to be on top of things too in order to snatch up stuff when it does become available - I've found the r/homegym weekly stock thread very useful.</p>
<p>All that said, I was lucky enough to buy some equipment right when this all started, just days before everyone sold out of everything, and I can say that I've done a complete 180 from being convinced I need to go to an actual gym. I used to love the atmosphere there, being around others phyched to get better and feeding off that, and enjoying all the fancy equipment they have there, like stuff that most people would never buy. I couldn't have been more wrong - working out at home, never waiting on equipment, only needing exactly what you use, not having to drive or park anywhere, enjoying your own equipment - I'm totally converted and can't believe I never considered it sooner.</p>

        <p>This is insane. My gym everybody is already shaking hands again.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a 1.5 meter drink with my student association.</p>
<p>I think I hugged 97% of the room. People were so happy to finally touch and hug each other again.</p>
<p>Nobody sane wants the new normal.</p>
