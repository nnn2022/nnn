        <p>Look, I'm on your side about all this stuff. Please don't mistake me for one of the annoying people that come in here to start problems. Check my comment &amp; post history if you need to -- <em>we're on the same team.</em></p>
<p>But Trump? He wasn't on our team when he was in office and he isn't now.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice he never came out directly and called things out for what they are?</p>
<p>Did you ever notice he didn't fire Fauci?</p>
<p>Were you aware of this:</p>
<p>2019 Sep 19</p>
<p>Trump Executive Order 13887, "modernizing vaccines" &amp; Influenza Task Force [DOD, DOJ, DOA, DHS, USFDA, CDC, NIH, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)] -- we would later know this as the "Covid-19 Task Force"</p>
<p>This executive order paved the way for accelerated production of these experimental vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health</a></p>
<p>That was the executive order that paved the way for what we are going through now with this vaccine coercion.  And you've seen the military going door to door trying to coerce people into taking the vaccines? Trump set us up for that, too, saying over and over there would be a military rollout.</p>
<p>He also was responsible for Operation Warp Speed.</p>
<p>He's not your friend, and he doesn't represent you or me or any working people any more than Biden does.</p>
<p>It's time to face the fact Trump voters got tricked. Just like Obama and Biden voters did.</p>
<p>These people don't represent us. They're all on the same team, and it's not our team. Please see that, and stop the weird worship of this man.</p>
<p>I don't know how to say it any clearer, but... <em>He doesn't give a shit about you</em>, and he played an active role in setting up what we are going through now.</p>
<p>Trump? Obama? Biden? They're all the same. They represent the same corporations and concentrated wealth. They are just salesmen to trick the American people into this corporate global agenda.</p>
<p><strong>I love this subreddit, but until you guys realize that BOTH the Democratic &amp; Republican parties actually work against us --- there will never be any real change.</strong></p>
