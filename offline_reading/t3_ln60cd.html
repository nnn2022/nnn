    <strong>A Link a Day: Day 14, Where Lockdowns Have Failed</strong>
    <p><p>80% upvoted.  </p>
<p>Remember when I said I wanted the lockdowns to be a temporary fad before we streamlined the process of aiding the sick and preventing infection of the elderly? Here’s exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/what-is-the-alternative-to-lockdowns-a-symposium/">https://www.aier.org/article/what-is-the-alternative-to-lockdowns-a-symposium/</a></p>
<p>About the source: The American Institute for Economic Research, run by Edward Peter Stringham, delivers his ideas on not only economics, but also social structure. He has written two books and contributed to 70 other works pertaining to economics. This article includes the words of himself and a league of fellow writers, who published work on social studies, history, ethics, and of course, the development of the economy. All of them have a cite page linked directly in the article.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here he argues that the time for lockdowns needs to end, they never should have begun on a worldwide scale to begin with, and state from the beginning, “there is no one answer, but many.” Any frequenter of this sub will find that these people share the same philosophies we have, that COVID as a crisis has passed, that none of these safety measures matter, that the virus is one and the same as the flu in terms of close variants, and that history not only backs the unencessity of abolishing human freedom on a curricular scale, but ridicules the notion.</p>
<p>With time, anything can be forgotten. I’m sure at the end of this road, where we declare our freedom and put this behind us so we can focus on proper damage control, whatever reparations that follow will precede another period of peace like from the stretch of the cold war to the onset of this scam. Then the next generation will move in, gradually people will forget the past, forget this crisis as well, and open the way for a new movement of tyranny with whatever new tools corporations and dictatorships have at their disposals.</p>
<p>Unless we value the lessons of the past and the tried and true trial and error of our predecessors, our dark history will re-emerge again and again.</p></p>
