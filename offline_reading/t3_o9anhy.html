    <strong>“Let the South Die”</strong>
    <p><p>I was scrolling on the news Reddit and it was something about vaccines.</p>
<p>I kept reading these false statistics and absurd amounts of hateful talk about those not taking the vaccine. Most of which was “let them die then.”, “We should take their children away from them.”, “it’s all of these white, republican, trump supporting, Christian extremists who won’t take the vaccine”, etc.</p>
<p>Whenever someone would say “NC here and I’m so sad to say that most of us are refusing to take the vaccine. Don’t come here because of these anti vaccine idiots.” It made me want to go there even more. </p>
<p>Please let the south die. Please stop associating with us and forget we existed. Let us become our own country please.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. I was born in Macon Georgia but lived in Warner Robins. My family moved to Florida when I was 10 so my whole life has been the Florida Georgia line. I’m definitely gonna go back home when I can. I was born in Georgia and I will die in Georgia, God willing.</p>

<p>Brexit or any other people have the right to peacefully disassociate with a larger empire. Slavery being such a disgusting act blinds Americans to the immorality of fighting a war killing millions to prevent a people from forming their own nation.  We don't have slaves anymore so there is no excuse to not allow a peaceful national divorce.</p>
<p>America should be like NATO.  We should offer mutual aid if attacked and otherwise mind our own business.</p>

        <p>Don't bet on that. History is moving us towards more and more and more centralizing and larger nations.</p>
<p>That isn't a bad thing in the real world since so frigging much has more than local effects, such as 'localized' pollution that actually drifts over state lines through the air and water.</p>

        <p>Exactly this. As a northerner (PA) living in the south (SC) all I see is a bunch of NYers who vote Dem and complain about the traffic and taxes. I finally snapped at one and said you can't fucking complain about taxes if you keep voting in people who keep raising them. At least I'm down here acclimating to my environment and not trying to change it. (I voted for trump last election, which didn't matter because SC is a red state anyway)</p>

        <p>There is so much going on here. First of all these are the people that have been saying I wear my mask for you, I’m doing my part to protect you! Yet they will wish you dead in the same breath if you don’t want to go along with this so their  caring is completely conditional. They’re not good people they’re just fear-based. Secondly, as far as blaming conservative Christian Trump supporters, it’s come out time and time again that one of the largest segments of the population not going for this is the black community And can you really blame them considering what they’ve suffered through in the past with medical experiments?. I can say this living in an area with a large black community.  there is a large segment of the population that is extremely distrustful and not taking the vaccine. Dr Jill and Fauci even came here and tried to coerce them into taking it. So why are you continually blaming Whitey again And you’re leaving out the part about large amounts of black Americans who are refusing it as well?is it because you wanna keep virtue signaling and engaging in self hatred?</p>
<p>And again, so many of them still wearing masks yet they are vaccinated. Before this whole Delta thing started up and people have started talking about wearing masks again these people were wearing masks to be on the safe side according to them because they didn’t trust unvaccinated people and some of them were wearing masks so people wouldn’t think they were Republicans. If you were wearing a mask after being vaccinated because you’re still scared then you are being outed as a liar. Before this they kept saying they were wearing their mask for others they’re such good people, now it’s to protect them? Which is it? I’m tired of all of this, they are crazy and mentally unstable and I can’t take interacting with them anymore. If they are talking about a place full of awful people who don’t want to take the vaccine please let me know where this is so I can move there. I don’t want to be anywhere around people that expect me to have medical procedures done so they can feel safe. Also, it’s bizarre that they think me not being able to go to public events or certain places without being vaccinated is ruining my life. It’s not. I don’t wanna be around them. If I have to do things to be able to engage in these activities I’m just going to go somewhere that doesn’t have these rules. It’s a simple as that.</p>

        <p>Well, that sounds like you’re playing into their plan to divide us all.</p>
<p>We really need to come together right now- cause the government doesn’t give a fuck about us.</p>

        <p>There plan was successful decades ago. It’s just playing out now. Can’t really come together when there’s already a division. </p>
<p>Our political system is literally two different sides... that automatically causes division. We have all the colors and genders and sexuality and everything here as well. America isn’t a place of unity.</p>
<p>I’m not saying I hate my fellow man or what have you, I’m saying diversity is the opposite of unity. </p>
<p>There’s left and right, white and black, straight and gay, religious or non religious, rich and poor. Those don’t coexist the greatest because there will always be tension.</p>
<p>The division plan had already succeeded. Now it’s just prolonging the inevitable.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. Diversity is NOT the opposite of unity.</p>
<p>Do homosexuals having the same rights as heterosexuals REALLY harm you?</p>
<p>Does transsexuals having the same rights as heterosexuals?</p>
<p>I would say "Big fat MF'ing NO! at 200 KILLING decibels"</p>

        <p>There will always be clashing in everything. Waffles vs pancakes, bulldogs vs seminoles, republican vs democrat. </p>
<p>And who said it’s harmful? So far you’re the only one who said gay people having the same right is harmful. I never said anything about that or went deeper into it. I was simply saying things that are opposites or at least different sides... and sorry but diversity doesn’t bring unity. It causes everyone to form different groups that go against each other. Just look at the republican and Democratic Party. Look at the feminist movement that are attacking men now. Look at the Christian or Islamic church attacking homosexuals or vis versa, look at everything.</p>
