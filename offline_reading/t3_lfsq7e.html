    <strong>Ron Wright</strong>
    <p><p>All across the front page, you can find people celebrating the death of GOP Congressman Ron Wright, who was so bold as to suggest on Twitter that if Walmart and Target can safely do business, so can small businesses. As you heard, he died after testing positive for COVID-19. His death was karmic retribution for his opposition to discriminatory lockdown policies that have crushed small business.</p>
<p>What is not widely reported is that he was 2 years into a battle with Stage 4 non small cell lung cancer. This particular cancer diagnosis has a 5 year survival rate of less than 10%. Radiation, chemo- and immunotherapy can all make a person more susceptible to infections, and worsen their course if a person becomes infected. Statistics said every day of life he lived after 1 year was a gift that half the people with the same diagnosis don’t ever receive.</p>
<p>Like all the coronavirus mortality data suggest, this is an example representative of the vast majority of COVID deaths: hastening the death of the very old or infirm. </p>
<p>It is arguable, given his health, that he could have excercised more individual caution. What cannot be argued, although many in the media are trying, is that this was a healthy 67 year old man who got COVID and suddenly died. He had terminal cancer and died of an acute infection, as sadly 1,000s of patients with cancer do every year, including those years long before SARS-CoV-2 was being transmitted in humans.</p>
<p>End the lockdown. Restore sanity. Quarantine the old and sick until they are vaccinated, let the rest of us live.</p></p>

        <p>I feel for his family but you’re right. He was 67 and battled lung cancer. COVID got him but a bad flu would have done him in as well.</p>
<p>The most important thing to take from this is he died living.   He knew he was on borrowed time so he went all in. I appreciate that in a person.</p>

        <p>"Would he have been alive today if it wasn't for covid? Yes? Then covid is the cause of death"</p>
<p>That was the open and shut case I received from those who bothered responding when commenting about this in r/politics earlier today. Is it fair to say he died of covid over 17 days after diagnosis (and approx a month after contraction since they claim it was due to the capital walk-in)? Was he still testing positive of the virus when he died? I'm curious about these answers because of love to know how they constitute covid being an absolute cause of death</p>

        <p>I can’t believe so many people blatantly lack empathy for people who pass away just because they have a different political standing. I thought the point of lockdowns was to save lives but then those same people openly say they hope you die if you don’t agree with them.</p>

        <p>I meant that it’s the way people rationalize them. Calling you a terrible person because if you go out you could potentially infect someone which could potentially kill them.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that both CNN and NBC have each added a single line to their coverage (toward the bottom of each article)</p>
<p>From CNN
&rt; The statement from Wright's office on Monday noted that the congressman has also battled cancer.</p>
<p>and NBC
&rt;Wright was hospitalized in September because of complications from cancer treatment, The Texas Tribune reported.</p>
<p>That's it. </p>
<p>The news can be factually correct without giving you any real information simply by emphasis.  So yea, it's Covid.</p>
