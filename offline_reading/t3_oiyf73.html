    <strong>I see how this is progressing and getting ever more obvious and sinister - hopeless. Is there any reason not to be?</strong>
    <p><p>As I say in the title, all I am seeing is how governments are now openly discriminating against the non-vaccinated, how politicans are openly calling for them to be forced or ostrasized from society. This used to be a fear but now it's reality.</p>
<p>I don't know how to keep going when it's all so obvious but the vast majority will just sneer at you and gaslight you into compliance. I feel like I am going crazy. What if I am? I just want to get off this mad carousel, please. </p>
<p>I just need some input from you guys. Is there any hope? I don't think there is anymore.</p></p>

        <p>There is not. It's over.</p>
<p>Just cherish your memories of the world from before, that's never coming back. You're now looking at a dystopian scenario so horrible there's no work of fiction that has described it accurately.</p>
<p>I wish I had better words to say, I really do. I don't. It's all over. I have constant flashbacks from before all this, from when I had hope, from when I could actually make a plan for the future, from when there was a future I could plan for. All gone forever.</p>
<p>I will soon depart from this inferno, I don't see myself lasting longer than some more months. I do not suggest you do the same but keep in mind that there's always that option. It helped me carry forward until now, I have people that depend on me.</p>

        <p>i agree, it's fucked. the mere fact that we have less rights than in dystopian fiction says it all. but if there's one thing i believe in it's that <strong><em>we cannot make it easy for them</em></strong>; for the elite, the governments, the deep state. as much as i have been struggling to keep going i am absolutely not leaving this earth without a fight. even if it means dying at the hands of fascism without anyone knowing. maybe it's because i tend to be spiteful but to think that these disgusting pigs are slowly killing people through vaccines, austerity and isolation enrages me so much that i can't think of giving up.</p>

        <p>"be kind" is an useless mantra. It's said to get people to shut up. So go on and be kind while everything you hold dear disappears. At least you were kind.</p>

The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy.</p>
<p>How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.</p>

        <p>you are not the only one. I am suferring from constant anxiety just watching the turn the world is taking. All those liberties and rights gone now, will be gone forever. I want to think, eventually all pandemics fizzled out. Even, black plague dissapeared as it came. Lets go, one day all this over. Until then, it is going to be extremely harsh. We have to resist.</p>

<p>He snaps back "It's an easy thing to do! To wear a Mask! It's a small thing to do to keep everyone safe!"</p>
<p>The Cult of the Mask here can't let it go.. They're so upset they can't call the RCMP on people anymore to force them to comply... now returning to the same old tired arguments.</p>

        <p>Today I've been reading comments from people saying it's time to let the unvaccinated "just die" if they come to the hospitals needing treatment for Covid. I've seen these types of comments for a couple of months, but it's hitting different today with all the other news. I'm going to go sit in the sun for a little while, and try to get in a better mindset. It's a lot right now - you are not alone.</p>

        <p>We are living through what passes for world war in the 21st century. World wars end. This one is weird but it too will end. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of casualties, massacres and war crimes is still to come, and not everyone will see the end of this war. But the war will end, and you have good chance of living through it.</p>
