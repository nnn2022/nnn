    <strong>Just saw a friend's kids' "virtual learning schedule." Appalled.</strong>
    <p><p>I've worked in corporate America long enough to know a certain type of worker, who is very good at showing you a schedule of why they're so very busy, and their meeting calendar is very full, but it turns out they're not doing much work other than making a show of the work they're doing.</p>
<p>I just saw a schedule for a friend's kids, twins in elementary school. People responding to it kept saying it "looked intense" but I looked a little closer and was just disgusted.</p>
<p>The kids only get 10 minutes of break time, three times a day. All the rest of their school day time is planned out. About 3.5 hours must be spent on Zoom. However, the vast majority of the Zoom time was occupied by activities that didn't require any active instructional time: watching kids take a test was one part, another was kids finishing up work at the end of the day. Yet another Zoom session was group reading, where the kids take turns reading a book to one another. The sum of the day actually requiring teacher-based instruction was probably less than 60 minutes.</p>
<p>My family does homeschooling and we have very young kids (significantly younger than my friend's). We like to consider ourselves semi-relaxed homeschoolers who give our kids plenty of free time to unwind. Even so, if we'd had a day with 60 minutes or so of instructional time only, it would mean something had gone really off-track -- say, if one of our homeschooled kids had gotten sick halfway through the day, or missed out on a night of sleep and couldn't focus, maybe.</p>
<p>This isn't an appropriate level of instructional time for even a homeschooled mom to be giving her kindergartener, and homeschoolers (due to being able to tailor lessons for a tiny "class size") can usually achieve results with less instructional time than a public school teacher.</p>
<p>Yet there were people in the comments talking about how brave the teachers were being and how busy it sounded for the teacher. How can people be this blind? No wonder the teachers don't want to be back in school. Half-assed "supervision" of group reading and test-taking without actually being in a classroom, and only an hour (broken into 10-20 minute chunks) of teaching a lesson. Brilliant. Surely no parent will realize their kid is being provided with basically curriculum materials and under an hour of instruction per day, and decide public school's not worth it?</p></p>

        <p>You should know that teachers often do not control factors like this, and that if a course consists entirely of students reading to each other, that's not usually a decision the teacher makes but rather the board/faculty/etc. Sure, they have to build a schedule to the standards of the curriculum they are teaching, but if that curriculum includes massive amounts of reading times, that's not the teacher's fault; it's the curriculum.  </p>
<p>Also, watching students take tests/exams online is rather commonplace and used often to screen for cheating while in online courses. There are actually much, much more extreme methods/software for using this that are somewhat common in college and are required for some courses. It's called a proctored test/exam and it's been done for about as long as online tests/exams have been offered.</p>

        <p>So third graders need proctored exams? And teachers can observe 30 third-graders to make sure no one's cheating while they submit an online assignment? How, exactly?</p>

        <p>Proctored exams are held to prevent academic dishonesty, including cheating. Your OP didn't mention they were third graders and I was responding less to you and more to the person I replied to directly, but there could be any number of reasons that a teacher would want to proctor a test for most levels of education, yes.</p>
<p>To answer your question about "How", a common method uses webcams which are required to show the test taker at all times, to which proctors (those designated to watch over the test takers) are assigned to, in order to keep watch on them and prevent cheating. More sophisticated technology actually automatically flags any transients (sharp, sudden noises), webcam movements, or the test taker leaving the screen. When combined with test-taking-specific browsers, these leave little room for cheating using traditional methods, and most students will just take the test legitimately and avoid the trouble of trying to over come the system.</p>
<p>So in short, to answer your questions: Yes, there could be situations where a third grade teacher would feel the need to proctor a test, and yes, there exists software that allows teachers to proctor tests for many students at once.</p>

        <p>I completely agree and to quote a wise man, Bill Gates once said that he would always "hire a lazy person to do a difficult job ,because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” </p>
<p>Honestly, there’s so many factors that are involved in the quality of education for students here in the US, so I’d like to avoid making blanket statements. I will just say that I wish all public school students had access to the same resources nationwide.</p>

        <p>The virtual learning really is horrible on all levels. My 4th grader has 2-2.5 hours of “live instruction” per day..mostly listening to the teacher lecture etc. The “work” is a few silly assignments a day- stuff like watch a video and answer a few questions, create a google slide showing things that interest you, etc etc. He spends maybe 3-4 hours day on school, total. In a way, it could be worse (I’m glad he has free time) but he is learning absolutely zero. As expected. The whole thing is really a waste of time for him, me, and his teachers (some of whom are trying so hard). I’d rather they extended break &amp; furloughed teachers- and just left the parents to their own devices to homeschool or not. The only reason we stay is to retain his spot in a particular program (language immersion)- and that program is obviously worthless at the moment..</p>

        <p>This. Teachers' jobs the past 6 or so months have been immensely upscaled; many of them are having to devise two entirely independent curricula for in-person and online, and being required to be prepared for a switch between the two at a moment's notice AND not getting paid any more for it. It's been quite a challenge to the usual fare for teachers.</p>

        <p>I fear that the only thing different about this school year, other than the social isolation that kids are experiencing, is that parents, for the first time, have visibility into what their kids are actually being taught in school. Many teachers are terrible, and when schools were open, they "taught" by playing movies or by telling kids to read the textbook while they fooled around. I suspect that if you stuck a camera in your kid's backpack, you'd discover that Zoom Class is sadly very similar to normal class.</p>
