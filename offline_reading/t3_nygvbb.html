        <p>They refused to hear the election fraud concerns. The peasants grew angry and revolted. The rulers instructed the capitol police to step down and then framed the peasants as terrorists even though they killed nobody and did nothing except walk around a building and break a few windows. This was after excusing billions in property damage by their preferred clients.</p>

        <p>Couldn't agree more. Even today, people still respect SCOTUS. Simply the promise of a fair day in court probably would have averted that riot. </p>
<p>Instead, they refused to even consider it.</p>

        <p>It wasn't a riot, I know you didn't intend it but you should stop playing on the lefts ballfield and letting them redefine terms. Riots and insurrections are what the democrats did for the last 4 years murdering hundreds of innocents and burning down billions in small business and urban city resources. What happened on the 6th was tens of thousands of patriots showing up to protest against the theft of an election and leaving peacefully before the sun went down with minimal public damage and 0 deaths outside of one woman killed by metro DC police while unarmed and of no threat to anyone. No autonomous zones, no burning courthouses, no assaulting civilians.</p>

<p>Pass the copium, please. It was a false flag in that no attempt was made to stop it, but most of the people there were Trump supporters angry about the ways the ruling class, <em>ahem</em>, fortified the election.</p>

        <p>false flag doesn't mean fake. it's where you basically attack yourself / your allies, and pretend you are an enemy so that you can justify going after that enemy</p>
<p>the 1/6 thing wasn't so much a false flag as it was just a general psyop. the government goaded these protestors into putting themselves in a compromising position, then took the photos and videos from that event and used it to prop up a story that was a misrepresentation of actual events that blew the whole thing wildly out of proportion. it was basically just a big trumped-up farce. all it really did was stoke more anger on both sides and deepen the divide between the two main camps</p>

        <p>Would you be able to accept a reality in which there really wasn’t large scale voting fraud? </p>
<p>There’s a HUGE amount of speculation around the event and not much hard evidence, so really it’s not provable either way right? So a reality could exist that was in fact no election fraud. </p>
<p>If that is a possible reality, and people went there to try and influence the results of a legitimate election, that could be considered a “coup” or “insurrection”, could it not?</p>

        <p>even in that situation, it was an out of control protest at worst. those terms generally imply an armed and organized takeover of a government, and as far as i'm aware, there wasn't anyone there who was armed, much less was there an organized attempt to forcibly take over the government. so no.</p>
<p>i personally just go towards where I feel the evidence leads, and if the dems won fair and square then fine. That's not what happened as I see it, and at this point you'd be hard pressed to dissuade me from that opinion. as much as trump is a scummy guy and all that, I'd rather have him again if he really won, than a different scumbag who won by cheating</p>

        <p>I haven’t seen any evidence of election fraud that met my standards of proving something without reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>I’m not going to go into the semantics of these words, but many would perceive people organizing on message boards to go down there for the purpose of changing the results of an election as an attempted coup. I don’t throw words and emotions around lightly so I tend not to comment because I truly don’t know.</p>

<p>In the last 14 days? No, but I wasn't talking about this year in the first place. So [I'll do ya one better.] (https://townhall.com/tipsheet/juliorosas/2020/11/30/police-chief-association-releases-jawdropping-numbers-of-injured-officers-during-n2580844) </p>
<p>If you dig into the data you'll note that while the vast majority of protests in general happened within ~2 weeks of Floyd's death, the violent riots were spread out throughout the year.</p>
<p>&rt;How many of those "paled" "riots" attacked the capitol of our country?</p>
<p>Do you mean the capitol as in DC, because there were several. Or do you mean the Capitol Building itself? In which case there is precedent for protestors occupying the building for short periods; aided by congresspeople.</p>

        <p>The SCOTUS has actually done far more than that.   In a 1905 case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, they ruled that municipalities can require their residents to be vaccinated. Their decision told the courts to give deference to public health officials on such matters and that “The answer is that it was the duty of the constituted authorities primarily to keep in view the welfare, comfort, and safety of the many, and not permit the interests of the many to be subordinated to the wishes or convenience of the few.”   This ruling was applied during the Spanish Flu pandemic to allow the enforce of mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Isn’t SCOTUS much more lenient about being anti-mask than anti-election?</p>
<p>Most of their rulings have been against lockdowns and masks.</p>

        <p>How did Texas have standing? They  got all the electors that the constitution grants them. Texas has no say over how Georgia chooses electors. The states have broad latitude to run their elections. That's a good thing. There's a reason the Democrats are pushing to federalize elections even though state sovereignty over elections put their guy in the white house.</p>

        <p>you people amuse the shit out of me. You get laughed out of the court room about 80 times and you think its because there some grand conspiracy taking place instead of admitting a ball of orange lard lied to you, just like he lied the other 20,000+ times (some good soul was keeping track) and you believed it.

        <p>The SCOTUS disagrees with you.  In a 1905 case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, they ruled that municipalities can require their residents to be vaccinated. Furthermore their decision told the courts to give deference to public health officials on such matters and that “The answer is that it was the duty of the constituted authorities primarily to keep in view the welfare, comfort, and safety of the many, and not permit the interests of the many to be subordinated to the wishes or convenience of the few.”   This ruling was applied during the Spanish Flu pandemic to allow the enforce of mask mandates and other measures. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court will over turn this ruling now.  </p>

My rights end where  yours begins, and rights are about protecting oneself not IMPOSING upon others. People have clearly lost their minds.</p>

        <p>No.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and later sexual orientation and gender identity. Your medical condition doesn’t fit anywhere there.</p>
<p>If you can’t wear a mask for medical reasons, you probably shouldn’t be out in a store being incredibly vulnerable in the first place. You’re just asking for death. And WHAT medical conditions? The only people I’ve seen play this card are people who are just bullshitting.</p>
<p>My friend has asthma and she can still wear a mask just fine for hours. So what condition do you speak of?</p>

<p>You don’t have the rights to do whatever you want in a private business. There are some laws that protect you from discrimination based on things you cannot change like race or orientation.</p>
<p>Being told you can’t enter for not following their policies is not violating ANY rights at all. Those “rights” you think you have END when you decide to enter a private business.</p>

        <p>There's no easy one size fits all answer, but for myself, I just didn't comply ever, and I was only confronted one time. I can't tell you how many times I was walking through the store maskless and as soon as someone saw me, they would tear theirs off. We are the majority. We need to start acting like it.</p>
<p>Edit: it would also be wise to start unplugging yourself from the system as much as you're able and prepare yourself to be as independent as possible. Store food and start growing your own if you haven't already.</p>

        <p>Don't bet on it. Mr. Roberts got a LOT of heat for that nonsense even from his fellow Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>Two of them made it clear that Roberts got it absolutely wrong and did not mince words.</p>
<p>The First Amendment and Second Amendment are sacrosanct. NO restrictions on them are allowed. Not even during a 'health emergency' that was not actually a health emergency but a lack of treatment emergency.</p>

        <p>So you think it's okay that the state can direct the manner of people's religious observance? Indefinitely? </p>

        <p>What I think he means is the two amendments don’t have loopholes built into the language as the others do. For example the 4th amendment says no search or seizures unless .... the 13th says no slavery unless... the first says free speech period. The second says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed...period. That’s what he means.</p>

        <p>I've been out of he loop... Spent the past week in the Smoky mountains and it was beautiful... Also no masks.  There are a few sheeps that still wear it but it's pretty much 99.9% no masks.</p>
<p>Either way, heading down to FL and see this post, so no more masks wearing anywhere?  Or does this mean the government can't mandate but the businesses can still requires one for it's employees or customers?</p>

        <p>That’s not necessarily how you should think of that. In the United States, businesses don’t have to sell to you. They choose to because they like money. They cannot however, choose not to sell to you based on race, gender, etc. Just because you can’t be arrested for it, doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want. People think freedom of choice goes one way, it’s not. I don’t understand why that’s such a hard concept for people to understand. Take your business elsewhere if you don’t like being told to put a mask on. Why would you even want to go to a store that doesn’t have the same ideologies you do?</p>

        <p>Maybe that was a bad example but, federal law allows for a business to refuse service to someone when refusal of service is justified in cases where a customer’s presence interferes with the safety and well-being of other patrons and the establishment itself. Therefore if a business feels you not wearing a mask is detrimental to other customers or the business they have every right to kick your ass out.</p>

        <p>A business has the obligation to protect it's workers.</p>
<p>A business also has the incentive to stay open, and having all your workers sick forces you closed.</p>
<p>It's no violation of anybody's rights for a hospital to mandate masks during surgery.</p>
<p>It's no violation of anyone's rights for a company to mandate it's employees wear steel toe boots, a hard hat and hearing protection</p>
<p>Likewise, it's no violation of anyone's rights for a business to mandate that it's customers and employees must wear masks to prevent the spread of an infectious disease.</p>
<p>You might say that this particular disease is not a big deal, but companies have to work with the information they have, and the CDC and the media seem to say it's pretty serious for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>&rt;Also no masks.  There are a few sheeps that still wear it but it's pretty much 99.9% no masks.</p>
<p>I went to my nieces' water polo game yesterday. Not a mask in sight, and the natatorium (I think that's how you spell the word for the nice building that has a bunch of pools in it) was pretty crowded. It was delightful and my nieces' team slaughtered the opposition.</p>
<p>I did see one woman, alone in her car, with a mask on. We were at a red light and I looked over there, and well okay, lady, that's your choice, a weird one but have at it.</p>

        <p>Legally, in most states employers and schools will be able to enforce vaccines if they so choose according federal law and the EEOC.   So far no Covid vaccine has been approved for kids under 12 (Pfizer is 12 and up, Moderna and J&amp;J are 18 and up.  Moderna has requested dropping their age limit to 12 and Pfizer will probably request ages 2 and up this Fall based on the latest clinical trials).  So kids under 12 won’t be eligible and most employers really probably don’t want to have to deal with it.  I’m sure that there will be a number of court cases that will wind through the courts but ultimately they will probably all fail.  </p>

        <p>Looking at various types of weather control, (SRM, cloud seeding, and HAARP) I think it would be possible for areas to "become inhospitable" and "for your safety" be barred from living there. I live in northern CA, and I wouldn't be surprised if they declare swaths of forested areas to be unsafe due to fire risks. Now, I'm not sure if you've looked into it, but there is at least some evidence of CA wildfires being caused by unnatural means or at the very least, burning in unnatural patterns. If they can do it with fire in CA, I would be willing to believe they can do it with inclement weather in Florida.</p>

        <p>I'm in Sacramento actually. And yes, some investigators concluded Santa Rosa fires a few years ago were deliberately caused from a directed source (space? satellite?), not a naturally occurring fire burn pattern. Those communities were targeted.</p>

        <p>Totally. It doesn't really take an expert to determine there was something very fishy about the burn patterns as well as what actually burned/melted in Paradise, CA. I know anecdotes don't count as evidence, but a coworker I used to be friends with retired and had just purchased a home in Paradise the year before it all burned. He got out, but he went back in with others a few days later because he was Oakland PD for a long time looking for people or things that were recoverable. He said it looked weird compared to lots of other fires he'd seen. He is just one guy though, so take it with a grain of salt. I think I'd be willing to believe in Directed Energy Weapons, and them being used on domestic areas, but I'm not willing to accept that they're mounted on satellites. To me, all that space stuff will always be "just ten years away"!</p>

        <p>No I saw photos online and videos on YouTube and the burn patterns were not normal. Also, firefighters said, and even the fire chief there said it was not a natural fire, was like nothing they’d seen before. Photos showed cars completely melted down but nearby trees unscathed.</p>

        <p>People have built cities below sea level for thousands of years. Even if the sea level rose by three feet, a five foot levvie would protect cities as they are. That's before any of the other technologies (infill for instance, or building on pylons) that are already in wide use. Climate change mitigation could be expensive for Florida, some people might lose substantial property, but it's not the end of the world that some would have you believe.</p>

        <p>I'm 52. Climate change has been hyped my entire life. When I was in high school (got out in '86) and college (graduated in '90), global cooling was a debate topic, and then it turned into global warming and I remember seriously arguing, on the basis of bad propaganda of the type later promulgated by Al Gore, that we'd be underwater by 2000.</p>
<p>The issue is nothing new, and the hysteria is nothing new. It just catches fire every couple years when someone needs something to bitch at the other side for.</p>

        <p>When people say "State will be underwater" they typically just mean that all major population centers near the coast will be underwater. For Florida, almost all major population centers are on the coast.</p>
<p>There will still be land obviously, but if all the ice on earth melted, the sea would rise by  212 feet. That wont happen for a while. But most of it would be gone.</p>

        <p>You’re such a troll, just looking to pick a fight.  The link you lazily cited (and clearly don’t fully understand) contains exclusively biased observational data derived from mannequins and simulations in addition to population-level statistics that are confounded by multiple factors, including social distancing, resulting in an ecological fallacy.  Where are the randomized controlled trials that demonstrate the efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission of SARS CoV2?  The only one I’m aware of is the Danish study published in Annals of Internal Medicine that demonstrates no benefit to the wearer; it did not assess the benefit of wearing masks on preventing spread to others.  There is no study that confirms that masks are beneficial, just studies that support the theory.  There are plenty of other studies that support the theory that masks act as fomites and do little to stop the spread of aerosolized viral particles.  So again, show me the data!</p>

        <p>Obviously you don’t understand what a randomized controlled trial is.  All RCTs require exposing people to the disease-causing factors.  That’s how vaccines and drugs are tested.  You give the vaccine/drug and let the person go on their merry way, as if nothing had happened.  Then you follow up to see if there’s a difference between groups that got placebo versus the intervention.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why you brought Tuskegee into this.  You must be either black or a bleeding-heart, virtual-signaling fool.  Either way, that was a group of 600 men, 400 of whom were naturally infected with syphilis (the other 200 were uninfected), and monitored for disease progression.  That was not a randomized controlled trial, it was an observational study.  Lamentable as it was, the men were not infected by the government—they had unprotected sex and contracted the disease naturally.  The incident was a demonstration of the need for informed consent in studies.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I thought you were suggesting bringing them into a lab and getting someone infected with covid to breath on them. Sorry for misunderstanding that.</p>
<p>But with a mask study I would say you would be removing a layer of protection, instead of adding one. Besides, a mask is a simple physical object that can be studied with a simple physical object.</p>

        <p>The courts have failed us for the most part. They should have decided that governors cannot declare emergencies ad infinitum. You get 60 days max. Also, shuttering businesses is not even remotely legal or ethical yet they let that happen as well. When conservatives purge their ranks of frauds it should include justices.</p>

        <p>Lol. Well there would have to be a federal law passed mandating mask wearing for non-federal employees and non-federally owned locations. You cannot challenge something that doesn't exist. That's how the Supreme Court works. I guess someone could challenge that the President is not at the head of the executive branch, but that is pretty clearly constitutional since that is his title.</p>

        <p>I think a big part of the issue is that so much is being done under emergency powers either by unelected departments or by executive powers, and it just goes on and on and the emergency never ends. Emergencies are often used in history to make power grabs. </p>
<p>The legislature is supposed to be the one that makes the laws. Forcing all landlords to not have evictions for example is a vast overreach of power by a non elected government body.</p>

        <p>There are 5 states that are not yet fully open and 13 that still have some sort of masking mandate. Power grabs generally result in power that is grabbed and not reversals once the emergency is over and clear publicly stated goals have been met. 
The CDC did not force landlords to not evict. It is a moratorium or pause in response to the shutting down of the economy which landlords are a part of; and that will end this month. The CDC is a part of the Executive Branch and serves under the President. The President is elected. Furthermore the CDC was acting under a provision of the Public Health Service Act of 1944 which is a law passed by the legislature giving power to HHS to act in times of public health crises.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m bursting your bubble here, but it’s still happening, worldwide. Here in the UK people are still wearing masks, socially distancing, working from
home, and away to enter a third lockdown. The world is screwed, and Florida is only a small part of it.</p>

        <p>America is exceptional on the global stage because we do freedom.  I think you're starting to understand why Europe and the rest of the planet sucks.  I am in California and I haven't worn a mask the entire time, been going to packed crossfit and yoga classes in a republican city, in full violation of all the mandates.  </p>

        <p>That’s great, and more power to you. I too, have refused to follow any of these mandates. However, my point is that the world is fucked, and it won’t be long before Florida and any other state migrating away from current mandates, is sucked right back into it, because the corruption at play is way over our heads at this point.</p>

        <p>Ok how is it different than any dress code at any government office you’ve attended. Or public decency laws.    We have had the government telling us what we have to wear in public since forever. At least masks are for health and not because the government wants to tell school kids what’s distracting or Becky needs to cover her nipple but Paul doesn’t.</p>

        <p>"so this can never happen again" you make it sound like someone just reversed the decision to not let black votes or something monumental.  Was someone oppressed here?  Are mask mandates really so bad? </p>
<p>Also, why did republicans celebrate the ability for businesses to discriminate against gay people, but now are unwilling to let the free market be free? What the fuck is wrong with having people wear a mask to slow the spread of a pandemic? Jesus fuckin Christ this post is everything wrong with society</p>

        <p>But if Edna's Bakery or Joe's Farm Market says so, then they have the power over you, more than government, and can call police if you dont' comply, because 'it's private property'.. .another lie about property law being used to subjugate others.</p>
<p>This law would have to include discrimination from businesses based on health records, that NO business (other than related health occupations) should have any business inquiring or asking about.</p>

        <p>For people to buy this and not think “those in favor” are all idiots, you’d have to put 10+ doctors on stage, credentials in hand, going on and on about how viral material easily transfers through the fabric of the facemask… why this isn’t common sense idk.. I get that it might prevent an aggressive spread of droplets but many doctors clearly state masks do nothing for viral material</p>

        <p>Now that we all seem to be on the same page that covid exists and can be lethal, but you just never cared. Even your “side” is loudly proclaiming it was a man made bioweapon.</p>
<p>Even after disavowing Trump, why take the chance of being infected with something man made?</p>

        <p>China is a sinosupremacist Nazi state with soviet aesthetics ever since Mao failed miserably and they opened to the west as the world’s cheap labor hub.</p>

        <p>The answer is simple - it simply does not matter how many people have to die.  Inalienable rights are just that - not negotiable.  America is exceptional on the global stage in our sheer brutalism of prioritizing liberty above life itself.  It is why the world looks up to us for leadership.  #serious</p>

        <p>The SCOTUS disagrees with you.  In a 1905 case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, they ruled to give deference to public health officials on such matters and that “The answer is that it was the duty of the constituted authorities primarily to keep in view the welfare, comfort, and safety of the many, and not permit the interests of the many to be subordinated to the wishes or convenience of the few.”  </p>

        <p>You are right, this has always been an issue for the disabled in North America. When living in Southeast Asia, my family was never sick even though we still couldn't get vaccines. The difference was masks are a common thing culturally. The view is not on one's self, but the community in order to protect one's self. If someone felt a little under the weather, they would wear a mask. If there was a huge crowd of people, many would wear a mask so not to spread what they might not be able to see. And during seasonal viruses, the community would mask up. Essentially, one for all benefits all for one.</p>

        <p>Lmao it always gets my goat that people that come here to troll think we're all a bunch of trump worshippers. The majority of us (probably) recognize that the two party system is invalid and I would be willing to bet that many, maybe not most, of us don't even vote. However, trolls that come from the highly politicized other subs cannot conceive of anything outside the left-right paradigm. We recognize that the left wing and the right wing are both part of the same dirty bird. Trump is a pawn, an actor, and admittedly a pretty funny comedian. World leader? No.</p>

        <p>I don't think there are any federal laws against nudity hence why you have nude beaches and pornography is legal with the consent of the parties involved. Although I think the porn industry is a parasite that should be burned off.</p>

        <p>The body is not pornographic. It is natural. There should be <strong>NO</strong> public space in the world where it is prohibited. Consent to as much as <em>be seen by</em> another human is absurd, being nude is not a sexual act. It shouldn't be any different than being seen wearing a blue shirt. Hell, it should be less controversial than being clothed, it's <em>more</em> natural to be nude.</p>
