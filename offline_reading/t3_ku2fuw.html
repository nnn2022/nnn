    <strong>What is the solution to this problem? [discussion]</strong>
    <p><p>TL;DR at the bottom. </p>
<p>I write this as a person of religion (see what I did there), and I mean to disclose that because I must admit: I could not really get into this idea I am about to bring up. Reason being, my money's on another horse. But anyway, </p>
<p>What is the solution to this tyranny? </p>
<p>It's a simple question, to which I believe there is a radically simple answer. </p>
<p>Is the best response to this tyranny compliance? As has been said before, "The faster you give up your rights, the sooner we'll give them back to you." Maybe worded a bit differently, but it's the same premise. Just wear your mask, then you won't have to.  Just obey the curfew, then it will be lifted. Just don't spend time with friends or family, and then you'll be able to see them all again.</p>
<p>One of the worst parts of these measures is the law enforcement groups who agree willingly to enforce such insane restrictions. As if police didn't have a bad enough reputation for many, this certainly doesn't make things better. </p>
<p>In my personal opinion, compliance is not the solution to the problem many people around the world are facing. To put it crudely, compliance in this situation would be akin to a rape victim just giving in because then it'll be over sooner. </p>
<p>Well, what else is there besides compliance? I suppose the opposite approach would be resistance. Denial. Rejection. </p>
<p>Are there any other options besides "Yes" or "No" to draconian tyrannical authoritarianism? Is there a middle ground, or a compromise?</p>
<p>I was talking with my wife about this question, and she holds a different view than me, but in speaking with her I think I was really able to narrow down my argument, though it may still be short sighted. I figured why not share it here and get some discussion going? Like I said, I am a person of religion and I could not really get behind what I am about to suggest. </p>
<p>The simple answer to our unfortunate question is a one word answer, which I am fairly sure I cannot utter here, so I will use a word like it. How fitting for the time we live in, it rhymes with "virulence". Let it be declared here and now I DO NOT CONDONE VIRULENCE and I do not intend to incite it. I just wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>Resistance without virulence ends up a form of compliance, doesn't it? If politicians order you to wear a mask, and you refuse, they have you fined. The police do their dirty work, and now you have an actual law enforcement group breathing down your neck, requiring you to pay money for disobedience, regardless of whether the fine is legitimate or lawful. I was always told pigs are intelligent, but, well... you get the joke. Next to that, there is arrest. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to "resist" an arrest without it becoming virulent, because police are basically trained to escalate the situation, not discuss it, should you resist it. (Here I note that not all police officers enjoy this bullshit, and not all police offers actually practice enforcing it. There, I said it.) But dare to speak to any police about this issue and likely watch as they dodge around the issue and invariably defend police for "doing their job". Go on, try it. See the many videos of police officers not abiding by the same rules they are enforcing. I digress; the police are not "the issue". They're a symptom, an extension, of the root issue. But symptoms still need dealing with sometimes. </p>
<p>So it seems to me, resistance without virulence inevitably becomes compliance. </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? What's the most efficient way to put a bully in their place? Paperwork and legislation? Is the pen truly mightier than the sword? What if someone said, "Let me go get my sword"? Does the legislator feel so strong then? The truth is most countries don't need new legislation, they need the old legislation properly adhered to.</p>
<p>With such incredible documents as the Constitution, and the Second Amendment, I believe Americans live in one of the potentially best nations on earth, intrinsically and originally created to INHIBIT the tyranny, dictatorship, and encroaching dystopia we now see everywhere. Canada isn't too far off, but the charter of rights isn't as great in my opinion, as the American documents. </p>
<p>With the help of the the mainstream media, however, leftists have basically undermined the good natured intent of these foundations and divided the people. There seem to be two types of people in this division: thinkers and followers. Thinkers, not leaders; leadership is not necessarily the character trait of those who simply wish to question (or ignore) what the TV says, and make up their own minds, and actions.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves thusly arranged: the control freaks, the thinkers, and the followers. </p>
<p>Are followers the enemy? I don't suppose so, but they certainly aren't helping. </p>
<p>The control freaks who wish to impose strict regulations on our very personal lives are very much the enemy. They are the enemies of our freedom, and of basic human rights, and of our lives. They are the enemies of ourselves and our loved ones.</p>
<p>So what is to be done with these enemies? As a person of a particular religion, I am commanded to love my enemies, and even to submit to authority. That second one is a seriously big pill to swallow, especially for me, I admit.</p>
<p>But I see this problem as secular, and I think it requires a secular solution. </p>
<p>What I think would make this easier, would be if the enemies came in droves with weapons drawn. Then it would be so logical, so easy to be virulent without it seeming unjustified. </p>
<p>But these enemies are subtle, sneaky, and sinister. Their weapon IS legislation. Their bullets, swords, and cannons are rules and restrictions. And I can't think of another war metaphor but like I said, the followers help fuel their smoking fire of bullshit. They simply play along and believe everything they're told.</p>
<p>I think at this point I'm just going to start repeating myself, if I haven't already. So let me get to the point. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR -</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, this problem is secular, and the solution is secular. I believe virulent resistance to the tyranny, in mass numbers, is the solution. People who claim to be patriots need to act. We've read about it in history. Revolutions were messy, but necessary. Dictators needed to be shut down. Tyrants needed to be opposed. I just think it's been "so long" or at least so many generations since great wars and battles, that the idea itself sounds too extreme. We're comfortable. We're entertained. And the police state of most first world countries is also extreme. It seems impossible. The police state thinks it needs to protect the politicians, not the people. Revolution would be a crime. It's backwards. Not to mention the old wars were orchestrated and commanded by governments. Average people aren't so organized and on the same page. But I think a revolution is what's needed. </p>
<p>Am I wrong? Is there another solution? I mean, a practical one? Would anything else actually, realistically work?</p></p>

        <p>We have to resist every single step no matter how small it seems. It’s not the specific order you’re resisting it’s the overreach of power. Those who acquire power don’t relinquish it. Look at the Kulaks. It started small and progressively got worse and worse and worse.</p>

        <p>Ha, yes. But that won't happen, there's no way the divided people of the world could unite and not comply. That's why I suppose a revolution would be more fitting. But I guess that isn't going to happen (or work) either.</p>

        <p>I'd love to do something for a revolution but I'm probably useless. Things like "consume less" (doing that already) are useless unless you got numbers and too long-term. We'll have chips inside our assholes in about 2 years.</p>

        <p>I used to laugh at Antichrist and 1000 years of darkness (atheist here) but damn. Religion probably contains quite a bit of insight into, let's say, the nature of man.</p>
<p>Anything you can recommend for reading for a religion newbie? I had actually started reading the old testament (recommend by a hebrew friend) but god bored. I was carefully reading the lists of names of who was born to whom trying to find a metaphysical meaning but you'd probably need an understanding of hebrew for that.</p>

        <p>The problem with a revolution is that it isn't the late 1700s anymore. The world isn't so isolated by oceans and mountains and what not. Any kind of Civil War or revolution in the United States would be the end of it. It would be in another world war within a week everybody sticking their dicks in. There would be 1000 factions fighting on 10,000 different fronts.</p>
<p>But, someone out there with a more military organized mind might have a path to a better world that doesn't come after an extended Dark Age 2.0</p>

        <p>Mass civil disobedience. And vote for the most libertarian party in the next election in your country! We need to encourage small government. Even if you're not a libertarian, right now more than ever we need to swing the pendulum towards that!</p>

        <p>Agreed. I say libertarian specifically because I'm from Canada. Here, unfortunately even our conservative party is fairly left-leaning. So PPC and the libertarian party are really the only feasible non-leftist options</p>

        <p>This sounds crazy, I definitely believe war or revolution isn’t the answer. Possibly one day maybe, but right now nothing would be solved. Lives would be lost pointlessly and even if you managed to win the power vacuum that would be created would more then likely see us under an even more oppressive regime.</p>
<p>You ever watch police chases when they have a helicopter with thermal vision. The criminal has no chance. A massive army of people with rifles and shotguns isn’t gonna cut it. The more episodes of future weapons I watch the less likely I feel any one could successfully overthrow the American government. Unless you had key military personnel and infrastructure on your side.</p>
