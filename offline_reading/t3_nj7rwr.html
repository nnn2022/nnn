    <strong>Remember all the booms and fireworks last year?</strong>
    <p><p>Last year around this time, up until about mid-July, people all over the US were reporting loud booms and fireworks in their area. I saw a lot of posts online saying people were just board, I thought that was a pretty random thing for so many board people. Anyway, in my area, I am starting to hear them again! They are mostly loud booms, not even firework sounding. Also, like last year, it seems like someone is driving around and setting them off from their car and late at night. Is anyone else starting to notice this happening again in their area? What are they doing?!</p></p>
