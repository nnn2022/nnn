    <strong>That is my message of hope</strong>
    <p><p>Yes, this hell will end because compliance always go down and fatigue always wins. There is absolutely no way to repeat the mass fear of March.</p>
<p>Pay attention closely: Lockown 2.0 had everyone on the streets. London had record traffic congestion for november. This repeats itself in any given city in the world.</p>
<p>What do I want to say? That people are tired. The second lockdowns were always lighter, took longer to be decreed and were lifted more quickly than the first ones. Every business that could ignore did so. People are meeting their friends. People resumed seeing their families. Every rule that could be cheated and loopholed was cheated on and loopholed on.</p>
<p>There is an organized opposition to lockdowns, from the UK parliament making a rebellious group in the Tory Party (Covid Recovery Group) to the Brazilian Bolsonaro to multiple lawsuit from business associations in Germany to the impeachment of the President of Peru (Martin Vizcarra imposed the worldÂ´s toughest lockdown. The Peruvian Congress impeached him for "moral unfitness for holding office" and did the same for the vice president) to the mass Netanyahu protests in Israel.</p>
<p>It is impossible to repeat the mass terror of March. There are far less unknowns.</p>
<p>The narrative on a rushed vaccine is to declare victory before they enter in a lockdown 6.0 with zero compliance, because, if lockdowns are repeated on and on without results, people will realize that their efforts were in vain. It will become too obvious that lockdowns dont work. Heads will roll.</p>
<p>Believe me, politicians are scared that people realize the truth (that lockdowns were colossal sacrifices in vain) and vote them out.</p>
<p>This hell will end either with a vaccine or with Lockdown 6.0 with zero patience and compliance. It is taking too long, but we will win in the end.</p></p>

        <p>In the year 2000 there was a British Military report about the next 25 years , and where the British Army will need to be stationed going forward.  In that report they "predicted" the majority of the British Army will need to be stationed IN Britain...... to deal with domestic issues....... I wonder if 25 years of mass immigration and the current situation we are in now ( unjustified lockdowns) would be the cause of that........ nah  . Probably a coincidence.</p>

        <p>the clown Dr Fauci - Doomer ðŸ¤¡ and many others already said that even after the vaccine is deployed to everyone, they will keep implementing lockdowns, masks and social distancing all that BS. But I get your point and I also have some faith people will get tired. although is sad that the vaccine will be almost mandatory. is nice to be optimistic, but those motherfuckers are very evil.</p>

        <p>Not to be a downer but having experienced the second lockdown in Melbourne this was not the case at all. Initially in July they said it would be another 6 weeks lockdown and the restrictions were similar to those in place in March, of course people didn't care as much the second time so they punished us hard with "Stage 4 restrictions" starting in August. From the start of August until the end of October we could not visit anyone, were confined to our homes 23 hours a day (one hour outside permitted for exercise/shopping only), could only go out to the pharmacy or supermarket, had a curfew from 8pm to 5am, and had mandatory masks EVERYWHERE (even if you were on your own) with the threat of a hefty fine if you didn't wear one. A small group of people protested but those were quickly put down with force. Most people started to get disgruntled but then we reached zero cases and are now in some kind of new normal mode and people are just so happy to be able to see family and friends again that they've completely forgotten about the hell we went through and are 100% supportive of what happened.</p>

        <p>People are ruled by fear.</p>
<p>What drives people to comply with these destructive measures is the fear that everything they have will be taken from them if they fail to comply.</p>
<p>At the same time, fear is also what eventually drives non-compliance: The fear that, if they continue complying, theyâ€™ll be left with nothing anyway.</p>
<p>Once people reach the stage where they realize they stand to lose everything either way, noncompliance accelerates dramatically.</p>
<p>The deciding factor for how long that takes seems to be how much cash they had on hand when all of this startedâ€”the people who had lots of cash and had jobs that werenâ€™t disrupted are the core of the obedient. The people who didnâ€™t have much to start with, and those whoâ€™ve lost their jobs due to the draconian diktats, are the core of the non-compliant.</p>
<p>Given how economically destructive these measures have been, the ranks of the non-compliant will swell with time. The only problem is that itâ€™s taking too many people too long to see the economic reality.</p>

        <p>Very good news. It is very difficult for a new party to make it into parliament in Romania. The minimum you need to enter is 5% and new parties almost never achieve this. If they would have only got the 5%, that would have been huge, 9% is amazing. To put it into perspective,the largest party only got 29% of the vote. I will also note that the 2 largest parties  have smaller satellites parties that didnâ€™t make the 5 %, all because of this victory. Now the ruling party will only narrowly form a fragile coalition government, they already lost support and will continue to do so. This party will only be going up. Next election, there will be no government without this party.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? Lockdowns donâ€™t work?? Of course they do. You canâ€™t spread a virus if youâ€™re not meeting other people... </p>
<p>We can talk about the complications of a lockdown, and if itâ€™s worth it. But they do reduce the number of covid cases.</p>

        <p>In Latin America, there was an OPPOSITE relationship between the rigidity of lockdowns and cases and deaths per capita. The most strict, Argentina and Peru, are the worst off.</p>
<p>The lax Brazil of the "small flu" is better off than Spain that fined people for walking  the street.</p>
<p>Counterintuitive.</p>

        <p>Based on what evidence? I've seen 21 papers that have looked for an association between infection rates and lockdowns, and failed to find one with statistical significance.</p>
