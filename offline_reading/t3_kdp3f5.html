    <strong>“We don’t know the long-term effects of COVID yet! It hasn’t been around long enough!” but “Get the vaccine! There are no long-term side effects! Trust the science!”</strong>
    <p><p>The amount of inconsistency in beliefs among people who want mandatory vaccinations is unreal. This may be the most egregious example yet. </p>
<p>As each day passes, I’m starting to think more and more that people who say the things in the title might actually be NPCs or robots—they seemingly have no capacity for critical thought.</p></p>

        <p>The  logical inconsistencies were baked in from the start. Pointing them out to NPCs simply causes a meltdown:</p>
<p>"If my chances of dying of the 'Rona are less than the effectiveness rate of the vaccine, what's the point of taking it?"</p>
<p><em>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</em></p>
<p>"If the vaccine doesn't get rid of the requirements for social distancing, lockdowns, and masks, what's the point of taking it?"</p>
<p><em>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</em></p>
<p>"If airlines, theatres, pubs, hotels etc haven't asked in the past for proof of vaccination for far more deadly diseases like TB, Rubella, and Yellow Fever, why are they insisting on it for the 'Rona?"</p>
<p><em>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</em></p>
<p>"If the vaccine is so safe, why have all the pharma companies demanded legal immunity from lawsuits?"</p>
<p><em>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</em></p>
<p>By this point, the NPCs are in the fetal position, sucking their thumbs, yelling "Nyah Nyah Nyah!!!!! I can't hear you!!!"</p>

        <p>lol! its not inconsistency. </p>
<p>you have to look past the covid crazy's bullshit and understand what they're really saying. </p>
<p>they're not robots. we shouldn't trivialize them because they're dangerous. </p>
<p>. they just act out of self preservation. they're actually very manipulative and conniving. </p>
<p>they use whatever means necessary of lies and subterfuge to try to control their environment. </p>
<p>Trying to prevent you from living your life so they can feel safe:  we don't know the long term effects of covid! wear your mask! stay at home! </p>
<p>Trying to force you to get a vaccine so they can feel safe: who cares about long term effects! its had trials! that means its safe!  </p>
<p>they are actually very consistent. its just that their consistency is based on a need for self preservation and control, not critic thought</p>

        <p>Maybe you can help me understand.   Do you see yourself as part of a select club of rational thinkers,  who can see the truth, that's why this small sub and yourself tend to disagree with the majority?</p>

        <p>There is frequent and repeated history of the majority bandwagon missing the mark. There are also plenty of cases of the majority being right. It may or may not be much better than a coin flip, but either way "everyone says so" isn't a convincing argument.  Trendy is the antithesis of science.</p>

        <p>I am a bit upset with the “change” of the executive branch of a democratic system suddenly has the power to order you to stay in your home for months and that you will be unable to work for months. Certainly no one person should have that much power, and I’m not entirely convinced even legislatures should have that much power.</p>

<p>To me it means drive through food, lots of delivery,  grocery shopping, long drives on the weekends, parks.  Wear a mask indoors in public and that's pretty much it.  Are other people trapped inside their homes, unable to leave?</p>

<p>This is really the crux of the issue. That's what lockdowns mean to you, and to the majority of people who have no issue with them. To others they mean going bankrupt/destitute, losing their jobs/businesses they've dedicated their lives to, losing their entire social support system, losing their access to in-person education and falling behind because remote-learning is in many cases worse than nothing, losing their hobbies and their forms of expression and relaxation, becoming depressed/suicidal, not having access to vital healthcare and becoming sicker, the economy crashing and their possibility of being financially stable rapidly dwindling etc etc etc. The list could go on for days, literally. Not to mention the people who were already in crippling poverty who have no car and no way to pay for all that lovely delivery food.</p>
<p>I believe COVID exists. I believe it's deadly, albeit only really to the elderly and medically vulnerable. If lockdowns had no negative effects, I'd say let's do them until every virus that's ever existed was eradicated! But they have hundreds of incredibly negative effects. That's why we don't do them when there's a bad flu season (like the one in 2018). Sure it would save lives, but it would also destroy so many things.</p>
<p>Lockdowns may be fine for you, and that's great (genuinely). They are destroying the lives of millions of others.</p>

        <p>Probably the point where these became mandates enforced by law enforcement under the threat of force. Maybe at the point where my governor shut down small businesses so that they go bankrupt while helping billion dollar companies. Perhaps when part of their "mitigation" efforts in my state was to send covid patients to nursing homes AKA a group of people who have an ACTUAL non-zero risk of death. The line may also have been drawn when it became obvious that these measures weren't meant to do anything but impose governmental control over the most simple actions that human beings can take. Or when the politicians who pretend to care the most are the same ones breaking their own made-up rules. Some people drew the line when we were told "two weeks of shutdown ONLY to flatten the curve" and it became "shutdown for the year" then "shutdown until the vaccine" then "shutdown until the vaccine is given to absolutely 100% of people" which lead to now which is "shutdown even after the vaccine because we LOVE the power and control we have.</p>
<p>That's just a few examples of where my lines could have been drawn. A big thing for me is researching everything and not just listening to MSM-approved Covid propaganda. Thanks for listening and asking questions despite your somewhat secretive verbiage and tone at times. I appreciate it. Btw we are being asked to wear masks and not travel or be allowed to act like human beings until far after the vaccine currently. You might've missed the latest weekly governmental goalpost shifting, though. You should be able to see that this is 1% about health and safety but 99% about seizing power from the people and conditioning us to not question anything or be subject to being labeled as a "conspiracy theorist". C'mon man.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the consideration response.  I apologize for my tone, humorous and playful was my intent, I probably hit closer to patronizing and condescending is usually where I land.  I'll give it some thought,  my point of view definately needed expanding.</p>

        <p>Of course. I am sorry i definitely took your tone the wrong way. Thanks for explaining it so i understand. Also thank you for being genuine and listening to what i had to say. As for your last sentence, we ALL need to expand our points of view, especially regarding serious topics. If you have any questions or concerns about my beliefs I'd be more than happy to have a conversation.</p>

        <p>I went out to a resteraunt or some form of indoor entertainment about once a week, commuted to work and out out often for lunch. Went to the zoo, a couple renn faires in the early spring. </p>
<p>When things changed my small group of friends and I changed habits.  I began playing more disc golf again, started taking nature pics and visiting local wild life preserves and some more remote parks and gardens. I also started reading about pandemics and infectious diseases, to get an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>That lead me to set my expectations such that I believed early on that these restrictions would last roughly about 18 months,  very similar in nature to a deep recession. I still doubt I will be able to get a vaccine before June.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is, people think plague or pandemic and think Hollywood zombie flick or the stand, when in reality it's still day to day survival over the long haul.  I completely get about how what is normal now sucks compared to what was, but don't think it will be this way forever.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I missed any questions.</p>

<p>It could end tomorrow, if enough people said so. </p>
<p>There would be newspaper headlines for the pressure to the hospitals for a couple of weeks, and probably reports for an uptick of deaths among the elderly, <em>not much different that what we get to hear now anyway</em>. Barely anyone would notice in day-to-day life that there's still a respiratory virus going around, except for those who get it and have to stay at home for a week. The epidemic will end before the spring, with no closed schools, no closed restaurants, no closed businesses, no masks, no vaccines.</p>

        <p>Not any different than what we are seeing anyway. Practically zero difference. Now, 2000 people with Covid-19 are dying daily in the USA, maybe ten times more in the world. This will continue for at least two-three months more, before it slows down significantly. I don't see it getting worse in the long run whatever we do. Most countries have substantial parts of the population who are already immune, so the faster the virus spread the faster it will quench itself.</p>

        <p>There's a ton of data, you just have to be careful with the quality.  Test counts are incredibly noisy (see covidtrackingproject for state-by-state variations and issues, and how they vary month to month), death determination is iffy thanks to the cdc note from march 24, and still inconsistent by state or country.  Cleaning this data is a monumental task that not a single study I've read has attempted.  They accept the numbers and go from there.</p>
<p>There are also orders of magnitude more covid studies than, say, normal flu studies, and not all of them are good.  Possibly most aren't.  It's REALLY hard to say, to peel apart the data handling process, stats code in r or python if available, analytical methods, sampling biases, etc.  That's part of the point of peer review, but some of these papers were pushed through VERY quickly and it's hard to say how much was caught.</p>
<p>Essentially, there is a ton of noise, and it makes all of these discussions more difficult.</p>

People have different reasoning for being on this sub. </p>
<p>My personal standpoint is not one of being "correct" or "more rational" than the average Covidian although I did take a look at the statistics and decided covid is a risk I am willing to live. </p>
<p>I was pointing out that the mechanism by which Covidians participate in cognitive dissonance is based of a rabid need for self preservation.</p>
<p>As for your little spiel... </p>
<p>society is always going to have people who rebel against the majority. Whether I am correct or not is irrelevant. </p>
<p>Whether being cautious and listening to authority is more rational than questioning authority is also irrelevant.</p>

<p>everyone has a superiority complex. everyone thinks they have the keys. thats how we make decisions as humans.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the explanation.  I completely agree that people haven't incorporated "pandemic " into their internal threat matrix and are acting from a place of hyper alertness.</p>
<p>I guess I've seen a lot of hate on masks, restrictions etc, and the precautions seem to follow pretty well with my reading on infectious disease (e.g. Michael Osterholm) and I'm trying hard to understand the point of view that to me seems more concerned with denial and the utility value of truth.</p>

        <p>both sides are in denial of truth because humans aren't good at dealing with truth. we deal with information and then make absolutist decisions. </p>
<p>this sub posts more objective truth than most. you'll find page after page of statistics, studies, and figures. </p>
<p>so saying this is an anti truth stance or sub is not really in line with what I have seen. </p>
<p>you're also operating under the assumption that "truth" is more important to people than personal convictions. </p>
<p>Being pro Covid does not mean you have more of the truth either.</p>
<p>It usually just means you're better at following directions and have more trust in authority figures. </p>
<p>Again you're operating from an assumption that the average Covidian sat down with some facts and statistics and decided this was the right choice to make for themselves and their families. </p>
<p>No. they did not. They turned on the news one day and heard of a global pandemic. Then their government said wear a mask and stop gathering and they did it. </p>
<p>Pandemic response is not an informed choice for most people. </p>
<p>AntiCovids are more likely to seek out information just because they're less likely to trust authorities. It doesn't imply intelligence necessarily but it also doesn't imply lack of intelligence</p>
