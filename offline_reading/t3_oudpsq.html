        <p>Today on a radio talkshow they were having people call in to speak about their opinions on the vaccine. An older man was put on the line and he said something along the lines of this... (And I'm not exaggerating)</p>
<p>"Everyone in my family is vaccinated. My friends are. We are sick and tired of having to tolerate and coerce these anti-vaxxers into getting the shot. Look at what France did and how Macron is handling it - that is what WE need. There must be mandates. They did the same thing with the smallpox vaccine and this is no difference, we may need to take that approach again".</p>
<p>The radio hosts didn't even flinch or really find it that outrageous. Knowing that this type of sentiment is now being normalized is the most terrifying thing.</p>
<p>Any sane and logical person would view this man as an uneducated paranoid FUCKING MENTAL CASE. Did he forget that he can still get Covid? Did he forget that he can still SPREAD IT? Did he forget that if his system suppresses the symptoms that he is now willingly becoming asymptomatic and spreading it to others - what anti-maskers were crucified for in the past (Despite not even being sick)?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter to them. I keep writing this because it's the way I feel but we are entering true simulation territory. The behavior is so erratic and blindingly sequacious that it borders on black comedy. It's terrifying because you cannot reason with these masses that demand others get the jab. They have no interest in reasoning.</p>
<p>Rough times ahead.</p>

        <p>Being said on msm no supermarket for the unvaccinated. That's the same as saying we are ok with you starving to death. Especially for older ppl who can't go hunt or fish.</p>
