    <strong>Seeing a lot more people joining our side lately. Have any NNN members ever defected to the other side?</strong>
    <p><p>I can recall exactly <em>one</em> post from a guy absolutely ages ago claiming he was a former NNN member who came to see "the error of his ways", but the funny thing was he'd never actually posted here if my memory serves correct. Maybe one comment a week before his post? Highly dubious anyway and it hardly stacks up against the numerous posts from people coming here lately admitting they were wrong/brainwashed and actually <em>apologizing</em> to us. That's right, people on the internet actually admitted they were wrong and said sorry! Fuck Covid, THAT is unprecedented. </p>
<p>Point is once you're awake, that's it. No going back. You can see the absolute lunacy frothing from the other side's (masked) mouths and keyboards. It's hard to argue against freedom (though the doomers give it their best shot). Censorship, coercion and threats are only going to get you so far. People <em>will</em> get fed up and stand against it. The only thing I could see that would drive someone to the other side is if someone close to them died of (read: WITH) Covid; so how come we're not seeing that more often?</p>
<p>It's fucking funny watching the anti-NNN subs implode and start eating each other as more and more of their side and other mainline subreddits slowly come around to our way of thinking. I've made the connection before but it reminds me of how during the French Revolution they all started turning on each other for being too radical/not radical enough.

        <p>Dude, your entire account is devoted to this sub and stuff like it. This kinda weird obsession kinda stops people from wanting to hear your side.</p>
