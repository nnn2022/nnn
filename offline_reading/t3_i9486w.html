    <strong>I'm not responsible for the health of a complete stranger.</strong>
    <p><p>This might come off as heartless and selfish, and I apologize if it does, but I need to get this off my chest. I'm tired of being told that everyone else's health is my responsibility all of a sudden, meaning I have to stop living my life the way I choose just because someone's obese, diabetic grandma who smokes two packs a day and drinks like a fish might get coronavirus. Some random stranger's health is not my job to worry about. I don't expect random strangers to worry about my health. Their health is their responsibility and my health is my responsibility. Now obviously I wash my hands, sneeze and cough into my elbow, keep a reasonable distance from others, and stay home if I'm actively sick, but I feel that's reasonable enough. Those are just simple things that actually prevent illness and are just common courtesy. I do not like the government (and idiotic virtue signaling doomers) telling me how I have to live my life, and telling me what to do with my body. That is where I have a problem. I'm fine with someone choosing to wear a mask, I'm fine with businesses choosing to mandate masks, but I have a problem when the government mandates them and I'm called a selfish murderer when I choose not to wear one. In fact, I think all the doomers are selfish telling us that we have to give up our freedoms and way of life because they're afraid of a virus.</p>
<p>I want to actually go to school like a normal person, I don't want to attend New Normal High School. I want to do theater at my school and perform in front of a live audience. I want to play in the band at my school's football games. I want homecoming, prom, pep rallies, and all the other fun school events. I want to do mock trial and participate in my drawing club. I want to hang out with my friends face to face. I want to continue seeing my therapist in person, and not do appointments on the phone because in person appointments help me more. I don't want to live the rest of my life locked in my home in fear because I might be carrying a disease and I might spread it. I refuse to treat every human being like they are walking disease vectors. I want to do frivolous "non essential" things such as going shopping, eating inside a restaurant, getting my hair and nails done, seeing a movie or live production in a theater, and ride rides at amusement parks and boardwalks. I want to do all those things without pointless security theater, and without being deemed selfish for doing them. I can't, unfortunately, because apparently if I spread the virus to a stranger, I'm the worst person in the world. I might seem like a horrible person for wanting a normal life, but honestly, I don't care at this point. People need to start taking personal responsibility and stop making society cater to them. I would never dream of asking complete strangers to stop living their lives just so I won't get sick, because that would be selfish of me. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long rant, but I'm just tired of all the virtue signaling. I'm tired of my life and mental health being tanked because people are scared they might get sick. I'm tired of being told what to do with my life and my body. I just want to live my life the way I want without having to apologize for it. People need to be responsible for themselves and not worry about what others are doing. If they're scared or they're at risk, then they should stay home. Let the rest of us move on with our lives and make our own choices, not have the government decide for us. It's my life, I'll live it how I choose. I don't care if that sounds selfish, but a virus and the health of unhealthy strangers is not one of my top priorities.</p></p>

        <p>it's not just you, kiddo, it's all of us. everyone is exhausted. everyone is miserable.</p>
<p>there's a reason human civilization has never locked down an entire population on house arrest and shut down an economy for a disease - because we knew we would destroy society as we know it. this kind of "living" is wholly incompatible with human life. it's impractical, inefficient, uncomfortable, expensive, disappointing, and ultimately, self-defeating. </p>
<p><strong>this is not a life worth living or enjoying.</strong></p>
<p>our brains are not wired to function like this. we're supposed to identify the risk, assess it, figure out how to manage it, and move the eff on with our lives. our brains are overwhelmed right now with data. our brains don't know how to cope with this new way of life because it's unnatural. that's why we are tired, that's why we are angry, that's why we are confused. it's why we're lashing out at each other because of the unnecessary uncertainty.</p>
<p>strangely enough, i think this whole thing is a referendum on death, and the world - especially Americans - don't know how to reconcile that. we used to know how to live with and cope with and accept death, and that's why we didn't panic during other pandemics. now we want to live forever, we've forgotten that death comes for us all.</p>
<p>our mothers give birth to us - they give us life, but they also give us death. we all must die someday. it's selfish, isn't it, to have children, knowing that one day they'll die too? guess what - i'm going to die someday, my mother gave birth to me and knew i would die, my grandmother bore four children and knew each of them would die, and my great-grandmother, on and on and on, back back back into the annals of humankind, and yet we keep having babies anyway. i still desperately want to bring children into this world, even though they're just going to die anyway. that's life!</p>
<p><strong>because life is for the living.</strong></p>
<p>i'm not going to sit here in my house hiding away from everyone and everything i love, worrying about dying, or killing someone else by giving them a virus. if we think like that, we will be unable to function. our brains are trying to shut this down because they know we're seeding our own destruction. i'm not going to worry about the myriad of ways i could die, or my loved ones could die, or how guy at deli is going to die. </p>
<p>right now i want to live - i don't know what happens when we die, but no one has ever come back and told us how terrible it is. i don't remember what it was like before i was born, i don't think i'm going to know what it's like when i'm dead. i can't worry about it. i know that i don't want to live forever, because the people i love now - my husband, my parents, my brother, my sisters-in-law, my in-laws, my beautiful friends, my colleagues, my neighbors - they won't be here forever. i don't know when i will ever see them again, so i want to enjoy them now, while we're alive. i don't want to live forever in this world without the people i love the most. i can't take them with me, all we have is now. we don't know how much time we have, so don't waste any of it.</p>
<p>friend, i really hope that you get back to the business of living your young, beautiful life - you have so much potential, i hope that you have a lot of time. i hope that you get to live your life on your terms soon.</p>

<p>The world has never come to a halt like it has now for some "virus" AKA a hoax. The mortality rate is around 0.0009% and almost non existent in children, but let's keep the schools closed right? Let's take their childhood away, FUCKING RIDICOKOUS</p>

        <p>Agree about the mortality rare and hoax status. However, based on what kids will be learning in school, they are probably better off not going at this point.</p>

<p>Might be unpopular to say, but I honestly think the decline of religion has a lot to do with this. As someone that left the Mormon church of her birth, I have my issues with religion, but you can't deny that having the safety and comfort of knowing who you are, where you came from, and where you're going has largely helped and comforted people through scary things such as death. Of course, nobody wants to die, and no sane, mentally healthy person purposely does things to bring about death, but GET REAL, people! We can't prevent it. And if you're scared shitless of it, which is understandable, then maybe adopting some sort of spiritual belief system would help. All I know for sure is that there is a difference between being alive and actually living, and right now our society is enacting nothing more than a pale imitation of the latter.</p>

        <p>Ya I agree actually many religious people are less scared about death cause they know death isn’t final. I’m not religious but I definitely think this plays a role. </p>
<p>I actually think that’s one of the key roles of religion in our society. Literally no society could function if everyone was worried about dying all the time. Religion solves this problem for the vast majority of people. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, the most religious person I know gives the least shits about covid. Literally nothing in his life has changed other than he has to turn on a video feed on Sunday instead of taking his family to church. On the other hand, all the ultra pro lockdown Doomers I know are somewhat religious but also think they understand science, and most of them I think would give science the benefit of the doubt if push came to shove. </p>
<p>I would love to see statistics about religiousness/spirituality vs support of lockdowns. I know there are a lot of atheists like me on this sub, so I’m not sure if there is a clear effect here or not. There has to be some connection though.</p>

        <p>Such an interesting point about religion. It might partially explain why so many right wingers are not afraid of the pandemic. For my part, I grew up a militant atheist, although I don't think I ever feared death all that much. At 24 I had an intense spontaneous spiritual experience that was like an after-death/return-from-death journey, past-life regression and so much more all rolled into one. It completely blew apart so much of what I thought was real and gave me a whole different worldview with the understanding that the whole universe was actually alive and intelligent and hella smarter than just the simple human brain. Death was just something that I experienced as a game, a transition. I've done some psychedelics since which have been awesome too, but none have approached the level of that first trip which I now realize could have been precipitated by a surge of endogenous DMT lol. Anyway... psychedelics available to everyone would be just lovely right about now.</p>

        <p>It's not actually true though, because studies show that atheists are among those least fearful and most accepting of death. The very religious are up there with them too, but <em>very</em> religious and not just religious. </p>
<p>It's actually the people I know who are most religious that are most hysterical about this and want everything shut down. That's the thing about anecdotes, they're anecdotes I guess.</p>

        <p>I would gather that it also has to do with not living on or near a lot of farms.</p>
<p>Farms are where your raise animals for slaughter, or put animals down if they're no longer of use to you - even the pets you keep around for leisure.</p>
<p>Hell, I'm a vegetarian, and I've had to explain multiple times that I'm fine with other people not being a vegetarian since any given cow is going to die whether or not I'm inclined to eat it.  </p>
<p>It's sad to see people die, but there's a difference between preventing death and believing you can stop it altogether.</p>

        <p>Beautiful strawman. Tell me how familiar you are with the Bubonic Plague vs. the Antonine Plague? Rome isolated cities and shut down intercity trade, and tracked cases quickly. They quarantined, and kept it from destroying the empire. Im not talking about gender equality. Im talking about 3 plagues, and the various ways we have historically dealt with them. Hell, due to medical professionals, we can handle bubous so easy now its crazy (big in the Midwest US, spread by prairie dogs). </p>

        <p>You are right, good catch. And lets see, youre on a sub that argues against medical experts, on a medical subject, and your best argument when someone shows historical evidence that current guidelines work, you bring up gender inequality, rather than any actual counterargument. </p>
<p>New Zealand was strict, and smart, and quarantined for 2 months, essentials wore masks, and BAM, single digit deaths, and can contact trace any cases to individual quarantine breakers. Clearly, this works. If we drop the theatrics (handing food to us on trays, morons using masks under their noses, concerts, big public gatherings) this could have been "The big joke of an overreaction in 2020", not "200,000+ dead Americans".</p>

        <p>let's see, i don't argue against medical experts, i simply don't understand why the pro-lockdown, pro-mask folks won't listen to the other scientists and doctors, and why their good research is being suppressed. why is it that all virology/epidemiology research prior to March 2020 no longer counts? i mean, at least pretend to be honest and curious. </p>
<p>i very much think this virus is real, and like all viruses, it is in fact deadly.  covid-19 is behaving just as a respiratory virus should and it's sort of boring and predictable. that's it, that's all i've got. all viruses can kill mammals. in fact, life has a 100% CFR.</p>
<p>this all started out as the Hammer and the Dance; which is to say "flatten the curve!" and preserve hospital capacity, not "CRUSH THE CURVE ZERO INFECTIONS!" which is wholly unreasonable and unrealistic.</p>
<p>we always knew the virus was going to kill a pre-determined number of people before we hit herd immunity or we develop a vaccine. and if you're argument is that we won't get HIT before a vaccine, or only with a vaccine, then how did we develop herd immunity to thousands of viruses before? covid-19 is just another coronavirus, not the plague. </p>
<p>alas, all we have done now is stretch out the time for those vulnerable people die. sure we can "live" below the curve, but at what cost to society?</p>
<p>New Zealand locked down for five months and they still had an outbreak. covid-19 is now endemic, it's community spread, it's not going anyway. also it's foolish to compare a country the size of the U.S. in terms of geographic size and population diversity to a very small, ethnically homogeneous island nation. please be reasonable, we weren't born yesterday.</p>
<p>masks are nothing more and nothing less than a new false god, the new state religion of science and virtue signaling. at best, they are minimally effective when worn correctly by 95% of the population. </p>
<p>this is a medieval problem - like ancient Rome, like Constantinople, like the Black Death and the Bubonic Plague - and we can solve it with modern solutions like isolating the elderly and vulnerable, and let the rest of us get on with it.i'm sure modern medicine and improved hygiene go a long way too. unfortunately, in the era of mass world travel, where we can hop on a boat or a plane or a train, our borders are never truly secure. and you know as well as i do that the Ottomans never went away; much like the Rona, they lie in wait for the peasants to venture out of the kremlin walls. but you know, the peasants fought back, and sometimes they even won.</p>
<p>i do not live in ancient Rome - i live in 21st century America. the plague ravaged Rome despite their measures - why should i react like a stupid Roman peasant and be subject to barbarian, backwards containment measures when i am a well-educated, intelligent American citizen with free will and equal rights?</p>
<p>and don't say China. China welded their citizens into apartment buildings and chucked the bodies in a heap and burned them. we will never know the truth out of China.</p>
<p>we now know how to protect and shield vulnerable populations. this should be a wake up call for Americans and Europeans to take better care of themselves - diet, exercise, vitamin D, sleeping habits - in order to reduce the rate of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and overall poor health.</p>
<p>it's also time for us to take a real good hard look at mortality - none of us will live forever. the older we get, the harder it is for our bodies to keep up; the immune system will start to fail regardless with age. perhaps we shouldn't all try to live to be 100 y/o anymore, considering how poor the quality of life seems to be after age 80. i think i should be able to accomplish quite a lot of things by the age of 80.</p>
<p>we cannot stop the march of time as it takes its toll on our minds - we cannot stop or reverse dementia or Alzheimer's. do you know what it is like to watch someone you love die with Alzheimer's? it's breaking my heart now to think of it, and to think that i might die the same way. in a cold bed, completely out of my mind, unable to communicate my wishes or last words, unable to recognize my loved ones, trapped in a failing body with a crazed mind. do you know what that's like, alpha, and to know it's waiting for you in 50 years?</p>
<p>vaccines will not save us forever; modern medicine and treatments can only prolong life - life, not joy, just your blood pumping through the veins. our bones will grow brittle, our skin will become buttery and thin, our hair will grow thin and lose melanin. all the technology in the world cannot stop death. time only goes one way, and it isn't backwards.</p>
<p>the first breath you take is the last first breath you draw before you die. and we all will die someday, one way or another. nothing can stop death and nothing can save you. nothing. no one. your mother gives you life and she also gives you death. it's the same for all animals everywhere. we return to the earth to the sky to the water.</p>
<p>what good is living to be super old if everyone i love is gone and dead? what good am i if my body is weak and i am stuck in bed? what joy is there to be found in life, hooked up to a tube? i want to be with the people i love now, doing the things i love now, enjoying my life now, while i am young and healthy and beautiful, while i am in full control of my faculties and senses and limbs. while i can make love with my husband and hug my parents and smile at little babies in their strollers.</p>
<p>all of that has been gone since March 2020. this is a life largely without joy or happiness, without any of the things that make us human, that makes life worth living.</p>
<p>life is for the living, not the dead. please let me live my life fully and joyously until the last breath leaves my lungs and return to whatever awaits us on the other side.</p>
<p>i cannot worry about how i will die, or when i will die, or what it will feel like. i simply won't know. if you don't know, how do you remember? if you don't know what happens next, how can you be afraid? i don't remember being born, how bad can death be.</p>
<p>let me live my life on my own terms, and you do the same.</p>
<p>if you were to ask me if i would rather have six more months at the end of my long life, but society must stop and lockdown in order to do so, i'd say fuck off, no thank you, get busy living or get busy dying. please don't threaten me with a good time.</p>
<p>i bid you a good evening, alpha.</p>

        <p>Sorry if I'm late on this, but I think this needs to be said. Although I'm not necessarily on the same page as you I can definitely understand where you're coming from, I hate this as much as you do.</p>
<p>But what I think-- and correct me if I'm wrong-- is you need to realize that this is not permanent. From the beginning this was not meant to be permanent. You talk about how as humans we are wired to assess, manage and move on and you're absolutely right, but you're not realizing that that's exactly what we're doing. Currently were in the "management" stage, and it's taking a while, buy if you thought that this would be over in a matter of a month or two then I'm sorry but you're sorely mistaken. </p>
<p>Quarantining isnt a new concept. You made a comparison from now to previous pandemics and how they had a more laisser-faire approach but they also had many more deaths than we are currently having and lived in much less dense and less populated civilizations! </p>
<p>We're all in this together, fear is to be expected, but you also must know that this isnt permanent, that, chances are, a few years from now we'll back with friends and family, looking at this time and thinking "wow, that sure was something, but we made it". All is asked is that you watch after your neighbor and that they pass that care on.</p>

        <p>To reach 2M, the lowest threshold point of "Millions", you would need almost 3x existing deaths after the major peaks have occurred.</p>
<p>If you use a long enough timescale you'll get it, since it's going to be around forever, but not for a long time. And the deaths from poverty, untreated cancers, and suicide will vastly outpace it. Not to mention billions suffering!</p>

        <p>Of course you are tired because that's just propaganda the media pushes through. You can't be held responsible for someone else's health problems. The problem to them is your very existence. They see you now as a disease spreader, a danger to the society. That's the message by MSM and the government.</p>
<p>But the fact is the health issues originate by gov policies and the MSM for decades now. Smoking, obesity, opioids and now lockdowns, they are all due to gov guidelines and mandates. And it's just getting started. Many people don't realize smoking alone in the 20th century cost the lives of 100 million people. But in 21st century it is estimated to see the deaths of an extra 1 billion people.  I don't believe a pathogen's involvement can ever come remotely close to the damage regulations have caused.</p>

        <p>Good point. Government subsidization in a number of different sectors is a leading cause of perverse incentives across the board. And I can see where government incentives for certain products leads manufacturers to try to find novel ways to get those products into absolutely everything, which I suspect is the case with high-fructose corn syrup and similar.</p>

<p>Personal experience. About 8 years ago, I was in the hospital asking the doctors there why are they prescribing opioids to a relative of mine without follow ups? They looked the other way they were mainstream physicians. I had to send that relative to another country to get him off the addiction. And pay all kinds of money for substances and remedies which government calls pseudoscience.</p>

<p>Lockdowns are causing destruction to the economy as many businesses are prohibited to function, social problems due to isolation, house arrests, restrictions to activities and entertainment, creating mental issues etc. At the same time they show that the mainstream medical system has no scientific methods. Locking up people or treating somebody as a disease spreader is worse than what spanish inquisitors did to prisoners.</p>
<p>At the top, during the pandemic among essential businesses are drugstores, junk food outlets and tobacco/liquor stores.</p>

        <p>I definitely appreciate the sources.</p>
<p>On the first point (tobacco), the examples you showed aren't really regulation, they're just advertising gimmicks. It's essentially the same if I "suggest" that wearing a certain brand of shoe will make you a better basketball player. They're using the authority of doctors to pull you in, sure, but there's nothing governmental about a group of doctors, aside from the possibility that some of them vote.</p>
<p>On obesity, you make a very interesting point. I can't say that I think of dietary guidelines as government regulation (in the sense that I think of "regulation" as statute, or duly passed law), but once I started to think about it, I remembered as a kid how much influence those dietary guidelines (think "four food groups" or "food pyramid" for kids in the US) had on our day-to-day lives. They were essentially the entire basis for the menu in our school's cafeteria, and they were the basis of what we were taught on what to eat, when to eat and how much to eat, and you're right, they're all essentially arbitrary, guided by whichever politically-expedient "expert" the government picks to head a certain committee in a certain place at a certain time. And, of course, when the government makes a point of targeting high-fat foods, or high-sodium, or whatnot, industry picks up on that and markets a bevy of low-fat (high-carb) or low-sodium foods that fit in with the latest trend, and we become blanketed by those ads.</p>
<p>(As an aside, as a kid in the US in the 90's, I want to say that I remember being taught that popcorn was not terrible for your teeth - at least, I remember them saying popcorn, as a complex carbohydrate, was not as bad on your teeth as simple sugars were, so they advised skipping the candy in favor of popcorn, and I remember thinking as a grade school student that this was obviously bullshit, because popcorn always gets stuck in your teeth. Does anyone else remember this, or is it faulty memory on my part).</p>
<p>(Second aside - I read the article you linked from the NHS, and I thought it suggested 5 servings of fruit or vegetables per day, not necessarily 5 meals per day. One serving is generally not that large (a single apple, for instance), so getting 5 per day doesn't really require a massive buffet.)</p>
<p>Opioids are another area where I didn't see the hand of government clearly at first. I usually tend to blame the pharmaceutical companies for that, first and foremost, as little more than legally empowered drug pushers. Purdue, in particular, I remember as being aggressive in their marketing of oxycodone and their assertions of a low-addiction/low-risk profile (which were absolutely lies on their part). But in the Hirsch article you linked, there's mention of the Veterans Health Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services starting to push pain management and quality outcomes over other criteria for care rather than more meaningful and measurable goals, and again we see the effect of government influence creating perverse incentives. It's not regulation <em>per se</em>, but it absolutely carries the weight of regulation when your Medicare/Medicaid funding can be tied to your willingness to prescribe medications like opioids because patients demand opioids or because lobbyists have pushed them to the top of the preferred drug list.</p>
<p>On lockdowns, I think we agree in general. What can be destroyed in a day will take years to rebuild, and what can be destroyed in a year is more incalculable. I do worry about the economy and people's mental health (in large part because a tanking economy is going to drive people to despair, let alone the despair that comes with extended isolation). And I agree, for the most part, with the OP in this thread - you shouldn't feel <em>solely</em> responsible for the health of others. I'm in a high-risk group for COVID - I mitigate that risk by limiting contact and practicing proper hygiene. I'm generally in favor of easing or removing lockdowns, and I'm not generally in favor of <em>forcing</em> people to take action in ways they're truly uncomfortable with. I would ask, however, that while you shouldn't feel <em>responsible</em> for others' health, a little consideration might go a long way? The OP in this thread seemed to be on the right track.</p>
<p>Sorry for the length. I don't talk much, but when I get started on writing ...</p>

<p>You think these are just ads. How much documentation you want me to pull out that implicates directly the government </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446538/pdf/11211627.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446538/pdf/11211627.pdf</a></p>
<p><em>In 1958, when plaintiff lawyers H.Alva Brumfield and Melvin Belli requested that PHS scientists testify in a lawsuit brought by a smoker against R.J.Reynolds and the American Tobacco Company Surgeon General Burney would not permit them to do so.</em></p>
<p>PHS is the parent organisation of CDC. That's where it came that CDC basically supported smoking as they support pharma today. And MSM claim it's a conspiracy. Well it's all there. Gov could had step in way earlier but they didn't and they knew about it. I want to ask you who is going to pay for the damages caused by the government pretending they knew nothing about it?</p>
<p>For the diet guidelines like calories, RDA etc. You know what the government should recommend? Absolutely nothing, nothing about eating. Eating accelerates ageing that's what they should state. Fasting is the ultimate diet. Which means you should consume only what you're going to use and nothing more. And that's the minimum food intake with the maximum nutrients. You know that don't you? So how can they possibly recommend "number of meals"? </p>
<p>Pharma is linked with government. The reason is, a drug monopoly since the early 1900s. So basically there is no open medical market since then.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry</a></p>
<p><em>The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs.</em></p>
<p>And this testimonial....</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxM-134wku8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxM-134wku8</a></p>
<p><em>0:30 -&rt; Do you believe anybody who's getting funds from Merck or any of the other pharmaceutical companies should be on advisory panels that are making judgments about pharmaceuticals coming from these companies? Do you believe that's a conflict of interest?</em></p>
<p><em>0:56 -&rt; I think that is a difficult question to answer</em></p>
<p>Shows that the organization that you would think most likely to protect you from harm over diseases is actually a vaccine owner. There is a massive conflict of interest there and the leadership positions keep rotating between pharma execs, FDA and CDC leadership. </p>
<p>Opioids are controlled substances. You can't have something out of control and call it "controlled substance". And again who's going to pay for the damages now? The situation hasn't changed I assure you. Someone who has cancer can take as much oxycontin as he likes, he just signs a form and takes it. As far I understand, a controlled substance is called controlled because it is given and used in a controlled environment like in ER and never outside. These things are everywhere.</p>

<p>&rt;while you shouldn't feel <em>responsible</em> for others' health, a little consideration might go a long way? </p>
<p>I do what I can, I pass things I learn from experience. I don't think there is should be a mandate, but given respiratory issues I did recommend full-face respirators for those with problems if they are looking for mask protection. With the appropriate filters can protect 100% the wearer from air droplets. It won't help with surfaces or fluids though. Items you buy and touch, your clothes, surfaces you touch, they all can carry pathogens for extensive periods of time. With the slightest friction they float all around you. So the respirator might buy you sometime, it's not a panacea. You need to solve the underline health problems asap, especially respiratory related. To tell you the truth I don't understand why governments all these months never gave a guidance on the simplest of all matters for this type of pathogen. How-to-breath. It's ridiculous. They should teach these things in the elementary school. Don't they care? I believe guidelines come from lobbyists that's why they don't make any sense. It's just agenda.</p>

        <p>You are not selfish or heartless for feeling this way. Old, sick and immunocompromised people are nothing new. The regular flu was always deadly to those people and society went on. How many times did you see any of those people wearing masks to protect themselves during flu season in previous years?  I am really sorry you are missing out on your high school years.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I’ll protect myself and my family, wash my hands, and stay home if I start to get sick. And I’m courteous in public and don’t spit or cough on anyone. But I’m not going to worry about protecting the lady in front of me at the Walmart checkout or worry about her health and what if she’s high risk? I’m not going to care about the woman who’s complaining she doesn’t want COVID again but makes choices contrary to what she’s saying. It’s not my problem to protect the kids who ice skate with me. I’m not their parent and their parents should be making sure their kids are healthy and feel safe. </p>

        <p>I almost made a nearly identical post this morning before I was just too mentally exhausted to type it all out. I am angry and tired and exhausted and don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m 25 and want to be out enjoying my youth, meeting people, etc. Instead I am suddenly responsible for the health of every single person in the US and can’t enjoy my life anymore because of this? Whatever happened to being responsible for yourself? </p>
<p>By the time this shit ends I fear it’ll be too late for me to meet people and make a good friend base and meet hopefully the one and start a family and I’ll be alone and miserable and depressed forever. Not to mention I just don’t want to life like this much longer. It’s been 5 months, how are people still so gung ho about all this and panicked? How are people not exhausted and fatigued and saying fuck all this? Blows my mind</p>

<p>Reading this part of your comment gave me an instant mental image of a deep sea fisherman reeling in a large fish. Some people haven't succumbed to panic exhaustion because we keep seeing lulls in media coverage of COVID or at least substantial distractions. I think it gives people time to settle down a little bit, then they crank the hysterical coverage up and Gish gallop anyone who pipes up and asks critical questions. Nobody can keep up a sustained max level of fear. The media knows this and the media wants clicks. So they give you a little break, we both rest a little, and then they resume the process of reeling people in. I think that even this cannot go on forever, and some people will become more skeptical after being subjected to this. But others will just become so demoralized by it that they'll just take whatever mandates or arbitrary "public health" measures are meted out to them. Those fish will get reeled in and gaffed onto the deck.</p>

        <p>Interesting, I like this analogy a lot, seems spot on. I remember back in early June thinking how nice it was to hear about anything but covid (and then quickly got burnt out on hearing about the riots and everything). Maybe people will start waking up and realizing they’re much happier during the lulls and want that feeling to continue, but I have little faith in people</p>

        <p>I 100% agree with you. I am not responsible for other peoples health. When you filter out the facts from the fear the virus is mostly killing the elderly and immune compromised. People in those camps should have taken precautions but this virus did not warrant the insane restrictions and lock downs. I wash my hands i cover my mouth when I sneeze or cough and tend to stay home if Im ill.</p>

        <p>I just got tested yesterday as a matter of course.  Boyfriend was exposed, but he's also been tested and hasn't gotten results yet.  </p>
<p>Both of us feel fine.  We'll both quarantine if we need to, just to keep social peace (we can both work from home).  Other than that, we go out and have a good time because we both want to live.  </p>
<p>When he first told me he was exposed (the person who tested positive AND my boyfriend were both wearing masks at the time!), he apologized profusely.</p>
<p>I told him: being with him carries a certain amount of risk, because we both want to go out and we have the potential to catch it from anywhere: the distillery, the farmer's market, wherever.  He's worth the risk of maybe getting it him, and he's said same of me, whether directly from or whether we go out and get it from somewhere we happen to go out to.  </p>
<p>But we don't want to stop living life.  And so, I think we're part of a growing population of people who are staring to realize that CV isn't going away, and life is too short to wait for some ill-defined deadline for when we'll be able to <em>live</em> again.</p>

        <p>I just watched a documentary series about the Evergreen College scandal, and directly after that watched a video by the same filmmaker in which he interviews a cult survivor. The survivor provided a "cult checklist" and as they were reading it aloud and the two were discussing the list, the hair on my neck was standing up. It gave me shivers. I don't understand how people (outside of this sub) are not seeing the parallels. It's mind blowing. <br>

        <p>Thanks for this link, very interesting and not all that surprising to me. What do you think is the corona cult's version of this: "Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s)." hahaha and immediately I realize I can answer my own question... all those horrible slogans: "flatten the curve", "together apart", "we're all in this together", "stay the fuck at home", and just simply "wear a mask".   </p>
<p>Good news, if I may be so bold, about cults, is that people do end up getting out of them...</p>

        <p>A lot of went on at Evergreen is stuff that, until recently, people thought was just something that happened in colleges.</p>
<p>Well, the truth is, colleges and fringe pop culture niches were the canary in the coalmine for the the kind of identity politics that feeds the COVID mentality.</p>
<p>That is to say, your group identity is what you should identify with.  You should fight with your tribe and be outraged about everything that could even be somewhat construed as an insult.  You are perpetually a victim and your feelings are paramount.  If you are in the in-group, you are entitled to have the defined out-group listen to your perpetual whining about how "oppressed" you are and any argument someone might make to the contrary is just privilege talking and they should be quiet and let "someone else" talk for a change.</p>
<p>CV is the victim mentality hitting the mainstream.  You are obliged to care for the underclass of potential "victims" because you're privileged.</p>
<p>I've been saying since the beginning: we are all CV, whether or not we have it.</p>

        <p>I have been on and off watching videos on narcissism for a while now as a friend's ex-girlfriend really fit the basic description, as did another friend's ex-husband, and the gaslighting and manipulation techniques feel so familiar to what is going on now but at a much larger scale. I am glad that my observations aren't dissimilar to others.</p>

        <p>When I was in marriage counseling, DR. G. Said to feel better, do better. Have you tried fixing what you broke? Settling the debts you owe? Replacing anything you stole? Were you really abused? Or where you the abuser now praying on the public for sympathy? Are you away from your abuser? Or running from $100k of debt and damages?</p>

        <p>Ironic that some "scientists" in Germany found a correlation between not wearing a mask and narcissism. Of course the title of the study gets it published more than the data these days. That is why I always counter those people with the "70 studies on mask effectiveness" that most of the studies come from the past 12 months.</p>

        <p>Wow!! That is so true!!! A few weeks after our wedding, while struggling to pay the bills, I said something to my spouse, about making sure a money thing got taken care of that day. He threw the ring, tore up photos and created fear. Followed it up with obligations. Of which I had many, and he had none. So I was an easy mark for obligation. Then the guilt trips. Why don’t I make more money, have more friends, take better care of his needs. He spent 5 years threatening divorce at least once a month. Been apart, 2 years... guess what?? No divorce papers!!! 
Fear
Obligation

        <p>&rt;Now obviously I wash my hands, sneeze and cough into my elbow, keep a reasonable distance from others, and stay home if I'm actively sick, but I feel that's reasonable enough. Those are just simple things that actually prevent illness and are just common courtesy. </p>
<p>I think we're responsible for each other to an extent. That's part of how a successful society functions. We can't just run red lights or throw lit cigarettes into dead grass, and we have to pay taxes to pay for common resources that we all need. Ect </p>
<p>The problem is some people don't realize that there is and should be a limit to how responsible we have to be for strangers and only under certain circumstances. If people's lives have to be drastically changed with their whole livelihoods and own mental health put at stake only to <em>possibly</em> save people who are already vulnerable to illnesses, then resistance is to be expected.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of what you are saying. The one thing I disagree with is the idea that people who are pro-mask/lockdown don't think there's a limit to how responsible we have to be for strangers. I think you may have overlooked some very important nuance in drawing that conclusion.</p>
<p>I think nearly everyone believes that there is a limit to that responsibility. The thing that is hard to reconcile universally is where that line of "How responsible are we for other people?" should be drawn. It can vary wildly between person to person, culture to culture. What is the "right" balance of individualism vs. collectivism? There is really no universal correct answer to that, as it depends on what someone's values are, what the ideal world looks like to them, and what are the actual practices that go towards cultivating that ideal world.</p>
<p>There are more factors that go into this besides individualism vs collectivism too, like the actual consequences of the infection. For example, if COVID-19 was significantly more serious, e.g. it was very contagious, spread rapidly, and actually killed 30% of people who got it in a matter of weeks, and those weeks were really gruesome and torturous to live through, a portion of those who are currently No New Normalers would likely be pro-mask and/or pro-lockdown in that situation.</p>
<p>&rt;If people's lives have to be drastically changed with their whole livelihoods and own mental health put at stake only to <em>possibly</em> save people who are already vulnerable to illnesses, then resistance is to be expected.</p>
<p>What you wrote here, for example, shows another difference on top of the consequences of the infection, which is the perception of the seriousness of the consequences. You show very clearly here that your perception is that it's not very serious, whereas I get the impression that a lot of mask/lockdown proponents have the perception that it's more serious than your perception.</p>
<p>These are only a few different nuances that go into different people's perspectives; there are a lot more factors that go into it and make it complex. It's not really fair to apply their desired actions to your perception, that's way too much of an oversimplification that doesn't truly understand the complexities of the risk assessment and decision making process. If they actually perceived the situation the way you do, I don't think they would be pro-mask/lockdown either. I don't think that they believe that we all have to drastically change our lives to <em>possibly</em> save <em>only vulnerable</em> people. I think they believe we all have to drastically change our lives to <em>greatly increase the chance of</em> saving themselves, their own families and friends, as well as other people in their community, and they believe that those who do die are not limited to only the vulnerable population. Or they believe that there's not enough data to know for certain that this is actually really mild, and would rather err on the safe side than to inadvertently have potential drastic consequences. Or other things.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not saying that your perception of the seriousness is wrong. I'm only bringing up that there's a lot more factors to think about when it comes to trying to understand opinions and beliefs that are different from your own.</p>

        <p>I am. Fear of nudity is insane. In a saner world we'd wear clothes for fashion, weather protection, and safety during certain activities, not because naked body = sin. And on hot days if I just want to be naked I will put a towel under my cooch when I sit in a public seat so that no one else has to sit there after and encounter the slight mess left by my juices. Those juices aren't bad or dirty or evil, they might just be kinda sticky and annoying for some random stranger to deal with.</p>
<p>As for masks, no, sorry not sorry, I am not going to default to my normal breathing, talking, singing, and facial expressions being dangerous to others. Even if it's true that there's some risk my uncovered face sheds a viral load in invisible droplets and masks reduce that risk, using this to justify mandated masking ignores the largely incalculable psychological and social damage of not being able to see each other's faces (to say nothing of the ridiculous muffling of speech we're supposed to accept as normal). I won't sneeze or cough on anyone and I'll keep my distance from anyone who wants it. And if you don't find masks to be muzzles, you're welcome to wear one.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response. I also empathize with your frustration about people who are very closed minded about nudity. I wasn't aware that this argument was widely used, so I'll be more cognizant of my wording in the future and make it clear that I'm not trying to argue. It makes sense that what I said has a similar sound to those who use it as a weapon.</p>

        <p>i am absolutely 100% okay with public nudity, thank you for asking.</p>
<p>look, if a person wants to expose their body to the elements, natural and artificial, that's their problem, not mine.</p>

        <p>Woah, there's been some misunderstanding here. I'm okay with public nudity too, I'm actually a nudist, I am just not sure how many people who would fight for mask freedom would also fight for nudity freedom if such a movement gained traction. I'd be pretty disappointed if most wouldn't.</p>
<p>I'm also fascinated that my word choice of expressing curiosity has been interpreted to have a tone of combativeness.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm curious, are you okay with public nudity?</p>
<p>I'm a tub of vaseline from running outside in my underwear (runner's rash is a thing and it's a real energy drain to have the girls flapping around a lot).</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that I avoid wearing underwear if I can absolutely help it.  That's not sexual.  I don't do it to be freaky.   I just like a little bit of freedom every now and again.  </p>
<p>I'd probably be walking around naked all the time if I didn't think I'd get harassed over it.</p>
<p>That said, I wouldn't have a problem with it if nobody else wanted to do that.  You do you, boo.</p>

<p>This is absolutely normal, though.</p>
<p>Social media has been weird in that we can collect hundreds of "friends", but really, how many of those people, if you could, would you be able to maintain meaningful relationships with.</p>
<p>That's why it's unhealthy to expect people to care about <em>everyone</em> else.  Because <strong>it's absolutely god damned impossible</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p>I agree! I can’t tell you how angry I get with people that criticize others who have lost their jobs during the lockdowns. The criticizers literally will say that the newly unemployed are selfish, when in reality these unemployed really want to work to take care of themselves and not burden anyone else—they’re hardly selfish.</p>

<p>I get so angry when I hear people say “it’s just money.” No! It’s not just money. It’s their livelihood, their blood, sweat, and tears, their life’s work at trying to establish something and it’s a loss to our community. </p>

        <p>it reminds me of the faux tough guys and the faux activists. The people who actually care about something will do something. Fake tough guys talk and never fight. fake activists talk about how this and that will solve blm/climate change/etc. but never try to vote for people who will change it or try to get petitions signed or really do much to solve it.

        <p>So fucking ridiculous that I should be expected to totally change the way I live just on the chance that I <em>might</em> be carrying a virus that I <em>might</em> happen to infect someone I come into contact with, who <em>might</em> end up seriously sick or dead from. If we operate according to this logic in all facets of our life, what CAN we do? Seriously, what the hell could we do besides sit in our bedrooms and stare at the wall every day?</p>
<p>Just like you, I practice basic hygiene habits. I wash my hands religiously, cover my coughs and sneezes, and stay away from others when I'm sick. But then again, I was doing all that shit well before covid hit...who the hell <em>wasn't?</em> I've also never shared straws, food, utensils, etc. Forcing me to do anything more than that is tyranny.</p>

<p>Long ago when I was still in elementary school, we had to read a book entitled <em>Be a Perfect Person in Just Three Days!</em> It's about a young boy who wants to better himself, so he enrolls in this mysterious course to become a 'perfect' person. By the end of the course, you learn that being a perfect person consists of doing nothing but going to the bathroom and drinking weak tea while wearing a stalk of broccoli around your neck. Naturally, the boy comes to realize that being perfect is a load of horseshit.</p>
<p>When I see people wearing masks today, I think of the boy from that story, wearing a stalk of broccoli around his neck in a desperate attempt to be perfect.</p>

        <p>I was just talking to my dad about this this morning. My parents raised me to understand that absolutely everything I do or don’t do in life is my responsibility and mine alone. It’s not someone else’s job to ensure I have a good, fulfilling life and it’s not my job to ensure that of anyone else. It is not my job to keep someone else healthy. It is not my responsibility to toss my life in the trash so that a stranger feels “safer” in a world that is always sitting on the brink of being removed from existence by something extraterrestrial like the sun exploding or something to that effect. No day is promised. I’m tired of being forced to promise another day to someone else at the expense of all I hold dear. Fuck that. This is exhausting. I have never loathed the media more than I do now. I would gleefully celebrate their demise and at this point if civilization reverted to a time without the internet, I would celebrate that too.</p>

        <p>I am 32 years old, and don't really know any teenagers, but my heart has been breaking knowing how rough this must be for you guys, and your post confirms it. Thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry for your pain and I wish there was more I could do. For my part, I've hated lockdown since the beginning in March, but I know it would've been much harder on me if it had happened when I was younger. I'm more introverted now, but when I was in high school, theatre and music were the centre of my world. My gaggle of friends was the centre of my world. I just can't imagine having those years of sleepovers, beach parties, group cuddles, laughter, rehearsals, performances, creativity in community, be replaced by the desolate black hole of "safety first, kids!" and "together alone" BS we're all supposed to endure now.</p>
<p>Please know that your desire to live a life of pleasure, intimacy, and autonomy are your *birthright*. You do not need scientific proof or government permission to know that these things are absolute. You want these things because there is no other way or reason to live. I'm sorry you're growing up at a time when so many people are so damn afraid to live, when we are suddenly being held hostage to ancient and irrepressible functions of biology, when interpretations of science have been twisted to enact such massive control. Science, which should be a tool for ongoing discovery, not a fundamentalist religion overlaying all of reality.</p>
<p>I have long thought we already live in a pretty intensely controlling society but I never thought it would get this bad. It's been a surreal dystopian shock. What a horrid mistake for people to be so terrified of their own and each other's bodies, when the truth is that we need each other's bodies not just to thrive, but even to survive. Viruses in the endlessly mutating trillions will be a part of us forever and by disowning intrinsic parts of ourselves we will forever be at war and disease with ourselves. The freedom to socialize (which includes the freedom to isolate!) is NOT some sort of non-essential reward we can have after we have figured out how to conquer disease and death, nor is it some sort of dangerous impediment to survival. No, it is the only way out of suffering. We are nothing without each other, and surviving is not worth it without quality of life. You don't need a shred of science to validate this, you just KNOW this intuitively, with every cell of your body. And hopefully it is something all humanity will come to realize.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you're right, it's not your job to cater to other people's fears. I encourage you to keep feeling and expressing all your grief, rage, sadness, hopelessness. Your feelings are valid, they are necessary medicine. You don't have to let your boundaries be violated, and you don't have to accept an iota of control from someone else.</p>
<p>When you can show compassion, of course, that can certainly help relax others and create bridges of dialogue. When you can, try to take in the mindset of the fearful, controlling masses as a part of yourself... I believe that by empathizing with them, even if you don't agree with their worldview, you can at least realize where they're coming from, and then see how you can help and where they may even teach you something. For instance, I believe that part of what drives the neighbourhood nags is that so many have been conditioned into believing that squashing down pleasure to appease someone else makes you good, no matter what the situation. Getting a job you hate just so you can say you are "financially secure"? Good! Not visiting your friends even though you'd like to, but you've been told that you should forgo your in-the-moment happiness just in case some virus that you unintentionally carry gets out and potentially hurts someone else? Good! Deciding that you want to do something fun and you shouldn't be held responsible for viruses inside you that get out and potentially hurt someone else? Bad!</p>
<p>This got way longer than I initially intended, but I hope it was helpful to you, and I would love to hear your thoughts in response. I hope you have at least one person locally that you can see in person who is on the same wavelength you are. I know it has been invaluable to me to have that one friend myself. I have found this subreddit and /r/lockdownskepticism very therapeutic as well.</p>
<p>A few more resources:</p>
<p>I suggest the work of Kelly Brogan, an MD with some revolutionary ideas on health care. While I don't jive with everything she has to say and she's a bit too deep into conspiracy theories for my taste, she has many fantastic, grounded essays on health sovereignty and empowerment you may find illuminating.</p>
<p>This recent essay by Charles Eisenstein, one of the most heartfelt writers and speakers I have ever encountered:  <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/numb/">https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/numb/</a> In it he discusses a high school student's short film (link to that inside as well) which explores the feelings of lockdown isolation. I highly recommend all of Charles' work.</p>
<p>Finally, this hour-long talk (<a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/cnrZwASbBntH/">https://www.bitchute.com/video/cnrZwASbBntH/</a>) gave me so many desperately needed corona laughs. He puts the whole last few months into a perspective I find so refreshing and reasonable that I am working up the nerve to share with everyone I know.</p>

<p>Living like this however for such a minuscule risk of death - is not worth it. I want to live my life free and full even if I die before I am 40, or live til I'm 90. We are taking away freedoms for... what, exactly?</p>

        <p>I have a congenital heart defect, and I share the same sentiment as you. Other than my heart defect, I'm pretty healthy otherwise; I eat as healthy as I can and I exercise relatively often. My health isn't a stranger's responsibility, and I won't blame another person if I get sick. Also, my heart condition is not a reason for me to live in fear; it's a reason to go and live my life to the fullest and have fun. I refuse to stop living my life because someone is scared of a virus.</p>

        <p>Because of the cardiac after-effects this virus has on those who <strong>don't</strong> die, you should definitely wear a mask.<br>

<p>Masks don't mean you have to feel fear or stop living your life, it's just two loops you hook around your ears. Don't do it for others, do it for future you, who has 15x more years to live than just the 4 years of high school.</p>

        <p>It should just work both ways. The government should start mandating diet and exercise for the obese. Mandatory sentencing to rehab for alcoholics and severe smokers. If my liberty/pursuit of happiness needs to be encroached because you deliberately made yourself vulnerable to disease than its also up to the government to protect my liberty/pursuit of happiness by imposing health measures on you to prevent that vulnerability.</p>

        <p>It sounds like your parents raised you right.  My guess is that this will all be history by January, and hopefully sooner.  <br>
Just remember to ALWAYS vet whoever is running for office, and vote as soon as you are allowed (for people who believe that the entire Constitution is valid).  For may years, voters were not paying attention to our school boards and local governments, and this is the result. Now we know better.</p>

        <p>I am in my 20s and my heart especially breaks for those for children, teenagers, and those in university.  Childhood is so brief and those school years are precious, spending every day with your friends, doing all the special things that come each school year.</p>
<p>See, I know the pain of missing out on some of these moments that you can never get back having been hit by a car in my final year of primary school and missing so much, then getting sick part way in high school and missing all these memories, events, traditions I can never experience. I felt so <em>cheated</em> missing out on those moments, but it was beyond anyone's control. It was not the result of deliberate choices made by others, but that's what is facing kids today. Adults are deliberately and needlessly robbing you of an ordinary school year, an ordinary year of being a teenager, events, traditions, moments you'll never get back. All these selfish adults saying <em>it's just one year</em>, no, these kids can NEVER get that time back or replace those moments missed. </p>
<p><strong><em>It's not selfish. You are absolutely not responsible for the health of strangers</em></strong></p>
<p>The idea that you are is not a healthy mentality to force on anyone, nevermind on children and young people. You can't go through your life feeling responsible for someone else's health, especially when so many don't take steps to care for their own health as evident by the largely preventable top causes of death that make this virus look like <em>nothing</em>. The way people are now expected to treat their healthy body's like some sort of bioweapon, a machine killing those around them just by breathing, paranoid that they'll step too close and pass some invisible virus they might unknowingly have onto a <em>vulnerable</em> person or onto someone who passes it on to a vulnerable person and it kills them? It's incredibly unhealthy and maladaptive. I am a psychologist now and have seen young kids under 10 having panic attacks because they think that by going outside they are killing people.</p>
<p><strong>It is not okay</strong></p>
<p>The truth is that the at risk were always at risk. They always existed, and had to live with the fact they were at risk of just about anything - even including the 200+ viruses that cause the common cold. As humans we must live with viruses, they are an inevitable part of our life. Some make us unwell, some can kill some of us, some can kill any of us, and others are almost always beneficial. In fact, viruses themselves are a part of our bodies and make up a large volume of our microbiome which is essential to our health. </p>
<p>So those at risk mitigated their own risks and decided on those worth taking to actually live rather than exist. It's not new. There being people at risk of serious illness and death from viruses is nothing new. I have friends and family who are at risk for various reasons that are not their own fault. They were at risk before covid, and will be at risk after this hysteria has passed. They don't want this, and they think it's a joke all these people <em>pretending</em> to care so much about them when they never did before. Pretending they're such heroes when it's their own anxiety they actually care about, not those at risk. See those nearing the end of their lives, or living with conditions that make any sort of infection potentially life threatening, can give you a different perspective on life and death. You realise death is inevitable and life is for living  - this is something I've realised too, having come close to death myself.</p>
<p><strong><em>This? This is not life. It's existence.</em></strong> </p>
<p>None of us are guaranteed tomorrow. We could die at any time. The elderly have little time left no matter what, and the young arent guaranteed time either. It is INSANITY to waste all these months of life. What is looking to be at least a year of life. There are more people dying from causes other than covid, and they were robbed of the last months and days of their life. </p>
<p>Life is risk. Every single day our brains - even without our awareness - are assessing risks. We take risks every single day, ones that pose a greater risk to our lives than a virus. It is healthy to accept risks, and mitigate them for yourself. Yet suddenly we are being made responsible for the health of others, our ability to risk assess and live for ourselves stripped away. No level of risk is acceptable apparently. This will have long-term effects on people. This mentality that our bodies are dangerous killers would not disappear for everyone even if the virus magically vanished. People's mental health and ability to go about their lives will suffer from that alone. </p>
<p>None of this is okay.</p>
<p><strong>Life needs to return to normal. Children need to be given back their lives, too many kids have ended their lives during this. Adults need a reality check.</strong></p>

        <p>Yes you are.  You should absolutely ensure that all of your friends and family exercise regularly, eat their vegetables, don't have any processed sugar or alcohol, and get plenty of exercise.  Force them through insults if necessary.</p>

        <p>But if everyone is responsible then there’s no way you would get sick either. With that logic it’s ok to drink and drive because I’m not responsible for other people’s safety. Not mention wearing a mask gives a a level or protection to you as well.</p>

        <p>&rt;   I want to do theater at my school and perform in front of a live audience. I want to play in the band at my school's football games. I want homecoming, prom, pep rallies, and all the other fun school events. I want to do mock trial and participate in my drawing club. I want to hang out with my friends face to face. I want to continue seeing my therapist in person, and not do appointments on the phone because in person appointments help me more. I don't want to live the rest of my life locked in my home in fear because I might be carrying a disease and I might spread it.</p>
<p>Everyone <em>wants</em> this to do fun activities. No one <em>wants</em> to stay in their homes and not see their friends. However, if you do risky activities, you might not only be endangering the lives of complete strangers, you might be endangering your friends and family as well. </p>
<p>We all think this sucks, but it would suck a lot more if our closed ones caught this thing.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but I mostly disagree with you. I agree with your feelings of exhaustion and frustration over this virus and I agree with your disappointment that you cannot do things you want to do. 
But you are very lucky if your only problems are that you can't go to theatre and art clubs. You clearly haven't had any close friends or family that are severely affected by this or have even died because if you did, I don't think you would have made the statement that you are now responsible for someone's grandma. Like what if your grandmother died because of covid? I'm sure this post wouldn't even exist if you yourself had covid. 
You are young and there will be plenty of time to live life 'normally' where you can meet with your friends and perform in front of people and get beauty treatments but right now this is not the case. Everyone is affected by this. Literally everyone. 
You are selfish for thinking it's such a big problem that you can't do these things. There have been people who have lost their jobs, had friends and family die and are probably now homeless. 
I think you should really sit down and put your life into perspective if you think its such a big issue that you cannot easily get your hair and nails done when there are people who have family in a coma and will likely never recover. 
Stop complaining about not wanting to wear a mask.  It's a simple thing that we can all do to help protect ourselves and each other. This along with social distancing and washing our hands really is not that hard. If you cannot wear a fabric mask due to whatever reason then purchase a face shield.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it does come off as heartless and selfish. Is it really that hard to wear a fucking mask in Target for twenty minutes? I have to wear one for up to ten hours at a time for work but you don’t see me complaining! By your logic, why shouldn’t you be able to drive around piss-drunk? You’re not responsible for anyone else’s health, so what’s the problem?</p>
<p>I know I’m going to get downvoted and probably banned from this sub, but I don’t care. When I see people putting other peoples’ lives and well-being at risk over something as simple as a fucking <em>mask</em>, I can’t just sit by silently.</p>
