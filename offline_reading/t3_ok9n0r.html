    <strong>You’re a conspiracy theorist and you’re in a cult yada yada</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I’m constantly being told that I’m in a cult.</p>
<p>So I asked for the definition of a cult and what it entails. I took exact notes of what they said, and here they are:</p>
<p>There is a leader that talks a load of old shit.</p>
<p>These leaders are sexual psychopaths.</p>
<p>They prey on the vulnerable.</p>
<p>They start a grooming process aimed at people in need.</p>
<p>They are unelected autocratic nazi leaders.</p>
<p>They promise transcendental religious bollox.</p>
<p>They sufficiently groom these people in need to think that any other opinion is rubbish.</p>
<p>This results in having a vulnerable and captive audience where salvation can be preached. </p>
<p>The leader exploits their resistance to NOT be there.</p>
<p>The leader promises salvation.</p>
<p>The leader never gives what is promised because it’s all lies.</p>
<p>At some point the leader asks for all their personal belongings and money.</p>
<p>Salvation doesn’t come, and then privately lots of the people wonder how they got to this level and how did they end up like this.</p>
<p>But the people keep these thoughts to themselves because they don’t want to be labelled heretic.</p>
<p>These people are NOT actually physically restrained, they are theoretically free to break-away if they want to ..BUT the leader has a particularly WEIRD hold over them. </p>
<p>Cult members don’t really want to talk about the rationality of what they believe in because there is no proof or logic, they rely on faith.</p>
<p>Fuck Me!? If that doesn’t translate precisely to:</p>
<p>Leader (Medical dictators) </p>
<p>The vulnerable (terrified of a virus)</p>
<p>Salvation (the vaccine) </p>
<p>Promises (two weeks to flatten the curve)</p>
<p>Lies (lockdown and masks needed)</p>
<p>Requiring possessions and money in return for salvation (you will own nothing and be happy)</p>
<p>WEIRD hold (the vaccine is in them now)</p>
<p>But apparently it’s ME that’s in a cult. ahahaha </p>
<p>The thing that worries me the most is the person TELLING ME that I AM  in a cult is/was very reasonable, understanding and interesting and fun, they were excellently schooled (if you like that sort of thing), and spent 30+ years as a successful investigative journalist! </p>
<p>These weird accusations towards me literally started within days of them taking the first vaccine, they’ve suddenly got angry at me for refusing it. It’s now the number one problem in our household. </p>
<p>Apparently I’m a conspiracy theorist -yada yada </p>
<p>I then asked for them to define a conspiracy theorist and this is what they said:</p>
<p>Displaying a need for knowledge and certainty in an uncertain world. </p>
<p>And then told me that I need covid explaining to me, simply, in black and white terms.</p>
<p>Yes that’s right, I DO feel the need to have covid explained to me, simply, and in black and white..</p>
<p>Yes that’s right, can you do that? I ask them</p>
<p>Their reply to me .. you’re a conspiracy theorist and you’re in a cult.</p>
<p>..happy fuckin’ dayz. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening. </p>
<p>Oh and don’t let the bastards grind you down. </p>
<p>Christ knows how this is going to pan out for us all.</p></p>
