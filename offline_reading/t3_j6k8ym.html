        <p>I always found it ironic that in the name of health and safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>gyms are closed</li>
<li>parks are closed</li>
<li>hiking trails are restricted</li>
<li>hospitals and clinics are impossible to get into without jumping through ridiculous hoops</li>
<li>even then things like cancer screenings and heart ablation (personal experience, sadly) are considered "non-essential"</li>
</ul>
<p>yet McDonald's and Walmart never closed. I would ask how much more ridiculous things can get, but I really don't want to know the answer.</p>

        <p>There’s also the fact that this has now been going on for seven months. That’s enough time for everyone “seriously” at risk to have lost enough weight to dramatically reduce it. Anyone who was at risk because of something in their own control has officially had a enough time to almost entirely mitigate the problem.</p>

        <p>I was going to respond “but diet is eighty percent!!!!!”. But that is fair I don’t disagree you - there are a lot of reasons why it’s hard to lose weight right now. I think I was aiming more at the point that if COVID is so horrible and yet you could have done something about it (and it’s so horrible that you WOULD HAVE purely as a survival mechanism), then..people would have. I’d pound the treadmill to not get Ebola I can promise you. </p>
<p>I asked my mom (62) if she was cared at the start of all of this. And she said “No because people aren’t behaving like it’s that bad.” I.e., if COVID was a legitimate threat you wouldn’t have to legally mandate shutdowns/mask wearing/etc.</p>

        <p>Whether NYC's restrictions are justified is a different debate. I'm saying, the reason OP singled out NYC and not the 3 states you mentioned is the level of restrictions. Not the obesity rate (which, like everywhere in the US, is still much too high in NYC).</p>
<p>Spread of the virus is way lower in NYC than the states you mentioned, likely due to herd immunity. And the main thing that makes the virus easier to spread in NYC is the subway, which I don't think people are planning on crowding anytime soon. The restrictions people are complaining about like restaurants, churches, and schools don't lead to more spread in NYC than other places.</p>

        <p>op was very detailed about the fat asses and diabetes not being his problem and their shitty health. he was light on the restrictions. as if it were an after thought.</p>
<p>that's because nyc already had a first wave but the virus is starting to pick up again. nyc doesn't have heard immunity, the last stats was that only ~20% had corona. which isn't heard immunity, not to mention there are several different strains here. nyc subways are crowded now, but they're not the only reason for the spread - we're all close together generally. the restrictions put down are exactly what has flattened the curve and kept it low for so long.</p>

        <p>&rt; op was very detailed about the fat asses and diabetes not being his problem and their shitty health</p>
<p>Right. In conservative states, being a fat ass is your own problem. In NYC they make it everyone's problem. It's a difference in <em>attitude</em> that OP was pointing out, not a difference in obesity rate.</p>
<p>&rt; that's because nyc already had a first wave but the virus is starting to pick up again</p>
<p>Barely. 500 cases per day in a city of 8 million is hardly a large amount. It certainly isn't an indication that it will start spreading uncontrollably again.</p>
<p>&rt; nyc doesn't have heard immunity, the last stats was that only ~20% had corona. which isn't heard immunity</p>
<p>This demonstrates ignorance of basic immunology. 20% of people had <em>active antibodies</em> in their system. That doesn't mean only 20% have had the disease or are immune. There's t-cell immunity as well.</p>
<p>&rt; nyc subways are crowded now</p>
<p>I guess, if you consider a 70% decline in ridership while running a regular schedule "crowded"</p>
<p>&rt; they're not the only reason for the spread - we're all close together generally</p>
<p>The science is clear that the virus primarily spreads in crowded, enclosed spaces. Yes, the subway is not the only example of that in NYC, but it's the main difference between NYC and other places. You're not more likely to get COVID in an NYC restaurant than a Texas restaurant, an Louisiana church than a NYC church, or a Tennessee school than a NYC school.</p>

        <p>Yes. I hate fat people. Because they are this way because they put no effort into the research of proper diet as wide spread as this information is. They don't exercise regularly and have changed the food and fashion industry to fit their needs. </p>
<p>I happen to like rich foods without fat and a lot of salt and clothes that have some type of shape. I have been 120 lbs for the past 25 years</p>

        <p>Actually, I'd be willing to bet most of us live in NYC or mask mandate states, or else the UK. People living in areas with looser restrictions don't need to come here and vent. I lean left and have stopped trusting any politicians, as many of us here have. I also work from home, but that doesn't help with the mental issues caused by social isolation. (Hanging around other people who don't treat you like a disease vector does!) Some people here have expressed hope that the election will end the bs, but general cynicism about politicians (including Trump! Amazingly, wanting your life back =/= worshipping the asshole!) makes that hope difficult to sustain. As for Boomers: if you're not old enough to be in the high risk group and not young enough to be either defying lockdowns to party (which we don't shame them for, oh no!) or spouting off on social media all day about your virtuous mask wearing, you're mostly ignored by this sub. I have seen posts about the cruelty of socially isolating old people in nursing homes. Sorry if that doesn't fit your narrative.</p>

<p>It's not my narrative. Posts and comments like this, that bash the groups I listed (this one is about fat people and NYC residents) are continually applauded on here. One about boomers being the ones at blame for everything and also absolving the younger generations of blame was the top post of the day back when it got posted weeks ago. I see lots of snide comments about every group I listed up above, and those are upvoted to the sky.</p>
<p>This sub is becoming an echo chamber, and really, the hatred I see spewed on here is really not much better than the type of shit people at /r/coronavirus and other subs say about our group. At this rate, nothing will change because many here are all too happy to shit on anyone they think they can get away with blaming for the mess we're in. I hope they're happy because the government and other elites sure love seeing their divide and conquer strategy playing out perfectly.</p>
