    <strong>The audacity here is beyond me</strong>
    <p><p>This sub should be banned. Now, you obviously will ban me, because truth offends you. This is fittingly ironic for the band of hypocrites that always complains about "free speech" when someone tells  them shut the fuck up and stop spreading misinformation. </p>
<p>This sub is a cesspool of such selfishness and self-victimisation I've never seen in my life. </p>
<p>You compare yourselves to Holocaust victims, who died in pain after days of agony. Why?  Because you have to wear a fucking piece of cloth on your face. Do you not realise how disrespectful this is to people who actually faced discrimination and torture? </p>
<p>You see yourselves as vigilante heroes of justices because you don't wear masks in public, you praise yourselves for actively harming others out of pure selfishness and oversensitivity. </p>
<p>You are utter hypocrites, calling "doomers" "scared, " "paranoid" and "angry, " when the ones who are that are only yourselves. You cry and complain about "free speech" but when somebody tries to burst your bubble of delusions, you are afraid of another's words to the degree you just ban them. </p>
<p>Please, reconsider what you believe in. </p>
<p>TLDR: you guys are like sad children and overreact to everything</p></p>

        <p>I don't think that coming to another sub with insults and blanket-imputations is the best strategy for making people reconsider their views.</p>
<p>What do you think about treating other people the same way you'd like to be treated yourself?</p>

        <p>You are on drugs pal because you can't realize how this kind of facemasks harms your respiratory system. Masks are worse than smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>And you are coming here trying to convince people to damage their health. There is no paranoia about it, it the fact. Nobody in his sane mind would want to cause self-harm. Unless on drugs.</p>

        <p>How come that people like you never have facts?
 People like you only make decisions based on emotions and i can beat you over the head with evidence and you will not want to see it.
  I hate people like you because you are the ones taking down the civilized world but iâ€™m also willing to listen to any evidence you might have to back up your rant. All you did here is showcase your fucking ignorance and that my friend wonâ€™t change anyones opinion about people like you.</p>
