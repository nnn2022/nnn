<p>The truth is that this is yet ANOTHER opportunity for the IMF to expand SDR issuance so that SDRs can ultimately become the world's reserve currency whilst enslaving the poor countries in perpetual debt. Never let a crisis go to waste, 'ey?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The creation of the reserve assets -- known as special drawing rights -- is the first since the $250 billion issued just after the global financial crisis in 2009, with Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva billing it as “a shot in the arm for the world” that will help boost global economic stability. The SDR allocation will be effective on Aug. 23, the IMF said in a statement Monday.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“The SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence, and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy,” Georgieva said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The U.S.’s position changed under President Joe Biden and Mnuchin’s successor, Janet Yellen, and with the fund exploring options for members with strong financial positions to reallocate the reserves to support vulnerable and low-income countries. Still, a global allocation of $650 billion was about the maximum that the U.S. could support without needing to get approval from Congress.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Group of Seven advanced economies in June endorsed a plan to reallocate $100 billion of new SDRs to poorer countries, but the G-20 in July only specified support for a general allocation of $650 billion in SDRs, without detailing how much would be re-lent.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Reallocation will be crucial to help countries in Africa, for which only about $33 billion is earmarked in the SDR issuance.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has previously said that from the total allocation, about one-quarter -- equivalent to around $162 billion -- should be made available to African countries. He has called on rich nations to donate -- and not just on-lend -- their allotments.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The fund will “continue to engage actively with our membership to identify viable options for voluntary channeling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer and more vulnerable member countries to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth” Georgieva said in Monday’s statement.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;More than 200 groups including the Jubilee USA Network, a non-profit organization that advocates for debt relief for developing countries, had called on the G-20 to support the creation of $3 trillion in SDRs, saying the funds are needed to help free up resources for health care and social spending.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Developing countries need more aid to get beyond the crisis,” Eric LeCompte, the executive director of Jubilee USA Network, said in a statement late Monday. “Wealthy countries receive most of these emergency reserves and must donate them to developing countries.”</p>
