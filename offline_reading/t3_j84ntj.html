    <strong>Questioning the effectiveness of masks</strong>
    <p><p>Masks aren't 100% effective,  its been pretty well established. At what point is it even worth bothering? In your opinon, if wearing a mask would save only one person, would it be worth it?</p></p>

        <p>Whether it's worth bothering or not is a personal decision. </p>
<p>I have decided it isn't worth it, any more that it would be worth it to have us all wear hockey helmets all the time to "prevent head injuries 'cause you might trip and fall".</p>
<p>Holding random strangers responsible for making others "feel safer" is a slippery and dangerous slope.</p>
<p>Most of the anger you see on this sub, and others like it, stems from two things:</p>
<p>- Many of us see the overblown response to this ScamDemic as part of a larger agenda, </p>
<p>and germane to your question:</p>
<p><em>- Our personal liberty and personal choice has been over-ridden by government officials who are acting, not to "save lives", but to cater to an irrational mob of Karens - which they have created themselves, through their fearmongering...</em></p>

        <p>this 'if it saves even one life, it's worth it' reason, has been used to justify countless encroachments  on, and outright stripping away of our natural rights to life, liberty and private property.</p>
<p>dictated maskings are only one of the latest examples</p>
<p>in no case, can anyone point to the actual life saved, even in the case of the classic 'seat belt'. the fact that someone survived a collision does not mean the wearing of a seat belt caused the survival, and there are many cases where wearing the seat belt did in fact result in death, airbags too.</p>
<p>correlation is not causation.</p>

        <p>only out of fear of 'punishment' </p>
<p>it took 20 years from when seat belts were mandated (dictated) as standard equipment (previously they were optional), to being 'legally required' to actually be used, and the usage was not dictated, it was 'legislated'</p>
<p>when i grew up, the 'safety cult' was just forming and had not yet seized power. i recall many a trip in crowded station wagons full of kids crawling around unrestrained, and yet we all survived</p>
<p>no bike helmets, no pads, none of it. and we still survived.</p>

        <p>Ok, but what if a seatbelt only worked if everybody was wearing them? Lets say in the car crash your restrained corpse would slam around in the car, injuring the other passengers. You would be actively endangering others. What if your choice to not wear a seatbelt could affect everyone around you, with potentially fatal results?</p>

        <p>If all 7 billion people on the planet had to wear a mask forever to save one life? No.</p>
<p>If just 1 person had to wear a mask for 5 seconds to save a life? Yes.</p>
<p>Be specific with your question.</p>
<p>Also, it wouldn't save a life, it would just delay death. So how long would the delay be? Are we talking about delaying the death of a 2 year old, or a 98 year old?</p>

        <p>It just makes me reverse the question. </p>
<p>"If it is worth it now, why was it not before during flu seasons?" </p>
<p>If all of this time they have had evidence that would suggest that we could have prevented deaths from the flu for years, then that irritates me that they didn't care enough for that but they do for this.</p>

        <p>Whether they are comparable or not doesnt really mean much with the point I am getting at. </p>
<p>My point is that those who are at the most risk from covid, were and still are at just as much risk from the flu. </p>
<p>My dad is immunocompromised, and so the flu can kill him off easily. He was expected to work during flu season working with the public and risking himself, if he was to refuse he would be sacked and labelled selfish. He has ended up really poorly in hospital a few times. Despite having the vaccine every year. </p>
<p>If the masks work to prevent covid from spreading, then surely the same would apply for the flu. If that is the case, why were those who are vulnerable and at risk before covid not protected then? </p>
<p>Why are people seemingly so hell bent on saving peoples lives at the minute, yet dying was a normal part of life 2 years ago?</p>

<p>But like I said, if there is evidence to suggest that masks do work. Why were they not put in place before covid to protect those vulnerable to the flu?</p>

        <p>It is absolutely comparable. Covid seems to be more deadly for older people, but for people younger than 65, it's equal to less deadly than the flu. They are 2 illnesses with almost identical symptoms. They are similarly infectious. They are similarly deadly. They are similarly transmitted. And they are similarly treated. Obviously, they are different viruses, and are not 100% the same, but to most people, the two diseases are indistinguishable. </p>
<p>And one problem with comparing Covid numbers to Flu numbers is that Flu numbers are vague estimates. Very few people are ever actually ever tested for Influenza. On the other hand, never in human history has a disease ever been hunted and meticulously tested for like we are doing with Sars-Cov-2. Pretty much every person that checks into the hospital is required to be tested for covid. Athletes, students, government employees, are regularly tested, and tested, and tested. Many companies require constant testing from their employees. International travel requires testing. There are ad campaigns to encourage people to get tested, with or without symptoms. Whereas tens to hundreds of thousands of people likely have died every year, never having been tested to see if they had influenza. They just died, and that was normal. If we were to test for influenza, the way we test for Covid, the numbers would almost certainly be similar.</p>

        <p>what Im getting from this is:
1) you think if old people or weak die, it doesn't count
2) you don't understand how seriously sick people age&lt; 65 get from covid
3) you think the maximum flu death estimates should be doubled, despite those maximum estimates accounting for undiagnosed deaths. ok</p>

<p>I'm sure this point has been brought up many times here, but the main reason comes from the fact that I just can't care about thousands, if not millions of people dealing with covid. Yes, it sucks, I won't deny that, as I know someone who had it pretty rough, even for being young (age 20). But because of the limitations of our brains, we can only meaningfully care for about 200 or so people, i.e. Dunbar's number. As of today (Oct 10), about 2 in 85 people have gotten covid in the US, so on average, every person should know about 3 to 5 people in their circles who have gotten covid. With 214k deaths, the absolute maximum number of people who had a meaningful relationship with someone who died of covid is 32-53 million, or less than 20% of the population. That number assumes there's no overlap in social circles, which is an absurd assumption, even given the lack of socializing this year. It's been 10 months, and this is all covid has to show for itself. We shut down economies, ruined people's lives, and enforced proto-tyrannies for this. None of this contributes to a healthy society.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I live where I can't leave my front door without one. And cannot have my nose showing either or I get scolded by people in parks, trials sidewalks. Been like this for 7 months straight so I tend to get irritable talking about it. I am not an indoors type person either. So when people say it's a minor inconvenience I don't know if they've been wearing one at all times outside for half a year now. I gotta move.</p>
