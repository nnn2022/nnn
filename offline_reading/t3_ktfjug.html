        <p>The gov are too deep in their bs to care. I signed a petition last year regarding rights of people who refused to take the vaccine. I watched the stream when this got debated. All they did was sing the praises of the vaccine, waste of time.</p>
<p>But if you want human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, the right to protest (but we can't do that because they took away freedom of speech, ask YouTube why they kicked talk radio but then re-instated them after ofcom got involved, can't travel to protest.) The right to education.</p>
<p>I should have just said The declaration of human rights, the committee can go through that and see how many of the rights the government has taken away.</p>
<p>How many businesses have closed for good?
What's the suicide rate look like?
Drug Abuse
Alcohol Abuse
Domestic Violence
Child Abuse
Unemployment
Mental Health
Undiagnosed cancer
Undiagnosed heart problems
Unntreated cancer. Due to convid restrictions
Unntreated heart problems due to convid restrictions
Do I need to go on?
How many people have been affected by the above? To save how many? At what cost?
Don't forget everybody in the UK has a price on their heads regarding health care. Money it's always about money.</p>
<p>If the human rights committee cannot see what I see  then they need a hefty kick in the bollocks.</p>

<p>It was always this easy.</p>
