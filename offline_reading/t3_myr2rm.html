    <strong>My Last And Final Message To The Doomers. (Sadly, Because This Sub Might Get Banned Very Soon). I had To Let It All Out.</strong>
    <p><p>You fat fucking doomers. Ahh, after observing many of you irl and on reddit, all of you are the same. Fat, lazy, unambitious and who had no lives prior to covid. You fools only find virtue and happiness in being lab rats to test whatever your Master, who is the government and fauci commands you to. You doomers love virtue signaling us if we protest or don't mask, yet you all are sitting in your basements and hoping all this covid nonsense doesn't end. Why? Because you love those petty government checks and you don't want to go back to your old miserable fucking lives. You blind idiots do not see the economic destruction that is on it's way, and more restrictions that are coming. You fuckers only love getting fucked in the ass hard by your Master.</p>
<p>You socialists/communists are the lowest of the low and most clownest out of all. You have gave up your freedom, basic rights and honor for a fucking disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. Are you that dumb to give up everything for this? Masks don't do shit (many studies done on this) and social distancing is dividing Us more than ever, and people literally fear each other now. If I was to social distance Myself from anyone, that would be from you worthless doomers. </p>
<p>One of My favorite analogies of all time is, "Many people are like the tail of a dog. No matter how much you try to straighten the tail of a dog, even after a hundred years it will still remain crooked and twisted." So that's how I see you worthless, lowest of the low jokers in their circuses, entertaining Me with their pointless arguments. No matter how much logic and rationality you will show them, they will never get it. Talking to these people is a huge thing for Me, I'm the type who would never even look at them, even if they were the last people on Earth.</p>
<p>You Doomer's  only ambition in life is to obey, bow down and be a slave to the government and to add the cherry on top, you will quad mask to please your Masters even more. And oh, also, their lab rats to test the vaccine for them, not knowing the long term side effects of it. And for the ones, who took the vaccine and still are double masking and social distancing, WTF. How fucking stupid you have to be to do that and yet you still virtue signal Us, while you are only making fool of yourselves. Your Master Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off rn looking at you and I bet it's hard for them to believe how easy it is to brainwash and manipulate this clown society for their own gain.</p>
<p>And for the people on this Sub, we didn't come in to this world to be fucking lab rats. We came here for a purpose, and to do whatever the hell we want to do, and have freedom in this "free" country who promised Us that. There is no high in living just a boring and simple life and submitting to the government, rather life is a wonderful adventure and no 1 should be able to stop Us. I personally like to live My life on the edge, and Idgaf about death and love to take all the risks. Time is very limited here and life is very short, we must make the most of it and do everything we want in this limited time. No Fucking 1 should be able to take our basic rights away. Fuck them. And you doomers, Go fuck yourselves and go back to your old miserable lives, who's only source of happiness is by telling others to quad mask.</p></p>

        <p>The funny part is they all claim to care about people of color and justify the panicked overreaching inept responses with "if it only saves one life"</p>
<p>The UN had to adjust their those at risk to famine projection from 135 million to 260 million due to economic downturn from the COVID lockdowns, restrictions, and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>Far more people will die from this than COVID. And unlike COVID, which overwhelmingly kills those at or beyond their life expectancy, famine always comes for the young first. And always comes for people of color. BlackLivesMatter my ass.</p>

        <p>You do realise the quote you linked makes OP sound like a proper sociopath? This really isn't a sentiment people should be lauding. Even when we take it as separate from the NewNormal/LockDown whatever rhetoric. </p>
<p>People in this sub aren't against the lock downs or masks because they "(don't give a fuck) about death". Do <em>you</em> come to this sub because you don't care about your death, your parents deaths, your communities death? No, quite the opposite. </p>

<p>who made you the spokesman for the sub? I quoted him/her because I feel the same. I've posted similar things many times here. I've lived my whole life on the edge and it really sucks to have corrupt politicians telling me how to live. To be perfectly honest with you i really dont care who dies. Why should I?</p>

        <p>I've put up with so much shit from people in the last year, so I don't care if they do all die. The planet is over populated anyway. </p>
<p>And I don't believe that's why people don't like this sub and my opinions will have zero influence on it being shut down. I've always said 'these are my opinions' if I post something controversial.</p>
<p>I get banned from things all the time. I even got banned from here once but the main reason I like it here is because free speech is tolerated. So don't tell me what to think or what to say.</p>

        <p>I feel like you can really aid some help, and im grateful. </p>
<p>CAN you first start like oh contribute ONE independent idea original of your own for us? Thoughtful perspective or opinion? That's yours? HAPPENING TO THE MASSES? Offering nothing substantial I probably wouldn't waste my time either. Can you join in and stay focused on the issue?</p>
<p>....... But oh? Cliche-critiques... Yay. Offering irrelevant criticism while questioning the creditably and character of the person- not even the subject.</p>
<p>Only contributing depth ironically- still hasn't a clue! Are you here to submit as shit hits the fan or just watch as it happens?? Come on both are pretty lame and apart of the problem.</p>
<p>This Lack of empathy- like, according to you- OP and the thread.... lacks for human life......??....  </p>
<p>It's lack of energy from the unnecessary. The totally UNAWARE.... Yet passionate for... What? 
Calling each other out??
 They are keeping us split and separate focused IN the WRONG direction. This? </p>
<p>This I PROMISE IS PURE exhaustion. 
To say IDGAF. Yes, its the easy way out and I KNOW its from how much this eats at us. We have to live with the truth. How DRAINING to deal with evil, oppressing, dark forces that have some y'all hypnotized and brainwashed.... Continued condition. 
Some WILLINGLY submit to. Our families and children. And it's evident that you have little understanding about how much work really goes into giving a real flying fruit- at the least- about the world's most current and important change we have as a collective. A planet. A whole. Be the change you want to see. We all got to deal with this. Its harder on the folks carrying the foggy headed here.</p>
<p>I don't see you offering anything but a hard time. Anything worth offering? Because it isn't a lack of GAF. I wish I didn't care comes from I wish I didn't have to hurt as I grow tired of the people around me lack vision. Insight. Willingness to understand, help and fight. And I know that's how my brother's and sister's in the fight with me feel. </p>
<p>So if you have the ability to CARE about the human collectives freedom and our life on the rock under our feet, we appreciate support and any positive solutions conducive to change. People are waking up people are becoming aware and it's happening faster and faster. This all has to be addressed. You'll know the feeling when it hits. You won't be alone. People are fighting hard to keep the path to knowledge accessible. That's what this fight is about because when we become so controlled that we can no longer grow? Well that's not really in the plans because we will fight to ascend. This fight is protection for our freedom. </p>
<p>The most difficult is supporting eachother, even more so is the reality we are living in such a dark world. Oppression of a force we certainly as a collective did not agree to. </p>
<p>We have hope. Hope for all the things ascending. We can do it. We can take control back. We can stand together. Im dedicated. And we are all only as strong as the weakest link.</p>

        <p>Again, very petty argument. Nobody is complaining about you if you quad mask, or wear a hazmat suite to "protect" yourself or stay isolated and locked at home alone forever to "social distance." Just keep your bs with yourselves, don't tell us what to do. </p>
