        <p>The survival rate of driving is by calculating the number of people who survive a car accident, not the amount of people that make it to their destination. In 2019, only  38,800 died in car accidents in the US.</p>

        <p>Over your lifetime, the chances of dying in a car accident is still much higher than the chances of dying from covid. In the next 20 years, it's quite likely that a lot more people will have died from Car accidents than Covid in the world (even if there was no vaccine).</p>

        <p>My husband’s coworker called him up hysterically crying because she tested positive for Covid and is saying she’s so scared she’s going to die. She’s a healthy 21 year old!! Her chances of survival are basically guaranteed! This fear mongering has gotten so out of hand that young people are afraid of dying from what’s basically a mild cold</p>

        <p>That is the case fatality rate (CFR), not the infection fatality rate (IFR). It only includes people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died. Most instances of infection are never identified because they are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and never get tested. The IFR, or actual probability of a person dying if they are infected, is around 0.2%. of course, that isn't age stratified. That number goes up to like 0.5-0.6% for over 65 but for people in their 20s or 30s it is as low as 0.03%.</p>

        <p>It's actually 99.8%. A 0.2% mortality rate is actually really bad if you think about it. If 1,000 people get sick, 2 will die.  If the entire US population gets COVID, that's 658,900 people dead. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, the 0.2% mortality rate is when there is hospital capacity. If hospitals fill up, many people won't receive treatment and the mortality rate will go up.</p>

        <p>Don't know where you're getting that number specifically, but combining the data on covid deaths for healthy people in their 20s and overweight 90 year olds with lung disease effectively makes it useless.</p>
<p>Give 1 million healthy people in their 20s Covid tomorrow, and very few will die. Most will be completely asymptomatic. While if you give 1 million elderly people covid tomorrow, you're looking at potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>Why the hell does everyone act like people in these two groups need to take the exact same precautions? Wearing a goddamn cloth mask makes no sense for either party - high risk people need much more protection (N95s at minimum) and probably shouldn't be going out in public, while for low risk people the mask is pointless. How about we allow the low risk people to go back to normal, and keep the high risk people in lockdown until we either have a vaccine that works or at the very least design a mask that protects the wearer without fail?</p>

<p>Science and factual data are cast aside while politicians play politics. The best course of action looking purely at the science would never be proposed by either side because of the political consequences of making the boomers feel left out. If they have to suffer, everyone should. What a joke.</p>

        <p>I guess we have different definitions of "really bad", as the flu mortality is roughly 1 in 1000 and hospitals fill up with flu patients every year. Out of 1000 randomly selected people, how many would be very old, or nearing death as it is? Yes, you're stating big numbers, but with relative perspective to the millions who died during Spanish flu or other pandemics, are the paranoia, lockdowns, mandates really warranted?</p>

        <p>Flu mortality is 10x lower than COVID. Deaths from seasonal influenza in the US ranges from 20,000 to 80,000.  For the Spanish flu, the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. Right now COVID deaths in the US are at 365,000. What do you think it will be at the end of this? Granted, worldwide we're at 1.9 million.</p>

        <p>Right, but the death statistics you're referring to are not based solely on deaths caused by covid, just any death which happened within the timeframe of a positive PCR test. And the PCR test was not designed to determine an infection, or anything about covid-19 for that matter. It's been proven to be extremely inaccurate and faulty, so we therefore don't have any real death numbers.</p>

        <p>You're parroting common conspiracies that have been debunked. Death certificates have a section for immediate death and circumstances leading up to the death. You can't be brought in for a car accident and then put 'COVID' as cause of death. They also don't put 'COVID' as primary cause, it would be something like 'respiratory failure' with COVID as the underlying cause.

<p>The thing about PCRs not being designed for infections is a misquote. He was saying it doesn't detect HIV. 
https://www.aap.com.au/pcr-inventor-who-died-in-2019-did-not-say-his-test-wont-work-for-covid-19-infections/</p>
<p>Does that mean I think ALL death certificates are correct? No but studies show that COVID cases are most likely being UNDERREPORTED not overreported.

<p>CDC estimates 7.1x more infections than cases</p>
<p>If accurate that puts us at an estimated 157 million infections in America.</p>
<p>With the current death count that would be 0.23%</p>
<p>Again, overall IFR is too blunt and demographics are important. But to answer your question, the CDC.</p>

<p>The vaccine is MOST DEFINITELY safer than covid lol, if your vaccine numbers and my mortality rate numbers are correct.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">COVID IFR rates</a></p>
<p>COVID survival rates:</p>
<p>If you're under 20 it is 99.997%</p>
<p>If you're between 20 and 50 it is 99.98%</p>
<p>If you're between 50 and 70 it is 99.5%</p>
<p>Over 70 it is about 95%</p>
<p>And, these are averages based on the entire population in that age group, meaning if you're healthy in that age group your survival chances are better than the number, and if unhealthy (diabetes, cancer, obese, heart conditions, etc...) your chances are worse.</p>
<p>I think it's likely the vaccine is safer than COVID, especially for the elderly and/or vulnerable where the COVID risk is significant. But for young and relatively healthy people, COVID risk is extremely low.</p>
<p>https://www.covidodds.com and other risk calculators gives approximate odds as well.</p>

        <p>I believe it's with hospital care, although if you're in the hospital for treatment your odds are much worse as those are essentially the self-selected serious cases.</p>

        <p>I don't think those stats exist. One could look to poor countries with lack of quality healthcare, but they don't keep good stats. They don't seem to be collapsing from COVID though, just collateral consequences from lockdowns (poverty, hunger, displaced medical resources).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.covidodds.com/healthy-75-years-old-male">This</a> is just one of many calculators, but you could take the worst case assumption being any hospitalization results in a death. That is likely far overly conservative for younger people, but closer to what would occur for the elderly.</p>

        <p>Personally, I'm pro vaccines. I think everyone should get vaccinated and I see nothing wrong with the vaccines. However, the vaccines OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE READY. It's fundamentally evil to distribute shitty vaccines. Also, why would everyone need to vaccinate for a disease that affects only 0.02% of healthy individuals?</p>
