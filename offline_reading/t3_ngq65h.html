    <strong>Trolled a mask nazi</strong>
    <p><p>I was at the grocery store today in a mostly blue area. As always, I'm the only one shopping while breathing fresh air (no mask). Some 300+ pound lady comes up to me and furiously tells me to put a mask on. You might think I'm joking or trying to be funny, but I'm a mid 20's fit male and I straight up looked her in the eyes and said "if you loose 50 pounds I'll put a mask on."</p></p>

        <p>You know normally I'm against fat shaming but in this case she deserved it. The second she felt that it was within her rights to command you to mask up she put herself on blast.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to a friend of mine, he was at the store with his girlfriend and her eight-year-old daughter. A man walked up to them and asked her eight-year-old daughter where is your mask put your mask on. Her daughter said I don't wear one. This man started telling her that her mother was a bad mother , of course her mom was standing right there and she said who the hell are you? At first they thought he was a manager but he was just some random shopper. Needless to say she completely went off on this guy and was screaming at him and the management had to come and break it up LOL people who think they can tell others what to do deserve what they have coming to them.</p>

        <p>I was at the antique/coin shop (everyone here should buy gold and silver as a hedge against inflation). Some lady that worked there told me to put a mask on. I said "I don't appreciate the arbitrary medical advice" and ignored her. She continued to bitch. The owner who is 70+ walked over and pretty much told her to shut up. I still walked out of the store refusing to buy anything, hoping she would get fired for scaring off a customer.</p>

        <p>You know something I think a lot of people totally get off on this whole authoritarianism thing. It brought it out in a lot of people. And I've actually been wondering about that, like what were these people like before this whole thing? Was this part of their personalities or did it come out after it was triggered by fear? For the life of me I cannot imagine telling someone to put a mask on. Even in the very beginning, and I live in New York City and I was getting massive massive propaganda at that time, they had everyone here absolutely terrified. Even at that time I would never ever tell someone else what to do. For some people that came far too easily. It's as if their lives are meaningless and they feel like they are doing some public service or something.</p>

        <p>Judging by my friends and family, its mostly people who were already "authoritive" before this all happened. Quite literally everyone within my peers who I already had problems with beforehand because they have this attitude of shaming/blaming others to do as they please is now a Coronazi.</p>
<p>Its at a point where I can meet up with old college friends who I havent seen for over a year and guess their stance correctly 95%.</p>
