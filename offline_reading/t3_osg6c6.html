    <strong>Quick survey/discussion related to having sexual relations between unvaccinated and vaccinated persons</strong>
    <p><p>OK this is a little awkward but I don't know where else that I could post this especially since I am banned from most covid related subs. Anyways I have part time girlfriend that I hook up with every so often for dinner etc. We are good friends.</p>
<p>She is vaccinated and I am unvaccinated. So about two months back we hook up. Within about a day or so I ended up getting sick. I had a fever and my testicles were killing, feeling weak. I was down for about five days.</p>
<p>Well we hung out again about six days ago. The next day I start feeling weak with a headache that would not go away. Then it evolved into me being sick again. I am still not feeling good but I am starting to improve.</p>
<p>Considering that this has happened twice I am just not going to have with her for awhile. It might just be a coincidence but I don't get sick that often.</p>
<p>Has any of you experienced something like this or heard of someone who has?
Most likely I will be deleting this post in a few hours.</p></p>
