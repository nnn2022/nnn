    <strong>Ideas for having a fun ass year as a college freshman?</strong>
    <p><p>I love the outdoors and trying new things, so far I'm going to: camp, go off-roading, hike, join my local mariachi band, learn how to dance swing and jazz, trip with friends, have mini raves at home, feed the homeless, learn how to play the saxophone, go on roadtrips, go to New Mexico and tour the breaking bad locations, set up mini punk shows and mosh in friend's homes, and join local meet up groups to make new friends. </p>
<p>I think the only thing I'll be missing out on is sitting in an actual classroom and going to festivals and punk shows.. godamn I miss my punk showsðŸ˜ž Lots of bands have announced show dates but they can fuck off with their vaccine card bullshit if venues even open this year. What other suggestions do you have for a soon-to-be community college freshman during lockdowns?</p></p>

        <p>Depends where you live. I personally found that I liked shooting guns and rock climbing. Both of which are things you can still do.</p>
<p>Honestly... my recommendation is to not go to college. I went. I just delayed growing up for 4 years and drank a bunch. At least I have a mechanical engineering degree to show for it and didn't have to go into debt.</p>

        <p>Honestly I think college is a waste of time too but I got a full-ride so I said fuck it why not? I've thought about becoming an apprentice but I'm learning some sort of trade for 2 years while working on my business in case my plans fail.</p>
<p>My hope is that since I applied to a ton of scholarships, that I'll have some money remaining to help pay the bills since any extra $ can be used on rent/food. The trades are in-person only which is great because I can still cheat on my core classes lol. Thanks for your comment</p>

        <p>Dude. You got it made. Just make sure you grow your tribe during this time and don't make any lifelong commitments until you're 25 and reach full brain development (face tattoos, etc)</p>
