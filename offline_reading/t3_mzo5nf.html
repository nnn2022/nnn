    <strong>If masks make you feel confident, you have terrible social skills</strong>
    <p><p>People tell me masks make them feel more confident. And I just want to ask: how? I have had three different jobs during the pandemic, and it was brutally hard trying to get to know anybody when you can‚Äôt read lips or see people‚Äôs facial expressions. Not to mention you have to speak loud just so you can be audible. I‚Äôm sick and tired of hearing ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù and saying it myself because I can‚Äôt hear from 6 feet away bull crap. I can only truly know people when we‚Äôre eating/drinking during breaks (because COVID goes away when you‚Äôre eating or drinkingüëç)I‚Äôm a social person and always have been, and I can tell you right now people treat other people worse when they can‚Äôt see their faces. Masks dehumanizes individuals more than people realize. The pandemic has had the biggest toll on me regarding social interactions. Everything feels so awkward and confusing it physically gives me a headache when I have to communicate with somebody now. Fuck people who will continue to wear them as a confidence booster. You‚Äôre a cunt that prefers the anonymity of the internet that enjoys hiding yourself and your face. Delete your fucking social media so you can stop being so self conscious. Be yourself.</p></p>
