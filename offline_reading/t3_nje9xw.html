    <strong>Barely Anyone Gets Tested For Flu</strong>
    <p><p>I think this is something that tends to get overlooked by the general public and Covid-cult: the flu was never something that was obsessed over and wildly tested. You got ill, you'd spend a couple days at home, and then you'd go back to school or work. You wouldn't make a big fuss out of it. You likely never went to a doctor about it and even if you did I doubt they'd keep a log of it. The number of flu cases in any given year would be much, much lower than the actual spread. Then you get into "asymptomatic spread" and all that utter bollocks. Not to mention the amount of people that died with flu in their systems that were not counted as "flu deaths".</p>
<p>Are you getting it yet? The flu didn't just magically disappear this past year. Get fucking real. Here's what fucking happened: they got everyone scared of this "nOvEL viRuS" from China, got you to take a (and they have fucking ADMITTED THIS again and again) <strong>FLAWED</strong> test regardless of whether you were showing symptoms or not so they could get the case rates up, and then labelled everyone that died with Covid in their systems as a Covid death. There are even cases where people have died in a car crash and they just slapped "Covid" on their autoposy report as the cause of death.</p>
<p>I bet if they had done the same thing with regular old flu (and I'm not entirely convinced that they haven't just rebranded the flu as Covid if I'm being completely honest) the results would have been the exact same as what we're seeing now. Maybe a bit less, maybe even a bit more. I find it very hard to believe that the flu was simply eradicated because "mAsKiNg uP AnD sOcIaL dIsTaNCiNg wOrKs", especially when you claim that Covid spread as much as it did because no one did those fucking things in the first place!</p>
<p>Take all of that and sprinkle on all the weird, dystopian, authoritarian shit that's gone on this past year and you have yourself a, what I consider to be, pretty clear-cut conclusive picture that this has all been a massive psy-op, conspiracy or overblown virtue-signalling shit-show of a circus. They should spend some time developing a vaccine for stupidity instead and cure the real pandemic plagueing this fucking forsaken fuck-fest of a species.</p></p>
