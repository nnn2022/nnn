    <strong>I went to my doctor today</strong>
    <p><p>(Well, nurse practitioner, shes who I have seen for years)</p>
<p>I went in to follow-up on some chest pains that i went to the hospital for 3 weeks ago (the chest pains were from <em>before</em> i got the vaccine, FWIW.)</p>
<p>She told me "it's good that you went to the hospital even though it was nothing- it could have been heart failure or mini heart attacks... <strong>I've been seeing a lot of this lately, just in the past couple of months"</strong> and the look on her face when she said last part spooked me so much. I did not ask why she thought that might be happening, thinking she probably wouldn't want to actually discuss other patients or say anything weird, but definitely she had a look as she said it and it was a spooky moment.</p></p>

        <p>She was trying to tell you something without actually telling you, seems to be that kind of situation. I did read that the jab was causing heart issues in younger folks with no previous history of one, which is pretty frightening tbh... Here in the states we have two issues with the jab, people who just aren't going and getting it and the other is people that aren't getting the second dose</p>

        <p>That was kind of you to not push her. No doubt she's scared for her job if she makes an observation about what she's seeing with her own eyes. </p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear you got vaxxed. Maybe her words can help you evaluate whether to go back for seconds? I hope so and hope your chest pains are nothing serious too.</p>
