    <strong>Why You Must Be Worried About The Next "Potential" Cyber Pandemic, That Will Be Way Worst Than Covid Itself?</strong>
    <p><p>Before any of you call this a "conspiracy" theory, it's not.  According to the WEF, COVID-19 was known as an anticipated risk, and so is its digital equivalent.</p>
<p>What’s more, “A cyber attack with COVID-like characteristics would spread faster and farther than any biological virus. Its reproductive rate would be around 10 times greater than what we’ve experienced with the coronavirus.”
In his welcoming remarks at Cyber Polygon 2020, WEF Founder Klaus Schwab warned about a coming “cyber pandemic” that would be worse than the current global crisis.</p>
<p>“We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to, the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole,” he said.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.”</p>
<p>Schwab added, “It is important to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cybersecurity community to draw and improve our unpreparedness for a potential cyber pandemic.”</p>
<p>As the digital world encroaches on our physical and biological worlds, an effective cyber attack could compromise anything connected to the internet, including:</p>
<p><strong>Medical devices that keep people alive</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem of connected devices that run smart homes (i.e. cameras, microphones, sensors, etc.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) ecosystem of digitally-connected humans</strong></p>
<p><strong>Global financial systems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Energy grids</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water treatment facilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Government IT systems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Military and defense infrastructure</strong></p>
<p><strong>And more</strong></p>
<p>Currently, “The only way to stop the exponential propagation of a COVID-like cyber attack threat,” according to the WEF, “is to fully disconnect the millions of vulnerable devices from one another and from the internet.”</p>
<p>But, “A single day without the internet would cost our economies more than $50 billion, and that’s before considering economic and societal damages should these devices be linked to essential services, such as transports or healthcare.”</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack” — Klaus Schwab</p>
<p>Needless to say, a cyber pandemic would wreak havoc on nearly all aspects of society.</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details, and the solutions recommended for a cyber pandemic could be far more detrimental to individual liberty than the cyber attack itself.</p>
<p>“It is important to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cybersecurity community to draw and improve our unpreparedness for a potential cyber pandemic” — Klaus Schwab</p>

I quoted many things from the link and you MUST check it out. It says it all.</p>
<p>(I highly recommend you watch the videos). It's all said exactly by the main head guy of the World economic forum. And you all most remember, these are the same evil psychopaths who "simulated" this plandemic way before it was a pandemic. It's known as <a href="https://youtu.be/0-FQbhkWYuY">Event 201</a> and the elite aren't even hiding it anymore. They are basically saying their whole agenda openly indirectly.</p>
<p>Basically this means we all are fucked. Internet will be gone for awhile, supply chain will fuck up, basic necessities such as water lines and all that will be affected. Bank accounts can be drained and your technological investments may be worth nothing. Most likely, there can also be a black out. It can be anything and these psychopaths are doing another simulation for this event on July 9th. Scary times are ahead of us. No wonder why many are calling this upcoming winter, "The Dark Winter." Stock yourselves up and keep safe and mainly keep your mental health in check. They want you to go crazy.</p></p>

        <p>I saw the video too. If this happens and it doesnt finally wake people up, then nothing will.   I hope it doesn't happen. But goddamn it they did the same thing with event 201 too.</p>
<p>If it does happen- these guys are pure evil. Smh.</p>

        <p>Computer systems are much too incompatible between themselves to create such a super computer virus. It can't happen unless it's baked into all network electronics chips. </p>
<p>If it's not in the chips, it could only be a lot of hackers attacking specific targets one by one. That takes planning and a lot of cyberwarfare manpower.</p>
<p>A bunch of guys in a basement doesn't cut it, it needs top tier nation state or major IT conglomerate juice to happen (google, microsoft, alibaba, huawei, etc).</p>

        <p>Yes, I've been keeping an eye on this possibility for most of the year. It's a bit disheartening to see that not many people are talking about it on this subreddit. There's been a huge uptake on news regarding cyber attacks/grid shut downs over the last few months, which tells me that whatever they're planning will happen soon, most likely before the end of the year.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm as self sufficient as far as that's possible myself - have my own water, have my own power supply, grow my own food (chickens that's a work in progress, but we'll get there before winter).</p>
<p>I'll still be majorly fucked when the global supply chains will grind to a halt. I mean, people in the city will be literally begging for water and food when that happens so I'll not be <em>that</em> fucked, still this will be a world ending event.
