        <p>Studies have shown the flu as being eradicated in places where people aren’t too stupid to think masks don’t work.  Meanwhile, the anti-science crowd (pro-make believe?), thinks it’s all due to hospitals inflating COVID numbers.</p>
<p>If masks don’t work, why do surgical masks exist?  This isn’t some vornado intake for your truck, it’s not some Saturday morning snake oil infomercial at 4AM.</p>

        <p>Doctors don’t wear masks to prevent viruses. Doctors also don’t perform surgery with symptoms of any respiratory illness. Do some research. If a mask works to prevent flu why doesn’t it work for coronavirus. Again, do some more research. If you don’t believe COVID numbers are inflated then watch them drop now the WHO have just decided a single positive PCR test is not enough to prove actual infection and that the Ct count for the test is to be massively reduced also.</p>

        <p>Your notion of what research means is very limited. For every nation that you can say it worked there are other places in the world where the opposite was also effective so that’s hardly a crushing argument. There are so many variables to take into account that you can only look very locally to understand how viruses may potentially act. There is no one size fits all approach that’ll work for the whole planet. 
One thing you have failed to recognise yet is the damage done by extreme lockdown measures. To be fair the MSM hasn’t been fair in their duty to represent both sides of the lockdown measures and their pros and cons. We make better decisions when we are fully informed and that just isn’t happening if you get all your information from a television or newspaper. Do some digging of your own rather than sticking blindly with a stance you obviously took a year ago.</p>

        <p>I definitely am not getting my news from TV, as I don’t have cable. I do more reading, and don’t have any newspaper subs as I’m more digital.</p>
<p>In Eastern cultures where mask usage is prevalent When sick NOT ONLY during a pandemic, they did an outstanding job.  Then again, mask usage wasn’t politicized by an outgoing nutjob.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I’ve just watched that and I have a question - do you think you can see coronavirus particles with the naked eye? If that’s what you’re referring to ‘digitally’ then it explains your views. I hope others with your outlook take the time to look at your argument so they may have a change of mind.</p>

They won't sell Starbucks to people before  they shop because they don't want people walking around with it. In a matter of minutes I had multiple employees complain about how my mask wasn't perfect.

        <p>Weird. I never bother pretending to care anymore. I'll go into anywhere like it's 2019 and usually I have zero problems. Not target though. They are mask nazis. I wish more people reacted this way instead of having  a "oh poor me" attitude. </p>
<p>Twitter ovibiosly has a hatred for conservatives. Drop them. 
Facebook isn't much better. Use them less. I do think Facebook has uses in real life so dropping them might not be as easy but still give them less power. Less time there probably means less advertising revenue. Once a competitor gets good momentum get off Facebook completely. </p>
<p>I'm a coffee addict so Starbucks might always get my money but I've never had troubles finding free movies online.  People really underestimate the power of thier wallet in my opinion. Goya foods had huge sales after supporting Trump, my pillow will probably have a similar moment. </p>
<p>Random addition but I keep hearing about a movie ben Shapiro had a hand in making. I might actually pay to rent that regardless of the quality because supporting a good conservative movie is a cause I'm 1000% down with. We're currently getting a feel for the true power of owning the media. I would love to see that change to a more mixed climate.</p>

        <p>Wrong, it’s a private business and has the right to restrict its services to anyone they see fit. Don’t believe me look up the court case regarding the gay couple who wanted a cake made by a baker and the baker refused. The baker won and set precedent that business owners can refuse service to anyone they don’t want to serve. Normally just lurk but don’t spread misinformation</p>

        <p>This is blatantly false. The gay couple was infringing on the business owners right to religious freedom. A business forcing me to wear a medical device is a federal crime as it circumvents my right to informed consent. A business (most businesses) do not have a medical license. Discriminating against me for not wearing a medical device when I am medically exempt is also a federal crime. </p>
<p>Business owners can not violate the civil rights of 1964. </p>

        <p>The civil rights act doesn’t cover this. Civil rights act prohibits discrimination based on religion and race.</p>
<p>Legally stores have to provide accommodations to those that fall under the ADA. But accommodating does not mean they have to allow you into the store to shop without a mask. At target (just because the video is from there) they have online shopping and curbside pickup which means those who cannot wear a mask due to medical conditions have a means to shop. I agree they cannot force you to wear a mask no one can. But if they provide an alternative they have followed the law and can refuse entry as they have provided an alternative. </p>
<p>You can like the alternative or not but legally they are protected.</p>

        <p>Curbside pickup is not a reasonable accommodation. I don’t want to be treated like a second class citizen. The reasonable accommodation would be to provide curbside pickup for those too afraid to enter the store. </p>
<p>The civil rights act protects people with a medical condition from discrimation. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the business is not protected from attempting to enforce unlawful demands. It is a breach of my right to be secure in personhood to force a medical device on my body. </p>
<p>A reasonable accommodation should be made to allow the same access that everyone else is entitled to. I’m not a direct threat, and therefore I am entitled to my rights in any public accommodation. Lots of people have already won lawsuits over this. It happens regularly but the media won’t tell you that.</p>

        <p>Like I said in my last post you may not like the accommodation but the fact that they provided one means they are protected legally. If you provide me a source where someone has won a lawsuit over this I will change my opinion. </p>
<p>The civil rights act does not protect against medical condition. The American Disability act does though. There is protection for medical issues it is just not under the civil rights act. </p>
<p>I would like to say I do appreciate this conversation, we may not agree but it was civil throughout and thats rare these days.</p>

        <p>The civil rights act protects against discrimination. It would be a businesses right to refuse to me but if I sued in a federal court they would then have to prove I was refused service for a lawful reason. There is nothing lawful about a business enforcing a medical device as they don’t have medical license (in most cases). </p>
<p>I will rescind my comment about cases regarding this particular subject being won in court. I took someone else’s word on that and have been unable to find documentation supporting my assertion thus far. Unfortunately, searching “anti masker wins civil suit” turns up a lot of biased articles. I will continue searching because I would like to see if this has been done yet as well. I’m not sure how long it takes for a civil case to move through federal court so it is possible there are lawsuits pending which have not been won yet.</p>
<p>That being said, it should be as easy as saying it’s against my religion to wear one. This does not violate any law and it would then be discrimination unless the business could substantiate their reasoning in court.</p>

        <p>You’re right about they need a lawful reason that is not protected. but if you are claiming a medical reason for the refusal it would fall under the ADA. I have added a quote below from the ADA wiki.</p>
<p>“The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12101) is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[1] which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal, and later sexual orientation. In addition, unlike the Civil Rights Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations.[2]”</p>
<p>The courts are not running at 100% efficiency right now so I don’t believe we will see any cases decided soon on the matter.</p>

        <p>I am also grateful for the amicable discourse.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t claim a medical exemption because I’m not completely literate on the law in that regard. Would it have to be diagnosed by a medical professional? Can I diagnose myself? These are questions I still have in regards to the legal territory on that particular matter. </p>
<p>That being said, I can absolutely claim it violates my religious beliefs and see no <em>legal</em> reason why a business could deny me service. I’m also not suggesting I can compel a business to serve me. They have the right to refuse and I have the right to sue. That is ones only means of recourse.</p>

        <p>Honestly and I don’t advise this, but you have a better chance claiming medical reasons even if you don’t have a medical condition (again don’t advise doing this as it’s wrong morally) due to the fact that businesses are taught not to ask for proof as it’s a violation of ADA. That’s why people with “service dogs” can get in almost anywhere even if the dog might be a normal dog.</p>
<p>Religiously you would have to find some reason why a mask is against your religious beliefs and I find that will be hard to do in a court.</p>

        <p>I agree, Medical exemption is easier but I don’t want to lie. If I go to court then my credibility could be questioned. </p>
<p>Religious exemption would be as simple “anti mask religion.” Since it doesn’t violate any law, I am entitled and protected in my religious beliefs, however insane they might be.</p>
