        <p>&rt;And so we only expect for 20 to 30 percent of the time that somebody is PCR positive, to actually have contagious virus the rest of the time is after the fact when they don’t. And this continues to be a source of confusion about sensitivity. </p>
<p>&rt;People continue to get it wrong at the CDC, at the NIH, everywhere, at the FDA continue to get this wrong. And that’s because they continue to think of this public health issue as a medical issue</p>
<p>Mina has been advocating reducing pcr test cycle to 30, which would reduce the number of "cases" by 80%.</p>
<p>The over cycling of pcr is picking up a whole lot of people who were exposed to the germ at one point but have long since recovered, which is exactly what you'd expect in population that has attained herd immunity.</p>
<p>This explains why California is finding "surging" cases even though covid19 hospitalization in the state continues to decline sharply and is now at less than half of summer level.</p>
<p>Yet this hasn't stopped newsom from imposing new destructive restrictions.</p>

        <p>Actually, hospitalizations are NOT decreasing here in California... and are in fact increasing. Doesn't invalidate your earlier points though.</p>

        <p>&rt; I mean, masks should never have been a cause for all of this questioning. We know it cuts risk. There’s no way around it. We’ve known this for decades.</p>
<p>I know he said the CDC is a little behind but we also have (at the least) the WHO and Fauci flipping from findings in past decades. I'm beyond tired of this.</p>

        <p>Masks do cut risk.  The right mask, in the right situation, worn correctly, does stuff.  Surgeons wear them to avoid getting droplets in patients.  We put masks on some patients in EMS to stop them spitting up vomit and/or blood particles on us, because bloodborne pathogens are nasty.  We wear p100 masks when working with oil-based chemicals to avoid inhaling some of it. </p>
<p>We don't wear cloth masks to stop aerosols from being inhaled.  We don't wear n95s to stop from sneezing virions in to the air.  We don't ask the general public to put whatever they can find on their face to stop a mild very easily transmissible cold or flu, especially when they're not even sick.</p>

        <p>Right, but here I do believe that he was talking about virus transmission, in particular.</p>

        <p>And I think he's incorrectly extrapolating "masks function" to "they must necessarily function as I expect in this case, in spite of evidence to the contrary" which is understandable given what we know of masks otherwise, but still unscientific.</p>

        <p>Hey maybe this guy shouldn’t have been running around professing the latest CCP guidance back in March/April, e.g.</p>
<p>&rt; “It’s the most daunting virus that we’ve contended with in half a century or more,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said at a panel discussion Friday at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.</p>
