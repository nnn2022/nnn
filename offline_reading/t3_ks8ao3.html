    <strong>Just tired of it all</strong>
    <p><p>I'm genuinely considering quitting anything political and just ignoring it almost completely anymore. I'm tired of it all. Mostly nothing seems to come of it. Humans will constantly be ridiculous, and the world will change and move on. Evil empires come and go, and everything that was once a great idea becomes corrupted. I just want to make sure when my time comes, I die favorably and move on to the next life. It seems inevitable that the world will soon burn, no matter what is done or what happens. We cant seem to move past conflict among ourselves, and we may never evolve past our tribal differences. The worst of humanity will always attempt to rise to the top to rule over us because they seem like the only ones with the ambition to do so. A great leader occurs, then is soon replaced with a significantly corrupted one. Happens almost everytime.</p></p>

        <p>I'm about to leave for the Army next week too. I am ashamed that I'll be serving under such pathetic leadership that will likely get men killed and that will likely backstab the ones in service. I had some life changing experiences in the last 4 years, I could only imagine what could happen in the next.</p>

        <p>The news is simply one giant psych-op meant to divide people and brainwash people and folk still don't get it. It's really disheartening to see those who fall for such tricks. The ones truly in control sit there and laugh while most of the public goes to news stories like chew toys.</p>

        <p>I normally try to ignore politics as much as possible. Incredibly depressing worrying about stuff you have basically no power to control. This is just the first time in my life you literally can’t ignore politics because these lockdowns affect every single person in one way or another.</p>

        <p>And you're right. It's certainly difficult with how demoralizing it can be with understanding the truth and politics. The only reason I got into politics was because of the second amendment and gun rights overall. My involvement in staying informed only escalated from that point. I was hardly political when I was at least 15, though I was largely into truth seeking and "conspiracies" as they label them and I simply accepted that poltics was simply evil no matter the affiliation. Which is still relevant, but now that I know more and understand the world better as an adult with it simultaneously affecting me more significantly, it's a struggle for sanity at this point. A couple of the hardest things for a human being is understanding the unknown, and not being able to control what is happening with the events around you.</p>

<p>That's what they want you to believe so that they can stay in power unchallenged. BTW, the world won't burn (the rulers won't let that happen), but it will be transformed if we do nothing.</p>
<p>&rt; I just want to make sure when my time comes, I die favorably and move on to the next life.</p>
<p>What if I told you...there is no next life?</p>

        <p>Saying the world will burn was a figure of speech. I dont share the same perception that when we die, that nothing happens. I think its narrow minded to think nothing happens after this life because that's too easy. Dont act so certain that you can just tell people that there is no next life and expect others to just think the same way, or just simply accept it.</p>

        <p>I am not certain there is no next life. However, it's pointless to focus on it while we're here in this world THAT IS BEING COMPLETELY DESTROYED by evil forces. It's an act of capitulation.</p>
