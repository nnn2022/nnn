        <p>Asking questions is good.</p>
<p>As for if you should get the vaccine, the overwhelming response here will be a resounding no. </p>
<p>The purpose of a vaccine is not to save others, it’s to save yourself. Which in your case you are young and healthy. Old people and others who are worried about their health, should worry about themselves.</p>
<p>It is not our job to take care of the world.</p>

        <p>I personally would not go anywhere fucking near one of those vaccines. Here is a sample of the literature on the subject and I have collected a full list of sources dismantling the fraud that is covid-19 here <a href="https://docdro.id/B5qrmV9">https://docdro.id/B5qrmV9</a></p>
<p>The International Journal of Clinical Practice:<br>
“COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.”<br>
“The risk of ADE in Covid-19 vaccines is non-theoretical and compelling”<br>
“Clinical trials of vaccine candidates have only been designed around immunogenicity as an efficacy end point and have not been designed to capture exposure of subjects to circulating virus after vaccination, which is when ADE/immunopathology is designed to occur. Thus, the absence of ADE evidence in COVID‐19 vaccine data so far does not absolve investigators from disclosing the risk of enhanced disease to vaccine trial participants, and it remains a realistic, non‐theoretical risk to the subjects.”<br>
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13795<br>
Vaccine Journal <br>
“Examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of different virus families. Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon.”<br>
“Vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines.”<br>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19022319/<br>
Nature Microbiology Journal: <br>
“Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials”<br>
“For non-macrophage tropic respiratory viruses such as RSV and measles, non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to induce ADE and ERD by forming immune complexes that deposit into airway tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways, resulting in inflammation, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. These prior observations of ADE with RSV and measles have many similarities to known COVID-19 clinical presentations.”<br>
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5<br>
PLOS Journal:<br>
“SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.”<br>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/<br>
Nature Journal:<br>
“Before allowing use of a COVID-19 vaccine in humans, regulators should evaluate safety with a range of virus strains and in more than one animal model.”<br>
“Work with the SARS virus shows that worrying immune responses were seen in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice. Also, some viral protein fragments can elicit more potent or less risky immune responses than others, and it makes sense to learn this in animal studies before trying them in people.”<br>

<p>The Lancet Journal:<br>
“We are writing to express concern about the use of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vector for a COVID-19 phase 1 vaccine study, and subsequent advanced trials. Over a decade ago, we completed the Step and Phambili phase 2b studies that evaluated an Ad5 vectored HIV-1 vaccine administered in three immunisations for efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. Both international studies found an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among vaccinated men.”<br>

        <p>The "you need to get vaccinated/wear a mask to protect others" is just bollocks then you are met with the "you're just being selfish"</p>
<p>So if you are immunocompromised or in an "at risk" category  then you already know that so you can take steps to protect yourself, instead you expect the whole population to get vaxxed, mask up , social distance etc etc and if they dont THEY are being selfish</p>
