        <p><strong>Kary Mullis on HIV, AIDS and Montagnier:</strong></p>
<h2>“They don’t know. Nobody really knows. This whole thing is a big sham. It’s ridiculous.”</h2>
<p><strong>Mullis asks Dr. Luc Montagnier for a reference stating ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.’</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“So, I didn’t get any more out of him, he (Montagnier) walked away after that. And the people standing around, by the way who were his colleagues there, looked at him thinking like he should come up with a better answer than that but he couldn’t and he just turned around and walked away.  I really thought he’d have an answer.  I really did! I mean, that was my last... I was right at the edge of my faith in the system... but I thought <strong>Montagnier</strong> will know why he thinks HIV causes it and he will tell me, ‘it’s because of this study,’ you know? But he didn’t have that.  <strong>None of those guys have that and that’s why they’re so weird, you know? That’s why they don’t want to say... they don’t want people like me walking up and asking those kinds of questions and they’re willing to go to great lengths to prevent that.</strong> They’re out on a limb. I wouldn’t want to be there with them.”
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W0XpMYMX0CM</p>
<p>Kary Mullis also stated:</p>
<p>&rt;“People keep asking me, ‘You mean you don’t believe that HIV causes AIDS?’ And I say, ‘Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant! I have no scientific evidence for it!’ I might believe in God, and He could have told me in a dream that HIV causes AIDS. But I wouldn’t stand up in front of scientists and say, ‘I believe HIV causes AIDS because God told me.’ I’d say, ‘I have papers here in hand and experiments that have been done that can be demonstrated to others.’ It’s not what somebody believes, it’s experimental proof that counts. And neither <strong>Montagnier,</strong> Gallo, nor anyone else had published papers describing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Mullis even had the opportunity do ask Montagnier personally about a reference proving that HIV causes AIDS. But he couldn’t name one. “It was damned irritating,“ as Mullis reported. “If Montagnier didn’t know the answer, who the hell did?“</strong></p>

<p>&rt;“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html">Gallo</a> and <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”</a></p>

        <p>Mullis is a biochemist, not an expert in virology. But Luc Montagnier is.</p>
<p>If you had difficulties to breathe, would you trust a dentist who claims that there are no lung diseases at all? Because that's what Mullis does.</p>
