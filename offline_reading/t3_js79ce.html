<title>An interaction I've just had with a supply teacher. According to her it's totally normal to mask 7 year olds and that they 'still do forms of affection, it just has to be verbal or "air X" instead', whatever the hell that means. Poor kids.</title>

        <p>Kids getting sick is inevitable. According to the CDC’s data, kids have over a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid. I don’t believe that torturing them with face masks is justified by extreme risk aversion. To each their own, though.</p>

        <p>Ok, but if your kids gets sick and nobody's following the guidelines, isn't there a high risk if them spreading it to more vulnerable people? I also fail to see how having your kid wear a mask is torture for them. I have younger siblings and they don't even notice. They can still hug their family and play with their friends.</p>

        <p>That’s really awesome if your siblings don’t mind! Life is certainly easier right now for people who can tolerate it. Same goes for adults. Many adults say they don’t notice their masks, but many others can’t wear them without overwhelming discomfort. Those people are living in a nightmare right now. I’m one of those people. I can tolerate it for 20 minutes at the store, but the sensation is overwhelming and I will never be able to participate fully in life again if they don’t go away at some point. When I think of a child feeling that way, it breaks my heart. Kids who find them even a little uncomfortable will be distracted from learning. Im happy to hear your loved ones are thriving and adapting. Everyone’s experience in their own body is valid, relevant, and unique. Your personal experience in your body might influence how you feel about all the changes we’re going through, like masks and restrictions. It really boils down to some essential questions about safety versus quality of life, individualism vs collectivism, authoritarianism vs small “l” libertarianism, and perception of simple vs complex threats. How much quality of life should someone be required to sacrifice for the comfort of strangers? Until very recently, people with compromised immune systems were expected to make their own risk assessments and take appropriate precautions. If we lock down and mask up for Covid, a virus with about a 99.7 survival rate overall, when exactly do we get to take off the masks? What’s the end game?</p>

        <p>Yup.  Thank god we’ve been working from home for years.  The fucking suffocating masks can fuck off.  20 minutes max and then I’m out of breath and feeling sick.  Bravo for those that aren’t sensitive enough to feel what breathing waste product air is doing to your body.  It’s WASTE for a reason...not meant to be rebreathed for any prolonged period of time. </p>
<p>I’m finding that the Groupthink mind control is SO thorough in the mask Nazis who also fully believe covid is 5-6 times worse than flu 🙄 that it’s like trying to talk politics.  Talking to a brick wall.</p>

        <p>I can definitely understand that many people are extremely uncomfortable in masks, but most little children I've met aren't. For the ones that are, they don't have to go out. Many schools have online options at this point. There are even some free online public schools. It's not ideal for kids to have to do school virtually, but it's better than having them or others being at risk. Again, I understand that the  quality of life there is really poor for  some people, but for most I've met it's fine. Many parents have even worked out safe playdates for their toddlers.</p>

        <p>Kid's have a 0.00084% chance of catching covid and or spreading it and dying. So all of these measures are COMPLETELY unnecessary. By isolating them from others it is actually doing more harm to their immune systems than to let them run free.</p>

        <p>Being asymptomatic doesn't mean you can't spread the germs. Little kids constantly touching their noses and mouths, then touching other people is definitely not a good plan. Also "read the science"? Lol</p>

        <p>Yes, go actually read the statistics and see how low the risk is.</p>
<p>e: it is WORTH taking the very low risk to give kids a normal, in-person education, without being traumatized by dystopian bullshit like having everyone masked and drenched in sanitizer</p>

        <p>Those same kids are touching mask that are suppose to remain clean with their dirty little hands thus defeating the purpose of the mask. Science is consistent, your line of thinking is not. </p>
<p>CDC recommends you replace your mask as soon as you touch it. Did you read that "<em>science"</em> ?  How many times do you think a child touches their mask in an hour? </p>
<p>I don't wear mask and I know more about the procedures and guidelines for wearing mask than you doomers and it is getting old, annoying, and infuriating due to the blatant hypocrisy. Especially since you are completely unaware of it.</p>

        <p>You don't even know me. How can you claim to know more about this? Of course, it's not good that they're touching their masks, but their guardians should be replacing it regularly. And it's better than them sticking their fingers in their mouths.</p>

        <p>How the hell are they going to replace it if they aren't in school with their kid? You haven't even thought how ridiculous it is to ensure that happens logistically. Look dude, I've pored over more scientific journals than you'd care to know and there are tons of issues that you and everyone else who thinks this is a great idea have overlooked.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the known carcinogen the medical masks are “sterilized” with known as <strong>Ethylene Oxide?</strong> Yeah, thought so. </p>

        <p>I went to a mall a few weeks ago and I was one of the only people without a mask. 3 different kids approached me that day, smiling and waving. Being able to smile back without looking like a criminal behind a mask was a great feeling.</p>
<p>Makes me think how sad some of these little kids must get not being able to see anyone’s faces anymore. Can’t tell if someone is frowning, angry, sad or happy at them anymore. </p>
<p>It’s disgusting how people can’t see that these kids are going to be the future of society and depriving them of basic human socialization at a young age is inhumane. They’ll never be able to realize it isn’t ‘just a mask’ until it’s too late.</p>

        <p>I don't get it -- the teacher is right. Kids can get and spread COVID just like anyone else. </p>
<p>Pretty much every kid you see outside here has a mask on, even kids in strollers. They're fine.  It's not 'everyone should have a mask on, except if you're a child and usually a germ vector.' People realize it's hard to keep one on a baby and you do see babies without them (and babies with them) but any kid old enough to talk/talk to you explain they need to keep their mask on outside the house. No big deal.</p>

        <p>They're being kids -- with masks on when they're not at home. Pretty much every kid in my city has a mask, dude; at least every one I see when I'm out and they're required for everyone who's in in-person school, and for every person on any transit or in an enclosed space or outdoors if there's anyone nearby. It's not me having this thought process. It's everyone.</p>

        <p>Then you're all idiots and you've been mass brainwashed to think that it's ok to muzzle babies and kids when it's not. Seriously and I say this very seriously now... turn off the news.</p>

        <p>Mask should only be worn in a sterile environment. Honestly, would you prefer your surgeon using a mask in the operating room he wore getting Starbucks or the one he wore in a public restroom or porter potty? The CDC recommends replacing any mask immediately after touching it or adjusting it.</p>
<p>Did you  "read that <em>Science"</em> ? Children playing with mask that are supposed to remain sterile defeats the purpose. This is what we're constantly pointing out about your kind not thinking at all and just going along with things that aren't consistent or make any sense. You aren't even aware of the CDC's recommendations which tells me how much you care about the <em>"science",</em> lol!</p>

        <p>You are.... deeply confused. Or you're letting children on a playground perform surgery on you, which would also suggest you're confused (and other things). </p>
<p>The CDC does not say masks are only to be used in sterile environments. That's not a thing.</p>

        <p>I personally feel that it's incredibly important for children to learn facial expressions. I'm autistic and therefore struggle with facial expressions and I think kids only seeing a third of people's faces every day for a year would be incredibly damaging to their development.</p>
