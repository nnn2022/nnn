        <p>We have seen this behavior on both sides. This is a personality problem. Not a mask versus no mask problem. I have seen videos of people dragging someone put of a store by the hair for not wearing one. Why aren't people posting those?</p>

<p>Btw this woman is completely deranged and the man's reaction is hilariously dumb but I don't even expect every doofus to know how to handle mental cases.</p>

        <p>Yep. I wouldn't do this, but I would definitely be doing it in my head. This shit's got to stop. Not that I'm condoning it, but it's not surprising when you treat customers like this, demanding that they put a diaper on their face just for food and any business that enforces a dress code, especially one as ridiculous as this, deserves all they get. They're the ones who decided to be Nazis in the first place. I would definitely show them my rights and do all I could against them because what they're doing just isn't right.  I don't agree with the loud things like marching into stores with a ton of people yelling and chanting because that just makes people laugh at us, but I think a large group of people peacefully walking into a store and dispersing throughout it, just doing their business is a great idea. And if eventually a war is what is needed to get these tyrants to stop, then a war it may have to be since they're the side that is okay with violence against people like us in the first place.</p>

        <p>All people act like this. A man was shot and killed for not wearing a mask. People have been beaten even by police for not wearing a mask.  </p>
<p>And people will do this back to those that try and force them to wear masks. </p>

        <p>Sorry OP, I'm going to have to disagree, and I know this will be an unpopular opinion to most on this sub. This woman has been destroyed by the lockdown. She is desperate for some normalcy. The sobbing in the end was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>It's strange too cause in a way the cashier got some poetic justice. If he'd have served her she would have been gone and he wouldn't have a giant mess to clean up. This is what a year of this madness drives people to do. I'm not advocating those who have calmer heads to start mimicking this behavior but at this point instead of blaming her I'm like, </p>
<p>"Well this is what happens when you don't treat people like people for over a year."</p>
<p>PSA: If you're a cashier just serve the maskless people and get them out of your store as quickly as possible otherwise you may have to deal with this or worse.</p>

        <p>Yeah I would have had a different reaction to this a year ago. It’s not how I’m going to spend my time but you are right, treating people like this for over a year has consequences. I used to think people who were rude to customer service people were rude and trashy. Now flight attendants wake you up while for your mask slipping while you sleep and watch you eat. People on the other thread are so excited that he dragged her out and they think it means that’s socially acceptable now. It’s not okay to touch people. I love how in between talking about how sexual assault is bad ( which it is obviously these people want to touch and drug everyone and that’s somehow righteous.</p>

        <p>Last fall two dudes in NYC in separate incidents stabbed business employees for "making" them wear a mask.  I thought it was stupid.</p>
<p>But after that I got asked to put on a mask much less.  Obviously some highly paid lawyers began to factor in risk of violence along with risk of disease.</p>

        <p>Get in a physical altercation with a person during a "pandemic" while also making minimum wage... sure that makes sense.</p>

        <p>Again, I don't do this. People don't mess with me because some people have the sense to mind their own business.</p>
<p>Pretty rich coming from an actual child though.</p>

        <p>There’s plenty of people who want to be left alone to live their life and breathe. Not everyone has the same circumstances as you. But I guess disabilities don’t exist , everyone who doesn’t listen to the television and random abusers acts like this. People like you are so sure you are on the right side of this, enjoy the hellscape you are building.</p>
