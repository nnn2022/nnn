    <strong>Callout to people of Ireland</strong>
    <p><p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Just seeing that Michael D. has signed off on the law that discriminates against those who haven't been vaccinated and those who are pending vaccinations if they so choose, by allowing only vaccinated people access to indoor hospitality. A dangerous precendent that will see more premises and business with restricted or denied access to the unvaccinated by Christmas time.</p>
<p>The media here is making it out that the "vast majority" of people are supportive of this new law, although from some independent polls I've seen, it doesn't seem to be the case? </p>
<p>For e.g. www.gript.ie/poll-do-you-support-vaccine-passports-for-indoor-dining/ shows almost 5k votes, with only 4% in favour?</p>
<p>To be honest, I thought Mike D. had a bit more sense than to sign this bill into law, but it's done.</p>
<p>I'm genuinely asking if there are those Irish out there witnessing this unfold before us, that don't agree with this? Whether you're vaccinated or not this is wrong on so many levels and I find it even harder to believe that the majority of people here are in favour of this.</p>
<p>Whoever is out there that opposes this we need to gather, there have been protests of thousands of people in Dublin, but it was minimized and radicalised by the media. Where did those people find out about the protest? </p>
<p>I feel so in the dark right now in regards to who is actually on my side in all of this, where are you? Come together and show our strength in numbers.</p>
<p>The signatories would be turning in their graves at the thought of what's happening to our Republic. The people have more power than the Government and NPHET. </p>
<p>Just need to know there's a community of like minded people still left on this island.</p></p>

        <p>My hope is that this is driven by propaganda and the real feeling of people will be felt post-legislation on the streets. Miserable and angry people with nothing to lose are a force to reckon with.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've seen some pubs already come out and say they're not reopening on Monday in solidarity, but that's just a handful. </p>
<p>If the vaccinated here had any shred of decency in them they would avoid indoor dining, and I believe there are a lot of vaccinated people who would do just that, but then you have that certain kind, the agent smiths, who already have their tables booked</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing: if the vaccines work, then eventually society will open up to everyone. If they don’t work and you need endless boosters, people are going to get pissed off when they are faced with endless rounds of month/several months long symptoms. There’s no happy medium here where people are joyful taking 2 of 3 boosters a year that fuck with your health.</p>

        <p>Problem with that is you have so many people who would gladly take monthly shots as a virtue signal to show everyone around them how great they are for protecting the vulnerable etc. I've seen these comments, patronizing and condescending towards people any way skeptical. "This is why we're going into lockdown number seven, because <em>selfish</em> people don't care about other's health, but look at me, I'm proving that I care by getting monthly shots outside the city hall." This is the logic I'm seeing lately, it's madness. People willingly asking for more restrictions and stricter measures. </p>
<p>How many times have we seen comments saying "oh just let them die" etc. You cannot claim to care about people's health unless you care about <em>all</em> peoples health, not just the ones you pick and choose.</p>
<p>Plus, we've already began to see the back tracking on these shots. When it first came out, Pfizers shot was apparently 95%+ effective at eliminating symptoms and spreading the virus. Six months and two shots later, efficacy has gone down to what 60% and it doesn't eliminate symptoms or spreading the virus. Pfizer CEO came out there saying oh you're gonna need a third shot. And then of course "delta" is after appearing, so then all the shots that have already been administered are starting to look like they don't mean shit, but now because of this miraculously more potent variant that comes along, you're gonna have to go away and get another shot because the first two aren't as effective. Rinse and repeat.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear. I spend a good almost year in Ireland with many a fond memory. I'm surprised the people I once knew from that very proud island would see allow this to get passed through. </p>
<p>Mainly also because a double bolted door wouldn't get between an Irishman and his lunchtime beer for the most part when I was there!</p>

        <p>It is sad to see, the vast majority of people just threw the hands up in March last year and did what they were told. The novelty of working from home wore off after a week, but the amount of people here that were begging for lockdowns to stay in place so they didn't have to leave or see people was crazy.</p>
<p>Imagine this, last year you were only allowed to enter a pub if you were spending €9 on a meal in the premises. Now you need a digital vaccine cert to be allowed in for an hour and a half only. It's crazy.</p>
<p>And last year I was telling people who were giving out about having to buy chicken goujons for a pint, just wait until they make you get an ID for Covid. And they called me crazy.</p>

        <p>Yep, I've seen the same in Australia. With France and Greece gone, if Ireland and the UK go too, that will be the start of the global dominoes on this point. I hope it isn't so.</p>
<p>I worked at small rural Irish pubs albeit it 15 years ago, I still can't see how the locals in these small towns would accept it.</p>

        <p>Easy. To make this happen, government will pick a few pubs that disobeyed and put the owners in jail. Media will put this everywhere in the news and scold the owners for being completely reckless. 1 entire month of news telling how the owners that disobeyed destroyed their families and community.</p>
<p>After that, with much grieve, no one will dare disobey the government again. If this goes global, there will be no push from other free countries against the dictatorial regime like we used to have the US and other free countries. And that's the end of mankind. You can read the rest in the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>If you don't know Christ yet, my advice is that you seek him while there is time.</p>

        <p>That's what I'm thinking too, I can see it happen all over the world. It really is a global division campaign, surpasses racism, sexism and all the other isms. It's the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated, no matter what your age, gender, country, skin colour etc. Global civil war it feels like they're brewing.</p>
<p>But like it doesn't add up for me that the majority are rolling over and taking it? Sure most of the people I know are vaccinated, but they're not down your throat about it, but the <em>only</em> reason they've gotten it is because they were going to be let go from work, or they wanted a week on a beach in Spain, or eat a meal indoors. Not one vaccinated person I know in real life has gotten it because they believe they work. They just "want things to go back to normal."</p>

        <p>Absolutely it is. All over this "delta" fearmongering. Literally in the Rothschild playbook from how many years ago - they'll introduce the virus and half the people will dive on the vaccines, then there'll be the "more lethal variant" that will encourage the remaining unvaccinated to get their jabs, and whoevers left will ship them to camps or kill each other off until they're the last ones standing.</p>

        <p>Mate, everyone with a brain and realistic thinking knew this shit would last AT LEAST two years. </p>
<p>I’m in the music industry, and EVERYONE was in the knowledge at the very beginning, that this would last at least two years. Anyone who didn’t think this were doing wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Even my dads office said at the very back, office work will resume in 2022.</p>

        <p>That's bullshit and you know it. Every politician and media outlet has been spraying since February last year, "next two weeks" here and "temporary measure" there. </p>
<p>Varadkar told us we would be closed for two weeks and we've been in a lockdown since March 2020.</p>

        <p>I mean maybe but my original point was that anyone with a half a brain would of known before that was all said, that it would be at least two years. 
People in government say things to appease the people.
Remember the panic shopping when it was a two week lockdown? Imagine the mayhem if he had said two years.</p>
<p>It’s always been two years.</p>

        <p>You're right, this was never intended to be short term. Can you not see that its a guise to usher in stricter population control? Do you not see the shift in wealth over the last 18 months? Do you not see the people who are pushing the vaccines are the ones that are making millions? Do you not see the blatant media bias in every headline you read? Do you not see other countries around the world threatening prison time for not getting an experimental gene therapy shot? Do you not see blatant divide and conquer tactics being used? Do you not see whats really going on? </p>
<p>Reality is, if this pandemic was as deadly and serious as those profiting from it make it out to be, there wouldn't be a division of anti this and pro that. The whole population would be scrambling over the bodies piled in the streets to get the shot. </p>
<p>But that's not the case. And reality is, two of us may get on swimmingly if there was no Covid, yet its caused an Us &amp; Them situation, which can only escalate until there will eventually be violence. This is what we're trying to prevent. Can you not see the precedents being laid out each and every day as new restrictions are imposed? </p>
<p>Come on man we're all on the same team here, end this bullshit us and them mentality.</p>

<p>But again though, you're side stepping with weak insults, its about having an open mind that unfortunately not many people seem to have these days.

        <p>The Gript reader base also voted 96% against giving Tony Holohan the freedom of Dublin despite what I've seen, people think he's a fairly genuine figure in how we've handled the pandemic. He's very popular nationwide and you can see that around the time his wife died on social media. An online poll on the Gript should be an instant red flag. Get a reputable publication to do a survey where they have something to lose then people might consider it. It's like saying "are you pro marriage equality?" and only polling students, just not a fair representation.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://Journal.ie">Journal.ie</a> had their own poll and 68% said they were against it, which has it's own problems but I definitely feel it's less biased reader base than the Gript/John McGuirk. https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-vaccine-passport-ireland-5406617-Apr2021/</p>
