    <strong>This is a Fun Time Guys! Perk Up!!</strong>
    <p><p><em>Has Peace Cost You Your Strength? Has victory defeated you?</em></p>
<p><strong>I keep seeing posts calling out the hypocrisy of the government and the white coat wearing dweebs.</strong> </p>
<p>This is fantastic news! Finally we are seeing how corrupt the government is. Finally we are seeing the truth of how corrupt the medical structure is! Fantastic!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Cause now we can finally start evaluating our own beliefs of what true power and freedom means and requires! We can now without prejudice examine and learn more about what it takes to be healthy.</p>
<p>We are growing up and gaining wisdom right now! The idolization of politicians, left/right, scientists is crumbling.</p>
<p>Yes the path is hard, but we will come out with freedom and power over our lives in the end!</p>
<p><em>Maybe now we can be great thinkers and re-examine everything fed to us. Do we now blindly trust the studies without taking the time to examine them? Do we start learning the jargon they use so we know what they are referring to? Do we stop letting others thinking for us? Or do we be lazy and let others do the science and thinking for us?</em></p>
<p><em>Has Peace Cost You Your Strength? Has victory defeated you?</em></p>
<p><strong>I keep seeing posts on how the government is keeping you from visiting family</strong></p>
<p>Are you sure? Or are you just self enforcing the isolation cause you saw a news story (remember we already know they lie and exaggerate) of how the police may arrest you for visiting grandma.</p>
<p>How about you step out and just go visit your family. Have a dinner come hell or high water (hint: it likely won't).</p>
<p>Is your loved one in a hospital or care home? Round up your family and friends and go in as a large group. They ask for you to wear a mask? Say you have a medical condition. <strong>STAND YOUR GROUND</strong></p>
<p>Puppets normally are only following "procedure". </p>
<p><em>Do we finally now realize the strength of family and love? Do we now strive to build real connections vs the vapid relationships of the internet and urban environment? Or do are we content to wallow in our bubbles cause the System will provide?</em></p>
<p><em>Has Peace Cost You Your Strength? Has victory defeated you?</em></p>
<p><strong>I keep seeing posts on how COVID means that life won't return to normal</strong></p>
<p>Good! Maybe seeing how easily our old way of living crumbled, with no one defending it, means it was weak and vapid anyways.</p>
<p>And the good news is that we can evaluate what is truly important to us! Maybe now we can learn to paint or write cause it's important to us. We can pick up skills like gardening, sewing, carpentry etc. </p>
<p>The system we relied on to hide our ineptitude of providing for ourselves is coming to an end. This is great we can finally stop with wasting our lives and mucking about and learn something constructive.</p>
<p><em>This is a time to shed. Shed away the useless parts of our lives. Do you really need that fancy phone? Do you really need that fancy car? Do you really need to be able to Uber Eats?</em> </p>
<p><em>Has Peace Cost You Your Strength? Has victory defeated you?</em></p>
<p><strong>I keep seeing posts of how small businesses are closing at the expense of Big Box stores, costing jobs and livelihoods</strong></p>
<p>Good! Maybe now we can truly realize how lazy we were when we decided to shop at Wal-Mart and Amazon.</p>
<p>But they had lower prices you say, that's all I could afford! Good! Maybe now you can start to re-evaluate whether all the purchases you made were necessary. Maybe now you can start learning to sew and patch up your clothes instead of buying new ones. Maybe now you can learn how to cook instead of buying processed foods. Even better yet learn to garden.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your money within you community (the Sikhs, Jews, Armenians, Koreans, and Muslims do it and that's why they are such strong communities). Do you think a small business could be shut down if 200 people showed up in front to stand down the cops?</strong></p>
<p><em>Maybe you don't need all that stuff. Maybe you were buying all that cheap made in China junk to fill a hole in your heart. Maybe you wanted status that now in a time of calamity means nothing. Or were you just too lazy to do things yourself?</em></p>
<p><em>Has Peace Cost You Your Strength? Has victory defeated you?</em></p>
<p><strong>Finally I keep seeing posts about MANDATORY vaccines and masks</strong></p>
<p>I mean they can <em>TRY.</em> What is stopping you from saying you have a medical condition and not wear one when in a store?</p>
<p><strong>HINT: REQUIRING AN UNOBSTRUCTED INFLOW OF OXYGEN IS A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT ALL LIFE HAS ON EARTH</strong></p>
<p>A store requiring proof of vaccination to enter? Say you do not consent to sharing private medical records.</p>
<p>They want you to take a vaccine to work? That is an offer from them that you can decline. Decline the product of COVID vaccine they are offering you by requiring them to extract said vaccine from your system at the end of every shift and at the end of your contract.</p>
<p><strong>THE SYSTEM REQUIRES YOUR CONSENT TO FUNCTION.</strong></p>
<p>And yes you may be laid off from work, not get the benefit of a raise, be barred from attending school.</p>
<p>This lets you re-evaluate what is truly important. And as life always finds a way, you being life will find a way to do what you want.</p>
<p>This is not a time of Peace, We are currently Not Victorious.</p>
<p>Perk up guys! We are finally facing the truth we have always wanted to find :)</p></p>

        <p>Thanks man, I totally agree, and was thinking the exact same thing. I'm lucky to be already growing my own food, making my own herbal medicine, paying rent instead of having a mortgage. I think loads of people defending this idiocracy have just been made too dependent on the current system and are afraid to lose the couple of breadcrumbs they are given, which makes it easier for the current elite to consolidate their powers. But it's beginning to be too much, and I just hope more and more people will start to wake up. I was almost at the brink of losing my sanity because of all the madness, but your post helped a lot. Thanks again!</p>
<p>P.S. I think their plan is to act like they are willing to "erase" our upcoming huge financial debts, if we accept to comply with their plans. I say fuck 'em. Let's invent our own money, and don't accept dollars or euros or whatever anymore. Just make regional currencies. If they come to our door to evict us, just tell them that we don't use their money anymore.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the attitude that will see us through this. One thing is absolutely correct. The old world is dead but the new world is just beginning. We have an opportunity to craft a new world away from the vapid empire of nothing we were born into. Time to start the world.</p>
