    <strong>Australia, let‚Äôs talk about masks.</strong>
    <p><p>All of you people wearing masks and think you‚Äôre doing the right thing and preventing disease. Make sure your mask is approved by the TGA (therapeutic goods administration). If it‚Äôs not then you‚Äôre simply virtue signalling.</p>
<p>The TGA regulates masks as a medical device if a manufacturer states it is to be used for preventing the transmission of disease between people. Medical devices must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG)</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I'll go with virtue signalling for $800 Alex üëç Judging by the knee buckling comments I read over the weekend I seriously doubt there is a single mask wearer in this city doing it for genuine reasons, unless they are complete morons which to me, at this point, is just as unforgivable. They've had a year to learn the true, unbiased facts about this thing, it's clear they're not interested in changing.</p>
<p>Looking through people's cars and counting how many are muzzled, that was it for me.</p>
