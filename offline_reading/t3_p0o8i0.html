        <p>I watched the video.  I emailed him to get the information he is stating.  Just because someone says something, doesn't mean it's true.  Google him.  I can't find his state-certified records.  I'm not saying it's not true but please do not take a man's word of it if you don't know him personally.  Just my opinion.</p>

        <p>Yup, been reading these links.  Interesting how the title above each link is very biased and the information actually debunks the title or provides the whole truth.  So sad how people will believe a person with no labeled, factual credentials vs the people, group or agency that does it for a living and receives the data.  Just shows how people are so fixated on conspiracies theories that support their agenda than researching the subject.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to find any information on this Miguel Escobar guy. All I've found is that he is a physicians assistant in Texas and that he has two crappy reviews. Is there anything else you've found? Its pretty obvious that this guys a joke but there has to be more information to expose this guy right?</p>

        <p>can go ahead and say he probably didn't have top secret clearance to knowledge about the virus before the rest of us did since we all heard about it before it ever made landfall...first 2 minutes he's trying to sound credible to the untrained ear but to the trained of us, really just discredits himself.</p>
