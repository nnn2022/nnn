    <strong>How many of the covid vaccinated unabashedly looked down and wished harm on anti-maskers/critical thinkers?</strong>
    <p><p>There’s a difference between having an opinion and being the haughty, arrogant type we know. </p>
<p>Now they’re suffering from anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>Now they’ve been stricken with Bell’s Palsy.</p>
<p>Now they are struggling to recover feeling in both sides of their bodies.</p>
<p>And hardly anyone believes them.</p>
<p>Except those who knew this was a scam all along. This was a long, drawn out separation of wheat from tares.</p>
<p>They wish they could just go back to normal. Yet, accepted their lives being obstructed upon by vastly invasive measures.</p>
<p>Please know, I’m not wishing harm and know many of the people suffering truly thought they were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>But at what cost?</p></p>
