    <p><p>I hate WW2 analogies, but the same people ratting on their neighbours for breaking quarantine are the same people who would be ratting on their neighbours for hiding Jews in WW2. The west is more passive than ever; there's no hope.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it really shows that the West has an extremely LOUD elitist class (of mostly spoiled, "educated" brats) that thinks they are a part of a natural aristocracy of intellectuals, "experts", and corporate bourgeoisie. And of course, the millions of Redditor type anti-human introverted shmucks who think they are a part of that class / worship that class (and the average idiot who will listen to anyone in a suit). The former envies the control modern dictators have over their states. They are OCD control freaks. They think they are so smart that they can design their perfect fascist state and make everyone life a lower class version of their lives. </p>
<p>One of the downsides of capitalism is that it creates so much wealth that the bored bourgeoisie becomes nihilistic and ignorant. They don't know how to create value for others, so they need ridiculous grand ideas for society to feel a part of anything bigger, like the ridiculous idea of completely eradicating virus. Government is the ultimate force for the know-it-all busy body. That's why anything anti-govt is a direct attack on these people's existence.  Letting the average person mind their own business renders the elitists useless and powerless. Of course they are going to fight for their life to push propaganda that justifies their "virtue". They cannot admit they were wrong, or no longer relevant. Their existence depends on this scam. </p>
<p>Of course it's really about corporate leaders getting more money, and just using these dumb ass boy scout authoritarians as puppets....</p>

        <p>From both perspectives - people reporting their neighbors breaking the quarantine and people reporting neighbors hiding jews - it is the same, following the laws and rules made by their government.</p>
<p>Not mentioning the obvious argument, that those a different kind of governments with different targets.</p>
<p>The consequences of both actions are different. During WW2 it was very likely, that those people land in camps and die.
During a quarantine, it is a slap on the wrist and a fine.</p>
<p>The correct analogy would have been between people reporting their neighbors during a quarantine and jews reporting Nazis not doing their job. So both reporters have a chance to live the next day.</p>

        <p>Of course I haven't.  Only my own ideologies and beliefs align exactly with my own.  The point is to pick someone with whom yours CLOSEST align.</p>
<p>But I'm confused at this point, are you just straight up arguing against democracy?  Election reform?  What is your point?</p>

        <p>I'm suggesting that it's possible, even in a democracy, to have nothing but crappy choices. If no candidate comes close to aligning with your beliefs, or they say they do but don't act in accordance with those beliefs, you may get shitty leaders.</p>
<p>Aside from any of that, if the government mandates or orders are wrong, you should not obey them. Unless you believe that all protests, of any sort, are somehow un-democratic? How dare we the little people, question our duly elected dictator overlords?</p>

        <p>Just because no candidates aligned with YOUR beliefs doesn't mean that's true for the majority of voters.  Just because you think you should be allowed to rape women doesn't mean you should be allowed to rape women.  Believing that you shouldn't get a dui for driving drunk doesn't mean that you shouldn't be charged with a dui for driving drunk.  I agree, the country definitely needs some election reform, it could definitely be better.  But this isn't Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>And no one ever said you couldn't question your leaders.  No one said you couldn't protest, they just said wear a fucking mask while you do it.  Jesus you people act like you're standing up to Hitler telling you to kill Jews.  You guys pretend you're patriotic heros for freight training a deadly virus around during a pandemic.  No, you're standing up to people telling you not to spread a dangerous virus by wearing a small cloth over your mouth at the grocery store.</p>
<p>There is a worldwide pandemic going on, did you think that nothing would change?  You thought that a worldwide pandemic wouldn't affect anybody?  That we could all just ignore it?  Yeah, this shit sucks, but we're all going through it.  You wanna complain to the government?  Fine!  Me too!!  Complain about why the government gives $1.7 trillion bailouts to big corporations, and not the small businesses that got shutdown.  Complain about the mishandling of the virus, complain about firing the pandemic team, and the WHO.  Quit complaining about mask mandates, that shit is petty and insignificant.</p>
<p>If you people would just sit down and shut up for two fucking minutes, the teacher would let us go to recess.  But no, you've gotta keep fucking it up for the rest of the class.</p>

        <p>You were surprised we didn't want to obey our elected leaders. I showed you why that shouldn't be surprising, and blindly following because "democracy!" was foolish.</p>
<p>We have had many pandemics of this magnitude in the past, and only the ignorant fear of the masses has been different this time. During the 1968 flu pandemic that killed rather more, they held Woodstock. Covid is mild, quit being a terrified little shit and move on.</p>

        <p>Do you people listen to the words that come out of your mouth?  You just explained to me how the 1968 flu pandemic was so deadly and that nobody did anything about it/held woodstock.  Do you not realize that it killed so many people because no one did anything about it/held woodstock?! That's somehow your logic here?!  That when no one did anything about the flu in 1968 it was so deadly, and that's somehow why we shouldn't do anything about the virus now??  Besides, coronavirus has killed almost three times as many people as the 1968 flu, and that's with a large portion of the population actually acting like adults!</p>
<p>I'm not scared of it, I'm tired of dealing with this shit.  I got it months ago, but everyone reacts differently.  And it's not gonna ever go away because you fuckers think it's some sort of patriotic call to arms to freight train it all over the fucking country.  If you want to complain about freedoms then do that.  Complain about the NSA keeping tabs on everyone, complain about Google and Facebook storing your data.  Complain about internet neutrality laws.  But you just sound dumb when you complain about perfectly reasonable and temporary reactive solutions to a worldwide pandemic.</p>

        <p>Honestly. The other redditor isn't wrong. The moment we give our government any sort of power they take it and keep it and sometimes expand that power. Its how those with power role, always wanting more. However, I agree that wearing a mask is nothing in comparison to those who have had loved ones die to COVID. Its nice to think its inconsequential but God forbid someone in their family gets it and dies (i truly hope it doesn't happen to any of you) and what alot of these people don't understand as even though it can be mild to most harmful to some and severe to a small amount. All 3 have LASTING effects months after infection. I have a coworker who is on restricted duty MONTHS after catching it because the damage it did to his lungs is making it hard for him to breath still. This isn't a joke and herd immunity will not work. Wear a fucking mask. So its not someone in your family who dies from this "almost harmless" virus.</p>
