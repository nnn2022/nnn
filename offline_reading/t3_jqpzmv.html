    <strong>Geriaphobia - “Flu jab blunder brought unexpected benefits for Britain’s pension black hole” Telegraph, 29th March 2017. Plus evidence of malice aforethought last Spring and this Winter. And now South Korea gets in on the act...</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/03/29/flu-jab-blunder-brought-unexpected-benefits-britains-pension/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/03/29/flu-jab-blunder-brought-unexpected-benefits-britains-pension/</a></p>
<p>Yes, that's right: this piece explains how <strong>a rise in deaths of old people, large enough to lower life expectancy</strong> for the first time in twenty years, is good for the pension pots.</p>
<p>An accountant’s view on Influenza.</p>
<p><strong>Flu jab blunder brought unexpected benefits for Britain’s pension black hole</strong>•</p>
<p>Sarah Knapton, SCIENCE EDITOR, THE TELEGRAPH (UK) 29 March 2017 • 6:47pm</p>
<p>“The flu jab blunder which contributed to the largest spike in deaths in a generation may have brought <strong>unexpected benefits for Britain’s pension black hole</strong>, a new report suggests. Latest projections from The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) show that the increase in the mortality rate in 2016 has slightly reduced overall life expectancy for the over 65s, down 1.3 per cent for men, and 2 per cent for women.</p>
<p>According to Mercer, the world’s largest human resources consulting firm, <strong>the shift has removed around £28 billion of pension scheme liabilities from the balance sheets of FTSE350 companies.”</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it wasn’t a “blunder” at all. Rather than “not working on that year’s flu strain” suppose it was actually lowering the immune systems of otherwise healthy people. </p>
<p>From the same newspaper that was implicitly advocating a cull of the elderly this March:</p>
<p>March 2020 - UK Telegraph journalist said coronavirus ‘cull’ of elderly could benefit economy and then the plan went into action to maximise the death toll.</p>
<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/11/telegraph-journalist-says-coronavirus-cull-elderly-benefit-economy-12383907/">https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/11/telegraph-journalist-says-coronavirus-cull-elderly-benefit-economy-12383907/</a></p>
<p>Then he said: ‘Not to put too fine a point on it, from an entirely disinterested economic perspective, the COVID-19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents.’</p>
<p>A screengrab of Warner’s comments on ‘culling elderly dependents’ received a strong backlash online, with readers blasting them as ‘despicable’ and ‘deeply sinister’.</p>
<p>Of course, what makes this truly sinister, verging on satanic, is the systematic decision-making, here and abroad, that resulted in COVID patients being moved into care homes with the vulnerable elderly a few weeks’ after this ‘cull’ story appeared. We were clearly being softened up for the kill.</p>

<p>"The daughter of a 91-year-old gran who died of <strong>Covid-19</strong> she contracted in a care home is demanding to know why her mum was “sacrificed” by ministers.</p>
<p>Her daughter Linda hit out at what she called a “scandalous” policy to release coronavirus patients into care homes and called for her mum’s death to be investigated as part of a wider review."</p>

<p>Not in Hong Kong though, where they still seem to have some respect for their old:</p>
<p>“Most important is stopping the transmission from hospital to nursing home,” Lum said. “We do a very good job on isolation. Once we have any person infected we isolate them in hospital for three months and at the same time we isolate all the close contact people in a separate quarantine centre for 14 days for observation.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/mps-hear-why-hong-kong-had-no-covid-19-care-home-deaths">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/mps-hear-why-hong-kong-had-no-covid-19-care-home-deaths</a></p>
<p>The rationale/ justification was clearly that they needed the hospital beds in anticipation of the flood of COVictims, but this looks more plausibly like a cull, a controlled and effective sacrifice to bump up numbers for public hysteria and to dispatch the elderly safely.</p>
<p>This was clearly the rubric behind Sweden’s decision-making. They dispatched their elderly without lockdowns or closures and now at least have a functioning economy. The cull “worked” for them. Sweden’s per capita death rate looks high, but is mainly due to their well-above-average population percentage of over 70s. As of June, around half of the Swedish COVictims were from nursing homes:</p>

<p>Also, more than 40% of US ‘virus‘ deaths occur in nursing homes:</p>

<p>They needed those high fatality statistics initially, to justify the pandemic and lockdown measures. They’ll need them again this winter to ensure we continue to accept their push towards corporate totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Actually the South Korea flu vaccine death toll has risen to nearly <strong>100</strong>. Hardly any reports in the western media, and these numbers are the ones they haven’t conflated with COVID:</p>

<p>This is the AI mindset. Cheaper to cull the elderly than reward their lifetimes of hard work with a comfortable dotage. I guess we have that to look forward to.</p>
