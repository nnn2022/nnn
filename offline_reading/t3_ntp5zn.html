        <p>It isn't just the American government saying it. It's the CDC, the NHS, WHO, Public Health England and just about every government in the world saying it.</p>
<p>Governments have put people on lockdown, spent billions on mask mandates and testing and tanked the economy for what? To make you wear a mask? What's the point? What do they get from it? This whole thing has not been good for any government anywhere.</p>
<p>I'm not disputing the disabilities act. I'm saying that making it difficult for some people to utilise a luxury like a zoo to prevent millions more potential deaths is a fair trade off.</p>

        <p>What's the point? Look at the transfer of wealth that happened during the pandemic. Small businesses all over were shut down while major chains were allowed to stay open. How does that make any sense for a pandemic? It is not about health but about control.</p>

<p>Risking people's lives so I can go for a drink at the pub, buy a sofa or try on an item of clothing before I buy it is downright selfish. Especially with online shopping and returns being as easy as they are today.</p>

        <p>Liberty is being in charge of yourself. The government is not meant to run your life. It is not supposed to be a nanny to all. The government is not supposed to run a free economy. We don't lose them money by not going to work. They are strangling the livelihood of businesses and their employees when they decide they get to shut you down. </p>
<p>You talk about it being selfish. What is selfish is trying to lock down more than half the population, taking their jobs, isolating them, forcing people to die alone. They separated families through travel bans. They forced schools to close. </p>
<p>All of this was detrimental. Based on the data from the cdc who and all the rest this was never something to be feared. But they went ahead and controlled everyone's speech on the subject. They censored people like crazy. </p>
<p>They took away freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (unless it was for a govt approved protest) freedom of privacy and lots of other shit as a temporary measure. There is nothing more permanent than a temporary government measure. Just look at the hightened airport security after 9/11. That has been proven to be security theater just like all this is security theater. </p>
<p>The people in the government telling you to wear a mask, don't travel and don't social distance have been doing so themselves. So is it safe for politicians to have dinner inside but not the rest of the population? Travel is unsafe unless you are a legislator? </p>
<p>Dr fauci didn't even agree with the measures they were using according to his emails. Fauci doesn't think masks work for this either. Do we just ignore that or do we think for ourselves and stop listening to people who don't follow their own rules.</p>

        <p>&rt;Liberty is being in charge of yourself. The government is not meant to run your life. It is not supposed to be a nanny to all. The government is not supposed to run a free economy. We don't lose them money by not going to work. They are strangling the livelihood of businesses and their employees when they decide they get to shut you down. </p>
<p>When something is dangerous we need rules to keep people safe. It's called the law. We need the law so that food suppliers don't make us sick, so gun suppliers don't give a gun to someone who is unstable, so that deadly diseases don't spread around the world and kill everyone. It is literally the government's job to keep us safe from the people who would harm us.</p>
<p>&rt;You talk about it being selfish. What is selfish is trying to lock down more than half the population, taking their jobs, isolating them, forcing people to die alone. They separated families through travel bans. They forced schools to close. </p>
<p>How is it selfish? You still haven't given me a single thing that the government actually get out of lockdown. They did those things so you don't catch a disease that has killed 3.7 million people. Just because you are healthy enough to fight this off doesn't mean everyone is.</p>
<p>They censored people to protect people. Spreading misinformation could kill someone.</p>
<p>Heightened airport security is still around because so are the terrorists. Covid will be around for a long time, yes, but here in the UK things are returning to normal. Clubs will be reopening this summer. Before you know it we will be maskless again, until then we need to keep the vulnerable safe.</p>
<p>The behaviour of individual politicians is not relevant. A group of experts have decided how best to keep people healthy and we are doing those things. There are going to be hypocrites who do as they please in every situation, but just because they're breaking the law doesn't mean it's ok for us to.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr fauci didn't even agree with the measures they were using according to his emails. Fauci doesn't think masks work for this either. Do we just ignore that or do we think for ourselves and stop listening to people who don't follow their own rules.</p>
<p>He thought store bought masks probably didn't work. But he recommended them, happy that he was doing everything he could to keep us safe. There are countless other medical professionals that disagree with his initial understanding, since then, Fauci has explained his recommendation on masks changed as more information became available about the way COVID-19 spreads and the effectiveness of masks outside of hospitals.</p>
