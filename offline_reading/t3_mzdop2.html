        <p>What planet do you live on?</p>
<p>Here on earth, we've had this thing called a "pandemic" during which time we closed down hundreds of thousands of small businesses, threw millions of people out of work, and forced little children to wear masks for an entire fucking year you moron.  </p>
<p>Where have you been?  <strong>We've done it your way.</strong>  You dipshit.  Despite the fact people like me were screaming at you how stupid this is.  But no, we were "conspiracy theorists" and "morons".  Okay, cool.  Let's do it your way!  Okay, let's see how that works out!  Oh right!!  Here we are!!  One year later!  One year into "two weeks to flatten the curve".  You've been wrong like a fucking moron for an entire year, and now here you are, your bag of shit in your hand and it pretend as though somehow this is <em>our</em> fault.</p>
<p>Nope.  </p>
<p>This is 100% on you you dumb shit.  Take some responsibility.  Have a little bit of self-reflection.  Look around you.</p>
<p><strong>We did it your way.</strong></p>
<p>This is the results of YOUR WAY.</p>
<p>It turns out you were wrong.  And stupid.  Oops.  </p>
<p>Now apologize for being a dumb shit, then sit the fuck down.  The human beings still left on this planet don't believe you anymore.  <em>Because you've been exactly wrong and stupidly wrong for an entire year.</em></p>
<p>Apologize, then shut the fuck up.  Everyone is done listening to naive shitheads like you.</p>

&rt;<br>
&rt;"I care so much about other people!! Oh, but also, I hope you get hit by a bus!"</p>
<p>It's always funny watching you guys project your own false dichotomies onto other people. </p>
<p>Wanting you to die diminishes my caring for other people <em>how?</em> You are a human extension of the virus, polluting the world with misinformation to increase the rate at which the virus spreads. </p>
<p>You're like those idiots that think killing Nazis makes you a Nazi. I don't tolerate intolerance and willful ignorance, and I never claimed to. You think people like me try to project an air of moral purity, but that does not reflect my beliefs in reality. It exists only in your brain. </p>
<p>I'd unplug your life support to charge a vibrator and feel zero conflict with my desire to help people. You desire destruction, and destroying you is a positive action.</p>
<p>&rt;You haven't even addressed my point, but I'm sure you won't because you can't.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We've done it your way sweetheart. It failed. It turns out you've been wrong the entire year.</p>
<p>Wrong again! I addressed your point by pointing out that we've actually done it YOUR way this entire time. There were no mask mandates in places like Ontario (or Alberta... funny how only Conservatives denied them and it blew up in their faces...)</p>
<p>You have absolutely ZERO stats backing up your claim that the failure is on our end. I have the existence of my own province, which like the rest of Atlantic Canada adopted draconian measures to counteract the virus and thus has the lowest Covid case numbers in the country by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing backs you up. You live in a delusion.</p>
<p>&rt;Now sit the fuck down. We're done listening to naive hypocrites like you.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up. You've displayed a startling lack of consistency and scientific understanding in everything you've stated so far, making you the only naive and hypocritical one here. </p>
<p>It's too bad the world isn't as idiotically simple as you claim it is. Then we COULD just open up and the virus would magically vanish through the power of determination. </p>
<p>But we live in reality, where I have a father with cancer and an army of mentally-deficient dipshits sitting in an pseudoscience echo chamber getting ready to try and kill him. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope you die, you disgusting oxygen thief. You bring nothing but pain, misery and death to everyone around you, and all of that should be turned in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>Choke on your hatred.</p>
