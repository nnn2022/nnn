    <strong>Help me compile a concise argument against vaccinating children</strong>
    <p><p>Now I know this seems like it should be obvious to many of us, but it's not to a majority of the population. My country is set to start vaccinating kids next month against Covid, and in preparation, I would like to have a <em>solid, informative, but concise, non-combative</em> argument against it so that I can do my part. If I can even prevent one child from taking on that risk, that's something, I feel I must do my part. </p>
<p>It's not my goal to attempt to persuade any adult what they should do with their body. But it is all of our responsibilities to protect children. The data here is focused solely on them. Wile I am not a doctor, I do analyse data for a living, but I do not think you need to be an expert to review the publicly available data and make up your own mind. All claims made below have sources provided at the end in order by which they appear.</p>
<ol>
<li>Probability of death from Covid for under 18s are less than two in a million (0.0002%), with a total of 67 children aged 5-14 dying from Covid in America in 2020. Their chances of a non-Covid-related death are 99 times greater than dying of Covid; being struck by lightning is much more likely. The probability of developing heart inflammation (myocarditis) from Pfizer/Moderna in men aged 18-25 is approximately one in five thousand, or 200 times greater than their risk of death from Covid. Clot risk from AstraZeneca is approximately 50 in a million, or 150 times the risk of dying from Covid for under 25s. 40 times likelier to develop a stroke from the vaccine than to die from Covid, 40 times likelier to develop a pulmonary embolism, 20 times likelier to develop deep vein thrombosis, and several times likelier to develop auto-immune disease. These are only the most serious known <em>short-term</em> risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>2a. Undisclosed Pfizer data from Freedom of Information Access request (FOIA), including attached chart, reveals the vaccine's lipid nanoparticles accumulate in the ovaries. Also of note, bone marrow isn't a place one would wish for them to accumulate either. </p>
<p>2b. Lipid nanoparticles are the envelope which contain the mRNA instructions to be transcribed by the body's cells and converted to SARS-COV2 spike protein. Lipid nanoparticles are understudied and novel in vaccines. Because they contain the mRNA instructions, they may be viewed as a proxy for where one will find the body producing spike proteins. (Sidenote: Polyethylene glycol, another constituent, best known as the main ingredient in industrial antifreeze, is also understudied in humans, though is less novel and is used in some flu vaccines to deactivate the virus, and some cosmetics.) </p>
<p>2c. The Salk Institute has demonstrated in animal models that the spike protein alone is cytotoxic, or toxic to mammalian cells. Fact checkers dispute this, but the Salk Institute is highly respected, their study is of high quality, unequivocal, and fact checkers almost universally have ties to the pharmaceutical industry, with board members belonging to Pfizer, Merck, etc. Implications to future fertility, particularly for women, are completely unknown.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's backwards for a society to ask children to assume some unknown risk in taking non-FDA approved / fast-tracked EMA drugs in order to protect the elderly and infirm in an attempt to achieve herd immunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children have longer to live and therefore have a greater window in which possible long-term effects such as Antibody Dependent Advancement (ADE), autoimmunity, prion disease, fertility complications, tumorgenesis, or other unknown risks to arise. Mechanisms by which these may be possibilities: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ADE- has been the primary obstacle in past attempts at coronavirus and mRNA vaccines, see papers in sources below.</p>
<p>Autoimmunity- body's cells producing spike proteins could teach the immune system to target the body's own cells.</p>
<p>Prion disease- A pathway by which prion disease could manifest has been suggested by Dr. Classen in the Journal of Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases, see paper in sources below.</p>
<p>Fertility complications- see 2a, 2b, 2c.</p>
<p>Tumorgenesis- No specific reason beyond it being a go-to failure mode for the body; nanoparticle accumulation in bone marrow of possible concern.</p>
<p>It's not my belief that any of these are likely. They are merely possible failure modes.</p>
<p>5) Vitamin D (un-patentable) and Ivermectin (Nobel prize, 4 decades of study, off-patent) are more effective as prophylaxis, and less experimental (though unprofitable) by virtue of being natural compounds and having been studied and administered billions of times over decades.</p>
<p>6) Vaccines targeting a narrow spike protein mid-pandemic drive an evolutionary arms race for escape variants. Further vaccination is likely to further drive this evolution, and the vaccines are likely to lose efficacy for each new variant produced.</p>
<p>7) Company track records. Moderna, founded in 2010, has previously made 9 FDA applications but never succeeded in bringing a single product to market or indeed in progressing beyond Stage II trials. Pfizer, paid out $4.7bn over the last 20 years in lawsuits involving false claims and corrupt practices. Their CEO sold 60% of his stock the day the vaccine was announced. Legal but far from a ringing endorsement. AstraZeneca suspended by more than a dozen EU countries. J&amp;J of fame for over the course of decades knowingly selling baby powder containing asbestos. The pharmaceutical industry is the top advertiser on all mediums and has board members on nearly all news outlets, participates in regular kickbacks to doctors, hospitals, medical organisations, and contributes to nearly all political campaigns where legal, and beyond.</p>
<p>8) Without completing trials in children, injecting them with novel vaccine technology arguably violates points 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the Nuremberg code.</p>

<p>Whilst all the talking points that we have exhausted to death over the last 18 months against adult C19 vaxxes are valid for kids, the high risk of myocarditis, heart attacks and strokes seem to be the best warning signs.</p>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1408116464683569157">Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH</a>"To put this into perspective, if we vaccinate 1 million 12-17 year olds, we could see 30-40 MILD cases of myocarditis. In this same 1 million, through vaccination we AVOID: 8,000 cases of COVID-19, 200 hospitalizations, 50 ICU stays &amp; 1 death. The benefits far outweigh the risks."</p>
<p>She says 30 - 40, except research shows it is:</p>
<p>"most of the people who developed the heart condition were young men, with a particularly high incidence for those aged 16 to 24, putting their rate at around <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/06/israel-detects-link-between-myocarditis-and-covid-vaccine.html">one in 5,000</a>."</p>
<p>Which would be 200 cases of MILD myocarditis to save 1 life.  And by MILD she means:</p>
<p>"All of the cases that were reported to us were hospitalized, the vast majority for a couple of days," <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/coronavirus/connecticut-confirms-at-least-18-cases-of-apparent-heart-problems-in-young-people-after-covid-19-vaccination/2494534/">Gifford said at the governor's</a> regular Monday COVID-19 news conference. "One individual that we’re aware of is still hospitalized."</p>
<p>And this of course is a cost born by the family. So, you could give your healthy kid a 1 in 5000 chance to get a dangerous disease in order to create a 1 in a million chance of saving someone at death's door. And if your kid gets it, the cost is yours, but if the 80 year old gets covid and dies of dementia, their entire hospital bill is covered by the CARES Act.</p>

<p>Prevent 8000 cases of COVID-19 [Mild, unnoticed] - 0.8%</p>

<p>Prevent 1 death - 0.000099%</p>
<p>Risk of Myocarditis [Critical, fatal] 30-40 - 0.0034%</p>
<p>No mention of long term risks of the vaccine. No mention of the reported deaths from the vaccine. Also, Myocarditis will likely result in hospitalizations, ICU stays, and death for some.</p>
<p>The only comparable items I see here are whether ICU stays are comparable to Myocarditis. How are cases of Myocarditis being compared? Clearly the ICU stays are recoverable, as she just said 1:1,000,000 will die from COVID.</p>
<p>So, the CDC Director just claimed that the risk of COVID 19 for the age range of 12-17 is 0.000099%.</p>
<p>Why is she encouraging this age range to get vaccinated? 🤔</p>
<p>Seems going unvaccinated outweighs the risks to me</p>

        <p>In 2020, there were only 721 Covid-19 deaths for people under 25. Seven hundred and twenty one.</p>
<p>And this is including their "catch all" method of PCR tests with inflated cycle thresholds and "all deaths up to 30-60 days of a positive test" accounting method.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, the odds of someone young dying from Covid-19 are much less than 1 in a million.</p>
<p>The other thing to factor in is --- people who die from Covid-19 are sick and have other problems. How many normal healthy children are dying from Covid-19? The number would be even less.</p>
<p>This isn't concise and doesn't help your argument... but I wanted to say it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here's the mortality breakdown from the CDC:</p>

<p>CDC recommends against it.</p>
<p>Of course, CDC guidelines are only valid when convenient, and when able to be used to force others to do what you want them to do.</p>

        <p>Just some thoughts, maybe good maybe bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>point 1: The numerical idea of "one in a million" looks even less significant if expressed as a decimal or percentage. Maybe include such a number near that text.</li>
<li>point 1: The phrasing around "odds from" could be something like "probability that" (and follow the consequences of this down the sentence).</li>
<li>point 2: This would sound better in the passive, or less personal voice, i.e. "Data attained via FOIA request shows that ..."</li>
<li>point 2: If accumulation in bone marrow is relevant to this point, quickly explain how. Otherwise this phrase seems randomly inserted.</li>
<li>point 3: Use a few more words to introduce "The nanoparticles". Explain the obvious if you must.</li>
<li>point 3: Perhaps move the comment on fertility up to point 2, so that the idea is more contained.</li>
<li>point 4: Excellent point. I would rephrase it to "arse" if in Ireland or Scotland - if not, get rid of that word.</li>
<li>point 5: Group this into point 4, they are getting at the same thing.</li>

        <p>Kids have a near zero chance of dying from Covid. In addition to the known side effects from the "vaccine" (including paralysis, blod clots, myocaditis and sudden death), we have no data on the long term side effects and these kids hopefully have long lives ahead of them. </p>
<p>Plus there are serious concerns about how the vaxx may impact fertility. </p>
<p>Giving this experimental mRNA shot to kids who are at no risk to Covid should be a crime.</p>

        <p>#1 is flawed because you are counting only death for covid, but counting non-death risks for vaccines. You need to count deaths vs. deaths or total risks vs. total risks.</p>

        <p>Good point, the problem is we don't have accurate death rates for the vaccines (probably by design). Do you have any mainstream, undisputable source for this that won't set off conspiracy theorist alarm bells in those who are brainwashed by the TV?</p>

        <p>I don't. The burden of proof should be on the person trying to inject kids. They would need to show that the risk of a vaccinated kid getting harmed by the vaccine plus the (presumably diminished but not zero) risk of getting covid anyway is less than the risk of getting covid while unvaccinated. And of course, death should be weighted in each category higher than non-death harm. It's going to be tough to get numbers for the calculation, but it's really the only argument I'd even make.</p>

        <p>You forget that these are the same people who fudge china's CO2 output by using the "per capita" method, meaning that other countries with significantly lower volumes of CO2, have to spread their emissions among an order of magnitude lower population, likely most of which can afford cars and such, than what china would have to, since they can spread their largely government owned factory output over nesrly one and a half billion people.</p>

        <p>That's messed up. I was totally pro-vaccine until earlier this year when I started to see how the sausage was made with the panicked rush and propaganda if the Covid vaccines, and the push to vaccinate even people for whom it makes no sense, like people with natural infection immunity, and children. Now I question everything and your link suggesting developmental delays is very concerning.</p>
