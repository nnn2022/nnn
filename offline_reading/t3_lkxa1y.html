    <strong>Stop wearing a mask if you want this dystopia to finally end</strong>
    <p><p>Do you think the government will ever give us a green light "mask aren't required anymore!". Nope. They'll try to implement them for as long as possible, untill the majority keeps wearing them. Never forget the most undeniable fact that covid is a 0.2% IFR virus that didn't warrant masks or any of the other bs in the first place. When you stop wearing a mask in public places you'll subconsciously inspire other skeptics to do the same. And the more people put down the mask, the faster we get out of this nightmare. If you still wear a mask in public places, but you're also fed up with the new normal than really try not wearing the mask for once. It's so easy and you'll feel so great for not complying with the bs narrative.</p></p>

        <p>Why are the masks even a thing? I don’t get it? Did they just fuck up by even implying they will help and it’s to late to redact? Why are they continuing to push the mask shit? What’s the motive? I know compliance and obedience etc but really what’s the purpose of everyone covering their face there has to be a reason, we know it’s not for public health that’s pretty obvious.</p>

        <p>&rt;Did they just fuck up by even implying they will help and it’s to late to redact?</p>
<p>Yes, that's correct. They were brainwashed into a believing a certain country where the virus originated from actually eliminated a virus by masks, lockdowns and all the other crap. Remember those videos in February "people dropping dead in the street". Other countries were actually convinced the virus was this deadly and they gleefuly destroyed their economies for it. It turned to virus to be a commom respiratory virus that didn't warrant any of the dystopia. Now they're too deep into the psychosis to back out now. They'll keep advocating for masks and implementing them untill covid is significantly brought down by vaccines. They'll also stop counting every single case and thus won't be able to assign it to covid. They will defenitely claim masks helped in stopping the spread (which is blatanly false, cases have been surging for months with mask mandates everywhere) and we will sadly mostly likely see them in the future again.</p>

        <p>Also, it's worth noting that people wear masks <em>precisely because</em> of the false narrative. Without the psychotic reaction to a 0.2% IFR virus, there would be no masks. Mask-wearing exists only due to this "new normal". In fact, masks are the most visible symbol of this Orwellian psyop. Nothing screams "deadly global pandemic" more than seeing everyone wearing masks. </p>
<p>How can you have peace and forget for a second when everyone is masked, something that would never happen in normal times. This leads to deeper sinking into the mentality that we really must be living in such a dangerous time and that this really must be an "unprecedented" virus, otherwise we would have never had lockdowns and masks. You can get that the vast majority of people who believe the covid narrative believe it only because they see society's psychotic reaction to it, and therefore come to the conclusion that "damn, this virus really must be that scary and serious, and unlike any virus we've ever had before, otherwise why would governments all over the world be implementing all these measures?" Masks, like the lockdowns they are a part of, are what exacerbate the psychological phenomenon of this irrational fear and insanity. </p>
<p>People wear masks not because they choose to, but because they are brainwashed into believing there is a plague upon us. Just think...would anyone wear a mask or would any business implement them if it hadn't been for the media and their anointed quacks telling everyone that this virus is nothing like the flu we deal with every year...rather it is a once-in-a-millennium supervirus that would have lead to millions of dead bodies lining the streets of every major city in the world had it not been for these restrictions? </p>
<p>Also, look at how they literally programmed the masses to go from "please no one wear masks because it's unnecessary and might just make it worse" in the first three months of the year to a total complete reversal literally overnight of "everyone wear masks at all times, masks are the best weapon against this terrible virus". If that's not horrifyingly Orwellian enough, I don't know what to say. Masks feed the atmosphere of fear, panic, mass hysteria, while dehumanizing and demoralizing the population. The powers that be know this too, hence why they advocate for them so much and silence all science that goes against their narrative. Also, what is sad is how so many have accepted this abusive spouse syndrome. </p>
<p>We've come to the sad point of we're so afraid of more lockdowns, that we wouldn't mind muzzles just as long as our overlords please not lock is down again. This is exactly like a horribly abusive spouse who takes everything from you, including your self-worth and dignity, then makes you feel relief when they "allow" you something that was just your basic right. "Thanks for letting me go out with you for 20 minutes to get a hamburger tonight...I know it could be worse, you could not allow me to leave the house or talk to anyone for months while beating me up every night and starving me".</p>

        <p>If you want to know why governments reversed themselves and started mandating masks, at least in some countries it was a calculated decision to make people feel safe enough to go out and re-start the economy.</p>
<p>Last May, when some countries were coming out of lockdown, there was concern in some governments that people had been scared too much and were too afraid to go out even to support non-essential retail, and this was going to continue the devastating damage to the economy of the initial lockdown.  This was still the period of plastic gloves, sanitizing takeaway and people not even leaving their home for weeks out of fear.</p>
<p>Masks were recommended because they were a visible and concrete step each person could take to "feel protected" enough to go out and re-engage in the economy a bit.  Of course, once government officials had come down officially in favor of masks, they couldn't lose face by walking it back, plus many people have now become dependent on them to feel safe from the virus, some governments are worried that the fragile economy will take a hit if masks are discredited.</p>

        <p>When you have a mask on, it's nearly impossible to have a meaningful connection with a stranger. There are no shared smiles. </p>
<p>If the only place you have to talk about the lockdowns and the new normal is on reddit, you are safely quarantined to irrelevant sections where your opinion can be minimized. If you go to your local bar and have a chat with some other locals about how bad things have got, you might actually get something accomplished. There is no resistance to tyranny when you can't freely assemble.</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>I think we’re already circling the main reason behind masks, so let me name it explicitly: Power.  The government wants to grow in power by having control over the people’s actions.  </p>
<p>“But always— do not forget this, Winston— always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.
If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.”
-George Orwell, 1984</p>
<p>The point of the government not just recommending masks but particularly making them mandatory is fundamentally to test their power and see if they can bully the citizens into being complicit, whether they like it or not.  </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you wear the mask, but secretly still think it’s stupid; the point is they’ve successfully stomped you down into physical compliance; and psychologically established a power-relationship over you.  It sets a precedent:  You now have to do what I say, no matter what, but PRECISELY for when you disagree.  </p>
<p>It’s like in prison those power games you hear about.  </p>
<p>A cell mate enters his cell and meets a dude already there.  “You are now my bitch.  Clean my shoes.  Twice.  And a third time.  How ‘bout a fourth time.”  That prison dude doesn’t care about having clean shoes; no more does the government care about your health.  </p>
<p>It’s about power.  And the thing is; the more you comply, the more your OWN psychology actually changes and you BECOME weaker.  Our actions not only define but also mould us.  If I spend every day for a year acting like a pussy; having shrugged shoulders, never looking anyone in the eye, being a pushover at work; no matter the initial reason; even if it’s just as a social experiment, You will come out feeling like a pussy too.  This is psychologically proven.  It’s why people say to stand up straight with your shoulders back.  Actions set the path for your mentality.  Actions are where it counts.  </p>
<p>Another example is how the Christian disciples in Ancient Rome were commanded to renounce their faith or worship whatever king/pagan god,
or else face death in the colosseum.  The tyrant in that situation is aware of course that the Christian’s “renouncing” of their faith, or “worship” of the pagan Gods is going to be anything but genuine, but rather done entirely out of fear.  But that’s the point.  “I can make you do it anyway.” Power is never about the specifics of the scenario; it’s purely about the getting you to do what they want specifically in CONTRAST of your own will.   That’s what the mandatory masks are.  It sets the tone for the government to dominate you and grow in power.  </p>
<p>Everything else; the fact that masks dehumanize people, cause distrust and division between civilians, (such as with neighbours calling the police on each other), the fact that this all leads  to a society that is deprived and depressed and socially vulnerable; these are all notable side-bonuses; useful tools aiding the effort of making the masses easier to control.  But the whole thing is fundamentally about power. The government just wants more power.  </p>
<p>And What else is new, historically speaking? </p>
<p>So the question is: are you going to let them make you their bitch?  </p>
<p>Or will you stand up instead, go unmasked everywhere, refuse the vaccine, speak out against the lockdowns, and be an inspiration to your fellow countrymen at this time when it is precisely most needed?</p>

        <p>So the point of having laws regarding masks is:</p>

<p>Definitely agree, but isn't that the case with <em>all</em> laws? The law that forbids you to strip down naked in public is there for the exact same reason. There is no real reason why they don't want you to do that, they simply want to assert dominance.</p>
<p>If we want to live truly free we need to abolish all laws.</p>

        <p>So true. The only way out of this is to stop with the masks because theyre such a visual marker. </p>
<p>You may hate confrontation, you may be in a hurry, you may respect a business, but all those excuses do not help make a stand for what you believe in. You may be smart enough to see through the BS, but that doesn’t even matter if everyone that looks at you <em>sees a face diaper/muzzle</em>.</p>

<li>It's a highly contagious, but mild respiratory virus.</li>
<li>You cannot control or contain in a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus in any real significant way. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses spread fast. No masks or lockdowns or social distancing or other voodoo is going stop them. This is why these measures have all completely failed. For the same reason we will never get rid of the flu. This would have been understood just this time last year...now "scientists" have magically forgotten.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think this discusting response was warranted then you would have to believe that this is truly that dangerous and deadly of a virus, and that the medieval quackery these "experts" came up with is actually sane, logical, and scientific...it just conflicts with running an economy. That's truly not the case. Plus, all these disease "experts" that are complicit in the false narrative know the kind of virus this is. </p>
<p>Gee...I wonder why Fauci was saying something completely different in February than he's been saying since then. I also wonder why the CDC, WHO are making themselves look completely satirical, and everything known about respiratory viruses, coronaviruses, epidemiology, and pandemic responses, was flushed down the toilet in March. </p>
<p>What has happened this year has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before? Why do you think that back at beginning of the year they weren't going insane? Why do you think they act like numerous studies (like the ones on masks, for example) published prior to 2020, don't exist anymore? Why do you think they act like they don't know the difference between CFR and IFR, and other obvious things about virology and epidemiology?  It's like the damn Ministry of Truth in <em>1984</em>. Ever wonder why you woke up one day in March and nothing made sense anymore? </p>
<p>It's literally the birth of a new strain of the common cold. Learning to live with it means going back to 2019 normal and acknowledging this for what it is. But for some bizarre reason, these psychopaths want to restructure society to revolve around a 0.2% IFR virus. As long as they are obsessed with it, treat it like it's ebola, then this hideous dystopia will continue.</p>

        <p>I would like to point out that your comments are quite insidious compared to the two simple questions I asked. </p>
<p>I would love to have a discussion about covid though. You have seem to made quite a few claims in your previous comment. It would be nice to focus upon the science and number first though. I've done my best to quote all bits from your response the relates directly to the science and numbers associated with covid. Would you happen to have some data or research for the claims which you make in your post? Particularly these bits:</p>
<p>Bit 1</p>
<p>&rt;You cannot control or contain in a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus in any real significant way. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses spread fast. No masks or lockdowns or social distancing or other voodoo is going stop them. This is why these measures have all completely failed. </p>
<p>Bit 2</p>
<p>&rt;What has happened after March has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before?</p>
<p>Bit 3</p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think they act like numerous studies (like the ones on masks being inefficient in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses, for example) published prior to 2020, don't exist anymore? Why do you think they act like they don't know the difference between CFR and IFR, and other obvious things about virology and epidemiology?</p>
<p>Bit 4</p>
