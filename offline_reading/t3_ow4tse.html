    <strong>I don't understand how people are accepting a vaccine that not just has a chance to, but is *expected* to cause an immune response.</strong>
    <p><p>This bugs me a lot. Blood clots, death, and other stuff aside, why in the world are people just  unequivocally accepting an injection that put every single person I know in bed with a fever and weakness at least for days/weeks. This would not be acceptable in any other time and the treatment would be recalled.</p>
<p>It's so weird to me that we're acting like we need to 'sacrifice' something to this virus or we're deserving of punishment, some trial, etc. for some reason.</p>
<p>I've had all the expected vaccines for a school age kid and never did any of them cause an immune response. The only discomfort was due to the needle. Before, being laid up for days/weeks would be rare, investigated, or an 'allergic reaction' that would go down on your record. </p>
<p>I think it's completely valid that I do not want to deliberately make myself feel ill due to an injection that I'm 99% sure would be pulled from distribution in the past.
One that comes with the <em>expectation</em> of debilitating side effects. Not just the 'chance'.</p></p>

        <p>Brainwashing by the media.</p>
<p>Suddenly now we are told that feeling like a truck hit you is normal after a vaccine. And also now apparently vaccines don't prevent disease it just makes it less severe. And everyone just accepts what they are told without question.</p>

        <p>This is why it bothers me so much that they're basically forcing this on pregnant woman. Your body is going through major changes and overriding its immune system to support a baby. Why on earth would you want to trigger an immune response during those precious and delicate 9 months??</p>

        <p>There were enough documented severe covid illnesses in pregnant women causing very premature births, to determine that an actual covid illness is worse stress on the body and the fetus than the response via the vaccine.</p>
<p>I personally would have probably not gotten the covid shot if I were pregnant, but I'd take a lot of extra precautions, ie leave my house a whole lot less. I'd rather get neither in that case. If I had little choice, and there was a reasonable likelihood of getting covid due to work or what have you, I'd get the vaccine and hope I wouldn't be one of the people who mounted a disproportionate response. At that point, if the vaccine causes your immune system to go into overdrive and cause further issues, then actual covid would do the same or worse. Ideally, you'd want to avoid both completely.</p>

        <p>I suppose I could understand it in a hard hit area with a healthy pregnancy under a doctor's supervision if that is what the patient wanted. </p>
<p>I guess I'm just sensitive because I have family shaming me about not wanting it even though they know I live somewhere where covid is barely  a thing and I have a history of loss and complications. They don't seem to care about me or my baby, just the vaccine. You're right, pregnant women should be lumped in with the vulnerable and elderly but they're not this time and that is so disturbing to me.</p>

        <p>Definitely one of the groups that should be watched the most closely, and I think pregnant women are lumped with the most vulnerable, in terms of possible negative impact - but there is just more at stake. I'm sorry that you were shamed or felt any pressure to take these vaccines, because I completely understand not feeling like it is safe to do so. It might have the exact opposite effect people are expecting, and make things worse. </p>
<p>When I was pregnant, my titers came back as negative for chicken pox. Never had it, turns out. I asked if I can or should get the varicella vaccine, and was told in no unequivocal terms that I should wait until after I give birth, because it's a live vaccine - who knows how I will react to it. And to definitely avoid anyone who may potentially have chicken pox because it could be devastating to my pregnancy as well.</p>
<p>I guess the chances of catching covid, depending on where you are, are higher than catching chicken pox nowadays (and I did get that vaccine after birth, because I certainly don't want it as an adult at least). But if your chances are already low, and you don't have to hang out in the covid ward as part of your job, I am totally with you on not even considering the covid shots. I also wouldn't if I were pregnant, since I work from home, but I did have my two covid shots and would have gotten them after giving birth. And to each their own.</p>

        <p>But does it?  Oh sure, you get ill after, but is it an immuno response to covid?  Or just your body reacting to whatever they are injecting you with?</p>
<p>They say that it’s 95% effective to keep you from catching covid.  5 politicians caught it on a 4 hour plane flight.  Odds: 1 in 3.2 million against for that to happen.  </p>

        <p>Lots of existing vaccines can give similar side effects though. You may not have had any reactions, or just don't remember them, but you always watch your kids fevers and symptoms after vaccination, and intervene with some children's tylenol/ibuprofen if needed.</p>
<p>Any vaccine is just telling your body that a something bad entered, and needs to be fought against. Live virus and mrna are more similar in that regard, because an actual semblance of a virus is introduced, and your body needs to figure out how to fight it. It's not so much of "the disease" to cause an illness in most cases, but it's enough for some people, and some others' immune systems barely respond if at all. It's ultimately very case by case.</p>
<p>Like most people I know, my first covid shot was a sore arm at best, and barely so. The second one made me tired and weirdly nauseous, like a hangover. Most people I know felt crappy the day after the second shot.</p>
<p>By comparison, my personal worst vaccine reaction was to an MMR shot as an adult. The US government has a mandatory vaccination schedule for all immigration forms, and it requires two MMR shots. I had one MMR shot, and one series of three M, M, and R vaccinations. So I needed one more "MMR" shot. That laid me on my ass the next day. 103.5 fever, could not move a muscle. I felt absolutely terrible. Cleared up the day after.</p>
<p>It's common for childhood vaccinations. Your body is building up an immune response after all. And as you said, we're not talking about serious side effects, but the general ones where you feel like crap the day after are very, very common, for children and adults, for all vaccines. That's like your body having a fever in response to any other virus. It's building up a response.</p>
