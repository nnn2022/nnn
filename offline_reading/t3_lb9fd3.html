        <p>They are a 110% right on that, nobody on God's green earth has isolated the virus and several Access to information' requests like these have been made in which the answer has been the same</p>

        <p>It has been isolated, characterised, sequenced and tested in many different ways by many different people in many institutions.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn't fit an outsider's view of what isolation and purification means, at this point is has been studied as much as modern science really makes possible.</p>

        <p>Filling out missing genetic sequences with a computer model isn't isolating it. That is what they've done. There are HUGE misconceptions about everything about this and there has been blatant misrepresentations of the "science" behind everything they've done. The "vaccine" isn't even technically a vaccine. </p>
<p>"<em>at this point is has been studied as much as modern science really makes possible."</em></p>
<p>This is laughable especially since this is supposedly a "novel virus". The Mrna treatment has never been successfully carried out and they've been trying for over 30 years and you and every other believer is trying to convince me and others they finally were able to do it in less than a year with a brand new virus? At this point that is being willfully ignorant.</p>

        <p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*. "</p>
<p>This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>“First, in the section titled ‘Whole Genome Sequencing,’ we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>

        <p>Only way to reverse any of this is non compliance. This is no loophole. This is just documentation from THE "official" health authorities that all of this is complete bullshit. It's up to each and every individual to start ignoring "mandates" and various other totalitarian measures.</p>
