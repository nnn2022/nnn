    <p><p>Ask people you know...</p>
<p>Of course, they may a) not know about the significance of Asia on the  mask issue, or b) have no idea how these countries are different from a  geographical sense. They may just think "asians wear masks, no issues" -  lumping all of Asia together.</p></p>

        <p>First off, stop focusing on masks. It's reductionist and it doesn't properly evaluate the actual virus mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>Second, the other virus mitigation treatments might be helping keep the transmission rates low. Maybe one area is better at social distancing, maybe another area has naturally less congested areas. It could be better social or cultural institutions. It could be government coercion.  Who knows. Confounders abound.</p>
<p>These confounders are why it's so hard to isolate each treatment and say "this works" / "this doesn't work".</p>

        <p>No...because there is this impression that masks work. They have not worked at stopping anything - practically speaking.</p>
<p>You can eliminate distancing as a factor...cuz all these countries are dense.</p>
<p>THey all wear surgical masks so you can eliminate mask differences.</p>
<p>I've been to all these countries. Was in Taiwan 2x last year.</p>
<p>When the mask mandates go away, I will shut up.</p>

        <p>Define "work". Quantify what you need to consider them a worthwhile effort.</p>
<p>Mechanically, they operate as expected. Providing a small filtering and absorptive effect. They also baffle the stream of exhalation aerosols, which acts as a minor source control.</p>
<p>They work slightly less than seat belts which are 20-65% effective. But you wouldn't talk about seat belts in isolation because then "they don't work". With an effective multi-layered strategy you get good results.</p>
<p>You wouldn't consider buying a car without brakes, or an airbag. They are not 100% able to prevent your death in the event of a collision, so "they don't work" but used in concert you get a better outcome.</p>
<p>This is why it doesn't make sense to talk about masks outside of the actual strategy of: masks, physical distancing, increased hygiene, minimized time around crowds, minimize time in indoor spaces with poor ventilation.</p>

        <p>Lockdown measures don't even work in certain countries...yet they "appear" to work in others...and yet the levels fall in countries with no strict lockdowns.</p>
<p>Poland is a great example...comparing many countries in Europe.</p>
