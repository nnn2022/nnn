    <strong>Some insight from someone inside of the healthcare system:</strong>
    <p><p>My father has worked for his hospital for over 35 years. He was very pro-vaccine when it first came out, so got both doses of Pfizer due to having an immune disorder and having to work directly with COVID patients every day. My mother and I have been skeptics since the beginning, and were both very upset when he got it. There were tensions in our family the first few months, as he didn't understand why I was so strongly anti-vaccine. This persisted until the numbers started adding up at his own hospital. Many of his older coworkers are either very conservative or skeptical of the vaccine, and they were recently exchanging some things that they have seen throughout their respective departments. Most interesting to me is that the number of both men and women coming in for fertility treatments has absolutely skyrocketed. Additionally, the number of young people coming into the ER  for heart complications post-vaccine is also through the roof. My father is now helping me in my mission to fight against mandatory vaccines at my university, as he is disgusted with what he is seeing, and is genuinely concerned for individuals of both genders who are of reproductive age getting it.</p></p>

        <p>At what point in trying do people go in for treatments? I figure 6 months so I don’t think the timeline makes sense. I bet there is an uptick in committing to trying to conceive now that covid is (hopefully) ending.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is what I was thinking too. Where I live it's considered normal to try for 6 months, and you can seek help with fertility after you've tried for a year without any success.</p>

        <p>Can't stand this pharma shill, she is so obsessed with her looks, her intro is embarassing.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/dgf1xWonTBI</p>
<p>No idea if she's actually a fertility doc or just likes to play one on IG. She downplays the vax risks, while promoting woke transgender inclusivity in reproductive healthcare.  Very lucrative!</p>
<p>Glad to see BigPharma still has their priorities aligned to maximize profits. Never change, guys!</p>
<p>Anyways, despite the cringe factor I still found her videos helpful... Good to know the opposition's talking points.</p>

        <p>Not sure but the people that are vaxxed are the least useful.  Old people, cowardly people. The builders and young people are least likely to be vaxxed.  So they would be more useful if you could find a way to control them somehow.</p>

        <p>I don't think the obedient are gonna be left completely sterile, but it will probably be near immposible to reproduce naturally. Get them spending money on artificial insemination and on top of that, control every step of the process with the lab-babies. </p>
<p>Heard of that theory that if they alter your genes with a patented substance, you're patented genetic material now? It may sound silly to think they'll jab you and say "I own you now". But how much of a stretch is it to theorize that in the future, when most pregnancies have to be in-vitro, they'll have legal authority to further genetically alter the eggs and sperm you give them because of the patented altered genes? </p>
<p>It's technically what they did when they started patenting seeds because they genetically altered them.</p>

        <p>Quite a while. They’re in power and have ways of covering for their deeds. Right now they’re claiming it’s rare cases having heart issues but that’s only because they’re not counting all the post vaccine heart issues as related. Only a few of them. They got caught so they’re releasing just enough information to make the public feel at ease knowing it’s “rare” so they can look away and continue receiving the jab. That’s how they’ve always manipulated the data and it’s why so many have been harmed by their prior products before they were finally pulled. They know what’s happening to people but they have to keep the scam up due to financial investments. With the amount of times these companies (the same ones making the jabs) have been convicted of lying about data, it’s incredible that they’re still in business and seen in a good light. There’s some intense Stockholm syndrome going on between the pharmaceutical companies and their patrons.</p>

        <p>I live 2 doors down from a Vaccination Centre. The street is a weird mix of residential, with businesses on one end. I saw people dropping and having seizures after they have the shot on YouTube etc., but wasn't sure what to think. A couple of weeks ago, I was standing near a window that faces their car park &amp; door, and saw a group of about 5 people going in at once- they looked like a family. One of them was a teenage boy with some kind of disability. About half an hour later, I just happened to see them all coming out of the door again, and the teenager was being supported by two of the family as they walked out. He looked to be in pretty bad shape, and then he kind of collapsed, where the two people were now holding him up and looked to be very concerned. They kinda turned around and went back inside again. Was heartbreaking, and really brought it home to me that this happens irl , and it's dangerous.</p>

<p>By the way I'm hearing that EMT workers are seeing more vax side effects and sudden unexplainable illness than they are seeing physical injuries such as puncture wounds, gunshot wounds, and even overdoses. It's the top thing they are responding to. These injuries are obscenely underreported and censored.</p>

        <p><strong>Dr. Charles Hoffe has been serving patients for 28 years, many of them First Nations people in Lytton, BC</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Hoffe states the experimental Moderna ‘vaccines’ are injuring his patients.</p>
<p>Video link: https://hive.blog/hive-110786/@drutter/sjbdolck</p>
<p>He does talk about infertility…</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“I think this has a very high chance of causing permanent infertility in women of childbearing age by literally giving them a vaccine against having a placenta that, as soon as the placenta is formed, they will miscarry every time.”</strong>
^(25:00-25:13)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“I just said with all these side effects appearing shouldn’t we perhaps just pause things for a while. Anyway, within 48 hours I had a very stern rebuke from my superiors at the Internal Health Authority,</strong> who told me that I was guilty of causing ‘vaccine hesitancy’ and they were going to be reporting me to the college of physicians and surgeons in B.C., and that <strong>I was forbidden from saying anything negative about the vaccine within our health facility. So I had been given a gag order.</strong> So initially I was a bit intimidated, because you know, unfortunately many doctors are because <strong>the colleges hold tremendous authority to literally shut down your livelihood or to give enormous fines.</strong> So I was a bit intimidated but as the week went on and <strong>I saw more and more people coming into my office with serious neurological problems,</strong> following their,… and this was just the first shot of the (Moderna) vaccine and we know that the second one gives much worse side effects. I became more and more angry about my gag order.”
^(video 3:30-4:35)</p>
<p>&rt;”So <strong>what I’m telling people about is not some theory, this is what I have seen in my own patients. I’ve been a doctor to these patients for 28 years and now three of them are disabled by this first (Moderna)
vaccine.</strong> And it upsets me very much because <strong>these people did not know that they were part of an experiment.”</strong>
^(6:30-6:48)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”I was offered this vaccine and I said, ‘no thank you. I would like to be part of the unvaccinated control group for this experiment’.</strong> But it grieved me that <strong>all of the patients that I have that now, have longterm ongoing neurological side effects, are all First Nations people.</strong> Because they were the people who got it first and the rest of us are just getting it now.”
^(19:45-20:29)</p>
<p>&rt;”There’s never been a vaccine like this before. And to even claim it’s a vaccine is really not true because it’s not, it’s gene therapy.”
^(22:46-22:54)</p>
<p>&rt;”You know, a vaccine normally has part of a microorganism in it and either a virus or a bacteria in some altered form that doesn’t make you sick but that will induce antibody reaction. So this does not have any part of any disease organism in it. This is a gene that is put into your body to induce antibodies to a coronavirus spike protein. And of course the concern with that, and this doesn’t touch what I’ve said in my letter, <strong>the concern with it inducing antibodies to the coronavirus spike protein is that there are twenty types of tissues in the human body that have spike proteins. So the potential is that this so-called vaccine could trigger an autoimmune response against some part of your own body.</strong> So that in all of these women that are now having <strong>miscarriages</strong>, who have had one of these COVID vaccines, and there are hundreds of them around the world, <strong>I don’t know why they’re vaccinating pregnant women. At that age you’re risk of COVID is almost zero.</strong> But anyway, there are now hundreds of miscarriages caused by this. And so <strong>the only mechanism that seems to be apparent of why this vaccine would cause a miscarriage, is that these women now have antibodies to their placenta. In other words, they are now vaccinated against all future pregnancies.”</strong>
^(22:54-24:30)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hoffe wrote an open letter to Dr. Bonnie Henry</strong>
https://vaccinechoicecanada.com/in-the-news/open-letter-to-dr-bonnie-henry-from-bc-physician-re-moderna-vaccine-reactions/</p>
<h2>By standing up and speaking out on behalf of his injured patients, Dr. Hoffe was punished.</h2>
<p>&rt;<strong>“I am no longer allowed to work in the ER,”</strong> British Columbia Dr. Charles Hoffe said,according to a True North News report.</p>
<p>&rt;”Hoffe added that his suspension from the ER came at the end of April, <strong>after his local health authority “suspended” his clinical privileges “for the crime of causing ‘vaccine hesitancy,’ for speaking out about my vaccine injured patients.”</strong>
https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadian-doctor-removed-from-hospital-duty-after-speaking-out-about-covid-vaccine-side-effects</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hoffe on microscopic blood clots:</strong></p>
<p>“So it is absolutely inevitable that blood clots will form because your blood platelets circulate round your blood vessels, and the purpose of blood platelets is to identify damaged vessels and stop bleeding.  So, when the platelet comes through the capillary it suddenly hits all these COVID spikes and it becomes absolutely inevitable that blood clots will form to block that vessel.”</p>
<p>Therefore, these spike proteins can predictably cause blood clots. They are in your blood vessels (if mRNA ‘vaccinated’) so it is guaranteed. Dr Bahrdi then said to me that the way to prove this is to do a blood test called a D-dimer blood test.</p>
<p><strong>“The blood clots we hear about which the media claim are very rare are the big blood clots which are the ones that cause strokes and show up on CT scans, MRI, etc. The clots I’m talking about are microscopic and too small to find on any scan. They can thus only be detected using the D-dimer test.”</strong></p>
<p>Dr Hoffe explains he has been performing D-dimer tests on his mRNA ‘vaccinated’ patients and <strong>he has worryingly identified that 62 percent of them had these microscopic blood clots.</strong></p>
<p>“These people have no idea they are even having these <strong>microscopic blood clots</strong>. The most alarming part of this is that there are <strong>some parts of the body like the brain, spinal cord, heart and lungs which cannot re-generate.</strong> When those tissues are damaged by blood clots they are <strong>permanently damaged.”</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. It’s very concerning. All the best to you guys on your mission!!</p>

        <p>Complications conceiving post-vaccination, in addition to an increase in testing. It’s very common for women to be tested in general (I’ve been tested just to be sure), but it’s not nearly as common for men to be. That’s what really stands out here.</p>

        <p>we have a very senior, experienced doctor in the family. they say they don't even bother getting tested because the tests don't even work.</p>
<p>unfortunately, everything is so politicized now doctors know more than they are letting on but cannot say anything for fear of reprisals. thanks to govts and bureaucrats, critical thinking and scientific rigour are dangerous things that could cost you your job.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti-vax. It sounds like your Dad is a prime candidate for the COVID vaccine. It's all about risk mitigation, COVID probably poses a bigger risk to your dad than the vaccine.</p>
<p>Someone like me, who is young and healthy, COVID poses zero risk to. I have no need for the vaccine. Especially since I already had it.</p>
<p>I've never been anti-vax, and have been a supportive of older and vulnerable populations getting it. Does that make me an anti-vaxxer?</p>

        <p>So what you are saying is that your father with a fucking immune disorder „survived“ the vaccine, but many young people are having heart problems because of it? That makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Of course numbers of complications after the vaccine are rising, but that doesn‘t mean the complications are caused by the vaccine. If they are then please prove it.</p>
<p>Also there isn’t even proof you have a father who worked for a hospital, why should anyone believe you?</p>
<p>Show me proof and i‘ll turn anti-vax</p>
