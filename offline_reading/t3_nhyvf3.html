    <strong>I'm in a conundrum here</strong>
    <p><p>As I've been reading and educating myself more and more daily about the nonsense going on in the world, I've noticed a big influx of "catch covid and die before you spread it to someone else".</p>
<p>I'm severly confused by this for a reason or two. One being why would someone wish death upon someone else they know nothing about. Second, if you catch covid, isn't the doomers logic that you will die anyway? What I mean is, if you'll kill everyone else by catching it (because it's so deadly) wouldn't you just...die yourself? </p>
<p>How is that an argument with them. They can't have it both ways. Either it's super deadly and kills everyone it infects or they are confirming that it barely kills anyone. I don't know how to put it into further words but the logic is blatant double speak. </p>
<p>I can't understand their mindset at all. If it's so deadly, then a huge portion of the population would be wiped out, people would actually be afraid to go outside instead of going out with masks on getting in others people's faces and screaming about how you could kill someone. It's all very rich to me. Can someone please explain how this works?</p></p>

        <p>My friend you're trying to apply logic to people who have none. Y'all might as well live in different words cause their perception of reality is so warped and their ethics so broken and bankrupt thanks to the medias. just stay strong in your beliefs</p>

        <p>It's a cognitive bias with a self protection circular logic mechanism.</p>
<p>Sadly the only solution is for all the COVID BS to go away and it will dissolve in their mind, and they will act as if it never was an issue. </p>
<p>I really wish I was joking.</p>
<p>They've convinced themselves they are in the "right", the media and government have reinforced their conviction, and their own mind allows for a basic logical fallacy "I do this to save others, but I hope you die from what I'm trying to save you from."</p>
<p>It like the joke (sorry Christians, no offense meant):
Jesus knocks on your front door.
You: "Who is it?"
Jesus: "It's me Jesus. Open the door so that I can save you."
You: "From what?"
Jesus: "From what I'll do to you if you don't open the door."</p>
<p>It can create a bit of confusion when looking at it from the outside.</p>
