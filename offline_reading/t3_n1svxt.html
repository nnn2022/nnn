    <strong>I’m man enough to say “I don’t know”</strong>
    <p><p>The biggest retort by doomers atm seems to be mocking “conspiracy theory and YouTube research”. They seem to be under the impression that I 100% believe any conspiracy or reasoning that says not to take the vaccine and that is the reasoning for not taking it. As if only they were to debunk an article, I’d sing my praises to Fauci and get my shot. But what these doomers don’t realize is I never work in absolutes. I am not stupid enough to claim I know I’m right. I could easily be wrong about covid and about the vaccines. I try to just keep an open mind and read different material. At the end of the day, I can say “I don’t know”. </p>
<p>But do you know what <strong>is</strong> absolute? Getting a vaccine. You’ve put all your faith that without a doubt everything you read is true, and you’ve put all your faith in a species that not even 100 years ago was rounding up people for deadly medical experiments. You’ve put all your faith that you have had all current information presented to you (so I’ve assumed you heard of Michael Yeadon). You’ve put all your faith that this medical technology could not possibly have unforeseen consequences. You’ve turned “science” into God, using faith to make absolute decisions. </p>
<p>On top of that, it still misses the main argument at the end of the day. This is about freedom. Freedom to accept or deny any medical procedure. Freedom to accept or deny any medical equipment (like n95 masks). Freedom to not make decisions BECAUSE I don’t know. This is what the fight is for.</p></p>

        <p>The swine flu vaccine caused Narcolepsy and Cataplexy a few years down the line... also swine flu turned out to be a storm in a teacup, yes the government were forced to pay out £60m to those affected by it but the fact still stands that the government rushed the “vaccine” and gave the company legal immunity. (but they didn’t tell the public that part)</p>

        <p>But you could argue the other way around and say the vaccine for polio (which is serious infectious disease) has been so effective that cases have decreased by over 99% with only a handful of cases in recent years. What needs to be looked at is balance. We know that COVID kills and so vaccines are hugely beneficial, whereas a lot of other viruses cause mild coryzal symptoms and therefore developing a vaccine would be essentially pointless.</p>

        <p>we don't take the original polio vaccine which was brute-forced rushed through, breached all sorts of ethical concerns when tested on retarded children, and then killed thousands of kids</p>
<p>we take the one that took longer, was tested ethically, came out years after the first one, and has an almost impeccable safety record</p>
<p>you don't have a clue what you're talking about; you're not reading people's actual professed and explicit concerns with the COVID injection, you conflate and obfuscate other "vaccines" and their "benefits" to try to argue about <em>this</em> injection while almost every person in this sub is saying "not all things termed 'vaccine' are equal, I have and will continue to take other vaccines I consider to be the right cost-benefit trade-off, and I am wholly unconvinced <em>at least</em> the COVID injection is one of them."</p>

        <p>&rt; you don't have a clue what you're talking about </p>
<p>I'm a UK-based doctor training in immunology, just to get that out of the way. I'm happy to discuss this, but the problem is you're stated opinions based on complete fabrication which is why people become reluctant to engage in conversation. I'm always happy to discuss matters surrounding COVID, but the problem is that most people on the subreddit, as you've demonstated, just don't want to listen to facts. </p>
<p>The concerns expressed by a lot of people are legitmate and understandable concerns (such as the VIIT/VIPIT and adeno vector based vaccines) and the reason we're even talking about it is because it was picked up by a stringent process enabling us to do so. If you actually bothered to read the above point, it surrounds risk/benefit, so the point of bringing in examples of other vaccines is a valid one especially as a response to another person talking about the swine flu vaccine. It may help to read the context of replies rather than skim reading and jumping to conclusions.</p>

        <p>Oh it's not that; there's no reasoning with a brick wall - you literally don't want to listen to fact and reasoning so every argument made comes off as a screaming child. Doesn't bother me one bit whether or not you believe I'm a doctor. Like I said, I'm just over the moon that we're going to have vaccine passports to put people in a safer position from those that don't want to educate themselves. Good luck with everything!</p>

        <p>I agree the polio vaccine has been unbelievably effective in its administration, however. The polio vaccine was researched from 1948 - 1953 when a vaccine was finally produced, a further 2 years testing was when they finally announced that the vaccine was safe and effective for mass use in 1955 though. Even then thanks to a defective batch thousands more polio cases were discovered and 200 children were left paralysed and 10 of them died.</p>
<p>The Covid “vaccine” had nowhere near the amount of research and testing that Polio vaccines had, not to mention a mRNA “vaccine” had never been approved until last year to my knowledge. Now we’ve had many reports of bad reactions after having the “vaccine” and some deaths, in any other situation that would be enough to halt use and go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Through my life experiences of government intervention (I’ve seen 4 pandemics and 3 economy ending recessions) I will never trust anything they say unless they can provide concrete indisputable evidence that it is at least 99% safe.</p>

        <p>It's odd you keep putting vaccine in quotation marks since it fits the exact definition of what a vaccine is.... But anyway</p>
<p>You've got to realise that science has advanced <strong>dramatically</strong> in those 70 odd years which have past since then. Just because you have skeptism towards government trust, doesn't mean that the scientific foundation behind all this is false; in fact it's been demonstrated time and time again that hospitalisations, mortality and morbidy have all reduced thanks to these vaccines.</p>

        <p>Definition : Vaccine
n.  A preparation of a weakened or killed pathogen, such as a bacterium or virus, or of a portion of the pathogen's structure that upon administration to an individual stimulates antibody production or cellular immunity against the pathogen but is incapable of causing severe infection.</p>
<p>It neither prevents nor stops transmission... it’s not a vaccine that’s why I use the quotations... and until a vaccine reaches the gold standard of testing I will not seriously call it as such.</p>
<p>I don’t just have skepticism towards government, all the manufacturers were given full immunity from legal action... why? I have found a laundry list of legal cases from each of the manufacturers not to mention that J&amp;J have the record for the single biggest compensation payout by a medical company, then either Moderna or Pfizer have the largest amount of legal cases against a single company... Why would I trust these companies with my bodily autonomy? With a rushed vaccine, approved by a government who has on multiple occasions proven itself to be dishonest at best? Why would anyone trust them?</p>

        <p>Every definition of a vaccine, including yours, surrounds the purpose of a vaccine to be one to help prevent disease. Here's some more:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine">https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Vaccine  suspension of weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganisms or toxins or of antibodies or lymphocytes that is administered <strong>primarily to prevent</strong> <strong>diseas</strong><strong>e.</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vaccine?q=vaccine">https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vaccine?q=vaccine</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; ​a substance that is put into the blood and <strong>that protects the body from a disease</strong></p>
<p>It's been shown in study after study after study that in an overwhelming majority of people, these vaccines do exactly that! The definition of a vaccine is not about transmission (although forttunately for us, many vaccines including these ones have demonstrated a reduced transmission rate). </p>
<p>In terms of legality, pretty much all companies, not just pharma companies, will have a clause to state that if someone chooses to use their product or service, they are protected from legal action. The difference here is that it's been highlighted. Honestly, you can even have a quick search yourself. </p>
<p>Also, as someone heavily involved in research, I can confidently says that these (to clairify I'm talking about Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and AZ since I don't know much about the others) vaccine weren't rushed. A huge part of clinical trials actually comes from funding and ethical approval. For example in the UK, the process of HRA approval can take longer than than trial itself! Each stage in trial went through all processes as it should with adequate sampling. Again, you've mentioned the government who did not get involved with the science being vaccine development... At the end of the day it's everyone's choice to get vaccinated of not, but there's no room for complaining when inevitably vaccine passports will be required for some activities to take place especially when the opportunity is there. Again, no one is forcing the vaccine, just like people shouldn't be forced to be put in positions which increases their risk of contracting COVID.</p>

        <p>Imagine, for a second, that not everyone in the world has to do what you say just because you're a doctor. I know it might be difficult, but you'll get used to it. It's kind of sad having to explain why unwanted medical procedures shouldn't be forced on the general populace to someone who's supposedly a doctor. It's a human rights issue, and it spits in the face of the oath you take as a doctor. The individual person has rights, and those rights belong to <em>them</em>. That's what sovereignty is, something we used to actually value. <em>You</em> are the one who uneducated. You may have medical knowledge, but you've forgotten why we invented medicine in the first place- we wanted a way to care for those who were I'll and wanted help. Clinical trials aren't even completed, and you want to force people to take this vaccine? Pregnant women? Children? Babies? What gives you the right to do that to them? You wouldn't sneak up behind someone and stab them with a shot, why is coercing them and ruining their life and livelihood if they don't comply any better? I'd hate to be one of your patients, you seem like an extremely vindictive and arrogant person- that's a really bad mix for a doctor, unfortunately not all that uncommon.</p>

        <p>It's your choice? Is that a joke? For a doctor you seem a bit slow. Yeah it's your choice, but if you don't get it you can't into stores, bars, games, work, or just outside in the general public at all. You can't travel, can't go to school (even if it's remote, colleges are enforcing vaccine policy), can't visit your loved ones in the hospital if they are sick or dying... So how exactly does that make it our choice? There is no choice, it's get the emergency approved vaccine or become a leper. This is top down authoritarian control based on politics, not science. If you're going to be an arrogant prick, at least have the balls to say what you really mean. Don't come to people as a wolf in sheep's clothing, telling people it's "their choice" when you want to lock them out of society for making a decision that <em>you</em> think is bad. It's incredibly sad to me that someone who claims to care about other people, who's job it is to help the vulnerable, has such distain for the common person. You laugh and make of everyone who disagrees with you for being uneducated, but if that's true then these are the people who are the most vulnerable. These are the people who you signed up to help, but you fail to see their humanity. You mock their fear of something that is a brand new medical procedure, something that has no long term trial data available. And you tell them they are anti-science? You're a medical professional coercing people without medical training and telling them it's "safe" when you have no proof. How do you know? Where is your data? If you want people to believe the vaccine is safe, then <em>you</em> have to prove it to <em>them</em>- they don't have to prove it's unsafe, that's not how medical science works and you know this but you just don't care cause it's your chance to feel like a hero. A doctor with a big ego is so cliche, you'd think the community would have more self-awareness. At this point I'm picturing you wearing a stethoscope all day long and randomly telling strangers about how you're a doctor, and nobody caring.</p>

It's not the fault of the educated that you decided not to learn basic science and you're struggling to grasp how vaccines work.

        <p>Lmao!  Love your inaccurate assumption of me. Being that you are a “doctor”, I would think you would promote healthy immune systems such as mine than to taking a shot full of crap, that is not fda approved, for a concoction that was rushed and has not been tested long enough before it’s release, and an mRNA that is completely new to being used in humans.  I’m so grateful people like you who can’t think for themselves are taking those shots. 😆 I can’t wait to see the effects on you in a few years. Weeding the herd out is so damn easy with humans like you. 😘</p>

        <p>Your beloved polio vax causes more polio cases than would occur on the wild. </p>
<p>More polio cases now caused by vaccine than by wild virus</p>
<p>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/polio-cases-now-caused-vaccine-wild-virus-67287290</p>
<p>LONDON -- Four African countries have reported new cases of polio linked to the oral vaccine, as global health numbers show there are now more children being paralyzed by viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild.</p>
<p>In a report late last week, the World Health Organization and partners noted nine new polio cases caused by the vaccine in Nigeria, Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. Seven countries elsewhere in Africa have similar outbreaks and cases have been reported in Asia. Of the two countries where polio remains endemic, Afghanistan and Pakistan, vaccine-linked cases have been identified in Pakistan.</p>
<p>In rare cases, the live virus in oral polio vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. All the current vaccine-derived polio cases have been sparked by a Type 2 virus contained in the vaccine. Type 2 wild virus was eliminated years ago.</p>
<p>Polio is a highly infectious disease that spreads in contaminated water or food and usually strikes children under 5. About one in 200 infections results in paralysis. Among those, a small percentage die when their breathing muscles are crippled.</p>
<p>Donors last week pledged $2.6 billion to combat polio as part of an eradication initiative that began in 1988 and hoped to wipe out polio by 2000. Since then, numerous such deadlines have been missed.</p>
<p>To eradicate polio, more than 95% of a population needs to be immunized. WHO and partners have long relied on oral polio vaccines because they are cheap and can be easily administered, requiring only two drops per dose. Western countries use a more expensive injectable polio vaccine that contains an inactivated virus incapable of causing polio.</p>
<p>The Independent Monitoring Board, a group set up by WHO to assess polio eradication, warned in a report this month that vaccine-derived polio virus is “spreading uncontrolled in West Africa, bursting geographical boundaries and raising fundamental questions and challenges for the whole eradication process.”</p>
<p>The group said officials were already “failing badly” to meet a recently approved polio goal of stopping all vaccine-derived outbreaks within 120 days of detection. It described the initial attitude of WHO and its partners to stopping such vaccine-linked polio cases as “relaxed” and said “new thinking” on how to tackle the problem was needed.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>This story has been corrected to show that of the two polio-endemic countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, only Pakistan has reported vaccine-derived polio cases.</p>

        <p>I agree with this 100%. I don't know either. All I know is that my common sense tells me something isn't right about covid cases and this vaccine agenda. I have always believed in personal choice and it just amazes me that so many people don't believe in it anymore. Hearing people actively mock others for not believing everything the MSM puts out really upsets me.</p>

        <p>Same, the very fact that they’re trying to coerce everyone into getting them with free donuts or being able to travel again should have raised red flags for everyone. Then if that doesn’t work, they start with the threats and insults. It’s literally everything we were taught to avoid since middle school lol with their peer pressuring, stranger danger asses. </p>
<p>I know people are stupid but I really didn’t think the majority would be this gullible and trusting. Just the vaccine commercials are so ridiculous, how can they not see right through it? Aren’t they embarrassed when they repeat the same lines the news told them to say? I’ve seen ppl I know for years who were always skeptical of everything suddenly start doing it. It’s fucking creepy. </p>
<p>When I ask them what changed they literally say “we all have to do our part!” “Are you saying you don’t care about elderly ppl dying? It could be your grandparents ya know!” “LoNg CoViD!”These are ppl I’ve known for over a decade, and they know obviously I would never be happy about ppl dying, but they still put me in that box cuz the news told them to. Only a month ago they were on the same page as us. They act like those conversations never happened now, wtf is going on? </p>
<p>I know it sounds crazy but sometimes I really do wonder if they’re literally brainwashed or something. The fact that they don’t even realize how disconcerting it is to repeat taglines from the news word for word makes it even worse. Just last year these ppl would have laughed along with me if we saw someone do that. Again, wtf?</p>

        <p>It does seem a lot like brainwashing to me. I had friends who gave zero fucks about covid last year. No masks. Parties. Vacations. This year they posted vaccine selfies, soon followed by masked alone in the car selfies. The amount of "I'm vaccinated" announcements on social media is blowing my mind. It bothers me more if they put some snide remark on there or add "do your part" hashtags and shit. Bizarro world.</p>

        <p>That's how I feel. I am uncomfortable with the amount of propaganda surrounding this vaccine and I'm creeped out by just how much the media and government is pushing it on me. Because of that I just don't feel comfortable getting it. I know tons of people are getting vaccinated and are perfectly fine, including most of my family and friends, so I'm not crazy scared of it or think it's going to kill me, I just don't feel comfortable with it, and that should be an acceptable reason enough not to get it.</p>

<p>I do, however, believe in reason. I know that often, there isn't a 100% consensus on anything. Just that if there's a 99.9% consensus, it's more reasonable to side with conclusions of the 99.9% than the 0.01%</p>

        <p>I have never felt more frustrated with other humans than I do now. Trying to have a discussion with people who are pro vaccine and pro lockdown is completely  one sided. We Aren't allowed to disagree, you aren't allowed to be using different news sources, if you're not following exactly what they believe they will start to call you names and insult your intelligence. It's at the point where it's too exhausting for me and I can't engage with them. I don't care what they think of me anymore. They don't see me as human, they have to do things to dehumanize me like assume I am a brain-dead idiot and I'm a selfish monster who wants everyone dead. Their way of thinking is so childish and simplistic I'm pretty much done from trying to have any sort of productive discussion with them. I can agree to disagree and listen to other people's opinions and sources but they can't do the same for me. I'm just not doing this anymore.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I don’t even bother anymore because all they do is talk in circles and regurgitate their little one-liners from CNN. It’s honestly embarrassing, I had someone tell me to my face “we all have to do our part!” and I almost kicked her out of my house lol </p>
<p>It drives me crazy that they truly believe we’re evil and revel in grandparents dying or something. Yes, that’s why we’re trying to alert ppl about the vax and encourage them to do more research right? It would be a lot simpler to say nothing at all and just watch what happens to them.</p>

        <p>Actually you said to another user:</p>
<p>"And you can post their educational backgrounds to prove it, right?</p>
<p>But I think you'll find they're about the same, LOL"</p>
<p>And I posted their educational backgrounds.
Then instead of trying to "make a joke and leave"
You made derogatory comments.</p>
<p>Finally, checking your history I think most people would agree that if their is a "Shillbot" it's you my Russian friend. ✌</p>

        <p>Lol! You made me laugh here which is quite an accomplishment lately, I totally agree with you! I would love to reality test them and say to them exactly what you have said here, do you honestly believe I want old people to die? That I'm a grandma killer? That I'm super selfish and don't care about anyone but myself? The reason I'm so upset and stressed out is because of exactly the opposite! I am afraid people are killing themselves with these vaccines and the path we're going down! It is just so exhausting</p>

<p>How about we're "cruel and disrespectful" for suggesting people can boost their immunity through Vitamin D, exercise, diet.  But they are just concerned about people's health by demanding we (not them, they didn't lose their jobs) give up our jobs, livelihoods and sit inside all day.  </p>
<p>Oh, and if we don't wear a mask we "deserve to die".</p>

        <p>Agree. After much vilification and accusation of being a trumper religious conspiracy nut by friends after telling them I didn’t get the vaccine I noticed that too. I’ve made a rational and adult decision because I’m a healthy young-ish person who has made it this far on my own healthy immune system and common sense. I’ve probably been exposed dozens of times to this thing and am okay. I see no reason to use an unproven gene therapy because social pressure says I should. People really are going overboard. It’s disconcerting</p>

        <p>I’m not getting the vaccine right now because I decided not to get the vaccine right now. I don’t need to justify my personal medical decisions to anyone else. Modern medicine is amazing, and maybe I’ll get the vaccine a few months down the road, but ‘no’ means ‘no’, and it’s not fair to pressure people to do something they’re so uncomfortable with, whatever their reason. Nothing is 100%, including both the vaccine and my views on on the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I use the economics style risk/benefit analysis...is it more beneficial or more risky to take an experimental gene therapy product (not a vaccine, it is a vaccine in name only to allow manufacturers to have liability protections) that has been shown to cause severe side effects including death and the younger the recipient, the higher the risk vs possibly getting a disease where I will either have no symptoms or have a surivilability rate of 99.998%? Gee...let me think about that one for a minute.</p>

        <p>I agree so much. People don't know anything for sure. </p>
<p>Let's put it this way. I don't trust the government. But in the beginning of 2020, I used that distrust to form a very different opinion than what I now have. I thought the government was lying and covering up the severity of Covid. So I was the only one wearing an N95 mask, gloves, etc. No one believed me. They all said it would stay in China. Everyone thought I was paranoid. Now my opinion has evolved into thinking this is a power grab. Hindsight is 2020, no pun intended. It's very hard to know what's going on during the time you are living in. And even after decades, I'm not sure we will have the answers about everything. </p>
<p>I still don't trust government. And I don't feel good about this vaccine having the biggest propaganda push I've ever seen. There are things that don't add up. More time is needed to get a better sense of what the hell is going on.</p>

        <p>Exactly 100% this... i felt something was "off" with this whole pandemic from the moment it began it was suspicious...</p>
<p>after doing independent research and applying logic i have decided that the vaccine is not for me and that everyone should have the right to choose if they want to take the vaccine without being punished for it.</p>
<p>I actually hope i am wrong and that these experimental mRNA altering injections are a legitimate good thing for the people... because if we ARE right then the truth is terrifying... so I WANT to be wrong.... but i can easily admit that i don't 100% know, i am just going with the safest option, which is avoiding the experimental drug.</p>

        <p>there is no remembrance of the past. "everyone died at 30 in the past" is what people believe now. 100 years is a short time for all these changes. if we were born any other time we would all probably be farmers or something. if it really was an optional thing then nobody would or could get mad.</p>

        <p>When I’m arguing with people about this I often find myself in a situation where I start going too far in the direction of “it’s all made up”. Obviously the disease is real, the flu exists, I’ve had it before. Now I don’t know if it is in fact worse than the average seasonal flu but I know it’s real. You’re right, it’s about freedom. Whether or not the disease is as bad as they say or worse doesn’t actually matter at the end of the day...the point is lockdowns have done way more harm than good and continuing these totalitarian measures is destroying society.</p>
