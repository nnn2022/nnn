        <p>Hey guys, so the only people I knew that were on my side (mom and dad) are now scared of covid and want to take the vaccine. Tbh, watever makes them feel safe, take the vaccine if you want. But the only people that used to not believe in all the nonsense are now supporting all the narrative. They are saying a lot of people have died and that the disease is really dangerous because of the symptoms the person might have even after recovering. All my friends and coworkers are doomers and I have to pretend I care/avoid the subject to not get into stupid arguments that might turn into me becominf a selfish scum. Now that I know that I lost my parents support I feel like I'm all alone irl. </p>
<p>I might get fired for not taking the vaccine (after being a year unnemployed because of covid) and my coworkers can suddenly hate me if they find out what's my opinion. I always see mandates getting lifted in the USA but things in my country are far from returning into normal. Never in my life I felt so alone and lost about something. Maybe I'm really selfish and childish..</p>
<p>So to you guys that live in places with no more mandates, I'm happy for you! </p>
<p>Also, thanks for this community, at least I'm not alone in this world full of people. I wish I knew some of you guys irl.</p>

        <p>by not getting vaccinated you are giving the virus the opportunity to mutate in you.. these mutations could end up creating a virus that does not respond to a vaccine.. if you get vaccinated, you significantly reduce your chances of getting covid and thus lowering the chance it will mutate.. so by not getting it and risking becoming an incubator for mutations, you’re putting every other person at risk. EVEN if you have ZERO symptoms, the virus can still mutate and become even worse.. so putting everyone else at risk because you’re too proud/deluded seems pretty selfish</p>

<li>I'm sick of the shills and brigaders who lurk in our sub and basically wish us all ill-will or death. </li>
<li>We all know that the PCR test is faulty, which skews the number of cases (i.e. false positives) as well as skews the actual death count (with or without co-morbidities/pre-existing conditions). But when we try linking actual proof or evidence towards this, the shills don't even bother responding or reading the info, and just reply back with "Fake News!"</li>

<p>No, they dont. As I already said in another thready I know a straight A-grade political theory master who cant understand the difference between Symptomatic and Asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>Oh, I meant those of us who are members of NoNewNormal know the PCR test is faulty (aka those of us who are awake to this scamdemic). </p>
<p>Got into an argument with a family member about asymptomatic people, and asked her she thought it meant, and she said "a sick person", and I told her "it means a healthy person but suspected of being a carrier, to which there is absolutely no verifiable proof that healthy people are carriers who can transmit it to another person", yet she just brushed me off and ignored what I said because "the news said so".</p>

        <p>Then don't. A few days ago I told my mother that this whole thing is only done when we hang them all. Nothing will change without that kind of uproar. 1989 was an error in history...<br>
She was appalled and said that this kind of speech could be very dangerous.<br>
I asked here if I should accept something from my government which not even she would demand from me. Made her pause then she said I would do as I like anyway so what's the point. I concurred exactly, and since so many others do exactly as I'd do and they are the same as me, yes, exactly what's the goal here?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don’t understand how these people are allowed repeatedly make trolling comments here, when that’s against the “be respectful” rule. Are the mods doing anything about this? If they aren’t then they need to remove that rule. We can be either a friendly discussion forum, or a say-what-you-want internet battleground, but not both.</p>

        <p>With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.
In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said.</p>

        <p>Sure, if I wanted to, but based you post history? LOL! Give me a break! Why should I waste my time with someone as insincere &amp; callous as you?? You either have some sort of superiority complex, or just wish to mock us for your own stupid entertainment, or you're a shill from another subreddit or website. I've read what you've corresponded with others, and I'm short on patience with your type who belittle, mock or act passive-aggressively towards this community. </p>
<p>I really don't understand your type at all. You come into this subreddit to write your drivel in a very irritating way. You've already stated to others you don't care if they take the vaccine or not, but you keep harassing others by continual espousing your own views. No one wants to engage with you. What the fuck is your problem? I trust my own immune system, so I'll take my chances with covid-19 (if it exists that is). </p>
<p>Jesus Christ... the more I read your posts, the more I shake my head at you and the rest of your ilk. You're always asking/demanding for data or charts. You have a very antagonizing personality. JFL... </p>
<p>You want dialogue? Act like decent human being towards us, not as some prick! If you acted more sincerely and were genuinely more kinder, sure, I'd have a civil discourse with you, but based on everything I see, no way. I don't wish to engage with someone pushing their views or have some fascination to debate or mock or belittle for their own bemusement. All I sense from you is ill-will and harm towards me and to this community. As you made it clear earlier <strong><em>"It helps me feel better about my pro vax stance when I visit the other side..."</em></strong>  LOL, I seriously doubt you even got vaccinated. </p>
<p>You bother me again, I'll ask the mods to ban you. Create a new account and they'll ban you again (hopefully for good).</p>

        <p>I haven't wished I'll will toward anyone and have only responded callously after being attacked. I'm here to ask questions and see if my opinion can be swayed. If you have data I would love to see it. If you feel attacked because I disagree with your opinion that's unfortunate. People should be able to get along despite personal differences. I'm in no way rigid in my beliefs or opinions and I am open to new information. What I'm not open to is misinformation and misguided judgment based on things like openVAERS.org, etc...</p>

        <p>I know you probably hate being attacked, but as the old expression goes "You need to look at yourself in the mirror." </p>
<p>Seriously, ask someone you personally know, and go through your entire post history regarding covid, and ask them for a critique. It's a free country (so far anyways), so you're free to be mean or kind or whatever towards someone else, but I felt ill-will &amp; callousness from you, and I would suspect others have too (hence your negative rating). You don't see me dropping in on r/CovidVaccinated or r/Covidiots making a ruckus. They're set in their ways, but they continually drop by here to attack us. I have no need to engage with them. </p>
<p>By the way, I recognize some members of this community have been terse with you, which isn't acceptable in my mind, but can you blame them? A lot of them have suffered tremendous pain &amp; suffering, and they don't want to engage with your type if you're going to antagonize them! A forum is a method or form of healing. This place allows them to vent or heal in certain ways. </p>
<p>I also recognize facts are important, and also correct others if they post something that I feel is either irrelevant, insincere or disingenuous, as well as I know there's always new data coming about, but I've noticed now it's become a tit-for-tat war of "selective science", so no matter who we source, someone will counter with their own science based facts. this war of attrition has become ridiculous. </p>
<p>Doctors, nurses, and scientific researchers who I've followed for a while have had their YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and/or other social media accounts banned or closed down. When free speech is limited, when dissenting voices are silenced, when I see people crying from their own suffering, then I put 2 + 2 together to formulate my own plan of action. </p>
<p>Good day to you.</p>

        <p>I whole heartedly agree with your last statement, up until the 2 + 2 as I'm not sure what conclusion you've come to. There are some massive issues with respect to freedom, on that we can agree. A member of this sub posted this study, I did a brief scan and plan to read in full as it's very interesting. It's relevant to your comment on selective science and may be worth your while as well https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf 
As for masking, if you're interested, this is the most comprehensive research I could find https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340603522_Face_Masks_Against_COVID-19_An_Evidence_Review</p>

<p>Just as an aside, pick a stance here. It's either unacceptable or you can't blame them, it can't be both. I would say I can blame them, they have full control over their actions and reactions. At the end of the day some people can disagree with grace and some can't. Several members on this sub, when presented with empirical evidence which refuted their claims, resorted to calling me out for "shilling" (as if I work for pfizer or something lol) or just grade school name calling. If your information is wrong but you want to hold on to your opinion that's fine but don't shoot the messenger...</p>

<p>"This conclusion suggests that vaccination-generated antibody and/or exogenous antibody against S protein not only protects the host from SARS-CoV-2 infectivity but also inhibits S protein-imposed endothelial injury." from your source's conclusions. So the vaccine protects against injury of tissues from spike protein. <strong>Kinda says the opposite of what you'd like people to think--this is typical.

<p>Now do other age groups and pre-existing conditions. This is where the "selfish" argument comes into play, however you feel about it. Vaccines are not only for the individual patient. We're clearly in a serious pandemic with approximatley 580,000 deaths in the U.S. so I don't know what point you think you're making.  </p>
<p>&rt; Tens of thousands of women report menstruation irregularities after taking the vaccine.  </p>
<p>Which have, in all cases, been temporary side effects from the vaccine. Irregularities like this are extremely common due to a number of environmental factors.</p>

        <p>&rt;Kinda says the opposite of what you'd like people to think--this is typical. You pick one line from a study and ignore the rest,</p>
<p>This is exactly what you've done! You looked at the conclusion statement without reading any of the paper! You should know that a concluding statement can say whatever they want. I've seen absolutely worthless papers that conclude with "this protein could have broad medical, engineering, and materials applications in the near future." Of course that shit isn't true, but it doesn't stop them from putting it at the end of the paper.</p>
<p>Besides, if they had ended the paper with "These findings call into question the safety of the covid-19 vaccines." Do you think they would have been published?</p>
<p>If you consider yourself knowledgeable about molecular biology, I'd love to discuss this paper with you, because it really is damning. It's the mechanism for all the myocarditis and heart attack that's happening in teenagers.</p>
<p>&rt;trusting that the unwitting users of this sub aren't going to read the study themselves but trust YOUR conclusions as a random Redditor.</p>
<p>Just because I'm a random redditor doesn't mean that I can't read a paper.  I have a degree in Moly Bio, including graduate work in virology and immunology.</p>
<p>&rt;Vaccines are not only for the individual patient.</p>
<p>Then who are they for? If the vaccine works, why do you care if I get it? And if your response is "variants", I'd love to see why you think we can prevent variants with vaccination, particularly when much of the world is not vaccinating at all.</p>
<p>&rt;Which have, in all cases, been temporary side effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Wow your assertion here is absolutely unfounded. How do you know that menstruation side effects have ceased? How do you know there isn't an effect on fertility? The research literally hasn't been done, pregnant women were of course not part of the clinical trials. It will take many more months before the data on fertility issues is collected and analysed.</p>

        <p>I've seen those numbers, and they're skewed. You want proof, right? I can't give you a smoking gun, but the PCR test cannot detect a live virus from a dead one. In fact, the inventor, Kary Mullis, even stated never to use his test to detect for viruses. He conveniently died though in August 2019, and then Event 201 happened in October 2021. </p>

You should be happy that we don't, cause in your logic we should all die off. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier, leave us alone. We're getting our news from real journalists, not from the fake-ass complicit lame-stream-media. Go live your life, and I'll go live mine. I won't harm or interfere with you or anyone else. But the more you try subverting or causing dissent in this sub, the more we'll resist your nonsense and consider you a true enemy of humanity.</p>

        <p>What I find so bizarre is how people see the constant  imagery of face masks, cold laboratories, face shields, needles, militarized vaccination camps as a sign and virtue of Health.  I see all this imagery as the opposite of Health.  It’s the devil.  </p>
<p>No offense, but the rank and file people in the medical field  that administer bedside care are mediocre people just filling out forms and checking boxes and carrying out the orders of the insurance and drug company overlords.  Sorry, but I don’t need Nurse Betsy lecturing me on health and injecting my body.  The main purpose of all these drug and biotech companies is to make a return for their investors.  Nothing else.</p>

<p>In my country there's STILL absolute no talk about prevention. Sport, nutrition, sun/vitamin D etc. only masking, distancing, seeing others as the devil etc.<br>
I can discern reliably a candidate for this sub by asking what that person does for prevention. If there's a blank stare -&rt; normie. If there is any answer, that person is suspect of being a rebel :D</p>

        <p>I went to Sam's Club today and got more than a year's supply of Vitamin C and D. Less than $30 combined. Prices are going to go up and who knows what the FDA/CDC are going to try to do about supplements... now I'm good through summer 2022.</p>
<p>Also getting a lot of non-perishable staples like rice while they're still pretty cheap. I'm going to eat it regardless of what happens to food supply or prices, so might as well get at least a few months worth now.</p>

        <p>You know what is really amusing? (First to explain, there are two kinds of Drug stores in my country. Apotheken which are stores oriented to prescribed drugs and Drogerien - which sound a lot like drugs, same word - which can but don't have to sell prescribed drugs and live off OTC.)<br>
Now the Apotheken are much more hesitant to recommend Vitamin D. The Drogerien otoh outright recommended it against the flu and you know (looking into the eyes) wink wink nudge nudge. I encountered this in three locations. :D</p>
<p>Since I live in a very small market I don't worry about price hiking. We're used to high prices. What I worry about is full shortages. But since Germany produces cheap supplements and Switzerland has (high priced) capacities I don't think there will be problems. A months ration of Vitamin D (2000 IU per pill) costs me 20$, the higher priced domestic variant costs 40$. So meh, if they have to increase prices it will be around 50. So what. In the worst case I just go and buy two or three months worth right into the shortage and the price signal will incentivize production.</p>

        <p>I [39M] am the only person in my peer group that isn't vaccinated yet and I am being 'vaccine-shamed' by everyone constantly. Everyone wants to challenge me, and it's very mentally draining. I am not against vaccinations, but I am concerned at the number of deaths and serious adverse reactions being registered in VAERS. Worse yet, I am stressing out that my two elementary-aged kids will be required to be vaccinated before next Fall. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about :(</p>

        <p>PM me anytime, genuinely. I wish I knew how to organize a telegram channel or something with people (especially parents of these next age groups expected to join the trial).</p>
<p>I do not engage with people who ask me entering about my reasons behind not having the vaccine. Mostly  because there is no honest will on their part to have a conversation. They want to remind themselves that they’re right, and don’t have any desire to consider different perspectives. </p>
<p>Truly
Open minded people have to remind themselves that they’re not being treated with genuine curiosity. It’s black and white with this issue for people who have the nerve to establish that they chose differently than you and follow up by expecting you to validate yourself to them. </p>
<p>I would never ask someone why they got it. I don’t care. Least I could do is admit it instead of pretending otherwise as a guise to convert the soul that ‘needs saving from their ignorance’. it’s self righteous in a way that viscerally repulses me. </p>
<p>When this issue turns to my children, and parents are burning the witch who didn’t do as theyre told, when this becomes bullying my child, making them feel anything at all by grown adults whose own opinions are so holier than thou that they treat dissenting people as nameless enemies- </p>
<p>When my kids life becomes segregated from
Normalcy With the support of the community that children should be able to find strength in... when children are shunned... when they ask me why they can’t just do it because their life is being made hellish by others.. </p>
<p>that’s when I’m done sitting down.</p>

        <p>by not getting vaccinated you are giving the virus the opportunity to mutate in you.. these mutations could end up creating a virus that does not respond to a vaccine.. if you get vaccinated, you significantly reduce your chances of getting covid and thus lowering the chance it will mutate.. so by not getting it and risking becoming an incubator for mutations, you’re putting every other person at risk. EVEN if you have ZERO symptoms, the virus can still mutate and become even worse.. so putting everyone else at risk because you’re to proud/deluded seems pretty selfish</p>

        <p>How do you guys not see how much theater this is??? We had people on this forum, as soon as Trevor Noah (a mainstream voice) did his segment questioning the vaccines working if we still have to mask, saying that this is a show and that it was very obvious they were going to change the guidelines soon and this is how they prep the public.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, just as the people here predicted, the cdc conveniently changes their masking guidelines right after that Trevor Noah segment. You are being programmed according to a script people. This is all a plamdemic. They tell the news and comics and late night shows what to say and when to say it.</p>
<p>This is all a giant show and it’s insulting how obvious it is</p>

        <p>It's so bizarre to me how upset some people are about the mask mandates ending in many US states and the CDC announcement about not needing to wear masks outdoors and in some indoor places. This is literally an essential step to going back to normal. Isn't going back to normal what you want? What we ALL want? And I keep seeing so many comments like "fuck whatever the CDC says I'M GONNA KEEP WEARING MY MASK!!!"... Like, ok? You do you. No one says you HAVE to stop wearing it. Just that it's socially acceptable not to anymore. Which is a great thing! It means we're easing back into normalcy. So I just don't understand how anyone could be against that.</p>
<p>And I keep seeing people bitching about how Costco and Walmart aren't going to be checking for vaccination status from maskless people going into their store. I just watched a few IG stories earlier from a celeb I follow who was like "people who weren't wearing their mask before and who aren't vaccinated are now just going to say they got the vaccine and go in maskless! So like, i'm probably just not going to go out ever again and stay in my house".</p>
<p>Wow, if only most doomers had this same attitude from the start. But besides that, what the fuck are YOU concerned about if you're vaccinated? Anyone in that store is either A - vaccinated and therefore protected and has nothing to worry about. Or B - unvaxxed but undertaking the risk that they could be exposed to COVID and get infected. So either way, there's no issues here. People have taken personal responsibility either way. </p>
<p>It just makes me shake my head.</p>

        <p>My two daughters are graduating high school this year. But I have an infant son as well (yes, huge gap, I know, lol - my wife is a fair bit younger than I am, but that's beside the point). I fucking <em>hate</em> that he was born into this hell. Fortunately, he's still several years off from school, but there's no telling how things are going to be by then. Maybe people will come to their senses in a few years, but things could also go horribly sideways, worse than they are now.  </p>

        <p>I agree completely. There was a guy in another thread that said 99.9% of people haven't been badly affected by the restrictions. I couldn't even reply because of all the bullshit I would had needed to debunk but my thought was that the guy probably didn't have kids. How can a family of two working people with one or more small children that are now faced with remote learning not be greatly affected by the restrictions and the number of people in that situation is far greater than .1%. Luckily my wife does not work so  she is doing the remote learning with our youngest but I told her flat out to not do it and to tell all the teachers and administrators that we refuse however she started doing it anyway mostly out of guilt.</p>
<p>Good luck and stay sane;)</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's a fucking shit show all around. They had students here haphazardly back and forth between in-person and remote, both of which were handled like third world ass. It's shown me that the government is not only untrustworthy, but far more inept than I ever thought prior to all this.  </p>

        <p>I don't see how that makes any difference. I have never had a flu shot nor has anyone in my family. I have never needed to prove that I had my flu shot to board a plane or anything else for that matter and my kids have never been denied in-school learning because they didn't have the flu shot. If they treat this vaccine the same way then I won't care.</p>

        <p>by not getting vaccinated you are giving the virus the opportunity to mutate in you.. these mutations could end up creating a virus that does not respond to a vaccine.. if you get vaccinated, you significantly reduce your chances of getting covid and thus lowering the chance it will mutate.. so by not getting it and risking becoming an incubator for mutations, you’re putting every other person at risk. EVEN if you have ZERO symptoms, the virus can still mutate and become even worse.. so putting everyone else at risk because you’re to proud/deluded seems pretty selfish</p>

        <p>Depends, many people with those secondary conditions live moderately long lives. You're not saying anything I'd consider asshole-ish. There are just arguments in favor of vaccination that the scientific community deems far better than these. Maybe for some here the "scientific community" is some distant thing, but for me it's friends who I think are good and dedicated people, not to mention intelligent.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of intelligent people are in the science community, and I'm all for people voluntarily getting the vaccine. I don't think it's something I'm going to get, but I'm not going to stop someone else from doing so. It's a lot different from all the other vaccines we have, this new one was rushed out in under a year and we still don't know the long term effects.</p>

        <p>I would argue it was brought out quickly, but not rushed, they have been testing for many months now. If there was some kind of odd side effect that kicked in after a year it would be the greatest scientific misstep in recent history, side-effects that occur that much later just don't happen. I'm not saying it's not possible, but the chances of something like that happening are so small I don't think it makes sense to consider it. You have exponentially greater chances of harm from a car wreck on your way to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Yeah pretty terrifying that COVID has increased that by 20%, right? (well, not exactly 20%, some deaths are 2020, some 2021, but still a pretty significant increase). </p>
<p>&rt; (well beyond life expectancy)  </p>
<p>Yeah, I guess my thing is that unlike you (apparently?), I'm totally willing to put up with a slightly sore arm and wear a bit of fabric for the benefit of other people, even those beyond normal life expectancy. Not to mention people much younger but with pre-existing conditions.  </p>
<p>&rt; only around 13% of them died from/with COVID.  </p>
<p>You say "only". 13% is pretty damn significant.</p>

        <p>&rt;  she’s 30. Why are people in this age group even subjecting themselves to this garbage?</p>
<p>I'm in this age range! It was a pretty obvious decision for me for several reasons:  </p>
<p>1) Help protect my elderly father who has several pre-existing conditions and other relatives<br>
2) Help get the country back on track<br>
3) Not worried about myself, but hey, at least I'm protected now, just in case  </p>
<p>And honestly... one of the biggest reasons, is why not? It is shown to be safe and effective. I had a sore arm for about 24 hours. No different from my flu shots.</p>

        <p>I have my reasons as to why i'm choosing not to get it (at least right away), but i'm not sure why you're being downvoted. You have a legitimate reason via your elderly father and you even said you're not worried about yourself but you're fine with protection. And you weren't rude or condescending. So this time I don't agree with the downvotes.</p>

        <p>I've been out of work since November.  It was not by choice, but it is now and it has been for awhile.  I am so ready to get back to work and be a productive member of society, but I suffered a mental breakdown not from fear of covid, but from experiencing extreme cognitive dissidents.  I had mental illness before covid, but it's really hard when all the things I was paranoid about in the past and having to spend time in the hospital bc I believe in conspiracy theories and now this stuff is coming true.  Anyway, I really need to be active and want to get a job so bad.  I have been waiting for this all to be over and now they are talking about vaccine requirements.  I had trouble dealing with the cognitive dissidents of wearing a mask, health questions everyday, and temperature checks.  I feel bad that I'm on unemployment, but I can't relate to people and I don't want to get pushed into doing things I don't believe in.  Now there is talk of vaccinated people causing health issues for nonvaccers.  My parents are vaccinated and I've been getting really bad headaches when I visit them on weekends.  I'm bitching because I'm so bored and I really want to be productive, but I don't want to be shamed and blamed.</p>

        <p>Does anyone else find it astounding the amount of terrible side effects people have with this? <br>
I've had all the standard vaccines as a kid, plus some that you have to get when you travel to tropical regions. But I NEVER in my LIFE experienced fever, convulsions, vertigo, foggy brain, double vision, vomiting, GB syndrome......<br>

        <p>No way, no this is super weird. In the past it was widely agreed within the medical community that vaccines did NOT cause side effects. You'd get a sore arm, maybe some irritation at the site of the injection and that's it. The people who said they got flu symptoms after having a flu shot were regarded as "crazy conspiracy theorists" by doctors. Now doctors say that the side effects are a sign of a good immune system, people seem to be happy to get side effects because it means the shot is "working"...I dunno man, it's crazy. Where did this all come from? I bet if you asked this time last year even, people would say vaccines don't have side effects. How did everyone get brainwashed so fast?!</p>

<p>None of them came with side effects.  In fact there is one, I can't recall what it is for, but it has something like 9 needles, where if you have side effects it means something bad.</p>

        <p>my family is getting increasingly frustrated with me refusing to get the vaccine. the way i see it, i either risk getting negative side effects from the vaccine, or i risk getting covid, then having negative side effects from it. there’s the possibility i might not even get covid at all and that’s the gamble i’m taking right now. but they’ve taken to saying that i’m not thinking right and that i’m being illogical. i try not to get mad but it’s like they don’t even hear me. after my dad said i could die from covid, i asked him “what if i die from the vaccine?” he said “well that would be shitty.” lol!?!?! they just don’t get it. i feel like with my age bracket i’m just as likely to get serious complications from the vaccine as i am from the virus and that’s keeping me from getting the shot.</p>

        <p>My brother just told me this weekend that I'll never see him again if I don't get myself and my kids jabbed. WTF. I tried to have a logical conversation with him telling him that I have worked hard to get my immune system top notch - and I NEVER get colds - and my inflammation down, so I'm really low risk of getting a bad case of Covid. Then he goes to tell me it has nothing to do with my immune system! WHAT?! I stopped listening at that point. Buh bye bro, been fun. Don't worry, I'll still send money to your kids, but make sure they sanitize it first. *eyeroll*</p>

        <p>Yikes, your comment appears to have attracted the trolls. I am not getting the vaccine either and my family is also giving me shit about it. It is really none of their business what you do with your own body. I'm not ready to get the vaccine yet. I'm not rushing out to get it. Eventually, I may get it when it has been out a while and I see more information on it. Right now, it is only approved for emergency use. If and when I get it, I will not be telling anyone in my family. It is none of their business either way.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is not going to kill you. All the VAERS stuff is being horrifically misrepresented and blown out of proportion by exceptionally paranoid people. There is a nonzero amount of people who will have fatal reactions to the vaccine -- this number is eclipsed a thousand fold by COVID-19 fatalities. Get vaccinated and help us get society back to normal.</p>

        <p>The way I see it, I either let this fucking virus to multiply in my cells, which has killed millions of humans, and is ruining our lives one way or another, or I take the cure that humanity made against it, which is made possible only because of all the scientific advancements humanity has made over the centuries, and is the culmination of humanity's knowledge.
Obviously it's not perfect, and I really wish this virus never existed, so I didn't even need to make a choice, but I'm definitely choosing science over this fucking virus.</p>

        <p>The sad fact is that most people get their news from television news sources and these news sources are always only left or right leaning. Up to now not one televised news source has questioned the narrative so people watching are only getting one side. Now that Tucker has spoken out against Fauci it might wake more people up.</p>

        <p>Well guys, its been a good run but I am out of options it seems and will have to get the J&amp;J shot (only one I remotely trust). My college, Oregon State University is requiring vaccines to return in the fall and I am one term from graduating. I was just going to take my 3 classes online but 2 of them will not be offered in an online format forcing me to take them in person. No big deal right? There are exemptions for that, well no. My request for a personal exemption (religious, philosophical) was denied due to the safety of the students. I also re-signed my lease the day before this rule was announced. It is too late to transfer, I cant afford to get a based lawyer and dont know what else to do. I will not however get the shot until september to hopefully ride this out as long as I can. For those of you lucky enough to be in free states, I am proud of you for sticking this out.</p>

        <p>Why are you doomers preaching we will all die if we don’t get the vaccine? How do you know saying yes to the vaccine isn’t gambling your future health? This bullshit has been around over a fucking year. It hasn’t done shit where I live. 1 very old overweight man died in our county of 25,000 ppl and I live in a very very busy tourist town (record high tourism last summer around 4 million visitors) i swear I’d have no idea this thing even existed if it wasn’t for the media or the masks.</p>

        <p>Are any of them FDA approved (for all it means anyway)? Exactly, of course not. Legally speaking, I'm reasonably sure they can't force you to get a treatment that's not FDA approved.</p>
<p>I call the experimental mRNA gene therapy shots such for a reason. It's because that's what they are.</p>

<p>And every damn time, the media suddenly stops talking about it and everyone forgets.</p>
<p>I guess now they've finally figured out if they just keep talking about it.. even without any death and destruction, the majority will keep falling for the bullshit.</p>

        <p>No dude wars are scams they literally don’t exist. I mean barely anyone dies. Do you know anyone who’s died in a war. Its just a way to feed the military industrial complex and all these big weapons manufacturers. You wouldn’t even know they “existed” if it wasn’t for the media talking about them. Al Quida! Nazis! ISIS! I’ve heard it all before. Don’t be a sheep.</p>

        <p>Don't let these doomers get to you. If you took the number of people who died and listed other health issues they had, people would know that they did not die from covid so the 582k number dafuckhead through out would be drastically reduced to a number that no one would even notice.</p>

        <p>582k people dead and a total of 328 million cases in the US. So with friends, family, and survivors I’d say, yeah people would know there’s a pandemic going on. Just because a bunch of hicksville towns that literally no one would ever choose to travel to aren’t seeing massive outbreaks doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. There aren’t any KKK rallies where I live. That doesn’t mean the KKK and racism doesn’t exist</p>

        <p>I just wanted to express how happy I am with the state of this subreddit. Over the last year, despite relentless social opposition, this community has been able to have open discussions about reality that would be censored anywhere else. People here are very positive and kind, and funny too. And the place is growing like crazy. Seems like everything is going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Also, shout out to the moderators for keeping things in pretty good order. I imagine the brigading and spam is absolutely bonkers for a subreddit like this. So thank you for volunteering for that job.</p>

        <p>Yep, and we are being forced to take it. Stores now require proof of vaccine to enter without a mask and my college is doing mandatory vaccine passports, same as my employer. I cant transfer because no free state that has a college with my program has the balls to ban passports and besides its too late to transfer as well since I have less than a year left. My college (oregon state) is also not allowing my professors to offer an online remote option in the fall either. I also just was told that my religious exemption was denied.</p>

        <p>Not sure how to feel about the CDC changing its guidelines. On the one hand, it's great to see the constant reminders about the "pandemic" coming down as (some) places stop requiring masks. It's also hilarious to watch doomers having a meltdown over not requiring vaccinated people to wear masks being sO eXtReMe.</p>
<p>But on the other, we've had our lives disrupted for over a year by a manufactured mass hysteria event that only ended when it became clear that paying people not to work was wrecking the economy. There was no new information guiding this decision, it was all politics and it's blindingly obvious that it was political all along. But the <em>only</em> thing that will have changed people's minds is a government organization saying something new with absolutely no justification. We're still surrounded by brainwashed doomers who would shave themselves bald within the hour if the CDC said hair could carry the virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah, as "happy" as I should be about it, it just doesn't sit right. On the one hand, while I personally expected much worse, this was certainly one of the plausible outcomes - that it would all be hand-waved away for very superficial, equally-illogical reasons (as the declaration of the "pandemic" in the first place).</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's like being kidnapped and held hostage for a year, and then one day, out of nowhere, the kidnapper lets you go and makes pretty much zero effort to restrain you any further. "Oh no, please don't go!" as he opens all the doors and unties you. Fucking wut??</p>
<p>Obviously you're going to run, but the whole time you're wondering ... is this a trap? A joke? Is something much worse going to happen as you try to escape?</p>
<p>I just did a quick check of the headlines, because I hadn't seen any mention of Fauci since this happened. Oh, look: "The underlying reason for the CDC doing this was just based on the evolution of the science." There the SCIENCE goes again, ~~doing a 180~~ <em>evolving</em> precisely when convenient.</p>
<p>Fucking hell. I really have no idea what to make of what's happening right now. We went from a very high probability of eventually requiring a vaccination to go into a supermarket, to ... "actually, we'll just do things on the honor system from now on &lt;wink&rt;". Again: WUT.</p>
<p>Highly unsettling.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid of the future. I've always had horrible anxiety, and worry about all kinds of things, but now I'm genuinely just scared.</p>
<p>We might get back to a relatively normal state, but we might also have a new global government type thing put in place, and we're all forced to become basically communist. Both of these outcomes, life goes on, though the happiness of the majority might change.</p>
<p>But, what if this virus was a test run, or a warning shot? We know the virus was likely manufactured, and that it likely originated from the lab in Wuhan from a gain of function research program. What if the next one actually gains function, and is actually deadly? If the new world order isn't enacted, what if they release an actually deadly virus to scare people even more? </p>
<p>People behind the virus and the vaccines already talk about population control and the need to depopulate the planet immediately -- a lot of them are getting old too and may want to see their work come to fruition before they clock out. There are articles floating around of extreme measures to use if things don't work, and how the vaccine spreads negative effects to people around them, how it causes infertility and is hereditary...</p>
<p>I'm actually scared of what happens next. The world is run by these awful people who would gleefully wipe out a significant portion of the population for whatever reason, and I am entirely powerless against it. I can say no all I want, but one day that might just be the word that puts a target on my head.</p>

        <p>I’m scared too. I feel like we’ll all eventually have to get the shot but I hate how things are going right now. It’s slowly getting to the point where vaccinated people can do whatever tf they want and for those of us that both refuse or don’t want it altogether are basically coerced into getting it and that’s what I don’t like. A part of me feels like everything will be ok because I like to be hopeful but of course it will include getting vaccinated. Like at first they say that they need enough people to get vaccinated and now they’re changing it to EVERYBODY should get vaccinated. <em>shocker.</em> We shouldn’t have to be forced/bribed to do something that’s apparently “safe.”</p>

<p>Can't happen. And if that does two things happen: All travel as in fucking all travel is banned, borders closed. Then everybody remains at home and the supply chains falter within a week. Then the whole system disintegrates and Billions of Humans die out. So no worries, if that happens the disease itself is you last threat to worry about.<br>
BUT: 99% of the elites and 100% all functional elites vanish too. That would be a real great reset. Nobody of this social strata would wish its own extinction, so they grind us down with fake invented crisis after crisis.</p>

        <p>I'm so stressed about everything going on and it's starting to wreck havoc on my body. My skin is breaking out like crazy, I'm developing stomach issues (when I stress a lot it's basically like IBS/hardly being able to eat cause my stomach hurts), horrible nightmares etc. I've always been skeptical about everything and I research everything to make an informed decision. I always try to see both sides of the equation before making up my mind. At the moment, I really do not want the covid vaccine. The fact that there are no long term studies and the fact that so many people who experience bad side affects are being gaslit by doctors who brush it off as anxiety terrifies me. But the idea of vaccine passports and being barred from services is also scary. I'm just turning 30 this year. I spent most of my 20s working a lot, and I could never travel because I didn't have the funds or someone I wanted to travel with, but now I do, and it seems like soon I'll be barred from that unless I get the shot?  But then travel aside, I'm worried they'll start making it mandatory for access to services (I think someone posted a video of Trudeau talking about how being vaccinated will give you access to services, implying unvaccinated won't have them). What if I won't be able to get a driver's license without being vaccinated? What if I can't rent an apartment without being vaccinated? What if I won't be able to go into a store or see a move or attend an event without the jab? I know some people on here are all about giving that stuff up, but I'm only 29 still. I want to be able to experience life and do all these things. But I do not want to be coerced into injecting something unknown and brand new into my body. </p>
<p>Does anyone else feel like this? I've always seen myself as moderate about most issues. I can argue for both sides of a situation, but I also have a strong gut response to things and so far it hasn't let me down. I just feel so trapped lately.</p>

        <p>Yes, I feel a similar way. I have the same worries about future restrictions especially with regard to being able to travel. I found that this constant obsessive worry of the future wasn't doing me any favors mentally. It's easier to take all this shit one day at a time. Stay updated on the news, but make the majority of your focus be on making each individual day a good one.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same. I’m different than some ppl on here bc I do worry about possible outcomes of my loved ones catching Covid but I also have a very strong feeling in my gut that the vaccines aren’t safe. I feel like I’m the odd ball out because most people either get their loved ones vaccinated and then the pandemic is “over” for them, or they are like many people on this sub who just aren’t worried about Covid at all. I feel like I’m alone in the middle.</p>

        <p>I can sympathize with you on not wanting to ingest or be injected by foreign compounds. I rarely take medicine unless it’s necessary. However vaccines rarely have long term effects, most of the side effects are uncovered within the first few months of testing. And so far an enormous amount of people of all ages and genetic diversity have gotten the shot with no life threatening or even severe side effects. So I wouldn’t worry too much that there are no long term studies. If you’re weary about the short length of time it took to develop the vaccine, be aware that most of these companies spread their resources among many different projects at a time. When the pandemic hit they knew they had to put all their eggs in the covid basket.  Hope this will change your mind, as the more unvaccinated people there are, the more virus circulating there is, and the more potential for mutations there is.</p>

Bu you are wrong in saying that "And so far an enormous amount of people of all ages and genetic diversity have gotten the shot with <strong>no life threatening or even severe side effects</strong>". People have literally died from the vaccines - have you not heard about the blood clots from AZ? Plus if you check r/CovidVaccinated, people have lots of severe side effects.</p>
<p>I think what people really miss is that you can't compare these vaccines to the traditional ones that have been around for decades. This is a totally new technology that has never been used on humans. Nobody knows how this actually works and what effects it may have. Everything right now is a hypothesis. "Trust the science" is the stupidest saying because science is about questioning things. You question, you study, you learn.</p>

        <p>You’re right, I should edit to say that these side effects are extremely rare. In the case of J&amp;J, there were only 6 documented cases out of millions. Not even covid long term effects are of that low probability. 
Re mRNA technology, sure it’s not the traditional medicine, but it has been in development for some time. It hasn’t just popped up as a result of the pandemic. 
Unrelated to this, the way the current research is going there will be a lot more changes in traditional medicine to this kind of modern technology.</p>

<p>This is anecdotal at best and I think the previous commenter meant there is more data showing no death or side effects than there is showing death and side effects. People literally die from things everyday. Things like water, air, the sun, various types of produce, cars, etc... this level of fear can lead to very unhealthy anxiety which is incredibly difficult to live with. It may be worth while to check out some cognitive behavioural therapy to help with you anxiety. As for the vaccine it's certainly your choice, I think the pro vaxxers just hope the choice is properly and accurately informed.</p>

        <p>You could and people have, it certainly goes both ways. I think its important to remain stoic and see things from both sides. I'm not scared of covid but understand the benefits to those around me of mask wearing, distancing, etc... I see the benefits of getting vaccinated but understand the hesitancy. What I don't see is the stance of the hard anti vax based on anecdotal evidence while disregarding empirical data. Furthermore extending that stance to say pro vaxxers are "stupid" or "sheep" simply because they chose to get vaccinated is just as ignorant as shaming anti vaxxers.</p>

        <p>Here’s the truth, The Great Reset was planned decades ago because the NWO knew there’d be economic collapse in the near future (i.e. the Fiat “debt” system would implode), so they needed a way to reset the clock &amp; start all over again. The whole pandemic was just the medium to carry out their nefarious diabolical plans to fruition.</p>

        <p>You could just say you can't elaborate or not respond. There's not need to get sensitive and worked up... sorry for challenging your line of reasoning. I guess it's only good to ask questions when they support the overarching narrative. So instead: omg what can we do to stop these nefarious and diabolical plans? How does the NWO get away with such atrocities while the rest of suffer? How do we get the truth about these monsters to the masses?</p>

<p>I feel like all this shedding stuff is being promoted in order to scare people into taking the vax, because they might reason that the vax itself is better than the shedding.</p>
<p>Any opinions on the danger of this shedding? Something to worry about if you aren't at risk of the virus in the first place? Or just some more hysteria?</p>

        <p>There was a case in chickens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease where a disease with medium symptoms became deadly to unvaccinated chickens, because vaccinated chickens stopped dying to the deadly mutations and they kept spreading the virus.</p>
<p>But the whole shedding feels like bollocks designed to make fun posters as "this is what antimaskers actually believe" category. It's basically on the same level as "5g mind control chips in vaccines".</p>

        <p>It annoys me that the goal posts are moving again - while I'm happy that mask mandates are going away; I am unhappy that masks are still required for schools and childcare. Now people are screeching about how kids still can't get vaccinated so kids must still wear masks until they can. I hate that my 12 year old still has to wear a mask at school.</p>

        <p>How is relaxing restrictions because COVID cases going down “moving goal posts”?</p>
<p>That’s like saying that allowing people to return home after a hurricane is moving the goal posts because the just told people to evacuate last week.</p>

        <p>If the mask mandate is gone, masks should be removed everywhere. But instead, masks are still being required at schools and childcare facilities, where young kids spend most of their time. In addition, a lot of places in my state that cater to kids (kids museum for example) are not dropping the mask requirement because "kids can't get vaccinated." In my opinion that is moving the goalposts. When I question why masks are still being required for kids, it is "well, kids can't get vaccinated and until they are able to, they have to wear masks." When everywhere else, the masks have been dropped, even for adults who are unvaccinated. Also, many parents are now saying that they still won't stop wearing masks until their kids get vaccinated. In my experience, I never heard this being a thing until now that we are at the point to remove the masks. We've known all along that kids are the least likely to have serious issues from COVID. It seems like this whole "but what about the children??" charade is specifically to make the masks last longer, when they should be going away. </p>
<p>Do you understand now?</p>

<p>Maybe because until now kids couldn't get vaccinated?  And it's still 12+ only?  Not sure how you'd have heard this complaint before.</p>
<p>You're in a subreddit where everyone was screaming that it was going to be masks and social distancing forever. Now the CDC is dropping masking rules.  NYC is removing restrictions.  It's going back to normal.</p>
<p>Why is this subreddit so mad that Normal is coming back?</p>

        <p>That's not normal though, and it's more of the objectively byzantine 'restrictions' that so are have produced ambiguous results, and that's being incredibly generous. IMO if it weren't for Desantis they'd still have people locked in their houses. People have to stand up to this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Had to go get a few groceries this morning and saw more people without masks. I know it's probably b/c they're vaccinated (which is totally fine if that's what you want for yourself), but damn... it was nice to see people being normal again!</p>
<p>All the while me and my kids are in masks though bc we're actually sick (with colds, nothing serious).</p>

<p>Sad thing is, many kids are being subjected to the hysteria, masks, mass testing, and vaccination. In theory I guess it's the parents' decision. It's too bad though-- I'm inclined to say it's child abuse, but I'm too busy fighting even just for my own basic rights, and am barely feeling like I will be able to prevent the state and state organs (schools) from forcing the mask and the vaccine on future children, should I have kids. I know parents in my area who don't want their kid to wear the mask but the schools are forcing it and they are unable to fight it properly. The news media here is 100% behind the health authority here, who is saying that 10 year olds (10 year olds!) have the judgement ability to decide whether to get the vaccine, therefore parental consent is not required. Of course psycho school teachers, administrators, and an atmosphere of peer pressure will result in many 10-15 yr olds being psychologically manipulated into defying their parents, siding with the authority figures in the schools, and thus getting vaccinated. I really don't understand how people and parents are not already out in fhe streets with pitchforks. There are demonstrations here but I wish more would attend. I hope many parents are prepared to take a stand and it's just not visible yet. I don't know a ton of parents so it's hard to say.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Thankfully where I'm at, at least on Facebook, I've seen a lot of parents pushing back against this vaccine for kids.
I just really hope schools don't require it. If they do, guess I'll be homeschooling.
My cousin in Alabama just mentioned that they're going to allow 14yos to get the jab without parental consent. It's so messed up and it's incredibly disturbing that people don't see how messed up it is.</p>

        <p>Like the newest CDC "ruling" today that you can unmask IF you're jabbed. So when I go into Home Depot with out a mask, people will just assume I'm jabbed...but what about when you have to "prove" your jab with a "passport" or something. WHY DON'T PEOPLE SEE THE SLIPPERY SLOPE!?</p>

        <p>The last time I checked the official numbers, the number of people who have died specifically from taking the covid vaccine was zero. Six people developed a certain type of dangerous blood clot that could be lethal if left untreated, but they're getting treated for it and it doesn't seem like it's a big deal. That's about it.</p>

        <p>&rt; your likely not fine  </p>
<p>Source for this? This is an extraordinary claim that goes against everything known about the vaccines, so I'd love to see your source that people with vaccines are "likely not fine". </p>
<p>&rt; it’s disrespectful to those who have died or had side effects.  </p>
<p>It's . . . disrespectful to have reports BOTH ways--of adverse events and no adverse events? Can you explain how? To me, it just seems like the logical thing to do is to examine all data, not to exclude part of the data because it's "disrespectful". If ONLY adverse events were reported, wouldn't this be a pretty skewed data set that could give you the wrong idea?</p>

        <p>Anyone who doesn't want the jab yet/ever think about what happens if you need blood ? I'm a regular donor and last year once the jab started rolling out, the Red Cross said it wouldn't take anyone who'd been jabbed. But now they WILL accept it which means "contaminated" blood could be given to you after a bad car wreck, a surgery gone sideways, etc.  Does this stuff stay in our blood?  And don't tell me that v@x people give blood all the time. I am up to date on my <em>v@x</em>...this is not a v@x, though.</p>

        <p>It's an immune response.  So bone marrow I believe. </p>
<p>The vaccine and antibodies will fade away after a somewhat short amount of time.</p>

        <p>You're probably right, thanks for the insight. So then I wonder how that affects marrow donations.  The general marketing theme seems to be the more jabbed, the better, but I can't help feeling that is just part of the ploy to get as many jabbed as possible.  I'd love to be able to jump into the future 10 years and read the headlines.</p>

        <p>I got asked if I had covid when I donated but I don't remember them asking about the vaccine, maybe they did though. If you're getting a blood transfusion, are you really going to freak out if it's got a vaccine in it? Get over it. That's just about as bad as a dude I knew who wouldn't be a donor because he wanted to control who would get his blood.</p>

        <p>Disappointed. Dismayed. These are my two emotions after reading that the CDC is “letting” fully vaccinated people stop wearing masks indoors and out. Was it all a game?

        <p>Home Depot still requires mask despite the CDC  rules. They have an automated recording play in the store every few minutes. What a joke. What happened to “trust the science”? Now it’s “don’t trust the science, just wear a mask” Honestly they don’t really enforce the rule but it’s still a bullshit stance.</p>

        <p>Yes, if you get fired you'd have to move back because your employer sponsors your visa.</p>
<p>i think you have to work for 5-10 years before getting a green card. Most employer sponsored visas are just temporary.</p>

        <p>You know what, that's actually something I didn't think about. I've been too focused looking at which jobs qualify for visas that I never thought about what happens if you get one, but then are fired! </p>
<p>I'm not sure on the amount of time minimum for permanent residency, but like someone else says /r/IWantOut is a good sub for asking this kind of stuff. I've been meaning to make a post there myself.</p>
<p>As for me, my plan is to go to school here in Canada to become a med lab scientist. That line if work is very boomer dominated and will be VERY high in demand in Canada and the USA in the coming years. It's already very in demand. So i'm hinging my bets that i'd likely get a visa pretty quickly with that line of work. </p>
<p>Also try to look for jobs that get more than a TN visa. TN visa is only temporary and doesn't really lead to permanent residency options.</p>

        <p>I'd recommend an immigration lawyer. My husband and I are trying to emigrate, too. We almost did the investment visa in 2019 but since I'm involved in a family business here in Canada it would have caused tax issues. They've since raised the price for that visa to $900k so that's out of the question for us. </p>
<p>Anyway, there are a bunch of different visas you can get, from special skills to owning a business. There are websites dedicated to explaining the different visa types and how to find out if you qualify.</p>
<p>Having said that, I've also been told to just go to the US and start applying for jobs and that might work, too. My husband just updated his LinkedIn profile because his brother has a friend in NC with a business who might hire him, so hopefully that works out. It's very tough, though, we've been trying for about 3 years now.</p>

        <p>My girlfriend, who I love dearly, has become quite a doomer lately and I feel blindside by it. </p>
<p>I've always respected her high intelligence (Master's degree in a STEM field), but she said one of the dumbest things I've ever heard last night when I told her that I wasn't interested in getting the vaccine right away (if it all) because of the numerous reasons you'd see on this board to not rush to get it when it's not even FDA approved.</p>
<p>In tears, she responded that I needed to get it sooner rather because she's afraid that we'll run out of the vaccines here in the USA and that I won't be able to get a shot because they'll all be sent to places like India.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to respond to that. I just looked at her baffled because I don't know on what planet she's on where the idea that we'll "run out" of a thing that's fully stocked in basically every CVS and Walgreen's within this country. I refuse to believe that she's that stupid so I'm just left with the notion that rampant, unthinking fear for fear's sake has taken hold of her. Very depressing to me.</p>
<p>Anyone else experience this?</p>

        <p>My boyfriend isn't what I would call a doomer but he does say things like "when everyone is vaccinated we can go back to normal." He hasn't gotten it yet but his whole family is or has already. It's definitely concerning. Unfortunately there is no point in arguing with people who believe in the narrative. All I can do is hope I rub off on him.</p>

        <p>New pet peeve: the phrase "life-threatening diseases"</p>
<p>If we take the most literal definition: every disease is life-threatening because it is possible to die from it, no matter how small that probability may be. A stubbed toe is now "life-threatening" because there's a small chance it'll get infected, you'll get gangrene or whatever, and things will just get worse and worse until you die. But more than 99.9% of the time, your foot will hurt for a bit and you'll live another few decades. </p>
<p>If we take the intended meaning: a life-threatening disease is one which kills some very large proportion of the people who catch it. Something like cancer, or ebola. You feel extremely sick and you need medical attention like yesterday. If you aren't treated, you have a very high probability of death. </p>
<p>If we use the first definition, the virus is absolutely life-threatening, same as every other ailment that exists. If we use the second definition on the other hand...well, you tell me. Would you rather have cancer or "covid"? One of these things is clearly a lot more dangerous than the other. You tell me which.</p>

        <p>Saw a news article saying New Mexico was going to start following the CDC guidelines. "No way!" I thought - they are all about perpetual lockdowns.</p>
<p>Sure enough, check out the fine print:</p>
<p>&rt;Masks are still required to be worn by all individuals in the following settings:
&rt;
&rt;<em> Health care settings, including but not limited to hospitals, long-term care facilities, and doctors’ offices </em><em>[probably safe to assume you STILL won't be allowed in the buildings with your loved ones?]</em><em>
&rt;</em> Correctional facilities
&rt;<em> Homeless shelters
&rt;</em> Public transportation, including but not limited to buses, trains, and planes and in transportation hubs such as airports and stations
&rt;
&rt;Also, pending additional guidance from the CDC, masks continue to be required in schools for all students and school staff regardless of vaccination status. “Unvaccinated individuals remain at risk of contracting and spreading the virus; over 99% percent of new COVID-19 cases nationwide are among the unvaccinated,” said Tracie Collins in a news release. “Please schedule your shot today at vaccineNM.org and protect yourself and your loved ones.”</p>
<p>Shit like this is why I'm not unconditionally optimistic about the latest news. Sure, you can go into Walmart ... for now. But the people pushing for mandatory vaccines and passports didn't just give up and go home. And now that all this insanity has been normalized, we have every reason to suspect that, come flu season, things will get ridiculous again.</p>
<p>I will be VERY HAPPY to be proven wrong. But I'm not getting my hopes up for a long time - not until winter passes without incident.</p>

        <p>I know where you are coming from, I think that for the sake of sanity we have to be optimistic and really celebrate even the small victories.</p>
<p>Look, I got vaccinated and I’m sure that makes me an idiot in your eyes, but don’t forget that even vaccinated people are ready to return to old normal, and many do not care if others choose not to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>I just think division and this thought that others have to believe EXACTLY what I believe or you believe is not helpful and is a massive waste of energy. We are United on the idea that it’s time to get back to normal and put this bullshit behind us.</p>

        <p>Oh don't worry, it's no trouble at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/feb/21/who-are-the-people-behind-the-top-covid-19/">Exhibit A</a>: the Author, Larry Romanoff. I literally cannot find any information on him on the internet other than Information about and article he published saying Covid originated in the US instead of China. (Well, there's also stuff saying that he's a coach at Ohio University, but I assume that's not the same guy).</p>
<p>Exhibit B: The website. Basically, my argument boils down to, what's the difference between you citing something from Lew Rockwell's blog and a site ran by, say, AOC or Bernie Sanders? Granted, politicians are a better source to cite then a random article someone could just make up on squarespace right now, but one would think a blog ran by a politician would have a bit of an agenda would it not?</p>
<p>Exhibit C: The citations. Some are from equally dubious sources, some are from the same source, others are actually reasonable, but taken wildly out of context. As you pointed out though, anyone with the minimum amount of braincells can look into it themselves. </p>
<p>I will grant you that the 1918 pandemic may have had US origins. However, I do not believe a sufficient amount of reliable evidence has been provided to prove that the virus was man-made, or that bacteria did most of the killing in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, it goes on a bizarre (non-cited) tangent saying that the Jews enslaved the Chinese and that the Jewish historians are hiding the truth from us. Honestly, the only things I could find doing my own research was that the Chinese immigrated. (Not that the fact that they immigrated minimizes their struggles. Have you seen what they had to go through on the Transcontinental Railroad? <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.history.com/.amp/news/transcontinental-railroad-chinese-immigrants">Here's an article</a>, although it's a very very VERY broad overview and only covers a fraction of what they endured. It's worth looking into yourself honestly.</p>

        <p>I’m a pro-vaccine but I’ve gotta say, I don’t understand why people are so adamant about forcing the vaccine on others. Like, if we are protected by it that’s great, we don’t have to worry, but it should be your own personal decision as to whether or not you want it. It’s not like a vaccinated person is going to be affected by a non-vaccinated person, so I personally don’t see why governments and people want to force it so badly.</p>

        <p>Not to get political but my doomer father is already writing off the new guidance released today as the health experts trying to pander to “those horrible Republicans Rand Paul and Ron Johnson”. </p>
<p>He thinks the CDC cares about what they think for some reason, or that those two would be able to stop them somehow if they wanted to suggest tightening measures.</p>
<p>Any guidance that isn’t “stay home as much as possible” is pandering to the far right to him.</p>

        <p>I mean, if your parents are elderly and they don't get vaccinated- that's honestly a possibility.</p>
<p>If you don't get vaccinated and they are indeed elderly, spending time with them unmasked is risky. You are possibly putting your parents at risk. </p>

        <p>Thank you Arizona! I went on a little getaway from San Diego to Lake Havasu this past week, and I just wanted to say how amazing it was to be somewhere normal again! It was my first time there, and wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was not disappointed. I’m pretty lucky in that my workplace doesn’t enforce mask-wearing but I didn’t realize how much I missed going to other places and seeing other people’s faces. Just going to stores and restaurants, and only seeing a couple of masks here and there, and not one person asking me to wear one was so nice. It was one of the most relaxing and fun trips ever. So thank you Arizona, and for anyone else looking to escape the dystopia that is socal, I highly recommend taking a little road trip to this little desert oasis!!! I will be back!</p>

        <p>One thing that I wish from the beginning would be that the media would concentrate on helping people who contracted COVID-19 to better cope. Instead of all the fear mongering. Now if someone gets an infection or any other malady they are afraid to seek medical attention. Doctors are our friends. (Maybe not all doctors, but the great majority.) Also, it is important to exercise while getting over COVID-19, because the body has to learn to breathe normally. Most people will contract COVID-19 even with this vaccine and it is important to know how to react.</p>

<p>Really? The majority that I have seen are too busy to worry about patients. They come in, listen to two sentences, say something probably unrelated, and get out the door. That's if you're lucky and they don't try to put you on a never-ending chain of drugs. I've never had a doctor even attempt to find the cause of a disease, they just want to give you a drug for symptom management.</p>
<p>God forbid iyou get admitted to a hospital - you're lucky if you come out without having a functional organ removed or some other life-changing iatrogenic disaster. My father once had a dude try to remove his pancreas with a Whipple for literally no reason. His pancreas is fine to this day. Dude came in, said "your pancreas is bad, I'l scheduled you for surgery in 6 hours". We call up the team, team has no idea, never saw the pancreas dude again.</p>
<p>Doctors are just body technicians. They left healing behind when they adopted computers.</p>

        <p>Im in NY and it seems my empmoyer is going to require us to get vaccinated (im an accountant) - has anyone successfully gotten a doctors note to get out of it? Thinking of going to my doctor and claiming anxiety. Im also suspceptible to blood clots and cant be on birth control because of it - so is anxiety or blood clots the better route to go if i actually attempt this?</p>

        <p>Someone already posted a link for an article talking about OSHA. Here's a link to another article that appeared about a week ago. The author, Pam Popper, is president of Wellness Forum Health (wellnessforumhealth.com) AND she's very critical of the way COVID has been handled. As she points out, by the time one points out the OSHA guidelines, and starts asking questions, the employer will probably back down.</p>

        <p>The library i work at is planning on posting pictures of kids book covers with well recognized characters masked up on the bulletin board as a way to make it feel normal for the kids. Every staff seems to be on board with it which is weird cus i dont like this idea of accepting this "new normal" but of course i keep this opinion to myself. I honestly dont think this would be well received by the public based on a youtube video lullaby song for kids normalizing masks with how many dislikes to likes it got. I wish there was a "No New Normal!"  kids book i could copy a picture of and sneak it on the bulletin.</p>

        <p>I'm terrified of returning to school in the fall where my public school system is mandating vaccinations "upon FDA approval." They're vehemently pushing for vaccination regardless of EUA or FDA approval and have even teamed up with a local medical group to run vaccination clinics. I'm so, so scared.</p>

        <p>Sorry you are scared. I'm guessing there will almost surely be an online option because so many people are not letting their kids get vaxxed with this untested, untried, probably unsafe garbage.</p>
<p>You can also start looking into homeschooling options on the off chance there's no online option in the fall. Most homeschoolers have local associations and you could reach out to them to see if they have any ideas for you about other options, such as maybe a homeschooling parent who would be willing to add you into their lessons online. Not sure if that's a possibility but it's worth looking into! Where there's a will there's a way.</p>

        <p>Tf are you guys going to do when the studies are finalized that prove the shot prevents transmission? It’s in research because of how long it’s been since development, science is a process. It hasn’t been proven to NOT promote effectiveness, and every vaccine on planet earth ever created has decreased levels of spread due to the body not producing more of the virus....</p>

        <p>Can anyone provide an official source on the laws/regulations in Florida regarding the vaccine? I've seen a lot of meme-type pictures and headlines that say the governor is making it illegal for businesses/employers to require the vaccine but I'd like to see the laws from an official place??? can anyone help?</p>

        <p>Pam Popper (Wellness Forum Health president, and someone critical of COVID policy) discussed one approach in this week's newsletter. This approach hinges on an OSHA position that injuries from mandated vaccines would be considered workplace injuries. Link should get you the PDF of the article--the 2nd page is where the OSHA details start. As she points out, she doesn't think employers will require vaccination once they consider what might happen in the event of vaccine problems.</p>

        <p>Explain your rationale for vaccine hesitancy, ask them for their rationale, see if you can come to an agreement. If not, take the matter to court. I'm pro-vax but not pro-mandatory vax. If they terminate you based on a medical decision it is 100% discrimination. They could however lay you off without cause and pay you severance at which point you may have a hard time proving the reason why they let you go. Best of luck!</p>

        <p>Or they might say that because these vaccines aren't fully approved by most regulatory bodies that they are not comfortable. Or they would like more long term empirical data before deciding if its safe to put in their body. Or they disagree with vaccines in general and would prefer to take the risks inherent to not getting it rather than the possible risks associated with getting it. It's their right to make their own medical decisions as it is yours.</p>

        <p>Once again, I know more than half of this group will probably hate me because I got vaccinated, and generally speaking trust doctors and experts over my own YouTube/Wikipedia research if that makes sense.</p>
<p>But I gotta say, even the CDC is now saying if you got your vaccine (if you didn’t, pull a McLovin right?) it’s time to ease up on the masks and go back to normal. I did see that as a win for the overall cause even though people who aren’t vaccinated now believe they’re going to be criminalized or whatever.</p>
<p>What I can’t believe, is now the media is FREAKING OUT like “WhY dId tHeY sAy EaSe Up?!?!” claiming extremists are going to use relaxed mask mandates to.... do something bad.</p>
<p>Like seriously what the fuck are they even talking about?! I thought we were supposed to follow the advice of experts, who now say it’s time to ease up!! It pisses me off so much that the media just HAS to insist that everybody remain miserable and negative. </p>
<p>Even the CDC is suggesting that it’s time to start moving on. People are moving on with life. It’s time for the hypochondriacs to stop insisting that the rest of us remain in misery for their comfort.</p>
<p>I think it’s really good news that mask rules are becoming relaxed. For what it’s worth, I don’t think people are going to randomly “card” you for not wearing a mask. I believe you have the right to choose whether or not you want a vaccine. Like if you want to be extra protected, get one. If not, don’t. Simple as that. </p>
<p>Overall, I think we should all be excited that even the CDC is suggesting a return to an old normal.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is important more to protect others and the continually spread, rather than to protect yourself(or the individual receiving the vaccine) from the disease.</p>
<p>If everybody who is sick at this very moment preformed an effective quarantine without infecting anybody with covid, then the disease would be irradiated in just a week or so. </p>

        <p>You've never heard of irradiating an area or surface with electromagnetic radiation (usually ultraviolet or x-ray, if I remember correctly) for the purpose of decontamination? I haven't heard of it being used for COVID specifically, but it seems more plausible than expecting something like staying indoors to somehow irradiate a pathogen. Oh, or did you mean "eradicate"?</p>

        <p>Obese 60 year old mother-in-law with chronic bronchitis and heart disease was hospitalized for shortness of breath a few days ago. Needless to say, she supposedly tested positive for COVID, aaaand also needless to say, they're intubating her even though she's been steadily feeling better and cried for them not to. If anything happens to her, it's on the doctors, not the virus. And there is absolutely nothing my husband and I can do. On top of all that, my husband's uncle called us multiple times yesterday harassing us to get tested and quarantine ourselves for the next 2 weeks. My area has no such mandate, and even if it did, we still wouldn't. My mother-in-law doesn't want us to go through that. She herself regrets getting tested, saying "fuck 'im" about her brother-in-law. They can't stand each other and yet he's feigning concern that we might reinfect her when she comes home. Mind you, he's been caught looking at kiddie porn twice in the past 10 years. THAT'S the kind of people who think we lack so-called basic human decency: actual pedophiles. He threatened to come over yesterday if we ignored his calls and texts, so I'm seriously considering crying rape if he does. The authorities would probably believe me because he's a gross old man and I'm a cute little girl. Nah, that would be too low of a blow, wouldn't it? Really tempting though, just to get him out of the picture. And to think of all the times I defended him when my mother-in-law spoke ill of him behind his back....</p>

        <p>You are absolutely right.  Ultimately our governor announced this morning that he'd drop the masks on  May 29.  Some people in this state are unhappy, saying it's too soon and they will continue to walk around with masks anyway.</p>
<p>I don't believe this is the end of lockdowns and mask mandates.  I wouldn't be surprised to find blue states  on hard lockdown again this fall, when COVID inevitably spikes up again.  I definitely need to reevaluate things and get out of here asap.</p>

<p>New surges, new "variants", vaccine "breakthrough", and.... vaccinated rate is too low, surging in "pockets" who are "under-vaccinated", not enough people getting their vaccine boosters. "Delays" in the development and distribution of vaccine "refreshers" / boosters, allowing new outbreaks and new "temporary" lockdowns e.g. "two week lockdown and renewed mask mandate while we get everyone their booster shot". Behind schedule, measures extended. Growing "vaccine hesitancy", experts saying "herd immunity" to new variants in unachievable without higher vaccination rates. More mass testing, masks, lockdowns, intermittent and unpredictable. Vaccine passports to incentivize and reduce vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine passports to prevent super spreading events.</p>
<p>Pandora's box has been opened. They will keep pushing, I fear. Even the US states which are taking a stand... who knows how long before they start being put under international pressure to play along. This has already happened to eastern European countries and Russia. Although thankfully as far as I understand, most of the people do not follow the mandates or believe any of the BS.</p>
<p>I am not necessarily totally pessimistic but I feel like we lost serious ground philosophically and politically and we are going to be fighting this the rest of our lives. If not "pandemic" then some other bullshit that they invent.</p>

        <p>I agree with all of this.  The media seem to be dropping hints that "Green New Deal" lockdowns could be coming.  I also worry that Biden would be pressured to make lockdowns much stricter (think China or New Zealand). Hoping that I'm totally wrong.</p>

        <p>My dad got the first dose of pfizer today and I'm so upset and worried. He doesn't want it but had to for his work (even though 90% of people there willingly took the vaccine, so there shouldn't have been a need for him to), but he doesn't think it's dangerous. So far he's doing well, but I'm so worried, and a bit angry because the more people who just roll over and get it, the more it encourages higher ups to make it required for everyone. I wish he'd just fought it somehow, because personally I think this whole vaccine thing has to blow over eventually. There's never been a cure for viruses and plenty of people are skeptical of this vaccine regardless of whether they have always supported vaccines (myself included). Maybe I'm being niave. I'm just so worried about what the near future holds. I've actually felt so motivated recently but it's like I can't even plan for the future. I don't know if I'll be allowed to have one. I'm grateful I'm stubborn though so I know that there is nothing that will cause me to take this vaccine. I'll be able to live knowing I didn't cave for any reason.</p>

        <p>I do think there is very little chance since I know a few people from work who have had it and they've been doing just fine. I can be a bit worst-case scenario sometimes. But I definitely worry about the unknown, long-term effects the most.</p>

        <p>Has anyone heard about any lawsuits against universities forcing the vax onto students? My university is mandating it and I think I will take legal action if I'm ultimately forced to get the shot, I just don't know where to start on that front. </p>
<p>First I'll try a medical exemption: I have extreme allergies to Advil and Ibuprofen for crying out loud, I break out in hives if I take either of them, but I am not sure if a doctor will grant a medical exception since I don't know if I'm specifically allergic to any of the vax ingredients. So my best bet might be getting an exemption on the grounds of religious objection? I don't really know if the school just has to take my word for it or not though. During my undergrad I had to submit proof of my past immunizations so idk if they'd buy a sudden religious opposition to this vax.</p>

<p>How long ago were the other vaccines? You could possibly claim evolving religious views. Even cite the college experience pushing you in a new direction. If politicians can "evolve" in one election cycle to capture votes, well, someone's religious views can evolve in a couple of years!</p>

        <p>I, also, wanted to add that whereas you may have been unaffected by one type of vaccine...it could be said, if one believed, this type of vaccine interferes with the design of god. you could make the case that other vaccines present a challenge to your divinely created system but the new vaccine is a man made alteration to that design and therefore is a repudiation of god as your creator. Placing man, and specifically scientists, in the idolatrous position of rewriting the hand of god. remember it is not within the power of another to deem your religious beliefs as valid, they must simply be sincerely held.</p>

        <p>My argument has been that this is the kind of persecution which gives birth to new organized religions. We are already basically to that point, where we all are drawing this line based on something deeply seated which makes us reject the vaccine for ourselves and for children. If organizing to some degree and claiming religious exemption works in some countries, we will all start following that prototype and sharing strategies etc. The hope I guess is that the persecution doesn't ratchet up to the point where we have to end up martyrs, or flee to the corners of the earth, etc, just to maintain our integrity. So far I think we're holding on alright but I'm not confident that we will fare the next decades very well. Who knows what bullshit could be next. It's unbelievable, looking back, how far we've slid already and how much horrible precedent has been set. I know things are going well in parts of the US but we lost a ton of ground and will be vulnerable to another round of similar tactics being deployed, whether it be "pandemic" related or some other dumb shit.</p>

        <p>all of your points are well stated. i cannot understand fully what i have seen from people i considered rational.....i'm concerned the next bull is now. although i considered the behavioral conditioning technique of intermittent reinforce leading to trauma bonding and learned helplessness as a reason for the recent changes, I am now much more strongly feeling that it is a move to exacerbate shedding and spreading in time for summer travel.... it worked so well in wuhan for the chinese new year in 2019.</p>

        <p>So the newest rebuttal i'm hearing when I mention people should get the vaccine to protect themselves rather than force everyone else to is "we need to get it for people who can't get the vaccine for health reasons."</p>
<p>What people are those, exactly? Seriously asking... None of the current vaccines have egg products in them. So that removes anyone who could be allergic to compounds in the vaccine like with traditional inactivated viral vaccines (like the flu shot). I can't really imagine there's a large sect of the population that legitimately can't get the COVID vaccine for health reasons. But if there are some then please do enlighten me.</p>

        <p>Do you know what it was you were allergic to specifically? Was it with all vaccines? I know many people with egg allergies couldn't get typical vaccines due to viruses being incubated in eggs prior to sterilization. But the same can't be said for the COVID vaccines since there's no animal products used in making it.</p>

        <p>There is not a large population, but still a population nonetheless.</p>
<p>Since the vaccine doesn't 100% protect you from it, it just lowers your chance to get it, transmission rate, and seriousness of it, then immunocompromised persons are still at risk, even if they're vaccinated.<br>
There may also be restrictions based on their condition. For example, I think people with lupus are suggested to only get the mRNA (J&amp;J) vaccine because it's less taxing on their immune system. So they may not all be vaccinated especially if J&amp;J has to keep discontinuing it.</p>

<p>I cannot since the clinical trials are still ongoing, which is why i'm not getting the vaccine yet. But again, if you're 100% protected from serious illness, then contracting COVID would be mild to asymptomatic.</p>
<p>&rt; B. Immunocompromised persons are safe after being vaccinated</p>
<p>If they've received the vaccine, then they're 100% protected from developing a serious illness. And thus, they are safe from developing a serious COVID illness that could lead to death.</p>

If there's still no information on if vaccinated people can still contract and spread COVID, and supposedly no information on how protected immunocompromised people are after vaccination... Then maybe they shouldn't be going out since vax and unvaxxed people can't protect them.</p>

        <p>This is a genuine question not intended to provoke / hurt anyone, but I want to get another perspective (which is why I'm on this sub): can some explain vaccine hesitancy to me <em>specifically</em> around COVID vaccines?</p>
<p>In the past, "vaccine hesitancy" was considered an anti-science hippie extreme leftist view, which seems to now have become prevalent on the right but only specific to the COVID vaccine. </p>
<p>On a personal level, I'm a libertarian, so if a businesses decides that it won't admit anyone who isn't vaccinated, that's their prerogative from a <em>legal</em> perspective. </p>
<p>I am anti-lockdown and anti-covid-hysteria (ugh and I hate capacity limits and constant paranoid sanitization of shared resources), but I do believe that vaccines have demonstrably rooted out smallpox, polio, mumps, measles, etc. These vaccines weren't 100% affected but because enough people took them there was herd immunity.</p>
<p>I've heard the argument that "this vaccine was made quicker than usual", which is true, but I think that's because of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>State-level impetus pushed the funding and the trials quickly.</li>
<li>Previous research done at Oxford University to create a vaccine against other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS) laid the foundation for the COVID-19 vaccine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lack of transparency regarding trials (many people don't know that it isn't FDA approved for example)</p>

<p>Unwillingness to take on the risk of a rushed new product for a disease that is not dangerous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No data on vaccines for people with underlying conditions / interactions with other medication. Many people with health conditions are understandably reluctant to take a drug that may interfere with their usual treatment, especially seeing that a lot of people in nursing homes died after getting it. It is not known how the vaccine interacts (if at all) with other medications/underlying conditions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A show of non-compliance with the authorities to protest human rights infringements. If people pushed back hard against the masks, maybe we wouldn't be needing to debate the vax today. It's important not to comply with measures you don't believe in so that you send a message.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about the waivers people talk about. I'm against mandatory vaccines, against masks, against the new normal. But I did get a J&amp;J shot, figuring that <em>that</em> technology (used for the Ebola vaccine) has been around and vetted for a while, unlike the mRNA ones. </p>
<p>I didn't have to sign or agree to squat. Just come on in, get poked, chill out for 10 minutes and leave. Walk-in clinic at a pharmacy.  </p>
<p>Wonder if anything goes wrong 5 or 10 years from now, I'll have any standing, as there wasn't any disclosure/waiver.</p>

        <p>Well most medical treatments are like that, you don't have to sign a form for a flu shot. That's because the flu shot and (at this point in time) the vax are totally voluntary and your choice, so you don't really have grounds for complaint if something goes wrong. If I am <em>forced</em> into getting a vax which then has side effects, I would like compensation for it since the decision was not my choice.</p>

<p>Yes, they have put in place a ridiculous liability protection for the vax companies now. But one would think that would have to be disclosed at time of service to apply.</p>

        <p>Sure i'd be happy to! My personal skepticism is surrounding the mRNA vaccines and the Adenovirus vector vaccines... Which as i'm sure you know are the most popular vaccines, especially in the western world. </p>
<p>These vaccines are completely new. They use never before used technology and there's a total lack of any experimental and trial data to <em>fully</em> prove their safety and efficacy long term. Even though they may have been heavily researched even prior to COVID, there is a difference between theoretical research and actual proven results from lengthy scientific trials. And no matter which way you slice it, there is no skirting around the fact that these vaccines have not gone through their required lengthy scientific trials. That's what i'm uncomfortable with.</p>
<p>These vaccines are ALL still in their clinical trials and therefore, are still experimental. Hence why most countries have had to authorize these vaccines under emergency orders. They're fine taking the gamble that the short term good these vaccines provide will outweigh any potential long term harm. But that's just it - it is a gamble. One that I definitely hope works out! I'd be thrilled if all these vaccines turned out to provide maximal protection with extremely minimal harm. But until the clinical trials can fully prove that for certain, i'm not rolling up my sleeve. </p>
<p>I think the best and most relevant example I can give is the controversy with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The blood clot risk was initially found to be 1 in 100K, but new research seems to indicate it's closer to 1 in 25K. And they're still not fully certain since research is obviously still ongoing. Situations like that are exactly why i'd rather wait until the clinical trials are done. This is all one big research trial still playing out in real time. And considering the risk of death from VITT is 40%. I'd rather take my chances with COVID which I only have a .3% chance of dying of supposing I even get infected with it.</p>
<p>And i'm seeing some preliminary reports coming out about the mRNA vaccines causing damage to epithelial tissue and the linings of arteries... Again, not proven, just preliminary... But still concerning nonetheless. So i'd hate to get the mRNA vaccine and come to find a year from now there's a massive influx of people with some sort of health issue observed in the ongoing clinical trial and I could end up being affected too. </p>
<p>All this to say, in the future as these vaccines have gone through extensive research and there's data to support their efficacy and safety long term, i'll be happy to roll up my sleeve for them! But I need them to be fully done their clinical trials and get the full stamp of approval before then. Given they are using novel vaccine technology, i'm simply uncomfortable taking the risk while they're still in their experimental phase.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is i'd have no qualms taking an inactivated viral COVID vaccine (like Sinopharm or CoronaVac) since they're based on very traditional vaccine technology that's been around for years and is very much tried and tested. Those i'd be fine taking if they were available in Canada. But alas, they are not.</p>

        <p>The fact that its not approved by the fda and is being pushed on everyone by people who are not doctors or medical experts.  People have been screaming at me to get the vaccine when my doctor said i dont need it because i have the antibodies. It also makes everyone i know whos gotten it sick. One person(22m) i know passed out after his second shot.  I dont think the cure should give symptoms worse than the sickness.</p>

        <p>I personally, just hate shots in general and would never get one unnecessarily. This one is definitely unnecessary in my case, as I’m young and healthy. I would never get the flu shot, so why would I get this one? I also don’t like relying on medicine too much, and I think it’s the reason I have a strong immune system in the first place. I’ve hardly taken any strong drugs or antibiotics in my lifetime. Those are just my personal reasons.</p>

        <p>Me too, I ain't gonna take it, especially for something like a virus that doesn't effect younger people. I'll let my immune system naturally fight it off. And hey, if I die, I die.

        <p>My brother got covid and was totally asymptomatic. I'm in better shape and younger than him so it stands to reason that I'd be totally fine. But I'm still going to get it. Because there's a little old lady who lives near me, who is against it wholeheartedly. I don't want to catch covid and give it to her or anyone like her. Not to mention my parents who aren't vaccinated yet but likely will be when my turn comes around so that's less of an issue. </p>
<p>The fact that I'm healthy enough to be alright if I got covid is a reason to get the vaccine not to avoid it. I won't get bad side effects and even if there was a problem, I'm healthy enough that I could get through it. Vaccines aren't like antibiotics. The covid vaccine is completely unrelated to all other medicines except similar SARS vaccines.</p>

        <p>So you're going to get the vaccine yourself when you just said that you don't need it. Possibly putting yourself at risk. To protect an old woman who does not want this vaccine and would rather take her chances with covid than the possible side affects of the vaccine? </p>
<p>When you really sit back and think about it, does that honestly make sense to you?</p>

        <p>She's not getting it because she's worried the side effects will be too much for her. She's not strong enough I am. I know people her age that got it and were fine but nobody is going to force her. The next best thing is to make sure I'm not giving it to her. Also, she's taking her chances of not getting covid, she's well aware that it could easily kill her.</p>

        <p>I’m happy that you feel that way and I believe that you truly understand that this is a free country and different people can choose to get or not get the vaccine. But if you really look around at the mob mentality people are starting to have over this vaccine and outcasting people who do not want to get it. You would see that your opinion is not the opinion of the masses. At least the loudest voices that is</p>

        <p>I understand this but you are claiming that you know the full side affects of the covid vaccine when it is injuring young people as well as old people. It’s almost the same argument as the people who think you should get your children vaccinated to protect other people. For one, what world are we living in now where I’m going to put my child at risk for the sake of other people. Two, they’ve openly admitted that the vaccine is not affective and doesn’t work to stop the transmit of covid. Considering half of an entire baseball team got covid all fully vaccinated. That’s just one small example but what I’m saying is is that for the minimal pros there may or may not be for getting the vaccine. Seems to be more cons</p>

Do you think these four major vaccines (J&amp;J, AZ, Pfizer and Moderna) are safe or without risk? </p>
<p>Like, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-coronavirus-lottery-prize-7058159d2c71eabd19b541194a1e2d95"><strong>we've got a Governor letting us know about some million dollar prizes for those who take the shot</strong></a>, or when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ncdu8r/follow_the_science_no_wait_the_other_science/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>media outlets say one thing but then flip for another</strong></a>, or how certain subreddits like r/CovidVaccinated have removed a plethora of posts related to adverse vaccine reactions, and the only way to find those posts is on <a href="https://removeddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/mn0amu/body_wide_joint_and_surrounding_muscle_aches_pain/"><strong>removeddit</strong></a>, or how the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, said his <a href="https://thegoldwater.com/news/44099-Inventor-of-PCR-Test-Says-Fauci-Knows-Nothing-His-Test-Is-Not-Diagnostic-Tool-For-Viruses"><strong>test shouldn't be used for diagnosing if one has a virus or not, and how he despised Fauci</strong></a>, and so on and so on and so on... <strong><em>Do you think any of the above is building trust with the people??</em></strong> Definitely not with me. </p>
<p>Good to know you'll take it. All the best to you and your family. I wish you no ill-will, nor am I attacking your position. But you came here with a goal in mind, and that's fine.

        <p>Thank you for being so polite.</p>
<p>I have a slight problem with the giant .jpg that you sent. First of all, screenshots of social media posts is not a reliable source. Secondly, using anecdotal evidence such as this is a form of availability bias. The amount of posts regarding a positive or neutral reaction to the vaccine are not represented. There is way to compare the outcome frequencies. Furthermore, a post about a positive or neutral reaction would garner less attention. A negative reaction would also warrant a social media post more than otherwise, giving the illusion of fewer cases. </p>
<p>With regard to the next part I don't really have anything to say, Im not American and don't keep too up to date on your domestic policy. The removal of negative reaction posts is crazy I'll give you that. The incorrect use of censorship on social media has become  very worrying. Who would be responsible for that? The mods? Reddit? </p>
<p>Again thank you for being so polite and courteous, it's so nice to be able to have a rational and mature debate on Reddit.</p>

        <p>I don’t mind you making your own choice, but there is one big inconsistency in your logic. The vaccine doesn’t prevent you from spreading the virus, so you getting it literally doesn’t protect anyone else. The only logical reason TO get it is for yourself, so the symptoms aren’t as bad. It’s fine if that was your reason, but it’s the only reason that makes any sense.</p>

        <p>The answer to all those questions is yes from my <em>philosophical</em> perspective. I don't personally agree with refusing service to any of those groups, but I do believe it's the business owner's right to discriminate. </p>
<p>If you are asking me whether or not any of those are covered from a <em>legal</em> perspective today (not my personal opinion), then we both know that you can discriminate against whomever you want as long as it's not a protected group. I think gender, age, and disability fall into protected groups. People who have had abortions or people who refuse to take vaccines do not fall into a protected group.</p>

        <p>At least you're consistent, can't fault you for that! Next question, to what extent does the business have the right to your personal information? Age, gender, skin colour can all be determined on sight, so the business owner could turn them away at the door. Sexual orientation was freely offered by the customer in my example (requesting a specific cake be made), so I will agree with your logic that they don't have to bake the cake. But something like whether you've had an abortion or a vaccine is not obvious visually. If someone walks into your shop, meets your required conditions on physical appearance (correct gender etc), takes some items and pays for them, isn't that good enough? How does the owner check if you've had the abortion/vax, and to what degree are you allowed privacy?</p>

        <p>If the business wants to filter customers by a certain condition, they would probably have some test for entry. </p>
<p>I can't imagine what a test for abortion could be, maybe they would ask for access to medical records (which would be one of multiple reasons why the customer would be turned off and they would lose business).</p>
<p>For vaccination, they would probably ask for some "accepted" verification (maybe vaccination card, or some of those digital biowallets where you give your information to a trusted third party - basically your dreaded vaccine passport). I imagine this will also turn some customers away.</p>
<p>But in both cases, the customer has the choice whether or not to provide their information / verification, and the business has the right to refuse service or information isn't provided.</p>
<p>My basic point is that at the end of the day, the market forces will determine if any of these is a good idea for the business. If the vaccine proof requirements (or mask requirements), or request for access to medical records is unacceptable to enough customers, businesses will be forced to amend their policy. </p>
<p>We "give up" our freedoms / privacy / private information consensually to a lot of businesses (Google, social media, Apple, Amazon). </p>
<p>At the end of the day, there will be an equilibrium between customer comfort and business requirements.</p>

        <p>I personally don't agree with it. Also it's not practical, and anyone who chooses to run their business this way will lose money - but it is within a business owner's right to do that.</p>

        <p>Well, don't you find it odd in how sudden these vaccines were created? It usually takes about 10 years to create one (I don't have the link right now but I can find it if you want).</p>

        <p>They were developed in parallel as apposed to in series. The early stages of development began at the same time as some middle and late stage development. Also SARS vaccines have been in development since the early 90's. I agree that it was very fast and yes we should question it. But asking the right questions is hugely important. For instance instead of asking how fast was it developed compared to others, we should ask how was it developed compared to others. What was different this time around?</p>

        <p>Let me ask you something, Darkmalemind. Did you get the vaccine? Did you receive any side effects that may stem from the vaccine, being long lasting or temporary? Would you get a "vaccine booster" every year for COVID-19? Should people be able to drive safely after getting vaccines? Could the vaccine have been made better? Is this vaccine even effective?</p>

<p>Yes I did get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No I didn't have any side effects apart from a mild fever the day after the second shot. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would, but not sure at this point if it is even recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes they should and I did for both shots. That's why they ask you to wait 15 minutes to check for reactions. If there is no reaction then people are fine.</p>

<li>
<p>I don't know if it could have been made better, I'm not an immunologist / vaccinologist.</p>

<p>I am personally not capable of determining effectiveness (no way to know if I could have gotten it but didn't lol), but I trust the various studies and trials that have been done on it.</p>

        <p>Something that I have written my Senator and governor about is allowing people to drive after getting the vaccine. I feel strongly that people should not drive after getting it because of the effects it has had on my body while driving back home from getting the vaccine. Chances are that you will be safe to drive. But why take a chance?</p>

        <p>I got the second Moderna on Monday.  </p>
<p>I'm a little surprised by the lack of side effects. I was expecting to be out a couple days—I told work I might be out, my gf was prepared to be off work to take care of me, etc. Instead I just had a very mild headache (1/10 pain) for 36 hours.</p>
<p>Very fortunate.</p>

        <p>Oh? Howso?</p>
<p>If anything, wouldn't people <em>not</em> being vaccinated be at risk?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems if the government was really looking to cull the nation, then they would inject a marker (RFID or maybe even some sort of harmless bacteria?).<br>
Going forward they would know anyone <em>without</em> the marker is a "free thinker" (i.e. not willing to just trust the government and get the shot) and therefore a threat to their takeover.</p>

        <p>Maybe because you guys need to get off your high horse of thinking everything on this sub is correct. Some stuff I understand here (like the argument that vaccine hasn’t been proven to decrease spread yet [key word YET, and it hasn’t been proven to NOT stop spread]), but most things are utter blasphemy and crazy conspiracies. This is about saving lives, and not following everything random people say. In fact, I’m here to find arguments against the vaccine so I can get both sides and not just the biased government side... I just find that in this sub arguments are usually highly illogical.</p>

        <p>I've seen a few people on here comment saying that the flu doesn't actually exist. That it's just your body purging itself due to a lack of vitamin D or something similar. Ive also heard them say that there is no actual study showing that it spreads from person to person? Genuinely curious where the idea comes from and if there is any backing to it. Very open minded and with how things have been in the world makes me question literally everything I have been told. If anyone has this belief Im super interested to know more.</p>

        <p>I've read somewhere that fb has been banning videos on that topic. One heuristic of mine is that if something is actively suppressed by social media companies then there's something that the globalist elites don't want the plebs to know (i.e. Hunter Biden's laptop).</p>

        <p>I haven’t seen anything else to confirm if this is factual or merely anomalous reactions, but I’d say from the looks of it it appears to be people thinking they’re hilarious for taking the piss outta skepticism. Or it could be that they’ve been instructed to fuel the “concern is crazy” narrative. I’d love to know if this is something flaring up.</p>

        <p>&rt; Has anyone seen those videos of vaccinated people sticking a magnet on their arm where the injection site was and seeing the magnet stay in place? Is it real? Or did i get duped.</p>
<p>You got duped.  </p>
<p>My vaxx spot isn't magnetic :( Maybe I didn't get the nanobots? I mean, what do you guys think--is every vaccinated person's injection site now magnetic, or is it just some? What is the cause, in your mind?  </p>
<p>I gotta ask because this is one of the funniest theories this crazy sub has come up with.</p>

        <p>Can never be regained. </p>
<p>I created this throwaway when the pandemic started. If you look at my earlier comments, they were desperately begging to shut down travel from China when all hell was breaking lose. </p>
<p>In January and February of last year I was telling my family and friends to stay away from crowds and not to travel. They all called me nuts because the media and medical establishment was telling them everything is fine. It wasn't. It was OBVIOUS to anyone who would look at the information. There was a problem. </p>
<p>I was being actively censored. There was a coordinated effort to stop people from noticing the situation in Wuhan and ringing alarm bells. Once it had spread everywhere in the world, only then did they put in travel restrictions and crank up the fear and start ringing the alarm. </p>
<p>Luckily by June, it was clear that this disease had changed and it wasn't the world ending pandemic with a huge CFR rate that people were expecting. But they cranked up the fear to 11, and all the world governments did the exact same things and took the exact same measures at the exact same times. </p>
<p>They threw away their pandemic plans and pursued lockdowns and facemasks. Not one government on the face of the earth has produced a clear lockdown cost benefit analysis for their citizens. Not one government has recommended vitamin D supplementation for their citizens even though there is a clear link between Vit D deficiency and poor covid outcomes. </p>
<p>There are very basic things that make me incredibly suspicious. During the vaccine roll out, why hasn't any government prioritized vaccination for the population that has never had covid? With such a shortage, why are you injecting people who have already beat the virus and already had antibodies? </p>
<p>If you have had a positive test or positive diagnosis, shouldn't you be ineligible for vaccination until there is more than enough for everyone? What scientific reason could there be for mismanaging a vaccine roll out like this?</p>
<p>India and the scary Indian variant. The UK has 19X the deaths that India has had when adjusted for population. </p>
<p>The Indians are doing remarkably well. It's been fantastic for them. We should hope we get that variant, if the variant is what has produced those outcomes and not their lifestyle factors. They show photos and videos of open air pyres (which is a cultural practice in India) to scare you, when it's all just bullshit. India should be worried about our variants and not the other way around. </p>
<p>At this point, anything I see in the media I view as complete falsehoods designed to influence my opinions or behavior unless I can verify it as accurate. </p>
<p>It's all bullshit until proven real.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more with this and the only conclusion I can come up with is that our governments are lazy and more focused on appearance (that they are doing something) rather than actually fixing the issue, as is always the case with our governments.</p>
<p>I dont know much about what's going on in India. It does seem that it could be fanatical, it could also be that deaths aren't being reported accurately, there's no way to really know. </p>
<p>I will be getting the vaccine when I'm able to simply because I don't see the harm in the vaccine. It has nothing to do with government influence. I also get the flu shot every year because I believe that vaccines work and that the scientific community has the health and well being of the people in their best interest. </p>
<p>I agree that there is a lot of conjecture happening, on both sides. To that point there is little to no evidence that the vaccine is as or more deadly than SARS-CoV-2. Just like MSM has their bias and, possibly, agenda rebel media has theirs as well.</p>

<p>Why no Vitamin D recommendation? </p>
<p>I have no doubt that individual scientists and doctors mean well and are trying to do good. But the reality is that there is no group who wants to put money up for funding studies that won't produce profits or funding studies that undermine their profits. Also, when such studies do make it, there is no funding to push the information out in the media, in fact, the media is funded to suppress that information by pharmaceutical companies who are their #1 advertisers. </p>
<p>You can make your own medical decisions about the vaccine. </p>
<p>The reality is, if you are young, with no medical conditions it honestly doesn't make any sense to get it, but this is not medical advice, and I'm just some asshole on the internet.</p>

        <p>I've heard thus body mod narrative before so I highly doubt you came up with it all by yourself. It seems you're feeding into the anti vax ideology but can't explain the what's or the why's. It's fine, you're allowed to believe whatever you want.

        <p>It makes absolutely no sense to get vaccinated for a disease I already recovered from and my immune system handled with ease. </p>
<p>It's a waste of money and unnecessary risk. </p>
<p>If I hadn't had covid yet and had some realistic risk of a bad covid outcome I would look into the risks of both in more detail.</p>

        <p>I agree to an extent. It would be worthwhile to test for antibodies as some peoples' immune systems seem to lose antibodies more quickly. </p>
<p>&rt;If I hadn't had covid yet and had some realistic risk of a bad covid outcome I would look into the risks of both in more detail.</p>
<p>It's hard to do an effective risk assessment here because we don't yet know the long term impacts of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and we don't know the long term impacts of the various vaccines. Yes you can asses the short term risks but that isn't a full picture analysis. I think thats the major dilemma: between all the information (and mis-information) floating around and all the unknowns it's difficult to properly asses the risk. Mix that with all the mixed messaging from our leadership and health communities (which I can agree has bred a large amount of mistrust) and its difficult to know what the right choice is. 
It's also possible that you suffer negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 in the future. I sincerely hope not but it is possible.</p>

<p>This may be true, it's also highly unlikely that you still have antibodies against the virus. </p>
<p>&rt;I have way more trust in my immune system than any medical intervention</p>
<p>Out of curiosity do you take any supplements or otc medications, at all? Just want to rule out hypocrisy. Also the vaccine is a medical prevention, treatment for covid would be a medical intervention.</p>

        <p>T cells exist. Even without immunity I'm fine with going a second round.</p>
<p>I supplement electrolytes. It's hard to run 10hrs a week with the occasional 6+hr run without additional electrolytes. It might be possible with a great water source, perfect diet control and a long adaptation period but that's too much trouble for me to figure out.</p>
<p>Btw. Do you drive a car? Just checking if you're a hypocrite for being so fucking scared of a seasonal respiratory virus. That or you're fat/insuline resistant and don't get outside in the sun in which case you are right to be scared. If you need advice on diet/lifestyles feel free to ask. I love helping people get healthy.</p>

<p>You know you could just say you don't want the vaccine because you're scared of it. Stop all the medical treatment non sense. You've received and will receive medical treatments, interventions, preventions at many points in your life.</p>

        <p>I’m getting tired of getting banned from other reddits just for voicing my fears and concerns about the virus and the vaccines. I’m getting shut out and I don’t know where else to talk about it. There’s radicals on both sides and I’m not like either of these two groups I’m seeing verbally abuse each other everyday on this site.</p>

        <p>So I have a dilemma... On Wednesday i'm officially going to be eligible for the vaccine in my region, and I don't want it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n9th6r/weekly_nonewnormal_chatventsupport/gy790nm/">I go into my reasons why here.</a></p>
<p>But I live with my doomer parents, who are addicted to the news and have full confidence in anything the government and the news says. So needless to say, they got their vaccines as soon as they could. Now the problem i'm facing is once i'm eligible, my mom is going to be on my ass nonstop about getting vaccinated. She's already been on my brother's ass about it since he's been eligible for a couple of weeks now and he doesn't want it either... And she's been annoying as hell about it... So I know she's going to give me the same treatment.</p>
<p>So my options are I either A - be honest and say i'm not getting it and just let her throw her tantrum at me about it. Or B - pretend to go get it, but actually not. </p>
<p>There's pros and cons to both... Pros of A are I stand up for myself and be honest. But cons are I endure my moms annoying tantrum and harassment towards me which will further deteriorate my already poor mental health from everything that has happened over the course of this pandemic. </p>
<p>Pros of B are I avoid said aforementioned temper tantrum and harassment... But cons are i'm lying and i'd end up giving my mom validation into thinking she had power over me. Which she doesn't and that wouldn't sit well with me. </p>
<p>So it's a dilemma. I think i'll likely end up just standing my ground and being honest about not getting it... But it's a shitty position to be in.</p>

        <p>Unlikely. If there are people here mad about the lifting of mandates it is probably because 1) they believe that the justification for it was applicable last year and are mad it took so long or 2) they are unhappy that different locations have different mandates, such a policy is not "scientific" or 3) they fear that there will be new mandates soon so do not see it as a victory.</p>

        <p>On this sub, I've seen the following. This is not an exhaustive list:  </p>
<p>--masks aren't effective<br>
--vaccines aren't effective<br>
--masks are actually BAD for you somehow<br>
--vaccines aren't safe<br>
--vaccines contain microchips<br>
--vaccines contain nanobots<br>
--vaccines cause aids<br>
--vaccines cause cancer<br>
--vaccines are contagious and you can "catch" the vaccine from being around vaccinated people<br>
--myriad home remedies for covid, some that have resulted in people getting hurt or killed from trying them<br>
--germ theory is wrong<br>
--covid is a pure hoax and doesn't exist at all<br>
--the covid death numbers are wrong (by orders of hundreds of thousands)</p>

<p>https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses</p>
<p>&rt;"Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort."</p>
<p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240287 (this one claims the outcome of "not effective" is to do with participants not adhering to their protocols, just like in everyday life)</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article this one is another literary analysis which found neither masks nor what they call "respiratory etiquette" (turning to cough, sneezing into elbow, etc) were effective.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372 from this one:</p>
<p>&rt;"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures."</p>
<p>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
<p>&rt;"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers."</p>
<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577 this one is more commenting on efficacy of cloth masks which are popular and equally legal under mandates as medical ones</p>
<p>&rt;"Results: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%."</p>
<p>All in all, despite the multiple sources being quoted in either favour, it seems there isn't enough modern evidence. However, we can gather that mask effectiveness is tied to how they're used and which kind is used, and it's impossible to make sure they're all used correctly 100% of the time by everyone.</p>

        <p>&rt;--masks aren't effective</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines aren't effective</p>
<p>Plausible, depends on perspective.</p>
<p>&rt;--masks are actually BAD for you somehow</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines aren't safe</p>
<p>Depends</p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines contain microchips<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'll just leave this here:</p>
<p>"The work was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and came about because of a direct request from Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates himself"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invisible-ink-could-reveal-whether-kids-have-been-vaccinated/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invisible-ink-could-reveal-whether-kids-have-been-vaccinated/</a></p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines contain nanobots</p>
<p>If you said nanotechnology I would say it was plausible.</p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines cause aids</p>
<p>--vaccines cause cancer</p>
<p>I'll lop these together.  If you're talking about the SARS2 shots... we don't know yet.</p>
<p>&rt;--vaccines are contagious and you can "catch" the vaccine from being around vaccinated people</p>
<p>The way that's worded, I'd say no.  If it was developing herd immunity with fragments of a virus, I'd say true.</p>
<p>&rt;--myriad home remedies for covid, </p>
<p>if you're talking about HCQ, Zpack and zinc/Ivermectin, absolutely true.</p>
<p>&rt;some that have resulted in people getting hurt or killed from trying them</p>
<p>Piggybacking, if youre talking about HCQ, THIS is false.</p>
<p>&rt;--germ theory is wrong</p>
<p>uh... vague statement</p>
<p>&rt;--covid is a pure hoax and doesn't exist at all</p>
<p>I'll leave this one simple, as I agree with you.  However if you replace "covid" with "lockdowns" then everything starts making sense.  The reason for the lockdowns and masks was a hoax.</p>
<p>&rt;--the covid death numbers are wrong (by orders of hundreds of thousands)</p>
<p>True.  The real count for SARS2 is most likely around a 50k.</p>

        <p>Lmao. Feel free to search through my history. You'll find no such thing. I've just dealt with so many maskholes that I stopped providing resources unless asked. I've tallied hours of resources from the CDC, nejm, etc and I get eye rolls. I'm on my phone now, but if your serious I'll happily and civilly  have a discussion with you.</p>

        <p>I support vaccinations and masks but I just wanted to say I respect the skepticism you guys have about Covid. It is good to question things. However, you gotta admit there is a big difference between skepticism and just plain lunacy. For example, I know about 90% of you are genuinely concerned about the vaccine and are skeptical based on science, which is good, but theories like “it’ll plant a microchip in you” or “people with the vaccines shed protein skins” are just pathetic</p>

        <p>Precise reason why the fear-based tactics in other countries are creating bigger problems in the long run. It's more insane if you SUPPORT alienation of basic activities, such as jogging with a mask on, just because you're too caught up in your personal echo chamber.

        <p>Yeah. Those who claim COVID is the best time for introverts are actually sociopaths. Socios are traditionally extroverts that have learned to adapt for the sake of getting attention. Honestly, just fuck personality types. I've made friends with pro- and anti-maskers alike.</p>

        <p>this is nonsense meant to divide skeptics. if the skepticism is warranted and turns out correct, then the next natural progression of questioning is: why were we lied to about the severity, what were in those vaccines, and why the propaganda push to make even kids receive them?</p>
<p>i dont see why the microchip theory (which in reality is looking a lot more like vaccine passports which will eventually become id2020 or w/e, ie a digital way to track information like vaccines) or depopulation theories or w/e are "pathetic" when they are really just more theorizing those previous whys if it turns out we were right to be skeptical. are you really not going to be asking follow up questions???</p>

<p>Oh absolutely. And I get really annoyed when people paint us all with one brush by assuming we're all like that. Extremists and conspiracy theorists exist in every political leaning and issue, so I get annoyed by the strawmanning and them acting like we're all fucking crazy.

        <p>Yeah the injected microchip and vaccines that auto-spread are not current threats, but these technologies actually do exist, it's mainstream news based facts.

        <p>You are the person I’m talking about. No. That theory is just lunacy. You have a phone that tracks everything you do you are literally carrying a tracker 24/7 they don’t need a microchip in you for anything. If you followed any medical science whatsoever you would know any of those theories make no sense. I even had ppl in this sub agree with me that those theories don’t make sense</p>

<p>That would require that at least one overt act be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense.</p>
<p>So unless you can prove that any specific person here has committed a crime or has been convicted of it you're shit out of luck my sad little friend.</p>

        <p>&rt;So unless you can prove that any specific person here has committed a crime or has been convicted of it</p>
<p>You were correct up to this point. The overt act does not itself need to be a crime. For example 2 people plan to rob a bank. They visit the bank first to assess its security, and then pool their money and buy a gun. Both can be charged with conspiracy. No other illegal act committed.
To that point, though, I'm not sure how to prove conspiracy to falsefy vaccine cards. I suppose it would depend on the extent of the planning? Providing templates of vaccine cards may enough but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I was simply saying that conspiracy, without committing another illegal act, is a crime.</p>

        <p>So what’s y’all’s deal? Are you guys just anti maskers cause you think they don’t help or do you think there’s a big conspiracy.  I heard someone use the term plandemic the other day, is that something you folks would subscribe to?</p>
<p>Edit: why did this get 11 downvotes?? It’s a genuine question, having a description of “no new normal” doesn’t tell me much about what is all in your concept of new normal or even what makes you feel that way.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence that masks or lockdowns work and the data points in the other direction. We sacrificed freedom, health, social life and the economy for nothing. </p>
<p>Covid is now effectively an endemic seasonal respiratory virus like influenza. It follows a seasonal pattern which we can't significantly influence and excess mortality of a viral surge is similar to a bad flu season. </p>
<p>Despite all this there is a massive campaign to get everyone vaccinated with a vaccine that is for all intents and purposes still being tested. It's a waste of money, could have unforeseen adverse effects, might drive viral mutation leading to more frequent viral spikes and increased mortality and is chipping away at personal freedoms. </p>
<p>I don't understand why anyone can be on board with the current covid response. It's already over. All covid measures need to be removed instantly and during the next viral spike we need to protect those who are vulnerable like we always do during any viral spike.</p>

        <p>Okay appreciate this well articulated response.  I think your response encompasses this subs core membership from what I’m seeing.  While I respectfully disagree with no evidence that masks make a difference, and even if it turned out they don’t, who cares if it genuinely seemed like it would saves lives.  Right, it’s a mask.  Googling annual deaths of influenza and Covid-19 does show a clear difference in mortality.  I do agree with the hesitation to get the vaccine, we all know it was fast tracked and it became so politicized that I wouldn’t put it past a Democrat or republican to support it, or oppose it, based only on politics.  Sad but true</p>

        <p>The reason yearly mortality is higher for covid is because we had two viral surges In one year and because they were bad spikes, not normal spikes. Both are easily explained by the novelty of the virus. </p>
<p>Now that the novelty has worn off it will likely trend closer to normal influenza numbers.</p>
<p>The research that masks work is based on a lot of unfounded assumptions on how the virus spread. Observational data on mask mandates working is heavily confounded by the timing of the mendates in relation to the normal virus pattern. There are high quality studies that show conflicting evidence and attempts to not get them published.</p>

        <p>There's no evidence that they work to stop or slow the spread (queue the half assed studies replies) and even if they did, state mandating them is still a rights violation. And even beyond that, it's a disease with a 99.9% survival rate. </p>

        <p>Both. Look who made Billions probably Trillions of dollars off this. China. They are the ones that said the lockdown was the way to go and the whole world followed along for some reason. China then proceeded to step up their manufacturing to full capacity and produce all the useless PPE trash and sold it to the world. If this was so deadly name 1 rich and powerful person, I’m talking billionaire that died from Covid. Nobody. Also powerful people made insane amounts money shorting the market when the “pandemic” was announced. What is the ultimate plan? We’ll see. Maybe it was all just a money and power grab. Governments around the world became tyrannical and people were OK with it.</p>

        <p>I believe the virus is real but overblown and mask mandates are an utter nothingburger compared to mass testing, contact tracing, supervised quarantines, and mandatory vaccination. Can't speak for others here though. Please don't paint us all with the same broad brush, pretty sure y'all don't like it when we do the same to you.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t my friend, that’s the point of asking this question, to understand the people that make up this community instead of painting you all as conspiracy nuts.  I do appreciate your response though.  It’s important for me to get opinions on both sides of an issue, this is where I think I’ll get the most informed information on the “not buying into this shit” side</p>

        <p>you’re exactly correct. isn’t it interesting how it seems almost no one got the seasonal flu this year? it’s almost as if .. masks were... doing their job?? also it’s insane to me that they act like masks are some new invention. like. I remember going to the doctor when I was really contagious with something and I had to wear a mask in the doctors office (pre covid, unthinkable I know) </p>
<p>so is it that the masks don’t work in general? or they don’t protect against covid? </p>
<p>if everyone had to wear protective gloves everywhere, you’d have people exactly like this claiming that the gloves don’t work, we won’t be sheep, but I have a medical condition that prevents me from wearing gloves! </p>
<p>it’s not the mask, it’s never been about the mask. it’s about how gullible people are to believe misinformation and propaganda. these are the people calling every doctor and scientist a liar and a fraud.</p>

        <p>I hope that as a part of the new normal, people actually wear masks if they have to go out while they are sick (cold, flu, whatever). Asian cultures already have this ingrained to them because they actually care about not infecting others with what they have, so I would hope people in America would try to do this.</p>

        <p>I would want both anecdotal and empirical evidence. I have definitely seen necdotal evidence. Out of the maybe 20 people that I know in my age group who got COVID 3 still haven’t gotten their sense of taste back or smell back. I know at least 40 friends who have gotten the vaccine and had nothing happen. I haven’t heard of anyone in my friend group having any long term effects from the vaccine. Empirically almost everything says the vaccine is safe for my age group.</p>

        <p>Do you have any idea how many babies are born per day? Even if we let the virus tear through without any precautions whatsoever, the virus wouldn't "kill" this country any more than the corporate executives and government officials already have. And the mask mandates being lifted in exchange for a vaccine is NOT an improvement.</p>

        <p>First, they all said COVID would go away when Biden was elected, "like a miracle". Implying obviously that it was all manufactured fear for political gain or something and that COVID isn't a big deal or flat-out doesn't exist. </p>
<p>When that didn't happen, did they stop to self-reflect and think maybe they are falling for conspiracies? No, of course not. They forged ahead with the new narrative: that the powers that be would never let us go back to normal.  </p>
<p>I wonder what the next line from the anti-vaxx hivemind will be when that's proven wrong as well?</p>

<p>Imagine how this person would react if I said the same thing about the virus lol! Anecdotal evidence of one person's family recovering from the vaccine easily is apparently proof it is safe, but if I shared a story of my alcoholic smoker asthmatic 60-yr old friend recovering easily from the virus, well suddenly we don't like anecdotes anymore!</p>

<p>There's no rationality to these people. They abdicate their critical thinking to the news media and 'experts'  so an anecdotal story is a perfectly valid form of evidence in their minds  as long as it follows the news media narrative. </p>
<p>If my neighbor BOB didn't have side effects the vaccine must be just fine!</p>
<p>Also, have they not heard of LONG TERM side effects?</p>

        <p>Ok, good for you and your family. I still won't take it. But let's flip the question around; how about you take my two shots, for extra protection? I'm serious, what's your genuine answer to that? Let's be honest, you never took the shot, you're just here to fight a losing battle in trying to convince any of us of how safe it is.</p>

        <p>Well it all works out then. I'm sick of my fellow Americans dying and I'm sick of limiting my social interactions. So I got vaccinated like they did in 1920 and 1953, So if you want to whine about lockdowns don't get the vaccine. The CDC has already said you won't have to wear that piece of cloth that bothers you guys so much.</p>
