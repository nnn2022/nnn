    <strong>What should I do if I suspect I may have Covid-19?</strong>
    <p><p>A bit of background.  I am currently 19 years old, I live with my family (my parents and my older sister).  My parents are in their mid-50s, my sister is 24.  I oppose the lockdowns tremendously, and view them as an unconstitutional power grab.</p>
<p>As of recently, I am unsure of what to do.  Over the past few days, I have been experiencing some symptoms which are common to Covid-19.  Those being extreme fatigue, sore throat(my throat feels slightly itchy, not super sore), slight loss of smell and/or taste, slight nasal congestion, and some slight tension in my chest.</p>
<p>Last night, I was coughing quite a bit.  However, they were not coughs that were forced to come out.  I could very easily have not coughed, but I coughed because my throat was slightly itchy and sore and I thought coughing might help me feel better.  This freaked out my parents both of whom are very unskeptical and view covid as the bubonic plague.  My dad (who is a doctor by the way) took my temperature which was fine, and he said if I kept coughing I need to get tested.  I was able to easily hold back all coughs after that because no way in hell am I going to get tested.</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I dealt with similar symptoms.  I am fatigued, have lost a small little bit of smell/taste, occassionally have some tension in my chest, and still feel my throat a bit itchy/soreish, and have lost some appetite.</p>
<p>Here’s my dilemma.  If I was living on my own, I would self-isolate for a few weeks with no problems because I would like to make a personal decision to stay home and not go out until the symptoms subside.  However, if I tell my parents (especially my Dad) about this decision, they will freak out and force me to get tested.  If this returns positive and I do have Covid, then the nightmare begins as that affects everybody I know around me and the government will crack down hard on everybody I know.  Not to mention, my sister is similar to my parents and is a complete hypochondriac.  She got covid tested and constantly gets extremely anxious every day about having covid.  If I had a positive test result, I think it would literally give her a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>What should I do?  I want to make the personal decision to self-isolate due to my potential mild symptoms, but if I tell my parents this, then they will no doubt force me to get tested, which I want to avoid at all costs, period.</p></p>

        <p>From my knowledge, the government will get involved in the lives of everybody you’ve come in contact with and closely monitor them.  I may be wrong, but I do recall hearing in the early days from a mainstream news source that it is not recommended that you get tested even if you’re sick because it adds in a legal obligation to quarantine</p>

        <p>I’m a physician also. I align with your thinking. I personally wouldn’t get tested for a few reasons: 1) I’d likely treat it the same with or without the diagnosis. If you get the test and the symptoms are mild and cold-like: zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C etc. it won’t change your treatment if you know it’s COVID or not. If symptoms worsen or don’t respond to typical viral treatments, then pursue additional diagnostics.
2) you will be put on “the list” with all its implications. </p>
<p>Everyone will likely be exposed to this virus. The numbers are out of the realm of containment. If you choose to not be tested, take extra care around potential at risk people and implement precautions but isolation is a containment strategy. COVID is past the containment stage despite a lot of chatter by politicians and a typical social media virtue signaler. 
You can make the decision - just be prudent about it. You don’t owe your family an explanation.</p>

        <p>He can’t force you to test because of your age. Maybe this is a good time to talk to your parents about how you value your independence and want to develop your own world paradigm. They may be more open than you think. </p>
<p>Evaluate why you want to isolate. There are ways to be cautious without isolation. As I said, isolation is a strategy that simply won’t change the overall tragectory of COVID at this point. If you will isolate, you will likely have to have the discussion with your parents. Find your voice on this issue.</p>

I am planning on moving to South Dakota end of the year and being compliant in this situation will likely make them more inclined to be supportive of the move.  If I do test positive which is looking likely, what will be the negative consequences of being put on “the list”?</p>

        <p>Not a ton, other than your family will be harassed. I have a patient who tested positive and 3 different agencies tracked her, with three different guidelines. </p>
<p>Also, the state agency told the patient’s mother to quarantine the sister (5 year old) because the sister was also positive... but the sister had never been tested . </p>

        <p>It varies considerably. My daughter was diagnosed at an out of state university (against my recommendations because she was essentially asymptomatic) and she quasi quarantined for 4 days cuz her symptoms had existed for 3 days prior. Her roommate was also quarantined despite not being positive. Unfortunately the roommate became positive after the quarantine started and they gave her additional days. </p>
<p>For mild symptoms, I’d say 5 days after symptoms resolve, if you’re going to do it.</p>

        <p>Every single day humans take risks. There is a real risk every time someone pulls their car out of the garage. We are not responsible for other people’s behavior. If someone that is immunocompromised goes to a frat party, it’s not the fault of the other party goers if they get sick. </p>
<p>I would avoid close, prolonged contact with anyone that you know is vulnerable (70 years plus, morbidly obese, someone on chemo etc) for the next week. There aren’t many people in this catagory. Aside from that, I would live your life.</p>

        <p>Those symptoms are the same for a cold or minor fever.
Since it’s a virus just like the flu, there is no treatment.
Have some naproxen and some rest</p>

        <p>I’m a physician.</p>
<p>If you test negative, how is that going to change what you do? I’ve seen lots of false negatives in hospitalized patients with classic presentation and imaging, who later test positive. </p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t get the test, I would just self isolate for a bit. Have your mom bring you hot soup and leave it outside your door. </p>
<p>Tell your father you are going to self isolate, whether you get the test or not, so there is no reason to get a test. I’m sure he would understand. If he doesn’t understand, then frankly he doesn’t understand the purpose of diagnostic testing.</p>

        <p>Damn that’s a tough one man. You got two options: lie to them (which would be lame as hell imo) or be straight with them. Face them like the young man you are. Tell them you’re 19 years old, able to choose to join the military so you can probably make a health decision on your own and that they can’t force you to get a test. What would be the point anyway? What would it change? It’s supposed to be insanely contagious right so they probably already have it at this point...</p>
<p>See if you can stay w a friend or something if they really want you to quarantine. Sorry about your sis. Not much you can do about that besides assure her you’re making it through just fine like any reasonably healthy person would so she could too most likely. I mean it’s about as good as a survival rate as you can possibly ask for haha</p>
<p>But yeah, lie to your family (wack) or face the situation like a grown up. Life sucks sometimes.</p>

        <p>Oops....I guess I was so triggered I didn’t read carefully. Get tested but definitely lie about being around anyone.  Give ZERO power to the tyranny of contact tracing.  You are NOT responsible for hypochondriac family members.  You can only control you and your responses.  If you’re positive, there is a 99++% chance you’ll get over it and be fine. If getting tested will absolutely cause too much chaos and you’re obviously in a stressful situation, I guess if you can hide illness do it. Just stay away from being in close quarters with anyone until you feel better. This illness is ridiculous and the reaction around the world is so ridiculously overblown.</p>

        <p>I get that you don't live on your own but why can't you stand up to your family?  Being able to stand your own ground and say no  is a useful skill to have and I'm a bit put off by your, will just do whatever they want me to do because it's easier attitude.</p>

        <p>Maybe I don’t fully understand things, but if it was me I would continue to fake like I was fine, and not get tested.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t totally self isolate, but I would just be less sociable, I’d get involved in a game or reading some books, you know, good excuses to spend a lot of time in my room by myself. And wash my hands more often than normal, take vitamin C, D, and zinc. </p>
<p>That is what I would do, and if worst case scenario happens, and you start feeling deathly ill, well that justifies getting tested. </p>
<p>Good luck with whatever you decide.</p>
