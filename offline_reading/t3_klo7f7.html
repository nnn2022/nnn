        <p>Precisely. Flu is gone, Pneumonia is gone, heart disease is gone. Magically they don't exist anymore. </p>
<p>Which is EXACTLY why when the news likes to throw around that "300K are dead from Covid!" I just roll my eyes because that number is likely 20-30% Covid. Pure fear mongering and manipulation by not giving any proper context to the data.</p>

        <p>In 2019, 331 people died of influenza in NSW. This year, 12 people have died from influenza and 56 from COVID-19. However, there was never any lockdown to stop the spread of flu in 2019. Why did they let all of those people die last year!</p>

        <p>So epidemiology just doesn't exist in your world, or do you just deny that we're able to even estimate the basic reproductive number?</p>
<p>Obviously there are challenges in estimating r0, with some estimating it as high as 5.8 early on, but more recent studies seem to find it around 2.5 or so (similar to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic). The seasonal flu hasn't had an r0 value that high in our lifetimes. </p>
<p>The scientific community worldwide doesn't even have a consensus on what "mechanistically" causes the flu to have "seasons." There's a bunch of theories, and its likely some combination of factors. Are you going to deny that there are flu seasons now too because there isn't a "shred of evidence" (besides, you know, the numbers of cases at specific times, just like how we measure r0)</p>

        <p>R0 isn't a function of the disease, but the disease in a context.  Population health, density, disease/vaccine penetration, social connectedness, movement patterns, age, climate/weather, other circulating diseases, health care (availability and practices), etc.  If you think one number sums that up you're sorely mistaken.  R0 is how we take the samples we have measured and reduce them to a simplistic final term.</p>
<p>Since we're using PCR as a poor proxy for diagnosis, without normalizing cycle threshhold, generally not controlling for state and country reporting policies (read the papers) which often include duplicate tests on the same individuals, fail to report negative cases, include antibody tests, include "possible" cases, and can even show someone who is already immune with a positive PCR, the data is extremely noisy and broadly incomparable to prior years flu counts and spread.</p>
<p>To that end though, we had an estimated 40-60 million flu cases during last year's very mild flu season in the US.  This can be even higher in a severe season, like 2018.  We must be undercounting covid cases even more than imagined in the US (which means the IFR is even lower than previous cdc estimates of 0.26%) for the current count to be representative of a much more contagious disease.</p>
<p>Colds (like covid) and flus do absolutely vary seasonally, we have an abundance of high quality data from a plethora of sources going back decades that substantiates the claim (including some great analyses of climate-based gompertz curves), as well as viable hypotheses for mechanisms.  We do not have an abundance of high quality data for covid's contagiousness, we have 13-14 months of really miserable data based on terrible tests and political agenda.  Having some understanding of why this cold (and others?  or not?) spreads better would contribute greatly to the discussion.  If colds in general spread more easily, we should have evidence and studies of that we could apply to this cold too.</p>
<p>Again, I'm really not saying covid isn't more contagious, just that it isn't obvious, hasn't been successfully demonstrated, and the exact scale is completely unknown due to the incredibly poor quality of data inundating the research community.</p>

        <p>Plenty of places in the world have norms of wearing masks in public during flu seasons. The flu isn't as deadly or contagious - we beat the yearly flu numbers greatly <em>while</em> taking precautions. Also, the main precaution we take against the yearly flu is the vaccine - do you regularly get it?</p>
<p>We did take precautions and put restrictions in place when H1N1 first appeared in 1918.</p>

        <p>Sure, "Covid" is a made up world wide corporate-government power play to control the masses, end small business, and sterilize people with mRna vaccine's to reduce world population. Anybody who "died of Covid" actually died of something else and was labelled a "C19" death. The last 9 months of your life was a lie and you quarantined for no reason. Fake fake fake fake fake fake.</p>
