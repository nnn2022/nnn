    <strong>My grandparents are getting the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>My mom just told me my grandparents are planning on getting the vaccine. I'm against everything, my mom only partially and my grandparents are against this whole clownery too but they still want to get the vaccine? How can I talk them out of it? </p>
<p>They can clearly see what's happening in this bitch ass world so why on earth would they do this shit to themselves. Help please</p></p>

        <p>Do you believe everyone should have their own autonomy to make decisions like this for themselves? </p>
<p>If yes, there's nothing you can - or should - do.  You can express your opinion to them you can't <em>force</em> them into anything.  </p>
<p><em>forcing</em> them into something makes you no different than people trying to force masks, force vaccines, etc...you can't control things out of your control, especially if it impacts the lives of others.</p>

        <p>Remind them that restrictions will stay in place regardless of whether they take it or not. Right now, the vaccine is in experimental stages until January 2022 and no one will take liability if anything does happen. Experts don't even know what can happen to health in one, two, five or ten years. Maybe ask them to think about what demands might come next, so multiple shots a year, further restrictions if not up to date on jabs etc.</p>
<p>My mom took the vaccine, she was pressured at the doctors and she felt horrible afterwards and isn't going back for the second. Like your grandparents, she knows this is all bull. I asked her why she took the vaccine, she said because eventually they're going to make it impossible to do anything and it was a spur of the moment decision. This is how they get people.</p>
<p>She's still my mom, I don't treat her any differently because of her choice and she respects my choice.</p>
<p>If your grandparents do choose to get it, please understand that you made them aware of the real information and they made their decision. We can't force people, we can just make them aware of the risks they are taking.</p>
<p>I understand people wanting to take the vaccine to get away from this nonsense for a tiny taste of freedom, but its really not worth it. I admit, I have thought about it myself but to play with my health in that way is not the type of risk I wish to take.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>I live in the northern Chicago suburbs and my grandpa is getting it on March 25 and he's (88 years old) excited for it but I don't think it's a good idea. The most realistic reason is because it can make you sick and the second reason is it's a part of the agenda. </p>
<p>I can't do a lot to stop it but something I'm wondering is that I know that if a lot of old people die from the vaccine, the news is definitely not going to report it, so how many peoples' old family members has gotten the (first or second dose) vaccine and has gotten really sick or died?</p>

        <p>People have to make their own decisions for themselves.  Most people make their decisions based on the influence done to them.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical corporations diligently always seek to hire the most adept and effective people/agencies at promoting their products to people, particularly against people's own best self-interests.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical corporations already have many decades invested into doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Good luck overcoming that if you don't have billions of dollars in advertising budget and hundreds of millions or billions of people already agreeing with you (and in the case of those following along with pharmaceutical corporations pursuing their own fiscal self-interests, that means billions of people already brainwashed into enabling the fiscal self-interests of the pharmacutical corporations).</p>
