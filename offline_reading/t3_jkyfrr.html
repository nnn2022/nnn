    <strong>Has anyone else noticed music just sounds really inappropriate in public places now ?</strong>
    <p><p>Now whenever I’m in a grocery store or whatever, maybe waiting in line, whatever music they’re playing seems almost hilariously inappropriate (if it wasn’t so sad). I was waiting outside in line for the grocery store and they were playing “dancing in the moonlight”, and that song in contrast with everyone standing 6 ft apart in their masks in the cold outdoors with dead eyes was just too much. I was like ... wow those days are over, this just sounds totally wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, but don't start believing it is wrong. </p>
<p>"waiting outside in line for the grocery store"... Sounds wrong</p>
<p>"Everyone standing 6ft apart in their masks"... Sounds wrong</p>
<p>Music sounds great, sounds human, sounds appropriate.</p>
<p>Stupid rules and ignoring how humanity has always dealt with illnesses like this, is what's wrong. </p>
<p>Hold on to humanity wherever you see or hear it.</p>

        <p>I'm typing this in a bar, playing music, nobody's wearing masks, guys playing pool and drinking beer. Like none of this shit ever happened. Gotta hang on to these moments as much as you can. You never know when some psychotic governor decides to shut it all down.</p>

        <p>I noticed that too. Then the pre-recorded spiel of “keep a six-feet distance from other customers and employees and keep your mask on at all times. We are committed to providing a safe shopping experience for everyone.” It’s like something out of a dystopia movie.</p>

        <p>There's policies in some countries, so you can't have too loud and happy music because of it makes hearing masked people harder. They want you to keep 6 feets away. They don't want you to rise your voice or be too close, because of it may spread the novel virus!</p>

        <p>Yes and it's not only music. I can hardly watch any movies anymore because of how utterly false they appear.</p>
<p>Seriously, how can I watch a movie about normal people doing normal things if our reality is absolutely nothing like it anymore? Or even more, how can I watch a movie about some brave vikings or whatever when all I see outside is a bunch of masked zombies?</p>
<p>I might as well watch randomly generated fractals. Those might be more related to our current reality than some Hollywood <em>feel good</em> movie.</p>

        <p>Back in the early days of lockdowns (before I found people to hang out with who were ignoring the social distance shaming in favor of living life), I remember watching some TV drama and crying because it had scenes in a city. People everywhere, sitting around at cafe tables, going to stores to buy whatever. Life the way it's supposed to be lived. I refuse to consume media that tries to sell lockdowns as normal in any way.</p>

<p>Yeah, I do this too. There was a lot of it back in April trying to make people feel good about spending all day alone in a room. I don't know if they're still doing it, I've kind of stopped following mainstream media almost completely.</p>
