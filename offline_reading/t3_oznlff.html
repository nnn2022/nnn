    <strong>The theater of mask wearing at the Olympics:</strong>
    <p><p>World class athletes winning gold medals, and immediately after doing so put on a mask.  Who is she protecting?  <strong>She</strong> is obviously not sick, she just won a fucking gold medal.  And she sure shouldn't be worried about <em>catching</em> a virus that the vast majority of us fight off with ease, because she is a world class athlete in perfect health.  But, the mask is <strong>mandatory</strong>, that is, unless you just don't want to wear it, then that's fine too.  USA men's basketball team's head coach, just chooses not to wear it.  He is in his 70s.  Some of the players though, after competing with and against other players in close proximity and with plenty of contact and sweat and everything that goes with it, choose to put a mask on once they are out of the game.  <em>Some</em> of those players wear it tight; some wear it on their chin.  That's because it doesn't really make a difference, it is just theater.</p>
<p>What we have here is a virus that is <em>such</em> a big deal that spectators cannot attend the Olympic Games, and we are told that that's because the virus is deadly and contagious and worth turning the world upside down for by destroying businesses, mental health, our kids' future development etc., BUT, we will continue to compete anyway because the mask makes us safe, but you don't have to wear it if you don't want to, so the virus isn't quite so dangerous after all.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy is astounding and I'm astounded by the people who don't see it.</p></p>

        <p>I can't watch any more of these Olympics for this reason. The mask theater is so fucking absurd. It makes me cringe over and over again, it's extremely distracting and I just can't watch. You see these people hugging each other, no problem, but the mask must stay on. Touching their faces, constantly adjusting the mask, playing with it, taking it off and putting it back on repeatedly. And these are the cloth masks that DON'T DO SHIT.</p>
<p>It's absolutely fucking absurd. Can't see people's faces, it looks like some weird cult. Tiny audiences, zero atmosphere. Abysmal. If not for the athletes who obviously trained hard for this I'd say they should've just canceled it altogether instead of allowing it to devolve into such a freakshow.</p>

        <p>I'm surprised that athletes wear no masks during competition. Many times we were told by "scientists" that masks do not reduce oxygen intake.</p>

        <p>Exactly, that's another thing.  Of <em>course</em> they don't wear a fucking mask when they're competing, that would be asinine, b e c a u s e masks restrict your breathing.</p>

        <p>Yep compete at the highest level and in extremely close contact very heavily but make sure when you go to the bench you put you mask on. It’s ok for them but hey you normal people make sure on sundays you don’t sing in church it can spread covid and definitely sit 6 ft apart. What’s even stupider is that they are all either vaxed or have Ben rigorously tested so why the masks?!?! It’s all been a show this entire time! Starting from the NBA playing in a bubble isolated from the rest of the world tested I think daily yet still wearing masks when not on the court?!?! Get outta here with that BS propaganda!!</p>

        <p>Agreed!  It was really weird how they started wearing them just the last couple days but weren't before.  Idiocy</p>

        <p>I don't know what Olympics you were watching, but I saw the event where swimmers were totally masked up as they do their laps. The masks work!</p>

        <p>Is it easier to set a blanket rule for everyone to wear masks, with the 1 rule of "unless you are competing".  Given the variety in humans attending the olympics (officials/coach's included). 
Yeah no doubt most peak level athletes would run over covid symptoms, but what about everyone else there?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
