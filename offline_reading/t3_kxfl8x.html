    <strong>Going for the children</strong>
    <p><p>I am a preschool teacher here in Japan, back in March they closed schools for almost 2 months due to “supposed Rona cases” When I started back working in May, schools were a nightmare. Forced social distancing, mask wearing and temperature checks. <br>
After a month things slowly went back to normal and now most schools don’t have children in mask or social distancing.  No children or staff ever got sick nor did they claim any children Covid cases.</p>
<p>February the vaccine is coming to Japan, and wouldn’t you know... They are claiming many more Rona cases and continue to raise the numbers daily. Tokyo is on an emergency with curfews and now my city is also. <br>
They are going after the kids now, claiming children in schools are infected with Covid. This is their new strategy to scare parents and get them to accept the vaccine.  If they claim a child has Covid at a school, numerous parents freak out and want action...</p>
<p>So, yesterday my boss tells me one of the schools I teach at is now canceled. It’s a small preschool but they also have many other schools. Apparently a child got sick, they tested him or her for Covid and the test was positive. The government then shut down all their schools and shamed them claiming they didn’t take good enough Covid prevention measures for children... Parents are outraged listening to the government BS.  The school always checked temperatures and did all they could.</p>
<p>All staff  children &amp; their parents must quarantine for 10 days.  The owner of the schools said they will do a full cleaning but the Health Department said, NO... The entire inside of the schools must be redone. Removing all wallpaper, wood panels, floors  and so forth and replacing them. They claim a cleaning won’t get rid of the virus..... Oh, and the government won’t be paying for it. The owner has to pay for all of the work and it must be done or they close the schools permanently. Crazy thing is, the one school I teach at is brand new, they just built it last year! Now they gotta destroy the inside and redo it all.</p>
<p>How damn insane is that?! Seems like a ploy to me to shut down small schools and force the vaccine.</p></p>
