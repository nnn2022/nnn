    <strong>Feeling lost and confused in a world gone mad.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm posting here for the first time in the hope that some people can discuss their feelings about what is going on right now.</p>
<p>For years I've been into "consipracy theories". 9/11 really sparked my interest into reading and researching the real motives and agendas behind some of the world events that have unfolded in the past 50 years or so. I'll admit, when we first started hearing about Covid-19 posing a threat in China, I was genuienely worried about it and the implications it would have on other nations (including my home, the UK) around the world. </p>
<p>However, it didn't take too long after the UK entered it's first lockdown on the 23rd March 2020 to start noticing red flags about what was really happening. Now there are tonnes of topics we can talk about since the start of the pandemic up until now but that's not my reason for this post. I have been well aware for a long time now that this unprecedented event is nothing more than a precursor to what is about to follow....The Great Reset. </p>
<p>I guess my point here is that I feel so lost and confused at the moment. Out of all my close friends (literally all of them) and my immediate family, I am the only person who is awake to all of this. Which in turn means I am the only person out of everyone important to me who won't ever be receiving a vaccine for Covid-19. I am just absolutely stunned and shocked that so many people are still oblivious to what is unfolding around them, it actually pains me. Everyone I love and care about is (and I hate to say it) a sheep. They are being programmed by the government and mainstream media and I believe it's too late for them now.</p>
<p>I am 27 years old and up until April this year I lived at home with my parents and 24 year old brother. Being at home with them for a year, in and out of isolation and lockdowns was really tough and not because I was unhappy at home, but because it was devasting to see them so blindly obey the government. There were many occasions where I would try to have a mature conversation about the whole thing, where I asked them questions and tried to helo them form a critical and rational approach to what is happening. But they were having none of it. They would shut me down and say I was "talking bollocks". One day a discussion got so heated it turned into quite an aggressive argument and I was called (and I quote) a fucking conspiracy nutjob. That was it for me, I'd had enough. My mental health was at an all time low and within 3 weeks of that argument, I moved out.</p>
<p>Since then, my mental health has improved but overall it's till pretty shot. It's hard, I've swallowed that pill and sometimes when I'm sat reading/researching I sit there and think "this is going to send you insane". But then I come onto Reddit and realise I'm not alone. What's frustrating me the most is that all my close friends and family have been vaccinated and through pretty poor decisions. "I want to travel again" or "I want my life back" are the most common ones. They are shocked that I won't be a lab rat for the government and have actually started expressing their concern for my safety (lol) and my impact on their safety. They clearly have full faith in the vaccine don't they.....My recent girlfriend of 2 months is also pro-vaccine, has had her job and believes every word that the government and MSM spout on the topic of Covid-19. Which baffles me even more because she's a hard lefty, has been a liberal all her life and KNOWS the government is corrupt and evil beyond belief. So why is her opiniom of this pandemic so different to what she would usually stand up for and believe in? Part of me is telling myself to just cut my lossed with her at this point.</p>
<p>If a higher force is making a decision that is going to impact my life, I want to know who they are, why they are making that decision and how it will impact my life. Not sit back and do fuck all. If theres anyone out there in a similar scenario to me, just remember you're not alone. When this all goes to shit (which it inevitably will), we can be the ones who will stand loud and proud and say "WE TOLD YOU SO". I have attended two protests in London recently and travelled far (based in Derby) to be with people who stand up for what they believe in and it was fucking great.</p></p>

        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>

        <p>I think one needs to comprehend, that there is a ongoing evolution to society, that has been underway since the beginning of civilization. I am 50 years old, I have been "into" conspiracy theories since 9/11 as well. But I am a skeptic at heart, so a lot of theories get put on a shelf for me, and only certain bit of data can be filed under factual, or true indicators of proof.</p>
<p>For instance, the true events of 9/11, and those responsible, may not be known for a very long time, if ever. The proof sited by many "truthers" is just not verifiable. However, if one were to look at the actions of some people in the following days to weeks of the events, there is a clear indication of a cover up. And is there is a cover up....well you get the point.</p>
<p>The events of the past couple of years has made me realize something. Society as we know it, is dominated by a set of ideas, those ideas lead to principles that are dubious. That is, everything from the media to government, economics to education, are based on deception.</p>
<p>Just take marketing for instance (which arose from the ideas of propaganda in the Nazi part and Goebbels). Nothing is a straight forward advertisement of a product or service anymore. The ads serve as a distraction from a product, and only serve to engrave a brand into the mind. This extends to everything in media, and not just products and services now, but into groups and ideologies.</p>
<p>This system has been growing rapidly in the past few decades. I dare call it the "Beast" system, enabled and proliferated by a class of individuals that worship that which they themselves created. This will culminate in the development and submission to, a rogue AI. Which is their ultimate goal, to merge with this "entity" they worship, in an effort to become something more than human, or as close to gods as they imagine one to be.</p>
<p>But in order for them to achieve this dream of theirs, the population must be under their complete control. A population whose growth far exceeds their capacity for said control. So as I am sure you see now, that population must be reduced and maintained at much lower levels than it currently enjoys.</p>
<p>The major aspect of gaining that control, is altering the perception of the population, and therefor altering their reality. For is you control one's perception of reality, you control their actions. This is where the AI comes into play. Now with technology and associated metadata, constantly uploaded and stored, compiled and processed by algorithm, the AI can begin prediction of human behavior based on machine learning, and then learn how to manipulate perception through media, to garner a given result.</p>
<p>So a long as the masses tune in to deception, they will follow their masters desires. As far as I know, there is no way to stop it from effecting other people, unless they wake up to what I just posted here, and tune out or accept they are lied to constantly almost every moment of their lives.</p>
<p>I know where you are coming from, and lots of us ae right there with you. So you are not alone, just separated from us by a digital landscape. Hang in there.</p>

        <p>NP bro, keep trying, if you save even one person from the "Beast", you have done something great and honorable. Bur remember, we have a hard life ahead, stay true and don't give in, for now you are an example to others. If you fail, they will think they were right to doubt you all along. But the more the truth comes out, the further you have pulled them out of the system. Because those in control, despite their best efforts, are still human, and still make mistakes. And they are all narcissists to the degree of psychopathy, and the pinnacle of arrogance. They expose themselves more everyday, to the light of day, and we can still win this. For the vast majority of people, don't want to be slaves, they yearn for liberty, all they need is the truth. Peace and God bless, you and yours.</p>

        <p>Great rant. Cheers to you for moving out and making a stand on your beliefs. We are not alone.</p>
<p>The COVID lock-downs and vaccination divisiveness has been detrimentally toxic to both my own relationship, friends and work environments.</p>
<p>Luckily I have an extended family who respects each other's beliefs and decisions and does not let it affect our deep relationship.</p>
<p>Yes, each day when a new governmental decree or PSA propaganda message comes out I also believe that "this world has gone mad". Best of luck to you and all, while we ride this moment in history out.</p>

        <p>As I read this, I feel like I wrote it. I feel so alone, luckily my husband is on the same page as me but I have cut all communications with my family. This is hard because my mom is dying from ALS and I have been helping care for her for years. Now I can’t, they all got the jab and I don’t know what affects it might have on me so I will stay away until the affects are known. I tried having that logical adult conversation with my dad last week and it was a disaster. “I was the one who has been duped!” He did his research, meaning he listened to more than just news channel!!!! Seriously!!!! I can’t make this stuff up! We are doomed, I don’t think there enough normal people to fight this! We need help</p>

        <p>Gosh, a fellow Brit here but now one living in California. I literally could have typed your post word for word. I agree with  everything you say. Until the day I die, I will NEVER understand how so many seemingly intelligent friends, my sister too, many who prior to the pandemic, were so anti government and feisty, have just fallen for the rhetoric thats is circulating. Its so utterly incomprehensible to me, as from the very beginning, when I heard there might be a lockdown, I thought, this can't possibly happen?? A lockdown?? That is a terrible idea and no one will put up with that...then look what happened. I am lucky I have friends who feel as I do, some out here in California, so I do count my blessings there,  as I simply could not have got through this on my own, as I live alone and that's been extremely hard in of itself. In fact, that's something that hasn't been addressed as much as it should, people who have been alone through all this. I am a strong person but have struggled mightily with all this. I almost fell out with my sister, she is married, mortgage paid off, retired, pension, I mean, she has hardly been affected by all this tbh, whereas I have been devastated by it, my work dried up for almost a year, it's still not recovered, and I just tried to get her to understand how so many people are suffering but she won't hear it. At one point she told me ..' its best we don't talk about the pandemic...' I mean, WTF, elephant in the room, or what?? Not talk about something that has had a catastrophic impact on my life, just because she is uncomfortable??? Anyway, I will end by saying, this sub, and a few others, have been so important to me, and my mental health... I hope you get through all this,  you are not alone.... there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Oh, and I am NOT getting the vaccine, and I am heavily into critical thinking. I try  not to use the words conspiracy theory as I hate that!</p>

        <p>Family can be the absolute worse for throwing you under the bus, and ostracizing you if you do not follow along with the rest of them.. wouldn't be the first to say 'goodbye' to family in order to live life free from negativity, stifling or outright disrespect.</p>

        <p>I missed that part. Good for you! My little brother is about to be 30 and still does the mommy buy me chicken tendies thing... I thoroughly believe the reliance on parents the millennial generation is using is attributing to a lot of negative effects in society.</p>
