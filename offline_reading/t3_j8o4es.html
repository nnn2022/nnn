    <strong>The Veneer Of "Caring"</strong>
    <p><p>Sunshine, rainbows, and unicorns are going to break out any minute. 2020 is the year of "caring"!</p>
<p>- They care about speaking out, unless you stray from the narrative.</p>
<p>- They care about taking to the streets and protesting, unless it's about lockdowns and loss of freedom.</p>
<p>- They care about LBGTXYZ#*&amp;@!, unless they say "we just want to be left alone and live a normal life".</p>
<p>- They care about minorities, unless they pull a Thomas Sowell and say "I can make my own way, you don't speak for me".</p>
<p>- They care about the disabled, unless the disability means you can't wear a face diaper.</p>
<p>They care about "bullying", unless it's harassing otherwise law-abiding citizens who refuse to participate in CoronaSecurityTheatre.</p>
<p>- They care about  Grandma, unless Grandma doesn't want to be used as an excuse to turn our society into a giant concentration camp.</p>
<p>Caring has nothing to do with it. It's all about control of others, narcissistic supply, and sowing division. So beyond myself, my immediate family, and those in my immediate circle, I refuse to "care" any more.</p>
<p>Who else out there is making their 2021 New Year's resolution "I don't care. I resolve that I have no more fucks to give"?</p></p>

        <p>Hear hear.</p>
<p>2020 is the year of virtue signaling and self righteousness. </p>
<p>They care about grandma and at risk people but many young and healthy people clogged up grocery delivery streams meant for those people because they were too scared to go get their own groceries. </p>
<p>They care about low income communities, but their caring stops when those people would rather work to keep food in their table than shelter inside (because they can’t wait weeks for clusterfuck unemployment offices to come through), and their caring stops when children in those communities can’t actually attend school anymore because they don’t have computers, good internet or a parent who can stay home with them. </p>
<p>They care about class disparities but don’t care about the decimation of small businesses and shift of wealth to the top that is going on.</p>
<p>They care about gender equality but don’t care that like 70% + of the people laid off or quitting are women because they were forced to end their careers to stay home with kids who are virtually schooling. </p>
<p>They care about grandma but act shocked if she says she would rather spend her last years taking a chance to spend time with her family than being locked in her room at a nursing home or inside her home. It isn’t about what she wants. </p>
<p>Basically caring stops where their level of comfort and security and convenience ends, and they’ll tell themselves any lies they want to justify it.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the award stranger! I feel validated knowing people agree.</p>

        <p>So true.</p>
<p>Very few people take up causes or give to charity because they actually care - they do it because <em>they</em> "feel good" aka they can tell themselves that they are "better than you".</p>
<p>In the young, there is also the totally mercenary dynamic of "If I do all this woke shit, chicks will like me and I'll get laid".</p>
<p>This is why so many people give money to help fly-covered, starving waifs in Africa, but if you tell them their support of lockdowns is literally putting people out on the streets, their response is "meh."</p>

        <p>I consider it validation honestly. And the more we consider it that the more it backfires on them. If they don’t have an argument they give the award ironically and I assume it’s because they don’t have anything to say.</p>

<p>After my local sub got taken over by BLM-holes and covid Nazis and banned everyone, we started an alternate local sub, and have been under constant brigading and trolling from members of the old sub ever since. It's not enough to kick you out, they have to silence and destroy you.</p>

        <p>Then they get upset when services like Gab and Voat exist, and that people become more violent and radicalized after being told that their beliefs are part of the violent radical fringe. I'd rather be called a milquetoast and soft, but be viewed as the "moderate" or "loyal opposition" part of the conversation and community, than be told that my opinions are pure evil and that I don't deserve happiness.</p>

        <p>People like this never actually care. It's about their own standing in the social game. They go with what is currently accepted as the trendy thing to do/say so that other people see them as a "good person."</p>
<p>Basically, people with low self esteem, zero integrity and no balls. They depend on outside validation and have no real moral values - they do not know themselves.</p>
<p>Anyone with basic understanding of human psychology can see this. To show this to people like them, would not work, because of cognitive dissonance. Their ego literally associates this realization with physical death, so their mind CANNOT accept this. It would cause them to go psychotic.</p>
<p>I recommend two things to everyone: learning about (evolutionary) psychology/biology and taking psychedelics.</p>

<p>Bingo. And you have just described about 75% of the population. Their craven acquiescence "to just get along" is how you get tyranny. It's why even America's Founding Fathers felt there should be certain limits on the voting franchise.</p>
<p>In the last century, these were the people that hung red flags from their tenements in Berlin - until the Nazis took power. They then went to the rallies, shouted "Seig Heil!" with everyone else, and made sure their little Klaus attended the Hitler Youth meetings.</p>
<p>When it was all over and their Fuehrer offed himself, they hugged the "Amis" and thanked them as "liberators".</p>
<p>Then they said they knew nothing about any camps, that it wasn't them - "We thought the smoke and that smell was a tannery or something". Despite the fact they supplied it with stationary, or food, or cleaning supplies, and had been inside the gates - "but never farther than the main office, mind you!"</p>
<p>That was then. But human nature hasn't changed.</p>

        <p>Exactly. "I was just following orders" is the excuse used for blind obedience to authority. It has never been a good argument and is not a good argument now.</p>
<p>Some people would honestly just rather follow authority it seems. Weak people, not to be trusted. This thing enables us to see the true colours of our fellow men. Archive everything and take note, when this is over, who should never be trusted again. They are the ones who'd stab you in the back without a second thought.</p>

<p>That's social media in a nutshell. Doesn't take a genius to see how the US has gotten more and more politicized and aggressive as social media becomes more and more popular. It's all about "looking good," doesn't actually matter what people believe. May sound like an overreaction but IMO social media is one of the worst things to ever happen to us (goes both ways too, i.e. Trump on twitter). Not to say it doesn't have its benefits as well, but overall I'd say it's a net toxic impact.</p>

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>If I had a time machine, I would go back to about 1982. Or maybe peak Western civ, about 1955. All the modern conveniences, but no PC, no "woke", no social media lynch mobs. Personal responsibility was king, and most people could be still trusted on their word and a handshake.</p>
<p>And officious busybodies like you see today, either got laughed out of the room, or if they warranted it, got the living snot beat out of them...</p>

        <p>The Bible was meant as a guide to living a moral and fulfilling life - there is nothing wrong with quoting it. Just because some have chosen to use it as a tool to oppress their fellow man, doesn't make its core lessons any less valid.</p>
<p>This John Adams quote isn't Biblical, but I think it helps explain where we have gone so wrong. The Founding Fathers believed in the need for a "God-fearing" people for democracy to work; I think it is the reason their experiment worked, while the French (atheist) version failed - there was no standardized moral compass to prevent savagery and slaughter:</p>
<p>&rt;"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."</p>
<p>We seem to be traveling down the French road now, vice that of the Founding Fathers...</p>

        <p>&rt; - They care about LBGTXYZ#*&amp;@!, unless they say "we just want to be left alone and live a normal life".</p>
<p>This is exactly what I say. I'm gay, I believe in traditional marriage, I eat Chick-Fil-A, and I'm conservative and registered Republican. I am who I am, and proud of it; yet at the end of the day I don't make a big deal out of it, and definitely don't let myself be whored out to woke SJW types to be used as a token. This in mind, the LGBT community does not care about me, the corporations changing their logo once a year also do not care.  Thusly I've learned over my short 22 years of existence, why should I care back?</p>
<p>I'm beyond sick and tired of these virtue signaling jackasses trying to control every part of our lives. With the absurdity going on in our lives, I truly feel in the vein of Roger Waters that, the species has amused itself to death. Here's a novel idea, if you have a compromised immune system, how about not going out (should you choose) and let healthier people live their lives. Why should I have to give up my freedom in the name of caring, when after all, so few people have cared about me? Indeed we know, those who give up their freedom in exchange for security deserve neither. These people have never spoken for me, then or now; I don't want to wear a mask, I don't want to social distant, and I don't want to care. I want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>Hey - this comment isn’t accurate.  In some people, it really does.  Rape survivors, PTSD.   Loads of circumstances in which wearing a mask or getting yelled at can cause a panic attack. Happy World Mental Health Day to you.</p>

        <p>The people who "care", don't care.  About you, anyway.</p>
<p>They care about being able to wag a finger, shout at, even assault and beat someone they feel morally superior to, or at least someone they know they can pick on (where I live, a white person would <em>never</em> tell a black person to wear a mask).  </p>
<p>They're not informing you of their magnanimity.  They're telling you they're better than you, and aren't you ashamed because you're not as "good" as they are.</p>
<p>I keep saying it, but it's true.  I feel sad for those hall monitor types.  They get the first bit of power they may have ever had in their lives, and decide that they need to be the biggest assholes possible.</p>

        <p>It's quite the opposite for me - My biggest resolution for 2021 will be to try to <em>actually care</em> about people. To care about their liberties and their freedoms, to care about what it means to have inalienable rights and for truth to be self-evident in the face of political narrative. To speak out against injustice and not conform to the groupthink narrative.</p>
<p>I try to respect people, generally. I do care about certain individuals. I know that the way to live that's right for me isn't right for everyone. So I'll want to hear what people believe is right for them in the coming year and make my decision about whether I will accommodate them, adjust my own life, or avoid them entirely. I know that some businesses will never be getting money from me again; I know that some businesses I never would have dealt with before have become staples of my existence. I've unfollowed, muted, or blocked communication with (or else been blocked by) people I care about for the fact that we are not able to find a point of compromise, or else that I am not willing to bend. I still care about them, and truly wish that they go on and live their best life with their beliefs and opinions intact. I know that some of them don't wish the same for me.</p>
<p>So, no, I will make an effort to genuinely care about others in this coming year. I will care about respecting their beliefs even when I disagree. I will care about maintaining our mutual sanity and peace by avoiding them.</p>

        <p>&rt;  They care about taking to the streets and protesting, unless it's about lockdowns and loss of freedom.</p>
<p>This one is the one that drives me crazy the most. I'm not anti-BLM, or racist or anything. But I really despise how the same people bitching at anti-lockdown and anti-mask protests/protesters are the same people who are touting how amazing and necessary the BLM protests were and spamming articles showing that COVID didn't spread at said marches since "most people were wearing masks" (i've seen the photos, no, most people weren't actually)... But yet in the same breath they contradict everything they say about the BLM protests in regards to virus transmission when it suits their narrative towards marches they don't approve of. You can't have your cake and eat it too. COVID doesn't care about whether your cause is worth marching for or not. It'll spread just the same. So pick a side.</p>
