    <strong>I'm pro-vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I've come to the conclusion that i'm pro-vaccine, I want everyone to get vaccinated because 7 billion clowns is just too much, the herd needs thinning, mankind is an invasive species on this planet and if the worst kind are gleefully getting jabbed with experimental vaccines then so be it, I'm fucking glad, I think more people should go ahead and get it. I'm starting to see why the elites look down on the people so much, my enemy aren't the elite, my enemy are the masses that let the elite reign.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what happens to all the clowns that got jabbed in a few years, I'm just going to grab some popcorn and enjoy the showüçø</p></p>

        <p>There has been plenty that have benefitted society. 
I don't know manufacturers. You can't argue the science, but requiring a vaccine for something that amounts to a terrible so us headache with cold like symptoms isn't enough for me to risk my body.</p>

        <p>Fair enough but why say you can't argue science? What does that even mean. If people throughout history did not "argue science" of their time period would we be where we are today?</p>

        <p>By saying "you can't argue the science" I meant you really cannot argue that vaccines do not work, nor that they don't benefit society.
I'm all about questioning, wouldn't be here if I wasn't, but I also accept facts. The facts are certain vaccines are important and should be researched, and if safe, implemented. Vaccines should be a choice and they shouldn't be forced. 
I'm not saying don't question, that's exactly how you achieve results, but you also cannot say that the science behind vaccines has not benefitted humanity.</p>

        <p>you really can, almost all the benefits attributed to vaccines really just came about due an increase in living standards, nutrition, sanitation, the vaccinations actually follow a backwards curve, the higher the living standard the more vaccines and not the other way around, they maim and destroy millions of lives a year and when understand how fraudulent germ theory is and that terrain theory is correct, that in order to be healthy you must clean and detoxify your system, follow correct nutrition and exercise protocols you realize its all a trick and that these injections are very dangerous</p>

        <p>I agree with you there, if they are safe and and work I feel like you should have an option in getting it. I'm against mandatory vaccines of any kind. But this begs the question of whose the one claiming they are safe and can they be trusted. I have no trust in the fda as they regulate a bunch of shit in our foods and such that are toxic. And as you can see with the covid vaccines they try to mitigate the damages the vaccines have done and also have friends or people bought out to do "peer reviewed studies" to claim they are safe. Are these not the same companies who make the covid vaccines that make most other vaccines. Is it not odd to question what they are doing now but not for the rest of the shit they are doing if you know what I mean.</p>

        <p>I want to feel this way but I can't. Some people who have been vaccinated are insufferable assholes but others have been coerced into it to keep their jobs and that includes people I hold dear.

        <p>They‚Äôre angry because we are free thinkers and don‚Äôt fall prey to the elites propaganda. It threatens them when we stand up for personal rights and responsibilities.

        <p>Are we not allowed to be angry? The revolution of ideas cannot happen with sheep, if you question anything or bring up any facts regarding any subject you will be labelled a racist, sexist, fascist, science denying homophobic and transphobic bigot lol</p>
<p>The sheep must die, and we must live. People cutting their dicks off and blocking their airways with masks is science and questioning the accuracy of PCR tests is bigotry. That is the world we live in today.</p>

        <p>You probably missed the part where the World Economic Form said they wanted to index all land, natural resources, economy etc. Meaning, living in the woods might not be an option when they come knocking to expropriate your land.</p>

        <p>There is no shame in saying that I'm in agreement with you. Seeing so many people line up to get an EXPERIMENTAL DNA modifiying drugs shocks me. They don't see the paradox of an experimental - but at the same time - safe and effective "vaccine". Safe and experimental dont go together. Even intelligent people dont pick up on it. They are soooo scared that common sense seizes to function.</p>
<p>Never in my live have I seen such successful propaganda. Actually Hitler used the same type of propaganda too, and very successfully may I add. History is repeating itself. Now we are indoctrinating children to fear humanly contact. We see so many of our youths supporting socialism. Women have been brainwashed by feminism to hate men. Dont get me started on the pending race war.</p>
<p>Many will die upcoming flu season, just like Bill Gates predicted. He knows the vaccines are meant to destroy the immune- and reproductive system. But there is a big likelihood that vaxxed individuals can transmit the spiked protein to others. In other words, having intimate relationships will come much more riskier. These people are walking disease spreaders if my sources are correct. So how much fun will your live be knowing that other can infect you? I also read that the vaccine contains microchips that connect to 5G. In essence the government will be able to read and manipulate your emotions. Making the population docile. Dark times are ahead. Living amongst zombies.</p>
<p>Im not looking forward to that scenario. Are you?</p>

        <p>&rt; because 7 billion clowns is just too much, the herd needs thinning, mankind is an invasive species on this planet </p>
<p>Genocidal eugenicist nihilistic ecoterrorists frighten me. Why would you even think of humans as a 'herd' that needs 'thinning?' This is the exact thinking that the minds behind the NN have. Don't become the enemy that you want to defeat.</p>
