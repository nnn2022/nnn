    <p><p>It took me more time than it should have to find any media celebrating the fact that Georgia had posted several days with ZERO deaths recently, including yesterday. I found a couple articles from a tiny paper in little old Augusta, Georgia and a website for a paper in Chattanooga, TENNESSEE (?). If you don't believe the media is biased and being used to spread fear and dismay, you are a fool. It's time for us all to wake up and spread the news loudly. Send emails with the links to everything you've found to everyone you know, especially family. Would you rather live under permanent lockdowns and surveillance or have a few of your crazy family and friends make fun of you but be able to go back to living life? Social chastisement is nothing compared to living as a caged beast. If you believe in the slippery slope, you need to fight however you can right now.</p>

<p>Why did I have to go to paper from Tennessee?</p>

        <p>Dude, they are very clearly suppressing their numbers.  The UK B117 variant has been in exponential growth since late January and is ravaging some of the more rural areas right now.  Personally, I've known more people to be sick and in the hospital with Covid right now than at any other point in the pandemic. </p>
<p>MASSIVE /s</p>
<p>Went up to The Battery this weekend to watch the final four and the Braves game.  I put my name down for 2 people at 3 different restaurants and the waits were so long I literally never got a table anywhere - just never even got a text that a table was ready.  Ended up just having to walk down to the Waffle House.  Also played some beer pong at Live! and didn't see a mask the whole time.  Good weekend.</p>

        <p>I know, I love going to Chattanooga; cool little city. Just annoyed that I couldn't find anything remotely positive from 11Alive or Fox 5 ATL instead of from a small town in another state...</p>

        <p>Gotcha. Yeah, doesn’t surprise me that most media is deliberately avoiding facts to spread a narrative. That’s been their MO for as long as I can remember</p>
