    <strong>Do You Think This BS will End After the Election?</strong>
    <p><p>Kinda conspiracy theory-ish here but hear me out. There are multiple theories on how this lockdown will end up. A psychic Sylvia Browne predicted the Corona virus in 2008, and she says that the virus will appear and disappear just as quickly as it started in November (Election time.) Never returning until ten years later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/03/FactCheckSylviaBrowneEndOfDays.png?resize=865,452&amp;quality=65">Sylvia Browne‚Äôs Prediction</a></p>
<p>However, there is talk about how the lockdown will usher in the new world order and make society into a 1984 world.</p>
<p>I honestly see both sides, I hope the first theory is true. I‚Äôm not ready to live life like Winston. But I honestly can see how the second theory can happen. Nobody is protesting this, people are just complying. They‚Äôve already taken our freedom away little by little disguising it as ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù. Newspeak, the thought polices are Google, YouTube, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirus/">r/coronavirus</a>, Reddit, etc. The handkerchief that shows your alliance with big brother is the masks. The exercises that are supposed to keep Winston healthy in the book actually gives him damaging effects, are similar to masks which are unhealthy for you. If it isn‚Äôt going to be a 1984 world then this is a test to see how far the government can push people and their freedoms until they revolt.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>Honestly why is THIS election year so different to distract us? 2016, 2012, 2008, 2004, and 2000 wasn‚Äôt this crazy.</p></p>

        <p>In terms of the election it depends.  Now I‚Äôm not American but if Trump wins I think he‚Äôll at least resist some of the policies. If Biden wins then it‚Äôll be more pro doomer policies and draconian laws</p>

        <p>Trump doesn't care about anything but himself. He doesn't care about the Constitution - nor do the Democrats. He doesn't care about lockdowns. None of it. He could be pretty firm about how un-Constitutional this is but it was all WH advisories that pushed for it.</p>

        <p>For all intents and purposes, yes. It won‚Äôt go away completely, but politics is the main driver of the lockdown hysteria in my view. </p>
<p>Not to get off topic, but with regards to Sylvia‚Äôs other prediction regarding the 2010 outbreak of a  ‚Äúfunguslike flesh eating bacteria‚Äù resistant to all know antibiotics and only susceptible to a ‚Äúcombination of electric currents and heat,‚Äù I think she kinda missed the mark.</p>

        <p>On one hand I think this is all about the election and everything will disappear from the media in November, whether Trump or Biden get elected because lockdowns hurt everyone even though it may temporarily hurt Trump.</p>
<p>On the other hand, how does this explain international hysteria? Are they following the US just because? Or do they have their own reasons too?</p>

        <p>I've been in the minority, clearly, in thinking this will absolutely not abate whatsoever after the election. I think Biden will decree his mask mandate, lockdowns will become even harsher, and Democrats, drunk on their power, will just continue their draconian policies into the indefinite future. I honestly do not understand this "It's all about the election" theory. It just doesn't add up.</p>

        <p>Well I honestly think this is a ploy from China to have us running around like headless chickens especially during the election year. Russia already did that in 2016 successfully but not as destructive as this. China has their foot on the W.H.O.'s necks, and the W.H.O. kisses China's ass in return. China and Bill Gates are also hand in hand. Fauci is PAID BY BILL GATES (Explains the flip-flopping, the non-sense from the W.H.O. and Fauci) This virus was man-made from China, a woman scientist wanted to cross AIDS with SARS, she was about to test on a human subject. (She tested on primates similar to humans.) however, corona got exposed to a lab assistant in Wuhan. The lab assistant is patient zero, and her files and pictures are deleted on the Wuhan lab site. If the virus was tested on primates further, this would've been more deadlier than it is now I'm thinking. </p>
<p>This virus is bio-warfare from China to shake up America. </p>
<p>All of this is proven in a documentary YouTube and Google keep deleting.</p>

        <p>What is the name of the documentary? I am into conspiracists and have heard some people talk about this prediction of the virus leaving and returning in 10 years. That would fit in with the whole agenda 2030 depopulation theory. It would be nice to have ten more years to prepare and enjoy life.</p>

        <p>If Trump wins, I'd like to think they can't keep this up for another 4 years, but I also thought that about Russia.</p>
<p>If Biden wins, I'm not sure which side they take. Do they stop doing this to not tank his economic record, or do they keep doing this in order to gain more control? He would gladly support a national mask mandate, lockdown, and whatever is next. Not that Trump will necessarily be great on that end either, but he is at least resisting.</p>

        <p>I am hoping if Trump wins and doesn't have to worry about re-election, he can take the gloves off. I have no faith Biden will do anything to end this. He probably doesn't even know what is going on and will do whatever his handlers tell him to do.</p>

        <p>I am a bit of the 'other side' doomer in that no, I do not think this will go away until next year or a bit longer.</p>
<p>It's all about control and power. The governments won't take that away. 1984 world? No, but I think a lot of people want that and it is clear many in the public do too.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it certainly <em>feels</em> like this is where it's headed.</p>
<p>I keep seeing cancellations into 2021 at this point. At the very least, even if it all "goes away" in November, we will still have to deal with the fall-out from this. Though I posted a document from Washington state a few days ago that had their government officials state this will continue into early 2021 or even 2022 depending on certain factors.</p>

        <p>This is a good question, and something I have been thinking about a bit today.   </p>
<p>First and foremost, the lock-downs are about Trump.  It has become political and it is all about making Trump look inefficient and weak. Watch 30 seconds of Rachel Maddow to see this in action. </p>
<p>On a broader, holistic scale,  I think this is about the reassertion of "reason" over anti-intellectualism --&rt;  Coronoavirus represents a way for the left to reassert the domain of the specialists, the educated, and the informed.  Impeachment did not work, so now we have to continue the push to demonize Trump and everything he stands for.  </p>
<p>But secondarily, I think this is also not about Trump.  I really think Coronavirus is the straw that broke the neo-liberal back (or brain) of capitalism.  For the past 30+ years the world has hung on the knife edge of global capital.  Coronavirus has demonstrated quite succinctly  that global capitalism cannot "deliver the goods."  Instead of providing quality medical care, a base standard of living, and social support, almost every government has chosen to impose draconian lock-downs designed to isolate and blame the victims of the virus.  </p>
<p>And... there is no end in site.  I keep puzzling that there have been many, many instances for governments to walk back the lock downs, BLM protests being the most prime example.  Even as deaths begin to fall, hospitals not reach capacity, and stores adopting masks (all of which can allow plausible cover to return to normal), governments have increased the rhetoric over "cases," "vaccines," destroying the virus 100% - or else...more lock-downs. </p>
<p>Why? Because this is the only option.  Instead of investing in hospitals and medical workers to address a shortage of hospital space, we build field hospitals that don't see a single patient.  We blame people not wearing masks to the beach, but insist the meat-packers go to work. We allow Harris Teeter to stay open with elderly cashiers, but close schools where kids have little chance of infection. But.... if we did the opposite, we would admit it has all been folly. </p>
<p>So, no, I don't think this will end based on a political change (which is super depressing).</p>

        <p>Trump barely won in 2016. Electorally victory looked large but in reality he won by 77k total votes split over 3 states. In order for him to win again he would need to keep all 3. Pennsylvania most likely gone. That alone turns it into a loss..... and I don't think he can flip any other states..... do you?</p>

        <p>Essentially another WHO fronted organisation. 
For what I was referring to see; page 39, second point of progress indicators of this GPMB annual report</p>
<p>https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_Annual_Report_English.pdf</p>
<p>This was signed off by 196 countries.
They agreed to run 2 live exercises by September 2020</p>

        <p>Hm, I see. What does the document say that indicates this ends in September? Just curious.</p>

        <p>Can you explain this further? Was this a farce to see how the world would react to a ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù pandemic?</p>

        <p>I don't think so. I mean, I guess there's an element of that but I think it's more about financing and setting up the infrastructure for a global technocracy. </p>
<p>If you look at what the world economic forum has been promoting lately with "the great reset", it seems to makes sense. Klaus Schwab says it himself that the pandemic is a perfect opportunity to reset the world.</p>
<p>Then you look at event 201 which was hosted by the WEC and realise that this isn't really about a virus</p>
