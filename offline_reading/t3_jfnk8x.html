        <p>I think a lot of people are afraid to talk. I can tell you I’ve been flying consistently during this time and each flight is more and more full. The airport is more and more crowded and shops are open inside unlike before. </p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve seen is that many people are clearly on vacation. First time I flew in April it was all adults looking like they were probably doing something fairly essential. Now it’s full families with shopping bags from touristy shops (I live in a vacation destination) and they have that ‘I’m on vacation’ vibe (can’t really describe it but you know what I mean). People are much more relaxed and the whole thing feels different. </p>
<p>Believe me, you friends are going on vacation but they just aren’t posting about it anymore.</p>

        <p>My aunt is a health journalist that formerly worked for a reputable newspaper in Canada.  I hear nothing but how severe the threat of covid is and how much we should fear it.  Both her kids, aged 12 and 17, are petrified of going anywhere.  There is never any discussion about how the response has devastated so many people and how the cure has been worse than the disease.  What I see from her is what I see from many 'journalists' - an opportunity to publish.  An opportunity to be in the limelight and get on this covid train and be a part of something.  I don't even bring it up anymore; I actively steer the conversation away from covid because I love my aunt and her kids.</p>

        <p>I have an actual affinity for her, our personalities click.  I can talk and laugh with her.  She's my godmother and my blood.

        <p>Good question. As most people have nothing to say when doing smalltalk and this is what is going on in everyone's life, yes I do. I say: "so how do you cope with the measures?". Pretty innocent. They all say they hated them but they also all said they thought it was necessary. They all asked me what I thought, I say I hate them and they are not necessary. Then the debate starts.
One went out of his way to listen to me to then try prove me wrong. He only listened to contradict me. He was very self-righteous and tried to make me look bad, intentionally misinterpreted what I said for which I corrected him, because only uncorrected it fit into his narrative of a corona denier. I was more versed so he tried even ad hominem. Pretty pathetic when I think back. What did he have to gain from this?</p>
<p>My point of view is: It starts innocent and then people try to drag me into this mud catching competition of pro &amp; against measures. And all I care about is unity among people againt the measures. But people prefer dissing each other instead of working together. Must be a first world problem, IDK.</p>

        <p>That could indicate they are not ready to discuss the matter. You will have much better success by waiting for someone else to bring it up because they will be more receptive to your views. Otherwise, they will just go on the defensive and it will be counter productive.</p>

        <p>What did you talk about last year? </p>
<p>I've learned that one should never discuss politics and regligion in most circumstances, especially with strangers, because they become heated debates.</p>
<p>In general, neutral topics such as the birds and the weather are ice breakers.</p>

        <p>try rewording your intro to something along the lines of "I don't see the point" or "I don't think they have done anything" these are a lot less antagonistic so people wont get defensive. after that point out the success of Sweden and say you wish you could have a similar solution. this will keep you out of any arguments and plant the seed of doubt in lockdowns in the others mind</p>

        <p>&rt; these are a lot less antagonistic so people wont get defensive.</p>
<p>My POV is that I am against measures, not the people I talk to. Unless they identify with the measures, I don't make them my enemy.</p>
<p>But it makes sense that they identify, otherwise they'd just go. "Interesting how our views differ on this topic. Did you see X recently on TV? etc."</p>

        <p>Most of the people I associate with I already convinced to be at least mildly against(70% turned angry by themselves, i keep sending them pictures of media scaremongering and stuff) Even some of my friends who are doctors we were at the bar with 15 people singing a satirical song praising our national healthcare.</p>
<p>I just like to remind them that they can follow the rules all they like. Covid is not going anywhere, stop asking for your freedom back and take it back.</p>
<p>Who is doing this to you? The government is doing it. I like to remind them of it: </p>
<p>" and if it is up to the government no NYE for you. 104 year old needs 1 month extra lifetime so say goodbye to whatever life you wanted to live for another year.</p>
<p>Are you going to roll over and take it?"</p>
<p>Most people won't oppose that directly but they will neglect the rules when they can.</p>
<p>It does help that I am publicly against and very loudly. Not ashamed at all. People have called me all sorts of things but all I do is laugh. I openly joke about how I completely violate the rules and that my dance moves are actually lethal according to my government.</p>
<p>I was at a party that made international news last week and I like to make jokes about it.</p>
<p>Be open about your complete disregard. Yes you will turn people off, but the people that remain will respect you for it.</p>
<p>I like to ask people when will you say this is enough?  Where will you draw the line?</p>
<p>I do however sort of keep distance in public places. Just out of courtesy. But no parties? Fuck that. Respect for corona as in no jokes? Fuck that this whole situation is so horrible it is ungodly hilarious.</p>
<p>Meeting places? I struggle with it too. I just loudly voice discontent with complete disregard for people who I offend and I just see who remains. The people that are offended will be offended but some people will laugh at my jokes. This I do at bars. </p>
<p>I will start small like when I petted someone's dog and he said it was very tame</p>
<p>"Like covid?"</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>

        <p>Your attitude is inspiring. The question is, does it work because you are repetitive or because you use a certain rhethoric that clicks with people?</p>

        <p>Hmmm. With people that I know seemingly well I usually try to convince them.</p>
<p>Not immediately but in steps I break down the narrative. Never go full the whole policy is bullshit, point out the inconsistencies and the actual insanity and work your way from there. Make jokes about how you feel the alcohol ban is not going far enough and the government should see to it that you eat your brussel sprouts. </p>
<p>I am pretty persuasive. If I know people well I make jokes to tear down walls and combine that with reasoning. I am pretty repetitive but I mostly target them when a new insane thing happens and then I make jokes and memes about it. They will be susceptible when that happens. Otherwise they get very grumpy. A lot of people will never admit that they do not support it anymore but they will break more and more rules. Reasoning works but not as effective on everyone only on very logical people that do not mind being contrarian. After all the propaganda and fear mongering there is a lot of programming to break down.</p>
<p>Even when they do not join you you are turning them. You smash their fortitude as in they might be saying they are in favour but being confronted with all the ridiculousness will take their toll and subconciously they will slowly turn. </p>
<p>That is the power of humour. They lax up. They can't be zealous anymore, or they will be as a joke. When you get them to laugh, you win.</p>
<p>For ordinary people jokes and memes work really well especially when you time it when the government does something insane again (for people you know).</p>
<p>But people I do not know that well I am not convincing them I make jokes and show how I am not in the doomer camp. The people that feel the same will talk to me approach me, or use humor in return. I try to emit to people in bars and such that I think everything is hilarious. </p>
<p>A lot of people do this. I was in a store few days ago and someone said enjoy it while it lasts when I was eating a hotdog (another partial lockdown was coming up) and I said I will. "I can't wait to eat a hotdog again here nexy year."</p>
<p>Loads of people are tired and feel gaslighted. Make jokes.</p>
<p>Humor is what is lacking. If comedians made jokes we would be well out of this. They can't also become very mad either, as the situation really is kind of hilarious sometimes.</p>
<p>A friend of mine got tested and I visited my grandmother recently. He tested positive and I was telling him that I am against the measures but he did not have to validate the importance of the measures so clearly by actually murdering my grandma himself.</p>
<p>Also we were playing cod warzone and I was wondering if my grandmother would also get a second chance in the gulag. That also tore some people up.</p>
<p>Or when I pondered whether my KD in cod is as high as my real life KD with the party I attended recently.</p>
<p>Clearly I hope I do not spread the virus indirectly to people who succumb but it did transfer the ridiculousness of attributing these deaths to me while just doing completely mundane things quite well. </p>
<p>My grandmother is fine btw</p>

        <p>I can relate. Medias headlines and pictures may affect people too. Many looks dramatic because of that's what sells.</p>
