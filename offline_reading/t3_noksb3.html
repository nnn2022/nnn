    <strong>"If you don't want the vaccine, you should reconsider your desire to serve in the Army." - Colonel Fuckface</strong>
    <p><p>I'm currently at an event called Advanced Camp at Fort Knox, which is an event used to measure people's leadership abilities to determine if and how they will commission into the Army. About 8,500 cadets will attend this summer. For reference, I've also been in the Guard for about 2.5 years.</p>
<p>We've been in processing for the past few days, and received a couple briefs today. They had stations set up to allow cadets to receive the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, and anyone who is vaccinated can remove their masks. Those who are not have to wear their masks, even when they are in the field carrying 60 pounds of gear in the summer heat and humidity. I was seriously considering getting the vaccine just so I didn't have to suffer in the heat.</p>
<p>That all changed though at our brief. One of the colonels in charge (very senior officer for non-military folk) told us that the vaccine was available. He also said if we hadn't gotten the vaccine for medical reasons, that's fine. If we hadn't gotten it because we wanted to give other Americans a chance to get it first, that was also fine.</p>
<p>However, this absolute cocksucker then said that if we hadn't gotten the vaccine because we wanted to use millions of other Americans, including children, as guinea pigs, then we should reconsider serving in the Army.</p>
<p>I have legitimate concerns about the safety of this vaccine, as do many others, and this man equated us to cowards. At the end, he told us that if we didn't end up getting the vaccine, we probably weren't fit for the Army. The vast majority of my battalion in the Guard (several hundred soldiers) refused the vaccine, so according to this man, they are all unfit for service.</p>
<p>So yeah. Here's my welcome to officer life. I should have stayed enlisted. If you're thinking about serving, I urge you to think carefully. The Army doesn't care about you.</p>
<p>Bonus story: A kid got the vaccine after being guilt-tripped by the colonel, and within a half hour had a terrible headache.</p></p>

        <p>It wasn't even screamed at us, just a matter-of-fact brief. It was honestly scary how nonchalant it seemed, like comparing unvaccinated people to monsters is normal.</p>

<p>It's not the vaccination numbers we are looking for. I think we are looking for a specific response from the vaccine.</p>

<p>But, I'm thinking we haven't seen the reaction that's being looked for. I think this is the reason the negative side effects had to stop being suppressed.</p>

        <p>So, even Biden's military hasn't yet required service members to be vaccinated (afaik), you can refuse you are just limited to what you are able to do. It's the tone and rhetoric that's the difference. </p>
<p>And yes, I fully believe that Trump would not be requiring vaccines or even pushing them to the military.</p>

        <p>Yes sir. I thought about rejoining a few years ago but the way things are there's no way I'm going to rejoin. Our politicians are corrupt and the people don't give two fucks about what the military deals with. Viewed as less-than and expendable.  I'm not putting myself on the line for all that.</p>

        <p>My parents met in the Army and were both deployed to the first Gulf War. They were exposed to depleted uranium and literally used as guinea pigs for experimental anthrax vaccines. They have both suffered from many symptoms of Gulf War Illness ever since they got back home. They had me a couple years after the came home and I was born with an extremely rare genetic bone disease. Gulf war veterans had a significantly higher rate of children with genetic conditions than average. So now my legs have broken so many times they’re permanently crossed, I live in constant pain and every bone in the left side of my skull is riddled with bone tumors. I had to have a surgery where they cut the tumorous tissue out of my sinuses because I couldn’t breathe through my nose anymore</p>

        <p>Well.. We’re going to need you on the right side of history when they start putting families in camps because they’re a threat to public health. It will happen, and there will be plenty of people fighting to the death. Hopefully some righteous soldiers will be left to fend off the next holocaust.</p>

        <p>How can you say he didnt come up with the decision to support it himself? Just like you decided to not support it based on the resources you found. How is you saying he's a bad leader for his views any better than him saying you're a bad soldier for yours?</p>
<p>And if he believes the vaccine is safe why wouldnt he want all his soldiers to have it so they can be safe? And if you, as it is in his optics, choose not to get the vaccine and thereby put your fellow soldiers at risk then he is in his rights to think you are not fit to be a soldier.</p>
<p>And i realise you may not agree with him having this oppinion of covid and the vaccine but how can you say you want a free thinker and condemn them for their own choices? </p>

        <p>&rt;I have legitimate concerns about the safety of this vaccine, as do many others, and this man equated us to cowards.</p>
<p>Let me let you in on a secret. They expect when they say charge a hill you will do it. They expect that you will follow orders when given without question. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>Your fear rational or not means nothing. The order is get your shot. As far as the brass is concerned you are watching your fellow soldiers charge a hill and bitching you might get hurt.</p>

        <p>That’s how I took this as well. At this point in my life I think I ask too many questions to make a good soldier. If you’re in the service, you have to just follow orders and be on the frontline taking whatever risks you are ordered to without question. I don’t agree with it, but I get how that willingness to set aside ones own self interest would make for a good soldier.</p>

        <p>Leaving ROTC in college was a great decision for me. Did 6 years enlisted as a linguist, and had a blast for the entire time. If I had enlisted at a younger age I probably would have thought about going the distance,  it getting out around 30 was the right call for me. Regardless, best 6 years of my life. I’m also super glad I got out though, given what a shit show the service is evolving into now.</p>

        <p>Anybody in the Army should know they have a terrible time recruiting kids in good physical shape because almost every one is at least overweight. So any Army guy willing to risk his life in battle but not have a vaccine deserves some respect and not shaming or we might end up having to learn Chinese quite soon.</p>

        <p>I can't wrap my head around the way complete dehumanization and ad hominem have become the default for such a large faction. It's degrading to the social fabric.</p>
<p>edit: replied top level by accident. Some of his wording sounds intentionally reversed. Claim you want to give the vaccine to other Americans first. It comes across as though he was being intentionally reductive.</p>

        <p>Currently I'm the only officer in my entire BN who has chosen to not get a  vaccine. I've been called a grandma killer by a superior and harassed. I'm not being bullied into taking it and told my superiors as much. There's a lot of weak leadership who need to convince themselves that they're doing the right thing by attempting to force this on their units for briefing numbers.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you're thinking about serving, I urge you to think carefully. The Army doesn't care about you.</p>
<p>Lol. Veteran here. What kind of entitled crybaby are you? Of course the Army doesn't care about you - it cares about mission readiness. When you signed that paperwork and put your hand up, you gave the Army the go ahead to treat you as a government asset. That's why it's called "service;" shitty pay, volunteering to put yourself in harms way, and being told what to do - including with your body.</p>
<p>Really, you're an Officer? Big lol.</p>

        <p>Then you have the opportunity to go to your Commander as a conscientious objector and request a discharge for your objection to follow a lawful order. There's an entire process for this. Are you really a fucking officer? </p>
<p>And big lol, I'm a veteran - meaning, I'm no longer in. I left because I decided I didn't want the government telling me what to do anymore - 10+ years was enough. But at least I can acknowledge that when you're in the military, you aren't a fucking person - you're an asset. Whether you like, think you signed up for that, or not - that's the truth.</p>
<p>The government injected me with all sorts of vaccines over the years. I didn't bitch about it because I knew what I signed up for. That's why it's called service. </p>
<p>So yes, either stop acting like an entitled crybaby - or get the paperwork rolling on that discharge. Because the Army doesn't give a fuck about your feelings. </p>
<p>LOL...."officer." Get the fuck out of here.</p>

        <p>Never said I was an officer I'm pretty sure you have me mixed up with someone else or your reading comprehension needs work.</p>
<p>I also got out years ago for the same reasons. </p>
<p>I hear your side but your willingness to get jabbed with shit just because you signed a paper is strange to me.  I got jabbed too but not by anything that seemed like such a rush job as COVID so if I was in current Soldiers position I would consider strongly opting out of service and taking my discharge.  Not worth it in the end. Especially for this government/country now.</p>

        <p>I thought you were OP. He or she is a new officer. </p>
<p>&rt;I hear your side but your willingness to get jabbed with shit just because you signed a paper is strange to me</p>
<p>Did you read the paper you or anyone else signed, or remember the part of the oath about obeying orders, etc...?</p>
<p>There's a lot of things I was unwilling to do in the military and I'm sure you were too, but the difference between "I'm unwilling to do this, therefore I will seek my discharge," versus "I'm unwilling to do this, but I have to if I wish to continue serving," versus "I'm unwilling to do this, so I'll anonymously vent on Reddit for pity and ultimately comply," isn't really a fine line.</p>
<p>Nobody in the military is forced to have a vaccination. Nobody will hold anyone down and stick a needle in their arm. However, refusing to receive a vaccine would make any service member not mission ready. Lots of things make service members not mission ready such as failing a PT test.</p>
<p>That's not Kool aid, that's the actual terminology. And when someone is not mission ready - then they go down the road of dozens of possible outcomes. If you don't like the government telling you what to do 24/7, then don't serve in the military. Pretty simple. Clearly, you get it as you also got out. </p>
<p>So yeah, OP is an entitled crybaby that will likely do nothing but accept his/her vaccine and bitch about it on Reddit, thinking the Army owes him/her something when that's never been the case for me, you, or anybody else serving. I stand by my original comment.</p>

        <p>I think I am right along the same thinking as you, honestly.  I was active for over 10 years as well and enjoyed it for the most part. Didn't bitch when my number was up for deployments. Rarely would I complain because if you look at situations objectively you generally see the logic behind.</p>
<p>I just have an issue with THIS vaccine and how the COL went about his speech because it was optional.  If it's mandated then take the route you want to as a Soldier.  However, guilting Soldiers into taking an optional vaccine is coercion to me.  </p>
<p>That's why I had an issue with it and can see why OP had a problem with it.  I'll take my mandated shots and small pox and all that bullshit because it was mandated and has been around.  This vax isn't even fda approved and has quite a controversy surrounding it regarding side effects.  I'm not on the boat of just injecting that type of shit into Soldiers for something so trivial as COVID.</p>
<p>Do your thing though. Neither one of us have to worry about that shit now.</p>

        <p>We get jabbed in the arm a dozen other times and a yearly flu vaccine and this is the one thing that triggers you. Seriously the only thing that is keeping the army from making it mandatory is that’s it’s currently not FDA approved yet which means they can’t enforce soldiers and DoD employees to take it yet but give it a 2-3 months and as soon as it is it’s going to be routine like any other vaccine.</p>
<p>Don’t want the vax fine then wear a mask for now for your battle buddies sake. Also we’re not guinea pigs do you really believe that if there was any risk of affecting combat readiness the force would be pushing this hard for everyone to get the shot?</p>
