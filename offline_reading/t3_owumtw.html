        <p><strong>Submission Statement</strong><br>
There's a conspiracy to downplay injuries and deaths resulting from the COVID vaccines. Most of these adverse reactions are being treated as background events. After reporting their symptoms to doctors and health authorities, many vaccine patients are being dismissed, labelled as misinformed, and censored from sharing their experiences on social media.  </p>
<p>The public is being constantly bombarded with the same messages: people fall ill or die every day (so it must be coincidental), "COVID vaccines are safe and effective" and "vaccines are the only way to end lockdowns". Perhaps health authorities should invent a new disease to explain away the excess adverse reactions. Wait, I just happen to have a new disease ready to go...  </p>
<p>P.S. I hope health authorities start taking their public health responsibilities seriously. They need to acknowledge, diagnose and adequately treat ALL patients affected by COVID vaccine injuries. They also need to investigate both vaccine safety, and efficacy.</p>

        <p>Have you read the SPARS Pandemic Exercise from John Hopkins? It was performed in 2017 and the timeline of it almost exactly matches our current situation: https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html</p>
<p>Based on corrective timing, we about at the point where vaccine side effects start to be publicized. This is obvious through the videos that are increasingly being shared on social media, and the influx of go fund me pages for vaccine side effects. </p>
<p>It also places the end of the “pandemic” in late 2022, which Bill Gates himself said was the most realistic date for return of normal.</p>
