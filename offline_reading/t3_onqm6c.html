    <strong>Vaccine Endgame</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, I just wanted to get peoples opinion on the topic of what the end game is for pursuing the vaccine. Pharmaceutical companies are not altruistic beings and the government is trying everything they can to shove this down everyone throats, but what do they actually gain from everyone being vaccinated? I see how they have seized more control with regards to vaccine passports/records, but is there some other goal they are trying to achieve?</p></p>

        <p>Look, this might come off as stupid to you but the fact that these restrictions and requirements to utilize a system where you need to show identification just to go inside a grocery store and buy food is straight out of the Bible, Revelation 13.  And sure, not all of the world is apart of it now, but soon, I am sure that it will affect the whole world.  Has anything gone back to normal?  No.  Has vaccination proved to be the solution of the pandemic?  No.  The world is caught in a never-ending loop to vaccinate and lockdown with every spike in cases.  Nothing like this has ever happened with the flu.</p>
<p>Do you honestly believe that with the medical and scientific technology to be able to save people from dying of cancer that we couldn’t save them from COVID-19?  Of course we could!  But that’s not it’s purpose this time.</p>
<p>My friend, we are nearing close to the end, and everyone who is paying attention is feeling that anxiety in their chest right now.  The world is in chaos: natural disasters, nations divided against themselves over what to do in this difficult situation.</p>
<p>The Great Deception in the Bible is using fear to control the entire world.  And look how much has changed in such a short time.</p>
<p>I pray for your health, I pray for you to have a sound mind, I pray that you understand that there is no lie in what I say here.  I only ask that you, first, acknowledge that you, like me, are a sinner, have sinned, and have fallen short of the glory of God.  Second, accept the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ’s sacrifice on the cross and believe in your heart that he was raised from the dead.  Third, Call upon the name of the Lord and you  will be saved.  It’s that simple.</p>
<p>A final note: as I was driving home from work, someone left a vinyl sign on a bridge that said: “Woe to you, Babylon.”  We have only a short time left.</p>

        <p>Spot on. I hope you’re not right…but I think you are. Everything about my intuition/gut feeling says we are past the point of no return. Just a matter of time before the “beast system” becomes worldwide. They have to destroy the current system to usher in their Great Reset/NWO.</p>
<p>But have no fear, those who stand with God are on the winning side. He’s already told us how this is going to play out. Not saying it’s going to be easy - because it most definitely won’t be. But even Satan knows he’s already been defeated.</p>

        <p>It's not the Mark. The Bible is very clear: the Beast is revealed first. No Beast, no Mark. We don't want to get into the habit of calling this one wrong (like we did the Apocalypse...), because when the real Mark shows up no-one will believe us.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely right.  There’s no mark yet.  The beast must come first.  But what I have come to understand concerning the Revelation is that the mark in their right hand and in the forehead means: through their actions and what they believe.  You already know those who follow Christ by their actions and what they believe.  No one whose heart belongs to Jesus will participate in that worldwide system.</p>

        <p>I think the elites truly think they are invincible and trying to force God’s hand. The beast is meant to expose the pandemic hoax and get people to pledge allegiance to him. It is then God is forced to intervene. </p>
<p>For now we are on the right side, but if someone comes out of nowhere, exposes the hoax, and asks for unwavering allegiance, we need to remain steadfast against him.</p>

        <p>I'm not a Christian but I've wondered about this scenario - a person comes out and denounces this New Normal garbage, maybe even does a lot of other good things, brings people together against the global consortium - but then rules as an evil dictator.</p>
<p>This could happen more locally too - the "pendulum" might swing back hard against global fascism and be replaced in some countries by a more traditional kind of fascist (could be race based, could be religious based).</p>

        <p>I think that the goal is to have everyone vaccinated I order to force everyone to have a vaccine card. Since the card is so easily forged, they'll switch to an electronic version. Without this pass, it'll limit where people can go and shop. For our "convenience" , it'll become a digital chip - so they can track us. We'll have an online identity that we absolutely can't delete. I've read an article where in future booster shots, they're looking to include a bioluminescent tattoo or QR code type of thing? Later, also for our convenience, we'll eventually be able to link Apple pay and whatnot. Without this tattoo, people won't be able to buy or sell anything. Which is why the vaccine is considered the mark of the beast by the religious, because that is how the mark is described in the Bible. It may not be the mark now, but it's assumed this will lead to it. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.</p>

        <p>Well, we <em>know</em> the 'vax pass' systems aren't about health. If they were, natural antibodies and negative tests would be acceptable. They aren't. We also know that spike protein vaccines become obsolete as other proteins mutate, requiring 'boosters' to remain effective.</p>
<p>So, what are we left with? A world where continually taking these 'boosters' will be required to buy, sell, travel, and socialise. It's a social credit system, based around the same planned obsolescence that makes you get a new iPhone every three years.</p>

        <p>The elites aren’t stupid.  They know everyone isn’t going to get vaccinated.  So anyone claiming that vaccinating the whole population is the end game is being short sighted.</p>
<p>People like us are an easily predictable resistance.</p>
<p>I think the resistance is too high to force vaccinations as well.  What I do see happening is increasing division and furthering the slippery slope.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come and it will come via more events like this.  But covid can’t do it on its own.</p>

        <p>Social Credit Score Worldwide, linked to your "Health Passport" and a Bank Account. You will also NEED an immunity booster shot every 6 months just to survive, as your immune system is something they'd love to get rid of. Now think of all the wonderful things this system gives to (((the Elite))).</p>
<p>Climate Lockdown is already being discussed, you buy too much beef? The system will track it and tax you more for "ruining our planet".
