    <strong>Just quit my job/got fired?</strong>
    <p><p>Kind of all over the place with my jumbled thoughts - I just gotta write. </p>
<p>My boss was letting it slide about me not wearing a mask but now she says I officially need to be wearing a mask. I said I cant do it. Oh and everyone thinks I'm selfish too now. It's so obvious it's not about safety. Weak people gonna succumb to societal pressure I guess. A blessing in disguise because you are who you surround yourself with and I do not want to be what they are. </p>
<p>Anyone who would give my boss shit about having an unmasked employee she could easily tell to fuck off. What is the point of being a business owner if you're still gonna let shit step all over you? One of the perks of being your own boss means that no one can really tell you shit. </p>
<p>If you gotta do something all day everyday that makes you feel stupid or silly, that will wear you down. Not sustainable.</p>
<p>What's up with small business owners tho tryna act more insane than corporations?  Its interesting, most small business have been more strict on masks, etc. Even saying I have a medical expemption, small stores have refused to serve me. Yet the big box stores I have no problem walking in without a mask. </p>
<p>People really gotta start saying no. We are the majority. </p>
<p>Since off the top of my head there isn't a business around me that seems to be owned by strong normal people, I'm gonna pray I can get my freelance graphic design and other odd jobs up and running to be sufficient enough. I think being my own boss may be the only option. </p>
<p>I feel good for getting out of a toxic situation and standing up for what I believe in, but man does confrontation, feeling judged and letting people down suck ass. Anxiety and stress commence now but so does freedom. Ying and yang</p></p>

        <p>Nice one, I too quit my job I was a prison officer's and I saw the effects of lockdown and stuff before it came to the UK. It was a like phycological experiment and mental health, suicides and self harm went through the roof... The prisonere are locked up 23hrs a day atm. I just didn't understand how if the UK goes into lockdown the samething is going to happen.</p>
<p>Also I agree with you why are the small business bending over backwards, it's literally there blood sweat and tears and there just letting themselves die.</p>

        <p>I've been wearing a mask for work too and it's fucking toss, but they've got alot of us by our balls because of the cash.</p>
<p>In the first lockdown the only thing open were food shops, I repair equipment in said shops, travelling to up to 8 sites a day, didn't wear a mask or gloves or change any habits for the first three months, have been seeing my family and friends all the way through it, and guess what... everybody is fine.</p>
<p>It's a scam and I feel sorry for the people who are fanatical about it.</p>

        <p>Good luck. I think you did the right thing, but now begins the real hussle. Same fate is probably waiting for me soon. They tightened the mask mandates since last time I was at work. I'm not gonna go along with the more tighter shit, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Very true. But this will only make me stronger. I have skills and am confident on the other avenues of making money, plus my end goal in life anyway is to own my own business with my boyfriend so the general entrepreneurialism drive helps.</p>
<p>My job didn't make me wear a mask when the state issued the mandate, but since the city recently made their own mandate, that's when shit changed. Good luck to you as well!</p>

<p>I think it’s very possible there was some sort of actual virus, but it’s been blown out of all god damn proportion and the world has gone insane over inflated numbers and an absolute bombardment of fear based propaganda. </p>
<p>Don’t really understand why you felt the need to message me first, but I actually responded a genuine answer to what you said and you randomly track down a comment and throw abuse at me? Considering you called me a troll in the message, that sounds pretty troll like to me..</p>

        <p>There were people in Nazi Germany that stood up to the regime. They felt pretty bad too. However, they could not turn their backs on the truth. The ONLY one you answer to is yourself. When this all blows over, you will be able to sleep well at night knowing that you were true to yourself, and you were RIGHT as well! In years to come, many will PRETEND that they weren't mask Nazis, but you will have the proof that you stood up for the truth. You can then ask/challenge 'em: "how many jobs did *you* lose for standing up for human rights?"</p>

        <p>In terms of businesses I suspect it has to do with business insurance to a degree. I’m sure these places are being told they cannot operate without these guidelines. Telling an employee that complains about not wearing a mask would be going against the grain and public optics. It does not surprise me it went this way.</p>

        <p>Yes, in a way. </p>
<p>I work in insurance. What we’re finding is that before carriers are willing to quote, they want a full report/rundown on covid measures for employees and customers if applicable. If a business does not have measures the insurance company deems sufficient, unfortunately they won’t quote and it becomes difficult to place insurance.</p>

        <p>To address the small business vs big box, this is by design IMO. With the exception of Costco. So most small businesses are pretty much screwed now no matter what, I think they are grasping at whatever will keep them open and they fear the masks, social distancing etc will be why they failed instead of seeing what their government is doing to them. Not to say some aren’t now seeing the truth. Big box stores have made so much profit and gotten so rich and they know this is bullshit so sure you can still come give them your money, however, I believe once all competition is gone that will change.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I think there's multiple factors at play to destroy small business by design. In my city riots and arson broke out near the end of summer and the area where all the small businesses were destroyed, they're now making plans to essentially gentrify. People who want to rebuild their businesses there are pretty much being turned away because they want to give the space to high end developers instead. </p>
<p>They def want us to rely on Amazon and Walmart as our infrastructure</p>

        <p>I don’t agree with the sentiment thrown around on this sub that business owners can just “not comply.”</p>
<p>What is this idea that being a business owner means “no one can tell you shit.”  As a business owner I am way more beholden to various entities than an employee.  The department of health, department of revenue, the IRS, department of planning, the city, the county, the chamber of commerce, the landlord, the department of licensing, the insurance company, the department of labor (or worker’s comp), the fire Marshall, any partners/sponsors I have, and my favorite: the liquor board.  All these folks have constant hoops I gotta jump through, and all of them have the potential to make my life hell if I don’t comply - real, tangible power to disrupt my operations (And don’t get me started on the devastation Yelp and the like can unleash.)</p>
<p>Let us also remember that not all business owners have the privledge to take risks.  A lot of families depend on the income from their business, or have things to worry about like immigration status.</p>
<p>Business owners are under severe duress right now and it’s incredibly naive to think they can just “do what they want.”</p>

        <p>Oh I get cha. Everything you said I've thought about as well. I have empathy &amp; recognize the stress folks are under. I'm still gonna advocate though for people as well as business owners to start being firm in how they feel without swaying because of societal pressure. If the majority of people refused to comply, the people enforcing and our governments would be outnumbered. "When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty".</p>

        <p>God damn man. Im not a fucking shill or anything, i hate the new normal just as much as you. I just think wearing a mask at work is a bad hill to choose to die on. Its not worth it if you get stuck needing government handouts to survive. </p>
<p>One comment with a differing view and people immediately turn on you.</p>
<p>This place is no different than the rest of fuckin reddit, one giant circlejerk where anyone who dares to see things lightly differently is the enemy.</p>

        <p>I didn't call you a shill. Did I?</p>
<p>So you have a different line in the sand? That's cool, just make sure yours isn't too far down the beach to even matter. </p>
<p>It isn't about the mask, never was, never will be, and if it isn't about the mask, then they can all go in the garbage. </p>
<p>I will always commend someone who stands up for his convictions. Instead of just saying "I hate this shit" then drones on all day doing what they hate in the face of the utter bullshit of all of it. </p>
<p>It's this person's hill, and if it isn't yours that's cool too. But the longer you participate, the longer you become accustomed to control, the easier it will be to get you to bend over for Bill Gates and hand over your weapons while you're at it. </p>
<p>This person also doesn't seem to have a problem with losing their job and wants to switch careers anyway, and if that's what they want then that's great. </p>
<p>For the record, if everyone made this their hill, your world would be operating differently, it works both ways.</p>
