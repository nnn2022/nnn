<p>Americans, for example, are not vaccinated against TB, yet they do not have an out-of-control TB pandemic. Yes, there are 13 million with LTBI, but they won't actually develop the disease as long as their immune systems are still functioning. This alone is evidence that good sanitation, a healthy diet, exercise and shelter are all that are required for someone to remain healthy and disease free.</p>

        <p>TB is a bacteria and not a virus.  The availability of better antibiotics since the 1940s (and not hygiene as you falsely claim) all but eradicated the disease from the US.
https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201509-632PS</p>
<p>However, funny you mention the TB vaccine. Multiple studies show that nations with mandatory BCG vaccines (Tb)  were shown to correlate with low number of COVID-19 confirmed cases as well as reduced mortality. Most likely due to trained immunity. Coincidentally Italy, Spain, and the US suffered the most with Covid and they are some of the few countries without mandatory TB vaccine regime.</p>

<p>Newsflash: every country in the world has a mandatory TB vaccine regime except Canada, USA, Europe west of Slovakia, Greece, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Australia and N Zealand.</p>

<p>There are no "multiple studies" showing the link between BCG and C19. The only article is by Miller et al and that's the one that made the headlines in early April 2020. <strong><em>IT WAS NEVER PEER-REVIEWED!!!!!!</em></strong></p>

<p>Either way I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince you on the safety and efficacy of vaccines as you are obviously affected by some sort of Dunning-Krugger effect. Unfortunately you aren't smart enough to see how wrong you are and you suffer from the delusion that makes you believe that you know better than 300 years of combined scientific research on the subject.</p>

        <p>300 years of scientific data? LOL, I literally showed you peer-reviewed evidence showing that the vast majority of the decline in TB cases in the UK occurred BEFORE the invention of the BCG vax. You're free to inject yourself with many experimental C19 jabs as you desire - just make sure that you keep the sub updated as to how you are faring, since you will literally be in a Phase III trial.   </p>
<p>BTW, if you even bothered to read the very first link that you so eagerly pasted, you would have seen this:  </p>
<p>&rt;However, other research has produced conflicting results, including a study published in August 2020 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> that analyzed the effects of BCG vaccination on COVID-19-related outcomes in individuals born in Sweden before and after April 1975 (n=1,026,304 and n=1,018,544, respectively). At that time point, the national practice of vaccinating all newborns was discontinued, thereby “allowing us to estimate the BCG’s effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons,” wrote the authors.5<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Using regression discontinuity, they “were able to show that those cohorts do not have different numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations per capita, with a high precision that would hardly be possible to reach with a [randomized controlled trial] design.” These findings indicate that BCG vaccination at birth does not protect against COVID-19 in middle age.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Further research is needed to elucidate the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection in various populations. “It’s an attractive hypothesis that should be tested rigorously in well-controlled clinical trials with sufficiently large numbers of [participants] that would allow one to draw rigorous and sound conclusions,” said Dr Pulendran.</p>

        <p>I respect your opinion very much and I agree with several of your observations related to the bcg and Covid (the evidence is not fully there as much as I would want). And you are not wrong regarding hygiene. Absolutely advances in hygiene during the most recent centuries have reduced the transmission of communicable diseases since soap and water, alcohol, hot water, etc kill pathogens (just to name a few examples). Eradication of mosquitoes in tropical areas have helped greatly as well. The same way that sexual abstinence and cleanliness avoids sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. The undeniable fact remains that our God given immune system is able to learn how to fight some viruses (not all) either via by passing the disease or via inoculation. As you are aware, if you had chicken pox, you probably won't get it again since your immune system has been trained to fight it (except if you get the shingles lol). If you aren't vaccinated, you will most likely get chicken pox at one time it another. Yes you can prevent a great percentage of disease by staying fit, eating healthy and living in a very sterile environment, but this is not realistic for all and in some very poor areas of the world it is practically impossible. Clean water in poor countries would save millions diarrhea child deaths a year. Does this mean we shouldn't give kids rotavirus drops at least when clean water is hard to obtain? Should dangerous operations such as heart transplants (that kills many) not exist as an option for many who are too sick and maybe ate too much and ruined their hearts? Pathogens are invisible and mosquitos are very hard to fully eliminate and they almost always attack the innocent, poor, unhealthy, and unprepared. Do these most beloved children of Jesus not deserve a chance to defend themselves? I wholeheartedly pray that you at least study the positive evidence for vaccines (and antibiotics) and the opinion of the majority of virologists and immunologists and science consensus on the subject. Give it a chance even if at least to try understand your enemy. Stay for a second away from your investigating your own bias. Try and investigate and learn how for example the Chinese practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of "nasal insufflation" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. I also recommend you read the history of Onesimus an African slave from the 1700's. I also recommend the heart breaking history of how Louis Pasteur invented the Rabies vaccine. Or the amazing history of the Spanish expedition directed by Doctor Francisco Xavier de Balmis in 1807. I understand your concerns since medicines by their nature are almost always toxic, vaccines, Chemotherapy, radiation, Acethaminophen, the list is very long. A simple operation can kill you or an Aspirin can kill you in many different ways. Of course there are deaths associated with vaccines, no doubt about it. But they are statistically insignificant in comparison. Please I beg of you to give this area a chance and open your mind. Try to understand that there are thousands of scientists who's whole reason in life is to study the area of viruses and immunology. An exceedingly complex area that still has much to be discovered. It is very likely you will easily find studies showing the negative effects of practically any medicine in the world, but overall vaccines have rid humanity from multiple diseases and will continue to do so for years to come and have and continue to save billions of lives.</p>

        <p>Polio is spread through contaminated faecal matter: it is definitely NOT a disease associated with hygiene. My point is that you need to actually research how the disease is spread, instead of pointing to anecdotes that do not even take into account the relative health of the people prior to infection.</p>

        <p>I am sure that you never seek a 2nd opinion when you go to the doctor's or do your own investigations. Just keep ramming those Rx pills down your throat, I see. It's sad that you don't want to engage in critical thinking in matters concerning you because you trust science so much. If you read your Bible, you'll see that even God the Father permits us to ask questions. Science is the art of asking questions. Scientism is the blind belief in what the experts tell you - that's a cult, hence the term Branch Covidians.</p>

        <p>You can ask and question all you want. What bothers me are people like you (that call themselves Christians) that throw rocks and accuse innocent people who spend their lives saving others of being murderers. Jesus will humble your innocent butt soon enough little buddy.</p>

        <p>As a fellow Christian it makes me sad to believe that you think God gave us all these tools and created all these smart scientists just to poison us. You remind me of the disciple who buried his talents in one of Jesus' parables... You are just a sad zealot. I pray that one day you will see the truth.</p>

        <p>It's strange how you think that God creating humans with skills automatically means that said people will use those skills in a godly way. Perhaps you should spend more time reading the Bible instead of thinking that non-Christian scientists and global leaders are immune to demonic influence that could lead to incidences like Tuskagee, Bikini Atoll irradiation tests, Navajo radon &amp; uranium experiments, depleted uranium rounds in the 2nd Gulf War, etc. These were all caused by EVIL scientists who were NOT doing God's work.  </p>

        <p>Yes, there are scientists dedicated to using their intelligence to creating weapons of mass destruction, since that is their area. However,  scientists (Christian or not) who have also have dedicated their lives to curing diseases don't do it to intentionally kill people . Many Christian hospitals and doctors use vaccines on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>There is a great part in the article where the guy injects his arm with three types of snake venom. He wakes up the next day to his arm looking like "Evil Dead." The doctors want to slice his arm open to relieve pressure. The doctors call a snake expert who says he will die. The doctors want to amputate his arm. He discharges himself and he's fully healed in a week.</p>
