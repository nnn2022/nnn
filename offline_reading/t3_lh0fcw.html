        <p>It's probably more effective to gently place a seed of doubt the makes them question things themselves... To respond in a way that humanizes you to them, making them realize maybe they are the monster.</p>
<p>When you react strongly they will dig in further to their positions.</p>
<p>That said, this is an all out war against us and you are NOT wrong to react as you are. And I applaud your inner strength at fighting back against this madness in any way that you choose.</p>

        <p>So do you guys think that the scientists are in league with the government and trying to get you all to wear masks. Looking at the data, masks work, so maybe protect people's health and just wear one. It's not that bad.</p>

        <p>People should have the choice to not wear an article of clothing. Also, masks remove a person's identity by making everyone look the same and are extremely uncomfortable. No matter what mask I wear, I can't keep it on longer than 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>The "science" on masks is all in laboratory settings and suddenly changed in March to May of 2020, opposing decades worth of mask studies showing that they don't make a significant difference in controlling respiratory viruses. All real world data shows masks haven't made any difference, let alone mask mandates. Also, masks are based upon the assumption of asymptomatic spread. Actual contact tracing studies show asymptomatic spread is extremely rare, to non-existent. I'm not going to point to some nefarious agenda, but maybe here is something somewhat more likely:
The health experts and politicians scared everyone shitless and then realized they need to show they're doing something to mitigate the spread as well as mentally put people at ease into somewhat integrating back into society. At some point, maybe Trump's refusal to wear a mask, the issue was politicized and equated to good people wear masks and bad people do not. Yes, people wear masks all over the world but for whatever reason it's highly politicized in the West. On top of that, the narrative that Asian countries just wear masks all the time is not true. They wear mainly for air pollution as well as if they're sick (not asymptomatically sick after getting tested), or for fashion.
Lastly, all of Cdc's studies have been of the following manner:
Study 1: "Several counties in Kansas has a mask mandate. Here is data for 3 months. Look, the mandate counties had a decrease and the non mandate had an increase."
No word on how the numbers played out after the 3 months. We know cases sky rocketed all over the place from November to January. California and New York are some of the most restricted states, everyone wears a mask, yet look at their numbers.
Study 2: Look mask mandates work. Check out these numbers for 3 months where cases were down everywhere. Masks work!
Study 3: 2 masks are better than 1! Here are a few mannequins with simulated breathing, check out how much is blocked! See, masks work, 2 better than 1, the tighter the better!</p>
<p>This is all literally the science and there's plenty of opposing science that just gets censored. Personally, not wearing a mask is following the science. There is science behind breathing in a reservoir of bacteria over and over. There is science behind wearing a dirty mask that touches your hands, purse surfaces, dashboard, pockets, etc. Also, some people genuinely have trouble breathing in one. Are they going to pass out? Probably not, but it still causes headaches and makes them feel fatigued. Being forced to wear a mask over pseudo science is something people take issue with as well. The personal choice argument is mocked but it's a valid concern, especially since asymptomatic spread has only been proven in modelling studies and is extremely rare in the real world.</p>

        <p>Because in my opinion the masks have nothing to do with preventing the spread of disease. This is why people are allowed to wear shirts and bandanas over their mouths and society pretends it's the same as a medical mask lmao.</p>
<p>It's all about optics and showing compliance to the state who has no interest in you being a free individual.</p>
<p>In my opinion.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>I wear one but only when I have to (at work, when shopping etc) is DO NOT make it a life style like so many have.  </p>
<p>If the virus is soooooo dangerous why allow anyone to leave their homes? Especially with the talk of wearing multiple masks now. </p>
<p>Also what’s the end goal? Zero deaths? Always wearing a mask every time you go out?</p>

        <p>Because it's just silly. This is a virus. It's not like people are dropping dead in the streets. Even then, what you do with your own face should be your right.</p>
