        <p>I like this. But how close are the population densities? Do the number of PCR tests compare well between masked and unmasked states?</p>
<p>Quite sure masks don't work but just trying to think of all the rebuttals the mask Nazis will have.</p>

        <p>Everyone knows places with mask mandates have had more cases. The problem is they are also testing more (surprise). That’s why I only look at deaths. They are much more reliable than “cases”, though certainly not perfect. It’s really hard for the Doomers to argue masks and lockdowns work when the deaths are so much higher in places with restrictions in place.</p>

        <p>Locally we didn't have a Province Wide Mask Mandate until recently.</p>
<p>Our Cities have had them since July.  Recent reports are over 99% Compliance with them this whole time. </p>
<p>Our Major Cities have seen large growth in cases while the maskless country side saw little to no change in cases. We have seen a slight decrease in cases and transmission but then we have severe restrictions like not being able to visit family for Christmas Dinner.</p>

        <p>i feel as if it has more to do with masks not being meant to be worn for hours and days on end so bacteria and mold is just grown in this humid closed in environment and people are breathing that shit in getting sick</p>

        <p>No, the tests are pumping out false positives.  Even the World Health Organization finally admitted to it.  FDA has said it, NYT has said it, the court in Portugal has ruled it, and we've been saying it for a long time.   Even the designer of the test has said it.  It was never created to be a diagnostic tool.</p>
<p>As far as masks, yeah they do grow mold.  That's for sure.  But that's all they do.</p>

        <p>I have been saying this for months and people have called me Crazy.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people citing a study from the Lancet that was from Germany claiming masks work and claiming to prove it.  A study done in April right after Germany had a mask mandate and they claimed the resulting case drop was proof masks worked.  Ignoring other jurisdictions that had no mandates and completely ignored the correlation with the Weather.</p>
<p>People still pull it up as proof ignoring that with the passage of time it was proven wrong.  Sept/Oct/Nov came along and cases went up...around the Northern Hemisphere.  As if the Cooling Weather had a major impact.  </p>
<p>We have had a useless mask mandate since July.</p>
<p>Cases started going up in September and have steadily risen.  Our 2 major Cities here have a lot of cases, our rural areas are nearly COVID free.  Yet the Cities have had mask mandates since the summer.  </p>
<p>I have posted Graphs to facebook showing when the mask mandates were put into place and how they have proven not to work.  Get the comments like "My 3 yr old could make a better Graph" or "Source"(When the source of the info in listed right on the graph.  I ususally get dismissed becasue I do not have an alphabet soup behind my name and what I say is not reported on TV.  No one seems to ever bother to look at the data themselves and just mindless repeats what the TV told them.  </p>
<p>It's not the maskless people getting tested and taking up hospital spaces</p>

        <p>The biggest problem I think with these observational studies like the Germany one is the authors can ignore whatever variables they want. Combine that with the fact they can conveniently choose whatever scenerio supports their theory.</p>
