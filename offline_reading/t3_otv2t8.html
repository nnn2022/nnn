        <p>I knew this was going to be controversial. Apologies if I lacked some context here.</p>
<p>Please bear with me. Here we go.</p>
<ol>
<li>As we all know the C-19 vaxxes are all unapproved. No government is willing to bear legal liability for any adverse reaction that might arise.</li>
<li>We also know that this jab is more dangerous, causing more injuries and deaths than any other vaccine in history.</li>
<li>But notice that the vax campaign is marketed more aggressively in a "specific set" of countries compared to others.</li>
<li>Notice also that ivermectin/hydroxychloroquine is actively being suppressed in the same "specific set" of countries.</li>
<li>Countries like Bangladesh, Guatemala, El Salvador, Zimbabwe and even Venezuela are using Ivermectin widely to cure/prevent C-19. Compare their daily infections per million people, to that of the UK.</li>
<li>The medical industrial complex is determined to get as many people jabbed as possible, but only again in that "specific set" of countries. They have tried all kinds of tactics in their arsenal - bribes, free donuts, cash prizes, lotteries, 24/7 media campaigning, etc.</li>
<li>When the bribes don't work, now they move to the next phase - forcing. To date I only hear of vax mandates being aggressively pushed into the mainstream narrative, once again, in that "specific set" of countries - France, Greece, UK, Italy, parts of the US. Never once I heard mandates being threatened in poorer Third World countries - I could be outdated on this.</li>
<li>Take the UK as an example. More than half of their population have been fully jabbed yet they record many more daily infections per 1 million people, than say, Bangladesh - most densely-populated country in the world - which has only 90 infections per million ppl, but vax rate is about 2.5% and less-than-satisfactory sanitation.</li>
<li>Looking at the statistics, like how poor, developing, Third World countries are handling the plandemic than many developed Western countries, and how the medical-industrial complex is going full length to advertise the experimental vaccine, eventually someone would have to call out that the King was indeed naked.</li>
<li>Here's the controversial part. There is talk that the real purpose of the vax campaign was for "depopulation". However I personally think that although that's plausible, <strong><em>only certain "ethnicities" and/or "nationalities" are being singled out for population reduction</em></strong>. Ask yourself: why American MSM and govt bureaucrats so panicked and agitated, when vax rates stagnated at 50%?</li>
<li>The same goes for several Western European countries, especially France. I heard that France was the most vaccine-skeptic country in Western Europe.</li>
<li>Here's another juicy part. Remember the migrant wave from Africa, Middle East and Central Asia into Europe, between 2014 and 2020?</li>
<li>We hear a lot of locals getting the vaccine on the news, but do you remember the migrants getting, or being offered the vaccine?</li>
<li>How many of those migrants have been vaccinated?</li>
<li>The same can be said for the US. How many illegals from the migrant caravan in 2017-2020 have been vaccinated? If the liberal left MSM is all about "saving lives", why did the liberal left MSM ignore the migrants for the vax program?</li>
<li>You may want to look up the <strong>Great Replacement</strong> theory. As well as the <strong>Aztlan Reconquista</strong> controversy.</li>

<li>The vaccines are very much approved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines</a></li>
<li>The vaccine causes almost no deaths. Numbering in single-digit numbers even in large countries.</li>
<li>Yes. Because people in some countries are more willing to not die and endanger others around them than in others.</li>
<li>Yes. Because in some countries, people will just believe anything they are told. Should I search for how many people in the US tried to cure themselves by drinking bleach?</li>
<li>Sauce? And even if it was true, poor countries kind of have to use anything they can despite it not being as effective.</li>
<li>No. They want to get everyone vaccinated everywhere. You can't get rid of a virus by vaccinated in just some places</li>
<li>People from third world countries are literally migrating into the developed countries to get vaccinated. So there is no need to do campaigns there.</li>
<li>Yes. The infection spreads faster in developed countries and there are reasons for that. Just as there are reasons for why even tho Bangladesh has much less infected per mil than UK, it counts twice as many deaths from covid as the UK.</li>
<li>Yes. That's because people in third world countries are too busy with trying to stay alive and don't have time for bogus conspiracies and have much greater trouble than wondering whether not wearing a mask should be a fundamental human right.</li>
<li>And whenever I hear that talk I must ask how is depopulation going to benefit anyone. Answer to that question is simple. Because 50% is not enough to delete the virus.</li>
<li>- can't comment -</li>
<li>Yes, migration from those places into Europe happens. It happens all the time as people run from danger and try to get better lives.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Idk. Probably a majority of them.</li>
<li>Because it didn't.</li>
<li>Yeah, those are full of bogus. There would be much simpler and less dangerous ways to do it than releasing uncontrollable deadly virus.</li>

        <p>Another bot. Repeating the same talking points over and over again.</p>
<p>Go to ourworldindata.org and see for yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emergency Authorization is not the same as full approval, dummy.</li>
<li>Cause no deaths? You sure? How about you pay a visit to VAERS.hhs.gov?</li>
<li>The governments and Big Pharma has admitted that the jabs do not prevent infection and spreading. Update your programming.</li>
<li>Like you, that unequivocally believes that the experimental jabs are safe and effective despite mounting evidence it is not? Ivermectin is the same as bleach? How dumb can that get?</li>
<li>ivmstatus.com; ourworldindata.org</li>
<li>Then why are vax rates in Bangladesh, Guatemala and Nigeria so low yet they're doing better than the Western world?</li>
<li>WTF are you serious? Migrating just to get the jab? </li>
<li>Why infection spreads faster in the UK despite more than half of its population fully jabbed?</li>
<li>They are "busy with staying alive" hence they are open to all possible treatments, just anything that could end the plandemic, including Ivermectin, HCQ, even traditional herbs. Why do the industralised countries don't do so? And you blame the people for harbouring conspiracies as a result?</li>
<li>I said certain nationalities and/or ethnicities are being SINGLED OUT for depopulation. Hence the more aggressive vax push, compared to others</li>
<li>No comment either.</li>
<li>I believe people do have a right to flee from danger, from tyrannical regimes. But your point is? So you think large-scale ILLEGAL immigration is not a pressing issue?</li>
<li>Show us the proof then. Until now, never heard of it.</li>
<li>So you don't know then. Probably none?</li>
<li>Never once the MSM actually mentioned that the illegal immigrants from the caravan are participating in the vax experiment. If that happened, and since the liberal left likes to wax lyrical about "saving lives", why didn't they cover it? Because it never happened?</li>
<li>How many coincidences until it is mathematically impossible?</li>
</ol>
<p>You big pharma bots do not offer new arguments. Just repeat whatever your masters program into you. I've been hearing the same lines over and over again FOR MONTHS. Give us a break.</p>
<p>Go kiss Klaus Schwab's @r$€ for all I care, Big Pharma bot.</p>

<li>You said "approved". Which it is. If you meant some specific kind of approval, you should have specified that.</li>
<li>yes, ignore the key word "almost" and the second sentence. It makes you look smart.</li>
<li>They didn't need to admit to that because we knew that. Well, at least people who know how vaccines work. Learn before you speak dumbo.</li>
<li>Yes like me who actually knows what he is talking about and overwhelming evidence the vaccine is safe.</li>
<li>Again, the same. Actually, read what is written there.</li>
<li>Doing better? With twice as many deaths despite having fewer cases? How can you even dare to call that better?</li>
<li>Yes. It's been all over the news.</li>
<li>Vaccination has little to do with spread. It spreads faster because people interact more and don't follow guidelines.</li>
<li>Because in developed countries we have modern medicine.</li>
<li>How is trying to vaccinate everyone singling anyone out?</li>
<li>Not as big as you seem to think it is. Vast majority of the migrants go through a legal process</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1375100422092902414">https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1375100422092902414</a></li>
<li>Show me a counterproof then.</li>
<li>Coincidences? Like the super-smart super-wealthy people who are running the whole world from the shadows are coincidently incapable to manage something as simple as targeted depopulation without endangering thousands?</li>

<li>Emergency Use approval is because the jabs are still under Clinical Trials until 2023, dear. Under normal circumstances vaccines take 10 years or more of research before they are marketed, dear</li>
<li>Playing with semantics? If that's your definition of "safe", why are governments so scared of ivermectin?</li>
<li>If this jab works, why cases are still higher than ever? Just like measles. We seldom hear large-scale outbreaks of measles because the measles vaccine truly works.</li>
<li>You still don't know what you are talking. Overwhelming evidence that it is safe based on a small clinical trial before roll-out to general public? In fact, where does the so-called 95% efficacy even come from?</li>
<li><a href="https://ivmstatus.com">ivmstatus.com</a>; <a href="https://FLCCC.net">FLCCC.net</a>; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">ourworldindata.org</a> - you don't like data eh?</li>
<li>I'm talking about daily infections per million people. In fact, just how many people actually died of C-19? Do you know that suicides and murders are also counted as C-19 deaths if they found traces of the virus on the victim?</li>
<li>It was never in the news. Few, if not no, illegal immigrant has been vaccinated.</li>
<li>Then what's the point of the jabs? What's the point of the masks? Eventually lockdowns again? For a virus with 99% survival rate? Blaming the people is what you globalist scum do all the time? Always the fault of the proles? Or it was part of the Great Reset to destroy small businesses?</li>
<li>Then why is Ivermectin/HCQ not given a chance in developed countries? Is this really medical science, or politics?</li>
<li>Because governments are aware that the mRNA shots are hazardous and their long-term effects are still NOT known. This mRNA shot has caused more casualties more than other vaccines combined in history. And the shot is more intensely marketed towards a certain ethnicity compared to others. This is a fact. Look at the vax rates in Bangladesh, Guatemala, India etc.</li>
<li>Hahaha legal process? Then why the amnesty proposal? What happened as soon as Trump's wall was halted? Look what is happening along Texas-Mexico border? Do you know that border guards in Texas are overwhelmed to the extend that Florida had to send in assistance?</li>
<li>Doesn't mean that illegal immigrants will go get it. As far as we know, the threat of mandates and passports are targeted towards the locals (mostly whites) and legal immigrants. We do not know whether the illegals will be covered or not</li>
<li>Show me news reports where illegals are being coerced into taking the jab as well.</li>
<li>Yes, and? Targeted depopulation, that's what it is. Only certain ethnicities are being targeted. That's the Great Replacement. Then comes Eurabia. Aztlan Reconquista. </li>
</ol>
<p>You are still using the same-old same-old arguments. Nothing new. It's getting boring.</p>

<li>Point? asshole. None? of course</li>
<li>Nobody is scared of it. It's just not as effective as real medicine.</li>
<li>Because as I said, vaccine server to reduce mortality rates, which it does. Not contagiousness of the virus.</li>
<li>Overwhelming evidence based on millions being vaccinated. few thousand having somewhat serious side-effect and only like 5 deaths having a causal link to the vaccine.</li>
<li>Again. Read it.</li>
<li>So what? "Doing better" very much includes people dying. No, they are not. That is obvious nonsense. Feel free to try to source it tho.</li>
<li>Why would it be in the news? There is literally no point for that. People doing normal smart things is not a good news story, it's not interesting. A lot of immigrants got vaccinated, tho again, feel free to source your claim.</li>
<li>Because 1% dying is still millions dying. Also, viruses mutate, and there is a chance it could become more deadly.</li>
<li>It was given a chance and it did jack diddly squat.</li>
<li>No, the government is aware that the vaccines are safe and they know all the effects they will have, that is none. No, it didn't. Again, there is a single-digit number of people who died from vaccination. So even if you were right, it would just mean all other vaccines are beyond safe.</li>
<li>What happened is that USA saved a shit ton of money on a worthless project. And yeah, I am aware. I am surprised you are since when I said it you laughed.</li>
<li>It doesn't. But since that is the reason for the increased migration it is quite likely. And there is no threat.</li>
<li>They are not coerced. That's the reason why they migrate...</li>
<li>If it's TARGETED why are they trying to get EVERYONE vaccinated? Does your brain not process how that doesn't work?</li>

<li>So you couldn't refute this, right, 1d10t?</li>
<li>Not effective? How about you go talk to some Indians over it? Was Remdesivir effective, joker?</li>
<li>Does it? In almost all countries mortality rates increased just as jab rates increased. Antibody dependent enhancement
4.Where do you get only 5? Do you know that VAERS is under-reporting? How many more cases are hidden from the public?</li>
<li>Don't throw the ball back to me, l0s3r.</li>
<li>Don't beat around the bush. Before Ivermectin was used things are worse in those countries, filthy globalist.
7.Source your claim that illegal immigrants are also subject to the mandates. </li>
<li>Before the VAX rollout there are no "variants" or "mutations". Where precisely those "variants" come from?
9.When was it given a chance? Your favorite WHO and FDA simply brushed it off. Poorer countries insisted. The results are remarkable. </li>
<li>I ask again: where the f*cm you get single-digit? Just VAERS in the US alone is 11,000. That's more than double the casualties of 70+ other vaccines combined in the last 30 years. But it was a single digit for you? How psychopathic can you be?</li>
<li>So you are OK with mass illegal immigration. </li>
<li>There are threats from President Biden himself. NY, Hawaii and California are already using VAX passports, fool</li>
<li>Show me again when illegal immigrants are being vaccinated at the border.</li>
<li>Why the threats of mandates towards a certain ethnicity then? It seems that illegal immigrants are exempt. Also there are no threats of mandates in poorer Third World countries. Their VAX rates are less than 10% and the MSM didn't give a flying f*ck.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear now that you are all for white genocide. You are either a globalist bot or a evil communist psychopath.
You are worse than Pol Pot.
You sincerely believe that innocent people should be executed so that fleabags like you feel "safe".
You are an evil cultist. You worship Klaus Schwab. You are a tool for the Globalist New World Order.
You can BTFO back to your Globalist den and cry.</p>

<li>Refute what? That it is approved? Yeah, I can't refute something that is a fact</li>
<li>How about you do and try to convince them they are not dying</li>
<li>Wrong. It's the exact opposite. Mortality rates went down as the vaccination took effect. But feel free to show a source to contrary.</li>
<li>So no proof then?</li>
<li>So? I am still waiting for you to source that it's more effective than actual medicine.</li>
<li>Yes, there were. Variants happen as the virus gets transmitted and mutates. </li>
<li>Any source for the bogus claim? That's not even remotely close to the truth. There are 6340 death reports after vaccine with only three being shown to have a causal link to the vaccine. Feel free to prove me wrong tho.</li>
<li>No, but since there is no such a thing as illegal migration, it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>There are no threats. So what they are using vax passport? That literally doesn't mean anything and doesn't affect anyone. What do you think it does? Explode when you say something bad? lol</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/06/17/immigrants-crucial-to-vaccinating-us-but-gaps-remain/">https://www.rollcall.com/2021/06/17/immigrants-crucial-to-vaccinating-us-but-gaps-remain/</a> I'll wait for something showing the aren't now.</li>
<li>No such threats exist. Yes, because there is no need for that, they literally have more people wanting to get the vaccine than they can afford. Except when they do. But again, why would they talk about something boring?</li>
</ol>
<p>White genocide? How did you even get from people of colour being the most in danger to whites getting genocided? You also clearly have no idea what communism means. No, unlike you I want everyone to get vaccinated. No clue who Klaus Schwab is, and I don't really feel like googling that. Until you can show some basic research and proof, you will remain sheep of the right. Don't bother answering without anything constructive to say as that will not be met with a further response.</p>
