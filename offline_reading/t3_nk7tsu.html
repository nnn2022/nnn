    <strong>The Medical Industry Must Be Destroyed</strong>
    <p><p><strong>LONG POST. TL;DR: Modern doctors see themselves as New-Age Gods that control life and death and resent you for not submitting to the technocratic medical elite. They are cultish ideologues without compassion who are in the industry for the money and most of them cannot replicate their own or anyone else's medical "research". The American Medical Industry is a disaster, all countries should disregard it and all of its "findings" for the safety of their citizens.</strong> </p>
<p>The medical industry, as it exists today, is a Godless abomination that must be institutionally destroyed and rebuilt if we are to survive as a civilization.</p>
<p>Do me a favor. Open a new tab and search "Medical School Cheating" on Reddit. Click the result from r. / medicine. (censored for AutoMod). Click on it and read the comments. This article is about medical students cheating on their medical exams. Look at the comments. Don't say anything, don't leave you own comment (No point. Mods over there insta ban people that question MuH ScIEnCE on sight.) Just look.</p>
<p>Look at how these fucking people talk about you. Look and get a rare glimpse into the mind and attitude of modern American "doctors". <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> Medical Malpractice is the 3rd leading cause of death in America. They cheat their way through school, and even if they don't, they only know "medicine" in so far as they know which horrific concoction the crooked witch doctors at Big Pharma have created to prescribe that suppresses symptoms but hardly ever treats the cause. </p>
<p><strong>European Redditors:</strong> Are you taking USA refugees?  Ich spreche Deutsch und liebe Deutschland und Europa. Bitte hilfe. Bin Baby.</p>
<p>Most modern doctors resent the masses, they resent middle America, they resent people that don't submit to their medical tyranny, and they resent you for being free. They hate every unfortunate soul you've seen that suffers with obesity or unhealthy habits. They are secretly disgusted with them, and hate them for not being healthier. Instead of things like education, lifestyle changes, compassion, nutrition, etc, they simply give the worst off of us medicine to suppress the  symptoms until they wither away and die. In their minds, the uneducated mass that doesn't understand why his lifestyle is killing him and just needs a push to get disciplined deserves his ill health. Medicine for profit run by sociopaths that haven't the compassion nor skills to be in their industry. Read their subreddits. Look at how they think about you! </p>
<p>Same thing with mental health. Oh, you're having this mental reaction to living in an intensely isolating and materialistic degenerate society? You have this disorder and that disorder. Clearly you <br>
 aren't normal and must be indefinitely sedated so you go back to sleep. Stop noticing things! Here, take this mind altering addictive medication for the rest of your life. Will it cause brain damage? Chemical dependency? Don't ask such things! The science was settled by "independent" think tanks and research organizations that receive their funding from the same Big Pharma giants that make the pills. Why are you a science denier!? BIGOT! <strong>FUN FACT #2: The Replication crises!</strong> Did you know that 70% of "MuH ScIeNCe" Modern Doctors in a <em>Nature</em> survey reported to have tried and failed to reproduce a medical experiment, and that over half are incapable of reproducing their own experiments? (  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility | Nature</a>  ) <strong>FUN FACT NUMBER #3</strong> In a 2012 study by C. Glenn Begley, only 11% of pre-clinical cancer studies can be replicated. ( <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Drug-development%3A-Raise-standards-for-preclinical-Begley-Ellis/1a81d3d1e8a983e0551edf485f4ac1a8cdd7fea4">[PDF] Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research | Semantic Scholar</a> ) GEE GOLLY Its almost like they're a bunch of New Age religious ideologues that are only in it for the money! </p>
<p>I had a doctor tell my mother to her face that he doesn't understand why she wants to get her blood sugar under control such that she doesn't need medication anymore. She takes an extremely light dose of what she has, her blood sugar is excellent, and for many years she didn't need to take medicine at all. She said she wants to get back to that point and the quack doctor got mad! "Why would you want to do that? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Why the hell would you put yourself through that? What's wrong with the medicine?"</p>
<p>That encounter should tell you more than anything else. These people hate that you are free. They hate that the unwashed uneducated mass that they've so long written off and condemned to suffer are waking up and realizing the truth of health, and how the "medical industry" is nothing but a multi trillion dollar life support machine that keeps people dumb and addicted. That doctors violent reaction is because my mother doesn't need him anymore. That was her last appointment (Find and internist doctor if you can folks.) </p>
<p>He's angry because he has got it in his head that he is the new elite. He's a doctor! A technocratic oligarch. A blessed anointed one. With the power of medicine he wields life and death in his hands like a knight wields his sword. He holds your life in his hands! Why aren't you listening? Why don't you submit!? Science denier! Bigot! Redneck! Don't you know who I am? I am the one who commands mortality! I am the enlightened one! Come back! SUPER SPREADER! COVIDIOT! <strong>I AM GOD.</strong></p>
<p>Until these people face real consequences in a court of law nothing will change. Until this industry is institutionally destroyed nothing will change. Until we certify, as a matter of law, that they are responsible for the deaths caused by their quackery nothing will change. Neither changing to a single payer system nor eliminating government red tape will cure this moral abomination. This is a matter of law, a matter of justice. </p>
<p><strong>We will write the names of every life lost to this crooked industry on the cocktails we will use to burn it down.</strong></p></p>

        <p>The AMA is literally a cartel that thrives on all of this and doesn't (if ever) gave one single shit about the "health" of us plebs. It is and probably always has been about profit and power.</p>
<p>So I'm agreeing with OP. The medical industry is our Carthage. Then again, I could say that about a lot of government-industrial-societal complexes like the "news" media.</p>
