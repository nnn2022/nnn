    <strong>Im not a conspiracy-minded person...</strong>
    <p><p>I’ll wear a mask if it protects the elderly and vulnerable. I haven’t had so much as a cold this year so the masks obviously work. </p>
<p>I’ll stay in lockdown when the number of cases is out of control. I like not being ill.</p>
<p>I’ll even get vaccinated in order to go abroad, I’ve done it with yellow fever, malaria vaccines etc. so it makes sense for countries who haven’t got the virus under control.</p>
<p>But the idea that I as a healthy 20-something who’s had COVID and was absolutely fine has to get a vaccination passport to go to any event is where I draw the line. </p>
<p>I’ve missed a year of education, not seen my friends or family except through my fucking webcam. I’m depressed and my anxiety is worse than it’s ever been. </p>
<p>If the majority of the vulnerable population is vaccinated then herd immunity is inevitably going to reduce the death rate, why stop healthy young people from living their lives?</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant I’m just so done with all of this</p></p>

        <p>I dont mind them most of the time either, but sometimes at work, my physical exertion has to spike and breathing is important to controling body temperature. What many people start to experience as heavy breathing or a feeling of being shorted oxygen is a matter of rising core temp (my theory, untested).</p>
<p>It would be nice if I could have a few moments of reprieve if I am well far away from others and need a few cool deep breaths. If no one is around, I do it anyway.</p>
<p>I also noticed not getting any colds, but I attribute that to sick people staying home instead of the masks. I work in grocery, and before the pandemic the stores sounded like a tuberculosis ward half the time (always old people). Not any more.</p>

        <p>The opinion supporys masks, not the science, the science didnt change at all. Scientific method and randomized studies are important for a reason. Scientists have engaged themselves very heavily with politics and business and are giving opinions based on that. Those studies didnt change, their flaws and outcomes didnt change, and to back that up there is all the data in the world clearly showing masks dont work. Its your side who has to cherry pick and twist beyond all belief to try to make people believe this works.</p>

        <p>I have read them, over and over and over agian. They do not scientifically support effectiveness of masks, there is no scientific evidence masks work. </p>
<p>What does anybody have to gain by doing the wrong thing? This is one of the pro-lockdowner's favorite false arguments. People do stupid stuff all the time, dont care about the consequences and then do the same dumb thing again. Whats the reason for that? There will be your answer, it is a unfortunate part of human nature that they do stupid and irrational things.</p>

        <p>As for masks working because you havent got sick, look up viral interference and cross immunity. Its not the masks.</p>
<p>Still, welcome to the sub, I'm glad that you have seen through some of the idiocy of this.</p>

        <p>One of the criteria on the vaccine passport in the UK is 'natural immunity' christ knows how that is recorded.</p>
<p>The vaccine passport will be as successful as our track and trace.</p>

<p>These two things are in direct contradiction with each other. You'll never get your life back with this attitude.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree it SHOULD have been stay home if you’re sick. But after a year of this there’s got to be a middle ground between the delusional anti-mask and anti-vax and the delusional Tory fascism that seems to be coming</p>

        <p>You rightly point out that the push for universal "vaccinations" is bullshit and I support it.  Consider the possibility that the very same people feeding you propaganda about the serum may have been lying to you all along.</p>
<p>&rt;I haven’t had so much as a cold this year so the masks obviously work</p>
<p>I respectfully beg to differ with your conclusion that they "obviously" work.</p>
<p>There's a lot more that's been different over the past year besides widespread mask wearing.  You pointed out that you missed a year of education and you're not alone  Colds and flus tend to ramp up with the start of school and there's been a lot of "distance learning" going on so there's likely less opportunity for spread in the first place.</p>
<p>Mask wearing provokes more hand-to-face contact adjusting something that's rarely comfortable.  In a normal year. viral transfer from infected common surfaces to face might increase the transmission of colds. flus. etc.</p>

        <p>We touch our face something like 1000 times a day without thinking about it. Surely having something between fingers and your mouth and nose stops some germs? In the same way I’d rather stand in shit with my shoes on than stand in it bare foot. </p>
