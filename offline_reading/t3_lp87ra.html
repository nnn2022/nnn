    <strong>Genuine question: why do you care so much about masks?</strong>
    <p><p>I fully understand the frustration generally around COVID. I really do. The majority of the Western world is feeing it. But I’ve a simple question - why do you care so much about masks, specifically? Why is it such a big deal to you if you don’t wear one? </p>
<p>Off the bat I want to say I’m not here to pick a fight or have any battles in the comments. I’m just trying to better understand the argument and mindset that leads to such vehement opposition to masks - specifically masks, not wider restrictions around COVID. I think there’s valid arguments for both closing and opening public spaces and the varying degrees it’s appropriate to do so and I’m sure that discussion is probably far too broad to be of any real use. So I’d love to hear specifically about masks, your thoughts on them and the reasons for your opposition to them. </p>
<p>Secondly, I don’t think the argument that “COVID doesn’t exist” is possessed of any merit or really contributes to the debate. If you believe that, that’s your choice. But COVID has taken family members of mine. The consensus among the global and medical scientific community is that the virus is real. There is plenty of empirical evidence to this end. The idea that “it’s just the flu” is pretty clearly a non starter at this point, I think. If you believe differently, I truly wish you the best but we’re probably not going to find any common ground on this issue. </p>
<p>So with those two things in mind - I’d be really interested to hear why you feel how you do about masks. Is it a personal liberty thing? Do you not believe in their efficacy? Is it due to an innate desire to rebel.</p>
<p>Personally, I have no issue with wearing a mask. If COVID truly isn’t as serious as people think (despite the huge body of evidence that it is indeed a very serious disease in a significant number of cases), then I’ve suffered the minor inconvenience of having a piece of cloth over my face for a short time. However, if my wearing that piece of cloth has even a TINY chance of stopping someone getting sick or dying, then it’s worth it. The comparative utility is way skewed to taking an action that protects someone else’s health and well-being. And I’d hope other people share that opinion and act accordingly, for my health and well-being. </p>
<p>As I say, genuinely interested in a calm and civil discussion here, I’ve set my thoughts out and would welcome anyone that’s prepared to do the same.</p></p>

        <p>Because masks are not proven to work, yet we are being forced to wear them. Nowhere have mask mandates caused cases or deaths to decline, yet people claim they're listening to the science. More like listening to a cult leader.</p>

        <p>Table 1 on page 7 of this report disputes that and found that wearing cloth or paper masks in a medical setting has reduced the instance of infection in a number of scenarios. There is extensive literature on this: https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/set-c/set-c-facemasks.pdf?la=en-GB&amp;hash=A22A87CB28F7D6AD9BD93BBCBFC2BB24</p>
<p>Can we maybe agree that there’s a debate at least about how effective masks are? </p>
<p>And if that’s the case, isn’t it better to err on the side of caution and just wear one, to be safe? </p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

        <p>If your ideas are correct you shouldn’t have any issue with them being challenged.</p>
<p>I’m interested in what people think/feel about this. So I’m asking them. If you look at my other replies I’m agreeing with fair parts of what some people say. I’m here trying to challenge my own world view and expose myself to some new ideas. I don’t think we’ll agree on much but I hope we can agree that the world would be a better place if people weren’t so entrenched in their tribes and were prepared to go out and have a civil disagreement with others once in a while. I think it’s the best way to remind ourselves that we’re not that different, really. </p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>

        <p>The filtration is one argument, and yes in controlled studies masks do filter the air.</p>
<p>The response to that is they do not filter EVERYTHING, virus particles are still more than small enough to ride right through any mask. Plus, people don't wear masks properly. Unless you are fully sanitizing your hands before putting it on, and before taking it off, all you are doing is trapping bacteria in your mask which then spreads to your hands as soon as you fiddle with it, which everybody does. Masks aren't magic virus killers, everything you breath out has to go somewhere and with a mask it simply gets blown out the sides and trapped in the fibers.</p>

        <p>I'll agree it's debated. If it is debatable at all, I.E. not as deadly as the media pushes it to be, then I shouldn't be forced to wear one. It should be optional. Much the same as my job shouldn't have been forcibly closed.</p>

        <p>As I said before:</p>
<p>To me, it is mainly about what it represents.</p>
<p>I can't separate masks from the curfews, the people being detained for going outside, the police breaking up "illegal gatherings" at home, the need for permission to leave the house like in Greece...</p>
<p>If I wear a mask, I feel like I'm supporting all that.</p>
<p>And I will be sending the message that "We should be terrified of this virus", which is the sentiment that keeps all this madness going.</p>
<p>I want life to go back to normal. I want <strong>freedom</strong>. Endless fear means endless tyranny as well.</p>

        <p>I entirely understand and fully agree with the desire for life to go back to normal! I feel the same way, the impact of the current restrictions on the well-being and mental health of my loved ones is heartbreaking. </p>
<p>I’d be really interested to know what makes you think this is a slippery slope to the kind of infringements on civil liberties that you describe. Like, I’d say that I can’t really imagine that any government wouldn’t want to go back to the way things were 18 months ago as soon as possible. These measures are hugely unpopular with huge numbers of people - even people like me that are prepared to abide by them certainly don’t love them! I’d argue that governments care most about being re-elected and keeping people locked down for a second longer than necessary isn’t going to help them achieve that goal, so why would they do it? </p>

        <p>Because control over society is power, and politicians often crave that. Not to mention that it sets a precedent where removing basic freedoms is legitimate.</p>
<p>After two years (maybe more), people become... used to it. <strong>Conditioned</strong>. They will not resist or question similar restrictions in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, politicians might let things go back to normal, but I'm willing to bet it won't be like 2019. It will be on their terms.</p>

        <p>I take your point. Honestly, I feel differently about it because I don’t personally think politicians are particularly capable of bringing about the outcome you describe - to be completely honest in my experience, most of them are fuckin’ morons who aren’t possessed of a desire for anything more than to claim a fat pay check and have an easy ride. </p>
<p>Totally respect your right to an opinion, guess I just feel different personally on that topic. Thanks again for your response.</p>

        <p>Guess it depends what you mean by “working”. There’s a clear correlation between lockdown being introduced in many countries and then case numbers falling. Don’t think that proves that they “work” but it’s potentially evidence that they do? Think other factors like the general prevalence of respiratory viruses during the winter months etc. </p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have really strict policies around lockdown and have seen tiny numbers of cases compared to a lot of other developed countries - which I think is quite compelling.</p>

        <p>Its been a standard that predates language. As there is no law against me endangering someone elses life by transmitting covid19, and considering I already potentially risk other peoples lives every time I leave my house, I don’t see a downside and would say yes it is definitely worth it.</p>

        <p>It’s not the mask, it’s the evil intent behind it. It’s part of a larger campaign to dehumanize us. Science is not on the side of masks, and neither is history.</p>

        <p>But what evidence is there for that campaign of dehumanisation? I can honestly say I don’t personally feel dehumanised while wearing a mask or when I see others wear a mask. It’s just a bit of cloth on someone’s face. Surely if there was a campaign to dehumanise us, the people perpetrating that campaign would have picked something more effective, that made everyone feel dehumanised? Or else why bother? </p>

        <p>My friend, I'm going to assume your query is honest.</p>
<p>The majority of people against masks are against them because of what they lead to which is a never ending overreach that pits citizen against citizen.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Last summer we were told to wear any rag on our face to protect others. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In November we are told by the CDC that the mask protects the user and other people. The mask debate should have ended here, if someone is afraid they can wear a mask and be protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few weeks ago we are told to wear two or three masks for protection. WTF?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The latest is the miracle vaccine will still require masks and social distancing. This came from the good doctor (Fauci) himself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is nothing more than a three ring circus with masks.</p>
<p>Now, my honest questions to you are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you think people that have PTSD from rape should be forced to wear a mask to make you feel safe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you think people that have had lung transplants, fibrosis in the lungs or low oxygen levels should be forced to wear a rag over their face that restricts breathing? Hint: if the mask doesn't restrict breathing it is doing no good against virus particles.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>I'm happy you feel that way, you sound reasonable. </p>
<p>The problem I have witnessed is the people that think the masks are the cure all are the people berating people for not wearing them without knowing why they are not wearing one. I have not witnessed someone not wearing a mask belittling somebody that is. It's always the other way around.</p>
<p>Another question I have for you is this. Do you think people that can not wear a face covering due to psychological or medical reasons should be forced to carry papers showing their exemption?</p>

        <p>Yeah I think it’s entirely right to challenge the idea that makes are some cure-all and that wearing them somehow makes you a wonderful person. Personally, and I understand many here will disagree with me, but I view them as a necessary inconvenience and something that likely has a comparatively minor impact on rates of transmission of the virus. I’m prepared to put up with wearing one if it means I might stop an elderly person getting sick or dying. A close family member of mine died of COVID. I’m willing to bear the inconvenience of wearing a mask if there’s even a tiny chance that it might spare another family the same.</p>
<p>Ermmm ... it’s a good question. I think I wouldn’t mandate people to carry around papers or anything to prove they have a medical reason for not wearing a mask, as I think that contravenes basic principles around privacy. In my country, people do things like wear a badge or a lanyard marking them as exempt from wearing a mask so they don’t get challenged unnecessarily as they go into a supermarket or something. It’s a less than perfect solution but I do think it’s a convenient one given the context of the situation. However, I can see how if you don’t believe in wearing a mask, you’d likely be opposed to displaying any public identifier of this. In short, I don’t think there’s an easy response to the issue you raise, or if there is I certainly don’t have that answer - not trying to cop out of replying to you, just that I honestly don’t know what the solution is to that one! </p>
<p>Thank you again for your response.</p>

        <p>There is an easy answer to the issue I raised though. </p>
<p>N95 and KN95 masks are readily available and they protect the wearer from particles. I would recommend the people concerned with contracting the virus utilize these masks. </p>

        <p>Countless studies showing no efficacy prior to 2020, and plenty of comparative evidence showing no correlation between mask mandates and use and outcome.</p>
<p>They also have large but broadly untested (because it would be inhumane) impacts on developing brains, both for emotion recognition and diction development.</p>
<p>The laws have been put in place with zero consideration for who should wear them, when, why, etc.</p>

        <p>This report (table 1 page 7) disputes that and found comparatively lower rates of disease transmission among mask wearers in a medical setting: https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/set-c/set-c-facemasks.pdf?la=en-GB&amp;hash=A22A87CB28F7D6AD9BD93BBCBFC2BB24</p>
<p>Your point around developing brains is an interesting one. Do you think that it would have that much of an impact on kids? Mask wearing is compulsory in indoor public places where I live and I’d argue that in that setting, kids are still seeing people’s faces a lot, their parents are probably not wearing masks at home, etc. Absolutely intend this as a totally civil challenge to your point, I think it’s a really interesting one and warrants discussion.</p>

        <p>FWIW I don’t like wearing a mask and don’t consider it to be some badge of honour. I just think it’s probably a reduction of risk to people around me if I do wear one. If you feel differently, fine. But I don’t think it’s really fair to assume I walk around preaching about masks being the magical cure-all or that I wear mine like a badge of honour or that I’m a wonderful person for doing so. Just like I don’t think you’re a terrible person for not wearing one - I might have a different opinion or believe that you should act differently, but that’s my opinion and I’m not looking for anyone to force you to act a certain way, nor for anyone to pat me on the back and tell me I’m wonderful for wearing a piece of cloth on my face. </p>
<p>I can’t wait for the day I can walk into a supermarket not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>&rt;why do you care so much about masks, specifically?</p>
<p>I don't really care about them, per se, it's moreso that I care about governments mandating their wearing in nearly every scenario. If someone wants to wear a mask, I don't care, feel free. We all need to protect the vulnerable, and take any and all personal precautions necessary in order to feel safe. That shouldn't equate to the government implementing wide-reaching mandates - mandates that always come with social distancing and many other restrictions, and perhaps even lockdowns. Things that have a wayyyy higher chance of harming a young and healthy person, such as myself.</p>
<p>You're seen as a saint if you wear a dirty old piece of cloth over your face, and a selfish grandma-killing meanie if you don't. It doesn't help that the vast majority of people wear their mask improperly, touch it incessantly, store it improperly, and/or don't wear a quality that's truly effective, perhaps making it worse than wearing no mask at all.</p>
<p>Just a note, though: Not everyone here is against masks, and even myself, I certainy recognize their use in particular scenarios. But acting like they're going to be a cure-all for the virus, like many (many) do, is lunacy.</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t think the argument that “COVID doesn’t exist” is possessed of any merit or really contributes to the debate.</p>
<p>No one here legitimately thinks that, and can provide any kind of legitimate, rational reason as to why. This entire sub is founded on the virus being, in fact, very real. We're just not fans of the less than ideal measures that have been taken to combat it.</p>
<p>&rt;Personally, I have no issue with wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And again, I have no issue with you wearing one. You do you. Just don't expect others to do the same.</p>
<p>&rt;If COVID truly isn’t as serious as people think (despite the huge body of evidence that it is indeed a very serious disease in a significant number of cases)</p>
<p>Depends on how you'd define "serious". Serious in the way that it's deadly and has potential to kill? Course. Serious in the way that we all need to freak the hell out about it and need to shut down the entire world because of it's stupidly high survival rate? Not so much.</p>
<p>&rt;I’ve suffered the minor inconvenience of having a piece of cloth over my face for a short time.</p>
<p>And that should be your personal choice. Everyone's life and thoughts are different, though, and I don't think it's government's job to determine how exactly we need to live our lives and how afraid we need to be.</p>
<p>If someone is terrified and paranoid of this virus, they should be staying inside, not going out to get their pumpkin spice latte and demanding that everyone else be as afraid as they are. They clearly don't care that much about staying safe. Though if that someone is being a good citizen and staying inside and taking personal precautions to stay safe, they have very little need to worry about all of the terrible grandma killers who don't wear a mask 24/7.</p>
<p>Life comes with risks, it happens. We live with the potential of dying at every second. Weigh your risks, take precautions, and go on with your life. Live yours, I'll live mine. Win-win.</p>

        <p>Really appreciate your time to respond and for the points you’ve made, I enjoyed reading your comment. I think ultimately you’re right, the virus isn’t going anywhere and is going to represent a level of risk to us in our lives for the foreseeable future. Guess the ideal would be for us to be at as low a level of risk as possible before we accept that this is something we have to live with. I’d feel the same as you if faced with the prospect of wearing a mask forever, I think. </p>
<p>While I don’t agree with everything you said, I fully respect your right to that opinion and really appreciate you taking the time to lay it out for me - thank you very much.</p>

        <p>Do you ever ask yourself why the Islamic religion wants their women to cover their face with a burqa? If not, I suggest digging into that topic and understand the psychological changes that occur in humans when they have their face taken away. Couple this with the very clear propaganda push by corporate giants and the suffocation of small business with these impossible governmental "health" measures. These holier than thou mask wearers love to scoff at this idea and minimize the very real impact that would occur when you aren't allowed a public face along with not being allowed to see others in public. I could understand voluntarily doing it, but these GLOBAL mandates reek of a similar psychological intent with the burqa and is definitely in violation of our rights as sovereign beings on this planet. </p>
<p>These rights are something no human can actually take away regardless of what public health scare your or anybody else is claiming to be happening. Your health and well being has always been your own responsibility since you are a sovereign being. I appreciate the concern about my health, but personally I think people all over the world need to start worrying more about their mental health rather than this sad worldwide health exercise in futility.</p>

        <p>I’ve got to say I really do think you’re conflating two issues that are not linked here. For a start, there has been no suggestion that mask wearing should or will become a permanent fixture of our lives. I’m sure more people would share some of your sentiments if that was the case, and I think until that discussion has genuinely arisen it’s probably not wise or fair to pre-empt it. </p>

<p>Here's an article about Fauci talking about possibly 2022, but we all know the goalposts have shifted this entire time and seeing how some of the public enjoy these measures, I'm not sure if they're entirely going to disappear ever...</p>
<p>I don't think you have any appreciation of how even 2 years of wearing these "face coverings" will impact society... some adults will recover, but a lot of young children will be scarred. Psychology does not care about your good intentions. Human beings are meant to see faces in order to develop and grow. 2 straight years of not seeing anyone's face will have repercussions and will further alienate a majority of people from one another. There will be massive psychological fallout for the younger generations. All the while, pharmaceuticals will have brand new clients to hand out their pills to and soothe since nobody else was allowed to be there for them. And no, this aspect will hardly ever be mentioned. Government does not care about mental health, and if they did... we would not be having these lockdowns.</p>

        <p>&rt; But I’ve a simple question - why do you care so much about masks, specifically? Why is it such a big deal to you if you don’t wear one? </p>
<p>Why do you think masks are the #1 issue here?</p>
<p>The sub is called "noNewNormal".  I am against lockdowns.  I dont <em>like</em> masks, but I also put mine on when I have to. And since I follow the rules I feel that gives me every right to be as vocal as I want against it.</p>
<p>Specifically when it comes to masks .. I dont think they are so effective. I have yet to see a study that really confirms that, although people say those studies are easy to find.</p>
<p>You might say "Well why not wear one anyways?"</p>
<p>Because I do think that that all of this is intended to make us compliant to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>If nobody wore masks, everybody would see that the world doesnt end and the hospitals dont break and there are no mass graves.  Like in Florida. Or <em>anywhere</em> where there is low/no mask compliance. And then there is no great fear of the the virus.  And that means that people say "no thanks" to the experimental vaccine.  And the government doesnt want that.</p>
<p>So they enforce masks. Wearing masks makes people afraid.  Because they think "Ok we maybe dont see flooded hospitals and mass graves, <em>but that is ONLY because people are wearing masks!</em></p>
<p>So having everyone in masks increases the fear. It paints a picture of the "Covid Apocalypse" that would happen if people <em>didnt</em> wear masks. There is the nightmare vision of what would happen if we DIDNT hold off the "full effect" of the pandemic with mask and distancing protocols.</p>
<p>(Even though whenever places dont take those protocols, somehow the "nightmare scenario" <em>never happens</em>)</p>
<p>So masks make people agreeable to the vaccine. And that's why I think things would be a whole lot better if everybody took their masks off and we could see that the hospitals dont flood and the doctors dont have to refuse medical treatment to people and there are no mass graves.</p>
<p>All of that was a big fairy tale designed to scare us into taking the vaccine.</p>

<p>How many years will you consider a short time? If 2 years from now everyone is still masked, will you still feel the same?</p>

        <p>I literally cannot breathe while wearing one because I have an actual respiratory issue.</p>
<p>I don’t care if others want to wear them, I care that I’m being excluded from society in many places and situations that I never had an issue being in before.</p>
<p>Supposedly mask mandates don’t apply to people with medical exemption but my experience tells me lots of places just assume I’m lying and so my ability to function as part of society has become very limited.</p>
<p>Also masking is doing untold harm to children and creating massive anxiety and mental illness as kids are being taught to fear other humans rather than socialize with them up close and in person as nature always intended.</p>
