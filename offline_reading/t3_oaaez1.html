        <p>Wow. This is an amazing episode and this guy's research on Covid-19 in Canada is phenomenal.<br>
Also highly recommend Trish Wood's podcast in general for anyone interested in this Covid-19 fiasco. I've recently come across it. She is simply amazing and learned so much from her podcast.<br>

From the Julius Ruechel's website above.<br>
"The remarkable story told by the data exposes in almost comical relief just how shamefully the government whipped the public into fear by cultivating a sense of vulnerability that is entirely out of touch with reality. But the data set goes even further than that. Written in black and white in the government's own official numbers, published by the Public Health Agency of Canada, lies the evidence that the blame for much of the dying lies squarely in policymakers' hands for decisions taken on its turf, behind institutional walls, and not with the individual actions and choices made by citizens out in the broader community.<br>
No matter how familiar you think you are with the chaos that has unfolded over the past 15 months, I guarantee you there are surprises in this investigative report for everyone. And I believe it contains the conclusive evidence to hold our leaders legally accountable for the lethal consequences of abandoning long-established pandemic protocols, which were meticulously-documented in the WHO's 2019 pandemic planning guide and which were specifically designed to prevent the epidemic of fear and DIY ad-hoc rule-making that have been on display throughout this crisis.
