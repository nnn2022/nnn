        <p>As time passes, the ranking of deaths per capita is getting more and more erratic. It gets more and more difficult to correlate the rigor of the lockdown adopted with the result (less deaths per capita than others that were more relaxed). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>USA is passing Sweden and the world champion is the Peoples´s Democratic Republic of Peru, with 900 deaths per million, where Kim Jong Martin Vizcarra imposed that you only could shop at supermarkets once a week according to your ID number (now this rule is more relaxed). The brazilian press tells us all the time of the Peru and Argentina lockdowns to make us believe that Bolsonaro is a mass murderer because he has not imposed that rigor to us, brazilians.</p>

        <p>With the way your numbers are plateauing in Brazil with minimal mitigation, those countries are about to look even more foolish. While I don’t think Bolsonaro’s level of flippancy towards the situation helped matters, I don’t necessarily think he had the wrong idea. He knew it was going to do what it do.</p>

<p>There were serious mitigation measures, but not uniform in the entire country and not decided by Bolsonaro. State governors decide, according to our Supreme Court. The judiciary interfered in lockdowns all the time. We don´t have a single pandemic, we have multiple pandemics in different stages at the same time.</p>
<p>In São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, for example, all non essential stores, bars, gyms and restaurants were closed and I am working from home. In Florianopolis, buses were shut down. Fortaleza and São Luis had full lockdowns with roadblocks where you had to explain why and where you were going.</p>

        <p>There is only one thing that is more stupid than a lockdown: the president order a natiowide lockdown in a country that is bigger than the entire western europe. The problem is that the doomer press was expecting that and Bolsonaro provoked, telling it was a small flu.</p>

        <p>This knocks Sweden out of the top 10. Though it's still not good to be that high, they are at a point where they are fading, whereas the rest of the world is rising and still locked/masked and saddled with the economic and health destruction that comes with that.</p>
