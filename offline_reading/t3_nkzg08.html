    <strong>"You're the reason we will be living this way forever"</strong>
    <p><p>So, long story short - my best friend is a biologist, and likes to think of herself as a treasure trove of factual information when it comes to anything related to the virus or science in general.</p>
<p>Recently, she got her first dose of Moderna and the only thing she can talk about now is the need to implement mandatory vaccinations and how "restrictions are the key to returning to normal". At first it was quite easy to avoid the topic, simply changing the conversation - however, now it's almost like she has fixated herself on trying to get ME to go and sign up for the shot (funny, because prior to this I was never the focus of any conversation). Every conversation somehow has started to stem back to COVID-19 and vaccines - sometimes her even claiming that I'm the "main" reason that we will be living in pandemic mode forever, simply because I don't want to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The other day, it honestly got to be a bit too much - when she begins to claim that the vaccine method was developed and perfected over the last 60 years (copy/paste vaccines) and that "western governments would never push something they deemed harmful to their citizens" - which made me think, wow how can you truly believe that? With this conversation ending on the same note, she decided to give me a subtle ultimatum - "if you don't get vaccinated, don't come around" basically.</p>
<p>I'm just starting to realize that if I continue to avoid the subject, I will start to have to avoid her pretty soon. Any advice for someone trying to undergo an amicable friend breakup with a doomer?</p>
<p>Biggest issue is we currently have a few projects and organizational duties for our work hanging between us both. It's difficult to fully cut ties with someone you literally share administrational duties with. It's also incredibly heartbreaking to see a dear friend slip into COVID madness. </p></p>
