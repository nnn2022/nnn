    <strong>Starting to Break (Mask Hysteria)</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a hospital and I’ve gone so far as to avoid wearing masks even while working at the hospital, which I’m sure you can imagine is already a bold move.</p>
<p>I never wear an exemption type badge in my daily life but did get one for the purpose of just being at the hospital as I was not going to get around easily without one (I was constantly hassled and managerial issues).</p>
<p>I’ve had quite a bit of grief from my manager but I stood my ground and said I’m not wearing a mask and I am not breaking the law doing so as I am exempt which is covered in the Gov rules. If I was breaking the law then that would be a different story. </p>
<p>He reluctantly said fine after I got the exemption badge but then obviously everyday I’m constantly stared at by people and I am constantly telling myself to ignore this and just keep standing tall .. to be honest I do not know how I’ve lasted this long but today was hard because:</p>
<p>I went to work in the more corporate building across from the hospital and the programme director asked to speak with me and he said that I can’t be walking around without a face mask as within the office are people who work in and out of covid wards and he said it’s not fair to them.</p>
<p>I stood my ground yet again and showed my badge but he basically said without a mask I can’t work in the building anymore which on one hand is fine because I work in another office usually but on the other hand it sucks because I feel completely ostracised as if I’m a bad person.</p>
<p>My company (external company to the hospital) as a whole always aim to have various inclusion networks which obviously I support but now I feel completely discriminated against because I genuinely have issues wearing the mask and people probably feel I’m faking it.</p>
<p>It’s getting harder by the day and it just sucks so much. I miss the days when masks weren’t a thing and I was easily able to brighten someone else’s day by smiling and making them laugh and not think I was doing something wrong for my face being exposed :(</p>
<p>Hopefully I don’t lose my job anytime soon because as difficult as it is I won’t give in, just feeling like I’m breaking over all this.</p></p>

        <p>How did you survive a whole year of a DeAdLy GlObAl PaNdEmIc without a mask whilst working in a hospital!? </p>
<p>You are courageous for standing up for what you believe and have a valid medical reason for. Stand your ground and don't give an inch. It never ceases to amaze me how the pro-C19 vax people want everyone to get jabbed so that the vulnerable who can't be jabbed don't have to, but when someone can't medically use a mask when everyone else does, the rules suddenly get changed. </p>
<p>It may suck to be seen as a pariah but don't flinch. They cannot coerce you to wear a mask and the Masketeers should remember that "their masks protect you from them." I am not from the US, but I am pretty sure that you can sue if they dare sack you for a valid medical reason.</p>

        <p>Taking a stand on crimes against humanity is a noble thing. You are a trailblazer, this doesn't come without a price. You'll be called selfish, you'll be publicly shamed, but never forget you are a defender of freedom. A leader, a walking symbol of hope.</p>

        <p>Imagine thinking you’re a super hero for not wearing a small piece of fabric on your face so we can stop the spread of a virus. In a hospital nonetheless. Fingers crossed you get fired. God forbid you kill someone with an autoimmune disease or cancer. Or is that real science and Covid isn’t? This sub is full of baby boomers with a savior complex about “holding the line”. Looking forward to this sub being gone soon. Also “badge”? Haha! What are you 12?</p>

        <p>Oh god. Way to kill my vibe. My guy, your comment history is concerning. I think you need to step away from the keyboard. Really hope you get some help in the future. Maybe if your family or kids (god I hope not) ever start talking to you again they’ll be able to help as well. Can’t even imagine what your Facebook or any other social media looks like. Anyway, good luck.</p>

        <p>Can I ask you some questions?<br>
Why do you so strongly choose to not wear a mask?<br>
I just wonder because you even work in a hospital, around many possibly sick people, in danger of getting sick? And what issues do you have when wearing a face mask? And why do you think you are being "discriminated" against?</p>

        <p>The people coming into the hospital are already sick. We never required hospital staff to walk around with masks on. Clinician's know that potentially getting sick themselves comes with the nature of the job. If the OP is sick they would stay home otherwise I don't see why this is even an issue.</p>

<p>I guess it was a fair question, but this is something I passionately despise about 'doomers:' they accuse us of being 'selfish' - for saying things that don't affect them matter too (go figure...) - but then dogpile the disabled, ill, and abused. It's evil and grotesquely selfish.</p>
