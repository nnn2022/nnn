    <strong>Thoughts on freebies for vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I'm Nikou, a reporter at the <a href="https://ft.com/">Financial Times</a> and I'd like to know whether various companies'/states' freebies to encourage vaccination are actually working.</p>
<p>There are lots of freebies if you get vaccinated and show proof - for example, Krispy Kreme gives a free donut, Governor Ned Lamont in Connecticut gives a free drink, Governor Hogan in Maryland gives $100 to state employees, and Lidl employees get a $200 bonus.</p>
<p>What do you think of this?</p>
<p>Were you or anyone you know encouraged to get a vaccine in the US because of freebies? I'm all ears for stories of whether or not these offers encourage you to get vaccinated and why.</p>
<p>I won't share your name without your permission - I take that very seriously, and I'm more than happy to answer questions about my story.</p></p>

        <p>Well, you know that old saying “Everyone’s got a price”? For some it’s a donut. Some it’s a coffee. To me it seems a bit degrading knowing that someone out there thinks that my price to take an experimental gene therapy is a donut. </p>
<p>You can’t tell me that this new technology was tested and vetted within a year. My soul is worth a lot more than a donut.</p>

        <p>If the virus was as dangerous as they claimed it to be people wouldn't have to be coerced into getting it. Free donuts or $100 does absolutely nothing to entice me to get an experimental gene therapy shot for a disease that poses very little threat to me</p>

        <p>It's a ridiculous indication of how desperate they are to get compliance. Which makes me even more sceptical than I typically am. The greater their payoff the less likely I am to get it. Then again it's hard to get lower than a zero chance.</p>

        <p>Getting further. But just from me. That would probably work for people on the fence. Maybe offer one free donut per day per shot. Now we're getting somewhere. Get a punch card going. Just a matter of time.</p>

        <p>I think these freebies highlight what a farce this whole thing is.</p>
<p>Never mind that 70-80% of those that die of the virus are obese!?!!? It'd be laughable if it wasn't so tragic.</p>
<p>Anyone that's gets swayed against their better judgement by donuts..... Well, thats something special for sure.</p>

        <p>i have my own money and don't want or need freebies. i don't think anybody i know was incentivized by free stuff, they may have taken advantage of the deal just because, but it wasn't their reason for getting the shot.</p>

        <p>The empty hospitals with dancing Tik-Tok nurses didn't convince me, but did somebody say donut with sprinkles? 
Good grief, you are in the wrong place.  Glad I don't have a subscription to FT.</p>

        <p>It makes me incredibly suspicious and even less likely to want a vaccine.</p>
<p>The government (in the US at least) doesn’t even provide free insulin or any other life-saving treatments. So, yes it is very suspicious to me that they are pushing this “free” vaccine. Why would they do that? The government doesn’t care about our health in other situations, so why are they so desperate to vaccinate?</p>

        <p>This. They let people die of many treatable illnesses every day because of inflated prices and offer no relief. Why is a covid vaccine more essential than providing life-saving medical care to people with chronic conditions?</p>

        <p>I think it’s insulting to people to try and bribe them to get a vaccine. It feels like we’re being treated like children or pets. “Here doggy- do a trick and you’ll get a treat!” I think incentives won’t make a difference. People who want a vaccine will get one. People who don’t want one won’t change their mind because Krispy Kreme offered them a free donut. I think they should let the chips fall where they may, and odds are really high that combined with natural infections, we will have more than enough vaccinations to achieve herd immunity.</p>
