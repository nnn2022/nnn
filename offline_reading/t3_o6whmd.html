    <strong>This is about money, not a virus.</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone, don't you see? This is ALL about money. Please let me explain.</p>
<p>Before 1971, the US Dollar was pegged to gold and all the world's currencies were pegged to the US Dollar. Then on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon took the US Dollar off the gold standard and therefore all currencies worldwide simultaneously began their purely unbacked fiat era.</p>
<p>This means you can no longer go into a bank and trade your currency 1:1 for physical gold or silver. Instead, these markets began free floating. This was the end of sound money in the world.</p>
<p>100% of previous attempts at unbacked fiat currencies throughout history have failed for the exact same reasons we are seeing today. Inflation slowly eats away at your purchasing power over decades in a way most people don't even realize.</p>
<p>At the very end of the currency experiment, there is so much debt in the system, the currency MUST hyperinflate in order to prevent cascading debt defaults, which is one of the main reasons for the Dark Ages after the fall of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Dark Ages was really bad causing mass famines, starvation, and unsanitary conditions which led to the Black Plague. Very few people escaped the ravages of such immense wealth destruction. So, when choosing between hyperinflation and cascading debt defaults, currency controllers will always choose hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Fast forward 50 years after Richard Nixon removed the gold standard, and you come to today where the elites are trying to usher in a "Great Reset" due to the massive wealth disparities and systemic corruption.</p>
<p>Currencies all around the world are currently hyperinflating due to unsustainable national and personal debt, and while hyperinflation is really bad for the individual, as a whole, it’s far better than the alternative.</p>
<p>In fact, during hyperinflation is when the greatest amount of wealth is created for those that are positioned appropriately ahead of time. Just look at how the ultra rich top 1% increased their net worth by a collective $2 trillion Dollars. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-and-that-s-a-daunting-sign-for-our-recovery/</p>
<p>This is the REAL reason governments shut down the world economy all at the same time (in order to control the destruction of the currency). It has nothing to do with a virus with a 97.8% survival rate. The elites are intentionally gaslighting everyone with lockdowns and fearmongering so we don't figure out what's actually happening.</p>
<p>There is good news in all of this chaos — you can protect yourself and your family, and even profit handsomely by getting completely 100% out of the dying financial system. Buy physical real world assets, and especially physical hold-in-your-hands gold and silver.</p>
<p>This is how a currency reset is performed: allowing gold and silver to return to its fundamental value, then pegging the currency against the metal. Then, after the metal is pegged to the currency, the currency controllers will cut off zeroes from the end of the currency, immediately devaluing everything in society at the same time giving the <em>appearance</em> of a collapse even though the supply of currency continues to rise exponentially.</p>
<p>For example, $1,000 instantly becomes worth $1, so a $5 million Dollar mansion suddenly costs only $5,000. And since your physical gold is worth ~$2,000/oz before the reset is complete, all it would take in this example is 2.5 ounces to buy it free and clear.</p>
<p>Do you see how this event can be <em>extremely</em> destabilizing, cause mass riots, starvation, political executions, wars, etc? It’s an incredibly dangerous time financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally, but preparing yourself ahead of time will literally change your life and the life of your family. Just make sure you're on the right side of the trade.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, that is a real risk. You need to prepare yourself for that possibility as well. Food becomes the #1 issue during hyperinflation. Have a LARGE stockpile of emergency food and clean drinking water backup and ideally after the reset, use your gold and silver to buy farmland so you can continue to eat.</p>

        <p>I think the fact that cryptocurrencies have risen so dramatically this past year and a half is no accident. The banks know they are destroying the currency, and they know the value of physical metals too and are using cryptocurrencies as a distraction. I believe they are printing currency with the sole intention of filling up the reservoirs of Bitcoin and others, so the masses are attracted to those (and the stock market too) rather than gold and silver. Meanwhile the banks and central banks around the world have been buying up unprecedented amounts of physical gold and silver themselves, in order to prepare for the currency reset. Basel III is a set of new international banking regulations that peg the world's currencies to physical, stable assets like gold and land. These regulations are set to begin taking effect on June 28th, 2021 (yes, in about 4 days).</p>

        <p>I also think a major reason they're pushing those is to acclimate people into digital currencies, and then transition everyone into the "Central Bank Digital Currency" or CBDC that over 80% of global central banks are currently developing.</p>
<p>When these come out, the central banks will have absolute control (their words, not mine) over everyone's personal finances and can steal your wealth more effectively and faster too. One of the big reasons they're pushing us into this is so they can implement negative interest rates.</p>
<p>This will create a permanent, inescapable divide between the rich and the poor with no middle class, since the rich will be able to borrow money and get paid to do so. They'll also be able to control individual finances through artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>If you do something they don't like, such as jaywalk, they can punish you and immediately deduct your account balance. This is a real-life example of what China is already doing and has been doing for the last several years.</p>
<p>They'll also be able to tell you what you can and cannot buy, and they'll have such a detailed view of the flow of money worldwide that their own personal investments will be guaranteed to profit.</p>
<p>It’s a level of control that's frankly terrifying, so if you had any doubts about the governments already, this will only magnify their power exponentially.</p>
<p>Think of this stuff in terms of incentives for the people who control the system, not the individuals. It’s in <em>their</em> best interests to have digital currencies, not in the public's best interests. 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>If you can only get jewelry, that's definitely better than holding onto cash, but the most ideal version is what's called investment grade "bullion" as this is the most concentrated form of the metal. It usually comes in a purity rating of 99.9% or 99.99%. This guarantees your safety (so long as you take good care of it and don't lose it or allow it to be stolen, etc) and gives you the greatest purchasing power on the other side of the currency reset.</p>

        <p>Of course. You can buy it online and have it shipped to you (depending on where exactly in the world you are) or if you have a Local Coin Shop or LCS, you can usually go there. Having gold and silver coins are also very good and still better than jewelry. If you'd like to search online, here's an excellent site that gives you the most metal for your currency. This is what's called "spot price" and the premiums above spot is what the dealers themselves charge to make a profit for their business. https://findbullionprices.com/closest-to-spot/?category=gold&amp;</p>

        <p>Not the OP however ... IMO gold / silver jewellery is ok but watches are probably no good. </p>
<p>They cost exponentially more than the value of precious metals used to make them, and that is when they even have any precious metals at all. Often times they are just stainless steel and have near zero intrinsic value.</p>
<p>When SHTF, most likely luxury watches without any precious metals will go to the same heap of garbage as other overpriced luxury scams like $10000 louis vuitton bags made of PVC. These things only have a brand value associated with the current marketing system, not thousands of years of historical use as a currency or inherent rarity. </p>
<p>Jewellery other than gold and silver is also a waste IMO. Most gemstones and especially diamonds are abundant rocks and can also be artificially created at will. They are nothing more than shiny carbon or silica.</p>

        <p>Buy 5% btc and 5% gold to hedge the incoming collapse of USD. </p>
<p>Buy arable land in Michigan/Minnesota 1-2 acres is all you need. Ensure water source exists. </p>
<p>Buy a large cache of seeds and 1-2 years of dry rations. </p>

        <p>Honestly, I'd say 5% of gold is WAY too little. I personally think you need to have at least 50% of your wealth in precious metals and that's me being conservative.</p>
<p>The rest of what you say, I totally agree with. You need to protect yourself and your family.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, to be fair I meant 5% of your current assets. Most people don’t own what was in my shopping list. </p>
<p>Post acquisition, it could be 50% of your remaining liquid assets that you should transition into hard currencies (btc, gold, light jewels).</p>
