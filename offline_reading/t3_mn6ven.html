    <strong>On what basis was the lockdown lifted at first?</strong>
    <p><p>At first all countries went for lockdown saying if not implemented, the cases would rise and deaths would rise. We all stayed indoors.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden lockdown was lifted in phases. They said the curve has been flattened. How does that happen? Cases go up or down according to how people interact. If lockdown is lifted without vaccines being given, shouldn't the cases be rising like anything? That's not happening.</p>
<p>If this was an actual pandemic, would they even bother lifting the lockdown?</p></p>
