<title>Vaccine passports were a “baseless conspiracy theory a year back.” They are currently in the process of being rolled out in many countries right now, and it will be a slow conditioning that ramps up and leads to you needing permission to do anything.</title>

        <p>And this also paves the way for needing “papers” for anything else they choose.  We are transitioning into a new era that in a way aligns with our past and does not end well for us. Many will not see it this way because the information the average person consumes is purposefully designed so you see everything the way they want you to see it.</p>

        <p>In Pre-Covid life I was a travel agent and a missionary overseas. Showing vaccine documentation is not a new thing to me, because depending on the country you are entering they could have a list of vaccines that you are either required (or strongly recommended)  to have and you show documentation at customs. </p>
<p>Its hard to wrap my head around a vaccine requirement for trans border travel between Canada and US because we have the luxury of social distancing (space), access to clean water and soap to wash our hands, the ability to buy over the counter medicine if needed or a doctor. However there are many countries where that is not the case and a vaccine requirement to enter makes sense because you are making choice to wanting to travel there. </p>
<p>Of course this is not what meme is referencing to but whenever the discussion of vaccine passport comes up those are my thoughts.</p>

        <p>This has nothing to do with passports to travel between countries. This is about a passport you’ll need to to show proof wherever you go that you’ve  been injected with an experimental drug that is not FDA approved and with no long term studies created by pharmaceutical companies with a long history of paying billions in criminal fines, just so you can be allowed do many anything in your own country. Attend concerts, enter specific stores, etc.</p>

        <p>Public schools have required vaccinations for decades. This isn’t unique. And FDA approval is likely coming there’s not sufficient data to stop it. Will you be willing to get vaccinated after FDA approval or does that just change your argument?</p>

        <p>Again this is different... ever attended a concert that requires you to open your phone and provide a QR code proof of your vaccination status to enter the building? Do you think that’s ok? Same thing for entering stores to purchase things. </p>
<p>No, FDA approval wouldn’t change my thoughts, Because I do not need this particular vaccine. I’m a very healthy individual with a strong immune system and I’ve done my research on statistics, and this particular virus is no threat to myself, and the vast majority of the population for the matter. I am also not anti vaccine, but we do not need a vaccine for everything, especially simple viruses anyone with a decent immune system can fight off. </p>
<p>So no it’s not ok for people who choose to not get this particular vaccine to be segregated from the rest of the population and be denied entry into many places.</p>

        <p>I’m not arguing that it isn’t different. But it’s also not apples to oranges. The picture/meme implies or inferred commonalities between the government asking for proof of vaccination before letting people travel “freely” with what looks like Nazi concentration camps. Correct me if I’m wrong and it’s something else. But I’d say the government trying to manage public health issues is different. It’s a ridiculous leap if anything. And I see people on this sub constantly use the FDA approval as a point for their argument however, I think to most people in this sub it’s irrelevant. They won’t get it regardless. So it’s really just a tool for furthering the narrative.</p>

        <p>you don’t need a vax passport to go shopping either, unless you’re required to wear a mask and even then it’s very rare you’re gonna be confronted about it. It’s like you need your drivers license but you only really need it if you get stopped, it’s not a big deal plus you can just wear a mask</p>

        <p>Well, as things currently stand, none of that is actually enforceable here. Including masks. It's actually illegal to ask people to provide personal medical information. Violates the Privacy Act, and likely also has Charter implications as well. So anyone can simply refuse to say whether they're vaccinated or not.  </p>
<p>Or, simply fucking lie about it, which is what most people who aren't vaccinated are likely going to do. Without any sort of federal, or even provincial database infrastructure, there is no way to keep track of any of it. Even if they issue out cards, which at this juncture, would be extremely easy to forge.  </p>
<p>The problem is that it's even being talked about in the first place. It would absolutely be a Charter violation on multiple fronts if an actual vaccine passport system was ever implemented. It would create a tiered society of "haves" and "have nots", and would essentially remove personal freedom of choice and bodily autonomy from the equation. Because even if the vaccine(s) weren't technically "mandatory", it would be moot if you literally weren't allowed to do anything without a vaccine passport.  </p>
<p>Anyone who can't understand how utterly, catastrophically destructive this would be, is a complete fucking moron.</p>

        <p>well that’s the thing, people shouldn’t have to provide a passport because the only people they’re hurting are themselves however a private business on private property can make whatever rules they want as long as they don’t discriminate against people who can’t do anything about it, so because you can get a mask very easily for no money and the vax for free it isn’t discrimination and plus someone can kick you off privately owned property for any reason they want if they own it but needing a vax passport to go on like public transport is bs</p>

        <p>Because before all of this, if someone came into any store with their face covered, it was because they were planning to rob the place, you fucking cretin. It's a basic safety issue, for my employees and actual customers. And again, if other businesses are allowed to enforce masks, I'm allowed to do the opposite.  </p>
<p>But even if it wasn't a safety issue, I think people wearing masks everywhere is stupid. It's an eyesore, and a reminder of how idiotic this entire shit show has been. You'd better believe I'm going to push back against it. Sticking to convictions is the opposite of hypocrisy.  </p>

        <p>You assumed that I agree that the coof is dangerous. I do not. There have been a grand total of 600 "COVID-associated deaths" in my province over the span of longer than a year-and-a-half. I have not personally even met anyone, let alone come into contact with anyone who has had it. Although being that I am healthy and not remotely at risk for this, I could have caught it and didn't even realized it months ago, especially since I traveled interprovincially several times since this shit show started.</p>
<p>The "body count" actually does lie. As per the CDC, they count some 12,000 "COVID-associated" deaths under the category of "unintentional and intentional injury, poisonings, and other adverse events".</p>
<p>Go ahead and try to tell me what else "unintentional and intentional" injuries could possibly mean other than "accidents and murders/suicides", my bucko.</p>
<p>They also list "influenza and pneumonia" (because pneumonia follows influenza as a secondary bacterial infection) as the single most common comorbidity, to the tune of nearly 275,000. This is in spite of the fact that the media talking heads have repeatedly claimed that "masking and social distancing" have "eradicated the flu". Obviously, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Further, they plainly state that only some 5% of COVID-associated deaths had "COVID only" on the death certificate. 100% of these cases would have been elderly people who were already well into the average life expectancy range.</p>
<p>Oh...but you can, like...wear a mask with your favorite sports team's logo on it.</p>

        <p>so we’re discounting all the people with say athsma or other underlying conditions who were living just perfectly fine and then all of a sudden got covid and died? apparently covid really isn’t a big deal, all of the major health organizations around the world are trying to contain this virus but behold all the worries are futile because u/ SpaceRenegadeX has cracked the code!!! it’s all just people with the flu and people committing suicide or getting shot (probably by those BLM guys tbh). honestly you’ve convinced me, i can not believe Sleepy Joe actually tricked me into getting a microchip implanted inside of my, now he’ll find out about my secret piss fetish! 😟. thank you good sir you have really shown me the light</p>

        <p>Okay, so explain how 12,000 murders/suicides and accidents got counted as COVID deaths. =\^]  </p>
<p>And why there are 275,000 flu deaths alongside COVID-associated comorbidities, in spite of the fact that they've claimed that the flu was "wiped out".</p>

        <p>12,000 deaths were counted probably because those people had covid, and it was a contributing factor in them dying, if you get poisoned and the virus enhances the poison to a point where it is fatal that can justifiably be counted as a covid related death. also even if all 12k were BS that still leaves &rt;600k deaths. plus if you did a google search and read for 2 mins you would know that the flu can lead to respiratory problems and organ failure which means if covid is also in the body (a virus that is VERY good at cause respiratory problems) the two combined overpowers the body and leads to death, again without covid the person probably survives as most recover from the flu pretty quickly. also if the flu was eradicated why do we still vax against it and still produce new vaxs every year against it??</p>

        <p>I'm not the one saying that the flu was eradicated, my bucko.</p>
<p>So you're going to sit here and claim that a person eating a bullet died "from" COVID, lol. You really are a fucking moron. *"Viruses enhance poison!!!"* Yeah, gimme a sec, I'm just gonna enhance my arsenic with a little bit of extra virus juice. I wanna make sure it's EXTRA deadly</p>
<p>You are beclowning yourself more and more each time you try to justify this shit.</p>
<p>I already mentioned that influenza segues into pneumonia as a secondary infection.</p>
<p>There are an average of four serious comorbidities with each "COVID-associated" death. And the vast majority of said deaths are in the elderly segment of the population. People who have already reached or exceeded the average life expectancy. At best, the coof is a complication.</p>
<p>As an example, the average life expectancy of someone with diabetes is ten years less than the average. So in the US, that's around 68 years old. An unhealthy, obese, elderly person can catch a common cold that can lead to complications resulting in death.</p>
<p>And also, with the Silent Generation and Boomers reaching and exceeding average life expectancy in increasingly large numbers, it's been long-known that a mass die-off was coming in those age groups.</p>
<p>You're getting pretty upset for someone who claims to "not care", though. And all because you think I should force my customers to wear masks in my own store. Tsk-tsk. You champagne authoritarians and your chicanery. Little rapscallions.<br>

        <p>i don’t think your customers should wear masks, your customers can do whatever they want. and even if someone is going to die tomorrow, if covid contributed to them dying today that still counts… furthermore not all poison is straight death, most militaries use incapacitating agents which have severe effects but overall don’t kill, obviously these are engineered but poisoning refers to a similar circumstance where someone probably could have survived long enough to get medical treatment but covid killed them too fast. i even said “even if all 12k were BS there’s still over 600k deaths”. lastly i really don’t care because in the end me and the people i care about are all vaxed and are at an extremely low risk from covid, i just like arguing against bad points</p>

        <p>None of my points were bad. They are all correct. The tonal shift in your replies demonstrates that clearly. Before, you were far less confrontational. Now you're attempting to convince me, in spite of simultaneously claiming that you "don't care."  </p>
<p>If you didn't care, you would have abandoned this long ago. But, if what you say is actually true, then you've just admitted to being here in bad faith. So, either way, you've lost.  </p>
