    <strong>I feel sad because I'm alone. Alone in a world where everyone blindly follows anything. I have no-one by my side</strong>
    <p><p>It's literally the most depressing thing ever. It's only going to get worse as we go forward. Majority of my friends and family are mere sheep who don't question anything. They believe the vaccines, lockdown, eradication of jobs, social distancing is a good thing.</p>
<p>What can you do against such force? I try my best to make people understand but I get labelled a "conspiracy theorist" - typical. </p>
<p>I want to stand up for my freedom but it seems everyone around me doesn't give a shit.</p></p>

        <p>This might sound crazy but the only people I’ve recently found that have any shred of sanity who aren’t deceived by the Covidian Cult are at a church that is defying the lockdown order out here in California. I get there is much controversy over the Christian Church, but true followers of Christ still exist and are nothing like the way our culture depicts all “Christians”. Not sure where you are located but I pray you can find a similar group of people that can give you some hope and who will share your burdens with you. God bless you</p>

        <p>Everywhere you go there is somebody who thinks just like you that feels just as isolated. They might even be judging you for seeming like you dont care as you go about your day. </p>
<p>Talking to everyday people (in person), it seems like only a small minority actually believe in the covid cult. Majority just go along even tho it seems dumb. Most are afraid to speak up but once you get them to be honest they think exactly like the ppl on this sub. </p>
<p>Shoot, if Im honest I am afraid to speak up around people I dont know I can trust.</p>
