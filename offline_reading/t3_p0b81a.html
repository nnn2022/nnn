    <strong>Curious scientist looking for research.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everybody. Im currently studying for a phd in computational molecular biology and im currently locked down in Sydney Australia. </p>
<p>Last week I posted here to discuss science with anyone whose curious about vaccines or immunology. Yall sent me some really interesting articles i wouldn't have read otherwise and i wanted to thank you and put up the offer again to see if anyone had more questions.</p></p>

        <p>Cool job description. Anyways, I've got a couple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've been pretty much floored by that cost-benefit analysis of the scientific community in their desire to vaccinate every person they can irrespective of demographics/age/etc. What is the calculus behind the justification of vaccinating people with something we have no data to reference and when there is virtually no chance many of these subgroups die from covid? "Herd immunity" alone given the mortality rate for most people that we now know seems pretty weak sauce; I've literally met drug dealers who have made more conservative risk calculations than "inject everyone, I guess we'll see how it goes"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is there lack of transparency in such data/calculations? Can't yall make it open source so people curious like me can fork it on github? i.e. show me how public officials calculated the need for lockdown in Sydney (inputs, dependencies, unknowns, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, I've lost total faith in policy makers and public health officials. Transparency = trust</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely scientists have done a terrible job of communicating our work to the public. It's not something we're trained to do. I'd be more than happy to get into the systemic issues in academia and how it can be insular and toxic, it's called the ivory tower for a reason, but in exchange for all of this we produce rigorous research where we pour over every detail. Can't tell you how much stress and tears can into a single sentence in a scientific article, it's like pulling teeth.</p>
<p>To your first point. There is an explicit cost benefit analysis of vaccination and that's exactly how advice is given, on the ballance of risk. If you're Australian (i am) you'll be familiar with this example. The Astra Zeneca covid vaccines been discovered to cause fatal blood clots in about 2 in 1 million people. A low but not insignificant risk by any stretch. Our regulatory authorities have changed the advice about who should get the vaccine 3 seperate times as more has been learned about who the blood clotting disorder effects and the likelihood of poor outcomes if someone catches covid. You can see their modelling here: <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/06/covid-19-vaccination-weighing-up-the-potential-benefits-against-risk-of-harm-from-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca_1.pdf">https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/06/covid-19-vaccination-weighing-up-the-potential-benefits-against-risk-of-harm-from-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca_1.pdf</a>In some countries this vaccine has been halted and restarted on the ballance of risk. The fact that governments and regulatory agencies are willing to make these extremely costly decisions should build your confidence in these therapeutics. They spent literal billions of dollars to buy these vaccines rapidly and have shown complete willingness to throw them out if they show any problems.</p>
<p>The Australian regulator even releases weekly reports on the number of adverse events. I can find out if the US does too if you like, I know they have a database but IDK if they report clearly like this. <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-05-08-2021">https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-05-08-2021</a> Take note that this is raw data and needs to be interpreted carefully this can be difficult without good statistics knowledge. For example f someone has a heart attack the day after getting the vaccine it would be reported as an adverse event but given there are 805 000 heart attacks a year in a population the size of the US you would expect, just on chance, that a certain number of people would have heart attacks after the vaccine and it might not be related. You have to collect the statistics and look at the data to see if more people than you expect are getting adverse events. This is constantly being done with databases like the one i linked. We've collected enough statistics now that you can expect that there are no adverse events with probabilities greater than 1 in 1 million. We have given out billions of doses.I can try find some more US examples if you're interested.</p>
<p>Your second point. I think the problem isn't transperancy or the availability of data as much as a communication problem, we're all drowning in information but we don't understand any of it. Specific health advice given to politicians, yeah I think that should probably be public. I'm right there with you asking for accountability and transperancy in this. What you can trust though is that the research and data that that health advice is based on is publicly available and scientists are working extremely hard to make sure it's correct and study areas which need looking into. There are HUGE repositories of covid research and data that you can look at if you want. Completely free. The following are not peer reviewed. I can find you more if you want. I know of some cool modelling done for the Australian population.<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">https://www.biorxiv.org/</a><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">https://www.medrxiv.org/</a></p>
<p>Here is the product information from the australian regulator where it shows exaclty what is in the pfizer vaccine. <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210125-pi.pdf">https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210125-pi.pdf</a> Note how the document suggests administration of vaccines only on the ballance of risk. People in their 20s and 30s are still more likely to have severe complications from covid than the vaccine, so it protects them too. I probably should have put more detail on this but this post is super long now.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that the lockdowns for sydney at least are completely justified. Our hospitals are stressed with even a small outbreak. 1% of cases are in the ICU right now. People in their 20s and 30s have died. That's nuts. Yes they should be more transparent. But what they do tell us show us that this is really bad and we need to contain it. </p>
<p>Let me know if you wanna know more, I'm happy to chat.</p>
