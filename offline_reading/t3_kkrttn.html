        <p>Strange mixed feelings about this. I'm sure the social media backlash is "Even if you're vaccinated you still can't travel evil grandma killer! Stay in your house forever! This is the new normal and you're not allowed to fly!"</p>
<p>In that sense I Iike the ad because it's in a sense calling for a return to normality. Airline companies are probably one of the most desperate for a return to normality. So I'd like to think there are some "good guy" big industries we can identify. Airlines, hotel chains, are probably two of those. They and their employees need a return to normality for their survival.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ad is clearly part of the carrot and stick manipulation to get people to get the vaccine. They're sort of forced into that though. They know vaccines will eventually be required to enter most nations. Eventually probably just to fly domestically even. So they're in a position thar their survival demands both a return to normal and compliance with the authourities imposing the "new normal." It's a shitty spot to be in.</p>
<p>The only reason I'm getting the vaccine is because I know it will be required for international travel, which is what I miss more than anything. So clearly the carrot and stick approach works. I'm not antivaxxer. I get the flu shot every year. I get more vaccines than are really needed actually. This particular one though the potential for side effects clearly outweighs the risk if the vaccine for most people.</p>

        <p>It might be OK if it was just airlines but it's not. They are talking about requiring it for lots of places even workplace or denying social security. That is forceful injection or economic sanction. How can anyone talk about this so casually I just don't understand it.</p>

        <p>It's not "ok". Not in anyway. And I'm totally against forced vaccinations. I'm not "ok" with any of this</p>

        <p>Neither am I. I didn't mean ok as in this context. Heck I'm not ok with it in any context really..</p>
<p>The carrot and stick only works if you give up your rights like they did with the masks etc. People should not cave to coercion and blackmail. This could all go away if we just refused.</p>

        <p>Then how can you possibly be willing to comply with it?! Don't you see that if the majority refuses they won't be able to enforce it?</p>
