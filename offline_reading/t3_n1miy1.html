        <p>"The report warned that it would likely be harder for health officials to encourage unvaccinated Americans to receive one of the available Covid-19 vaccines once demand decreases."</p>
<p>So I'm guessing the experimental group part of the population that begged and lined up for the vaccine is about done volunteering?  That's awesome that demand is going down, but I'm worried what is the next step is the propaganda machine will pick up steam and try to force the rest of us, the control group into the fold, by manipulation and force.  Hell, the local college here just announced yesterday they are requiring vaccine proof to attend the coming Fall semester.  What's next?  Jobs and employment? Traveling state to state, or to another country?  Where does it end?  Once you give up liberties they are extremely difficult to ever get back.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm bracing for that.  We're basically all being lead to the gallows for holding our ground.  You can buckle and maybe survive, or be made an example of in some terrible fashion.</p>
<p>I'm going to hold my ground for as long as I can.  I've made an uneasy peace with that, but I have to be honest I'm pretty afraid.  Resistance means becoming a pariah, an unperson.  Maybe covid will reduce enough over the summer they might let us go, but I wouldn't count on it.  It's too politically powerful of a tool.</p>

        <p>My gut instinct says I think they are planning to make all corporations and eventually all places of employment require it, or try to, and then that eventually means either getting a paycheck and eating, or not for a lot of people and their family.  Especially since in the last year alone we've had the largest transfer of wealth from shutting down or 1/2 capacity small businesses, but as Amazon, Walmart, and other big corps have made record profits.  I joke to my wife and say "One day I assume we will all work for Amazon/Walmart/Google/etc or whatever it will be called, but we will all work for the same company".  It's devious shit, and it's on purpose.  Consolidation of wealth and control to the few.  And dividing us.  Red/Blue teams.  Vax/no vax teams.  And the have's/have nots.  As I've witnessed in the last year I have family members who's income hasn't changed and they view the world WAY differently than others I know who've had their hours and pay cut.  Dividing friends and family, just as planned.</p>

        <p>Just saw a panel of red state governors on TV all saying that their state already had or were in the process of legally blocking all of this BS, including Florida saying specifically that he would make it illegal for airlines operating in florida to require vaccinations.</p>

        <p>Good. Being forced to provide your papers or proof of a vax just to live your life by your own choices should be illegal.</p>

        <p>If they did, it would trigger the interstate commerce clause... But, each of those governors officially invited you to move to their Free States.</p>

        <p>I mean, how does anybody really explain the government shutting down our businesses and taking away our livelihoods, and then giving us 2.5 stimulus checks for a whole year.  Nobody could survive on that.  That's like beating you into submission.  They either should have let us decide how to open and where to shop on our own, or if they were going to shut us down completely, then actually pay us to survive until the worst was over.  This half in/half out bullshit is insanity.  The beatings will continue until morale improves is the new American slogan this past year.</p>
