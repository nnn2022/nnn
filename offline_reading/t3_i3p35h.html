        <p>I think organized meetings like the big one in Germany are gonna be taken off social media before they can gather support. It's absolute bull and there is little alternative to starting these things in 2020.</p>

        <p>A theory of mines explaining why that event has been suppressed so much is that it might show that they have barely any impact on the number of cases.</p>

        <p>The big problem will be our social media landscape, news media, and how our reactions are.</p>
<p>Media is LOVING this! This is the best thing they could have hoped for. And we're eating it up (both sides, of course). All three big cable networks are soaking up the advertising revenue because they are enticing their key demos to stay there (and since they have their attention with nowhere or way to turn away...SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS HAVE YOUR WAY WITH THEM). Don't forget about the YouTube shows like TYT that just hollers and screams at you that everything is life and death and that political. They play to advertisers who are just as worried about PR than anyone would be.</p>
<p>There's also social media where people just lose their minds if you go even one letter against the approved message. I swear r/Coronavirus got taken over by the same Cancel Culture crowd that has plagued social media for a few years now. This is just another method to weed out who they feel are Trump supporters, regardless of who they actually are (because it's depended on THEIR definitions that casts such a huge net over everyone that it's near impossible to prove themselves otherwise), and they don't ever stop typing for a moment to allow themselves to actually read their responses.</p>
<p>And this is about health, too. People have died to this, though probably not as many as we are being told because of the benefits hospitals get from needing funding for the COVID stuff, so people will be more susceptible than they usually are, and the doomers know it. </p>
<p>If there is going to be a call for sanity, it needs to be where the above will stop talking for two minutes.</p>
