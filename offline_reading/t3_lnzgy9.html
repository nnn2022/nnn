        <p>You statistically would have to know about 700 people to have a good chance of personally knowing even one person whose died. And thats assuming the numbers arent massively overinflated which they of course are.</p>

        <p>I know roughly a dozen people that have had it. Three were hospitalized. Two of the three were heavy smokers. The rest had symptoms ranging from barely a sniffe to absolute misery for a couple days. Two people I know have died from restrictions. My uncle had difficulty getting non covid medical care and died from complications of an infection. A family friend commmitted suicide by alcohol.</p>

        <p>My younger sister, and her BF, and my grandparents got it. Both grandparents no symptoms.</p>
<p>My sis headache and fever for 3 days. Her BF same. Although the PCR-tests dont work properly i doubt my grandparents had it for real.</p>

        <p>I know one person that my grandma insists was a shining being of Immaculate Health with no pre-existing conditions that supposedly died from the virus</p>
<p><em>spoiler</em></p>
<p>Grandma is full of shit and I know it, it was her 2nd cousin so she's being defensive </p>
<p>I know a couple of other people that had plenty of comorbidities  that caught it that are totally fine</p>
<p>like dementia ridden and who is like 280 lb, extremely diabetic, high blood sugar, high blood pressure now she's straight dude she's totally good </p>
<p>The logic is that coronavirus is so bad it can exacerbate any medical condition and that can put you over the edge </p>
<p>however my uncle who had to have his leg cut off for gangrene, well he had coronavirus at the time, however no no no see his leg just had to come off because of his pre-existing conditions </p>
<p>coronavirus did not exacerbate that </p>
<p>That's not how it worked with him </p>
<p>but that's how it works with everybody else</p>
<p>🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡</p>
<p>I keep asking people</p>
<p>When was the last time you saw anybody coughing, or sick?</p>
<p>because the only reminder that we have that there is a  disease are the masks</p>
<p>Unfortunately most people in Florida don't even realize how incredibly lucky they are to not have their lives absolutely completely destroyed by the authoritarian government, uch as my mother, she has no idea what the rest of the world is going through and how lucky she is to be in Florida.</p>
<p>She runs a used car dealership and was out out of work in March, she is the definition of a sheep, she doesn't want to believe that anything is going on because that's just crazy talk</p>

        <p>I work in healthcare. So, yesterday? Humans experience different things throughout their lives. I decided to go into healthcare, I deal with a statistically disproportionate amount of sick people. I can only write words to describe what I experience to you (in this context), so take that how you will.</p>

        <p>Nice anecdote. We've had hundreds of deaths at my hospital from covid but 0 from the vaccine. I work in healthcare and most of the staff have had their first shot.</p>
<p>There have been a half million deaths from covid. How many have died from the vaccine?</p>
<p>You dont have to just look at US data. There is data for all sorts of countries. Look at data/statistics from Israel, UK, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, etc. There's so much</p>

<p>So much hype in a single sentence. Doing drugs have nothing to do with health. It's drugcare.</p>

        <p>So you're telling me you've had hundreds of people that were completely healthy  just dropped dead from the virus?</p>
<p>We are here because this is supposedly a pandemic where people cannot be allowed to live normal life because we will kill each other because it's so infectious and deadly to regular healthy people</p>

        <p>There is no agenda to keep people at home for the sake of it. Why would there be? What is the incentive for doing that? </p>
<p>When the covid numbers drop, restrictions drop. Restaurants have re-opened in California after the case rate dropped significantly.</p>
<p>&rt;So you're telling me you've had hundreds of people that were completely healthy just dropped dead from the virus?</p>
<p>The vast majority of them are 70+ and/or have pre-existing conditions. They were mothers/fathers/grandparent who are forced to say goodbye on facetime.</p>
