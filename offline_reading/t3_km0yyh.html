        <p>I think teaching kids sign language is a great idea, but it should never be a substitute for talking unless of course the child is hearing impaired. </p>
<p>I didn’t think of this until now but deaf kids are missing out on the chance to learn how to read lips because of the stupid masks.</p>

        <p>I'm in college age and I'm so bloody grateful that I wasn't a child when this hysteria happened. Children aren't very vulnerable to the virus, but are vulnerable  to mental health issues. Day to day life is a nightmare because of communication difficulties, blaming-shaming mindset and people seeing me as a burden for not understanding them when masked. Shops and the state especially. I'm currently learning sign language. It started as a lighthearted hobby that I didn't think much over, but now I'm learning it because of I may need it. My comprehension rate probably went from normal to less than 10%. It bloody sucks that I didn't get a diagnosis. I'm a person with perfect hearing according to tests, but socially deaf and have no right on interpreters.</p>
<p>I wished more people knew sign language and that it's not taboo. Because of fear of infection people avoid as much body movements as possible and tries to talk with their mouth closed, in addition to mask wearing. I've seen these people unmasked in plexi glass cubicle talking with the mouth closed.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you’re going through this. </p>
<p>I have fairly normal hearing but ADHD makes it harder for me to follow a conversation and I get distracted easily. Masks make it almost impossible, it’s like I lose my motivation to interact fast. I’m a really talkative and outgoing person normally but I notice myself getting out of breath when I have a mask on and just not wanting to talk to people.</p>

        <p>I was going to say, the sign language I know has come in handy more often than you'd believe even before all this nonsense happened; something as simple as learning the alphabet will prove its utility to you time and again.  But to do that as an excuse to keep the mask crap going...</p>

        <p>Teaching sign language is a fantastic idea, but are they teaching these kids sign language, or only "O, Canada" in ASL?</p>

        <p>Many pro-lockdown and pro-restrictions people sees singing and speech as dangerous because of it spreads droplets. Usually you're expected to stand 6 feets apart, wear a mask and talk - but with your mouth almost closed. In some countries moving your body too much like gesture and sign language are considered dangerous too for pushing the air with virus in it on other people, but this country has a more positive view on sign language. So, the school decided to do sign language as a loophole when they found out singing and speech are too dangerous.</p>
