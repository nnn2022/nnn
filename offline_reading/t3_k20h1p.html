    <strong>I am a pro masker/lockdown-er, please explain to me why you guys think these things are bad</strong>
    <p><p>No hate btw only skepticism but I have seen a lot of posts without logic, and I don't understand how they make sense, my questions
1. Masks are pieces of cloth which do not restrict breathing and reduce the chance of catching a highly communicable disease so what's wrong with that???
2. If this virus is a plot to control or whatever else you say  then why are many of rich people and famous politicians are personalitys from both side of the political spectrum being affected???
3.If you have to stay home and avoid spreading a disease to save a few people, why not do that, afterall the solution to black plague was quarantines</p>
<p>If you have answers or think I am wrong comment section is all open, I can only comment once every 10 minutes so I may not be able to reply to you all</p></p>

        <p>The numbers written in there are concerning but number of people affected by the virus seem to be more, it's a trade off, if we'd have continued like normal all these lives would've been saved but if you check the current numbers for covid, there is no doubt that they would've 5 folded if not 10 folded, the loss of workforce personel wouldve led to an economic crash anyway, idk about you but I feel all these deaths and economic loss is better compared to widespread death waves and complete economic crash, it could mean an end for many poor countries and huge loss for developing countries</p>

        <p>I don’t believe lockdowns are good because has a very high survivability rate and young and health people hardly die from it. So why not just isolate the people that actually have a chance of dying if that’s the case?</p>
<p>The economy can’t just wait and people need to work and pay bills. It’s so stupid to make everyone stay home, when 99% of these folks won’t have any serious symptom. And the economy broken affects way more people, not to mention the quantity of small business and companies that closed in the meantime.</p>
<p>And people with mental illness like anxiety and depression suffer way more, and have to deal with lockdowns way worse. The suicide rate has gone way up, and domestic violence too.</p>

        <p>Young and healthy people may have a reduced chance of dying but there are many who have pre existing health conditions and are old, idk man 2 million deaths and still increasing seems like a reason to pause the economy to me, as these deaths could be avoided if not for people protesting and public gatherings in general, futile loss of life should always be avoided, that's what I believe and so do most of the people apparently</p>

        <p>Err, you can’t “pause” economy. It won’t just wait for us to resume our life, you can’t freeze economical health. It’s simply not like that. The bills will keep on coming and we will have to pay them anyway. There’s no such a thing as “pausing economy”. We tried pausing and what happened? 700k+ small business closed ONLY in my country, i can’t even imagine how many worldwide. That’s people starving, people who lost jobs and have to find another way.</p>
<p>And yeah, 2 million might’ve died but the majority of these deaths were older people or people with existing conditions, that’s why i said to isolate only those. And i guarantee the deaths DUE to covid were lower than that, because if you die with, say, cancer but happen to have covid, your death will be counted towards covid. So yeah, i ver way less people died BECAUSE of it. </p>
<p>And i her way more than 2 million died because of consequences of lockdown. Suicide, mental illness, starving, diseases that couldn’t be treated because of lockdown, domestic violence, the list goes on...</p>

        <p>Before I say anything... Is <em>your country</em> America, because if that's the case then that's administrations fault, funneling money to big corporations from the poor, letting people die for profits, the list goes on, that's all I'll say, let this say the rest</p>

        <p>I am from Brazil. The president looks like Trump a bit and he didn’t really wanna close stuff but they did anyway. And they had to go out if business for the entire April and would come back mid May, but many shops never came back and had to shut the doors forever.</p>
<p>The government handled a misery to keep families alive and buy enough food and pay bills and it wasn’t enough. Some kept working anyways because there wasn’t any choice, but some lucky guys could enjoy home office tho. </p>
<p>Now things are slowly going back to normal here and shops are popping out here and there again.</p>

<li>But if this virus is so bad and terrible, why don't people who are afraid of catching it just stay inside and be lazy? It's easier than ever to do so, and you're in favor of lockdowns. I know that's what I'd do, instead of going out in public and want everyone else be as afraid as I am and demand everyone else follow my safety and sanitation standards to make myself feel better.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, masks are very hit or miss when it comes to actually preventing the spread or even protecting yourself. Maybe if <em>everyone properly</em> wore a high quality mask, then sure. But that isn't happening and won't ever happen, even with pro-maskers. Plus you also have millions upon millions of businesses and school children that have been effected by the mask mandates and social distancing protocols.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You mean all the rich celebrities and politicians who say we need to wear masks, socially distance, not travel for holidays, etc. who then support/proceed to not wear a mask, not socially distance, and/or travel for the holidays? All the while they have no need to worry about their job, home, kid's education, and mental health? This effects the Average Joe wayyy more than it does the rich and famous. But the celebrities and politicians need to virtue signal and/or make it seem like they're doing something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I should shut down my entire life in order to maybe sorta possibly avoid spreading a virus to someone that has an incredibly slim chance of killing or even harming them? Can we ban all cars while we're at it in order to quell the massive amount of car-related incidents and deaths? You have a way higher chance of being directly harmed from going to the store to pick up a massive jug of hand santizer than you do if you maybe possibly catch this virus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can't at all compare the Black Plague to this weak as fuck virus, come on. If this was the Black Plague spreading around, I'd have no problem wearing masks and staying home. But it isn't.</p>

        <p>1.No one who wants lockdowns goes out and protests for people to follow lockdowns except for a few snowflakes in the usa</p>
<p>Additionally wearing a piece of cloth to greatly reduce the chance of a virus doesn't seem that bad, even cheap surgical masks are very effective and they are less than 10 cents in most countries, not in America cause thats... No, American healthcare system is fucked</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes I know they don't have to worry about that issues, I am talking about the famous people who died, if this was a plot from the government, they wouldnt have died</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many people who actually have to throw their life away because of this crisis but most can pass just fine and I bet you are one of the latter like me, if however we resume everything like normal everyone will have to <em>throw away their lives</em> due to economic crashes by people dying and getting infected 5 fold if not 10 fold, the loss of workforce would be a devastating blow to many countries and total collapse for many and it's not even like the people are entirely helpless, there are organisations working to feed them and help them and incentives have been setup to donate money to feed people by a click of a button from us</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And do you ever ignore a fire in your house just because there has been a bigger fire before, I understand 0.5 percent may seem small 1.5 million dead is still a lot which could've been avoided if not for protests and public gatherings in general</p>

<li>I'm referring specifically to all the people who go out of their way to go out in public, but demand everyone else there (regular people or employees) wear a mask, socially distance, wash everything every ten seconds, etc. If someone is that afraid, they can stay home and take all precautionary measure they see fit to feel safe, as opposed to forcing it on everybody else just so they can feel a little better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hey, if you'd like to wear a mask, feel free. Just don't expect everyone else to. Again, take whatever measures you see fit to stay safe.</p>
<p>1b. I'm not conspiriatorial and don't pay attention to things such as that. It isn't really a serious thought in our community, for what it's worth. Maybe with some, but you can say such things about any community</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not like my life has ended, no. But I can tell you that I've been much more effected by the "treatment" of this virus than I've been effected directly by the virus itself. I haven't had it, nor has anyone I know aside from an aunt and uncle in their 50s all the way across the country from me, who recovered just fine a week later). Whereas many people I know and am close to have been effected by the lockdowns and restrictions. Effect such as job loss, home loss, poverty, starvation, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, falling behind in school, depression, anxiety, suicide. And that's just to start.</li>
</ol>
<p>What it boils down to is masks, restrictions, and lockdowns might kinda sorta help some people potentially be harmed. But the side effects of the "treatment" have definitively and directly effected millions upon millions.</p>
<p>You act like this will actually be the Black Plague though. Yes, many more people will catch the virus, and yes, many more people will die. But protect the vulnerable, take what precautions you'd like, and we can mitigate the damage while recovering the economy. The odds of someone dying from this virus, especially if they're even a halfway healthy and/or not very elderly person are crazyy high. I'm confident the effect of opening up is far less than the effects of lockdowns we've seen. Plus, it's a virus. It's likely to end up spreading either way, as we've been seeing.</p>
<p>A small fire in my house, if direct action isn't taken by me, will result in my loss of property and death. This virus, if direct action isn't taken by me, is incredibly likely not to at all result in my loss of property or death. I have a way higher chance of being harmed/killed by the effects of lockdowns. I get the point you're trying to make, but not every public health crisis needs to be treated equally. It's like dropping a nuke on some local rioters.</p>

        <p>I am not pro- or anti-mask. I believe that my health should not be placed in your hands, unless you are my attending medical professional. If I want or need to cover my face, I should have the right to do so. And vice versa.</p>
<p>A lockdown is only acceptable under the right conditions: it must apply to <strong>everyone</strong>; it must be as short as possible; and its duration must be clearly defined. Unfortunately, this action will only protect the locked-down population. Once it's over, the non-locked-down population cannot be allowed access to those who have protected themselves, or it's back to Square One.</p>

        <p>Who do you think the people to tell you to wear a mask are, idiots and non medical professionals??? 
And no you should not have the right to refuse to wear a simple piece of cloth not harming you to protect others, being against that is just being a special snowflake and the lockdown is effective due to essential workers, they have no choice but to work, treating the sick can't be helped and the scientists working to create a vaccine aren't superhumans like you to predict exactly when it will be ready, the lockdown will end when a vaccine will end hopefully by April and after it's ready and everyone is vaccinated, there is no harm from the virus</p>

        <p>&rt; Who do you think the people to tell you to wear a mask are, idiots and non medical professionals??? </p>
<p>They are not my attending medical professionals. I take health advice from them, not random people with "M.D." after their names. I certainly am never going to be taking health advice from politicians.</p>
<p>&rt; And no you should not have the right to refuse to wear a simple piece of cloth</p>
<p>Yes. I indeed do have that right. I've studied my history; I've seen what happens when folks follow mandates to wear "a simple piece of cloth" in public. A world war was fought in part to protect those people.</p>
<p>&rt; the lockdown is effective due to essential workers, they have no choice but to work, treating the sick can't be helped</p>
<p>Neither is educating our children. But that fact just proves that "essential workers" can indeed choose not to work. Nurses and doctors and paramedics and police can indeed stay home and protect themselves. No one can force them to risk their lives to treat you if you get sick.</p>
<p>&rt; the lockdown will end when a vaccine will end hopefully by April and after it's ready and everyone is vaccinated, there is no harm from the virus</p>
<p>Lockdowns that allow anyone to leave their homes are not effective. At all. This new virus will be with us forever, vaccine or no vaccine. Everyone will not be vaccinated. Some will choose to take their chances with the virus, or have been infected already.</p>
