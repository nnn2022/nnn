    <strong>How Covid relates to elitism and liberal rejection of populism.</strong>
    <p><p>So, first off, we need to recognize that populism is not a bad thing. Populism itself was invented as an alternative to the major political parties. It's a real political movement with real roots. In it's original form it was meant to tap into the wisdom of the people. </p>
<p>In the 1950s there was a school of intellectuals who's work was labelled "Consensus History". They became very "concerned" with working class movements of all kinds. They considered them dangerous. They even blamed McCarthyism on the working class, among other things. They were very much threatened by large scale working class political movements and proposed that they are always inherently authoritarian, anti-intellectual, paranoid, racist or xenophobic, etc. Sound familiar?  Because a lot of people hold onto this belief today. </p>
<p>We can directly thank Richard Hofstadter for this. The groups belief on populism came from his work where he erroneously defined populism in those terms. It was not an organic changing of definition over history. The definition was flipped, in prejudice, to suit the anti-working class sentiment of the group.</p>
<p>This not so subtle prejudice against the working class is alive and well today. You'll see it from the elite democratic class who see working class people as "deplorable". Meanwhile republicans tap into the original idea of populism but they don't actually follow through with anything. All in all, to be honest, working class people are under represented and as Ive described even considered dangerous and evil.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the suppression and dismissal of working class people ties right into the covid divide. It's people without privilege, with real lives and real world problems, that are pushing back against lockdowns, etc. "The people" in their wisdom know this shit needs to end. Liberals, including their small numbers but dominant voices that shape twitter/reddit, are simply giving us the populist-label treatment. It doesn't matter what the majority of people believe or feel. Our plight and our voices, and our collective wisdom does not matter. In fact, the proposition that they ever would matter is inherently "wrong". It's been destroyed, for years, by elitist assholes who wish to sit in ivory towers and decide our fates.</p></p>

        <p>The American and French Revolutions were successful because the bourgeoisie had become economically disenfranchised. I think a lot of COVID related propaganda is to keep the white collar class locked at home and insulated from the crashing economy by using the pandemic as an excuse.</p>
