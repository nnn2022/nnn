        <p>If those idiots actually knew anything about biology, they would know that the old and immunocompromised are those most inherently at-risk of most diseases and that being younger and healthier is inherently the ultimate key to achieving herd immunity. </p>
<p>They would also realize that the ecosystem has a carrying capacity and thus cannot sustain itself if and when organism populations become too large and dense; viruses help regulate this. If you're trying to save everybody, you're only contributing to the problem of overexploitation of resources and overpopulation</p>
<p>It sucks, but it's how nature is. I am not trying to go kill anybody, but viruses always will happen and will exist long beyond humans. We never shut our lives off for other ailments, so why this one? Most people who claim "tHeY fOlLoW tHe ScIeNcE" are misinformed as all hell</p>

        <p>One thing I realized is that its almost impossible to convince a doomer. At the end they"ll say "but what about the LoNG TeRm effects" and completely ignore all the other arguments. Little do they know that every virus can cause long term effects so its not something new and its not on a large scale. This is good news but they dont like/want good news.</p>

        <p>I'd be more concerned about long term effects from the vaccine, not the virus, though there probably are long term effects from both the virus and vaccine.  I'm wondering which is worse.  Step right up, folks! Play the virus game! What's your choice? Catch the Virus or get the arm jab! Win a long term prize! You pays your money and you takes your chances! Step right up!</p>

        <p>This is where the wording and lack of scale is creating such a problem in the dialogue. COVID-19 does have a higher rate of these long term effects than your average virus this is true... however, the scale is lost when they "forget" that the rate was already incredibly low to begin with. Like saying that you have a better chance of winning the Pick 3 than the Powerball. The odds of winning the pick 3 is pretty low, even if it is greater than the odds of winning the Powerball.</p>

        <p>And if they knew anything about history or agriculture, they'd laugh at the nonsensical Malthusian implication that we're <em>anywhere</em> near capacity.  Unfortunately, our society keeps pushing further and further toward the idea that the amount your view matters is directly proportional to the number of letters after your name, and ignores that the latter is also directly proportional to your tendency to view the world through that one specific lens.</p>

        <p>This went from “biology” to “people should die from viruses to save us from overpopulation” really quick. </p>
<p>If your argument is truly based on the fact that we should solve the ‘overexploitation of resources and overpopulation’ by not treating this virus, you’d have no issue with the abolition of all hospitals, pharmaceutical centers, or otherwise any place that would treat your illnesses. In other words: Why stop at just this virus, but let people die from all viruses to stop overpopulation?</p>
<p>For the sake of saving us from overpopulation, per your argument. </p>
<p>“We never shut our lives off for other ailments, so why this one?” It seems like you’re missing the point. </p>
<p>I’m going to assume that you’ve trusted your doctors insight (while acknowledging the pharmaceutical interests at play) up until 2019-2020 when the virus hit. If you trusted doctors up until then, why would you stop trusting them? If you think they all of a sudden got bought out, you’re just a conspiracy theorist, otherwise you’ve assumed something to be true that isn’t. </p>
<p>“I am not trying to go kill anybody,” while you may not be trying to kill anybody, you can still kill anybody. You could give this virus to somebody, and they live. But they pass it to somebody, and they live. But they pass it to somebody, and they live and so on. But then it passes to somebody who doesn’t live. This virus is a trolly problem. Knowing that the virus won’t kill all people (but only some), do you flip the lever to start the chain that ends up killing that one person? Or do you socially distance and wear a mask?</p>

        <p>The funny thing is that it is running its own course regardless of what we do.   Look at the case and mortality curves from around the world.  They all behave independently of lockdowns and mask mandates.   No one is dropping like flies either.  Just look at the all cause mortality data.  There really is nothing remarkable about 2020 in terms of mortality compared to previous years.</p>

        <p>I’m so tired of the liberal bashing. Get your head out of your ass. 
I identify as liberal-left, yet I do not identify with the cancel culture, the mandated mask wearing, or the closing of the economy. Stop politicizing and further dividing people. Labeling and othering only creates more hate and doesn’t help in constructive dialogue.</p>

The guy who wrote this is now a Mask lover who blames people who do not wear masks on the spread of the virus, and says that Sweden has done everything wrong.</p>

        <p>Skepticism becomes more difficult the more social and political pressure there is.</p>
<p>In this case, it is not just soft pressure, but governments are stealing everyone's rights as a way to create pressure.</p>
<p>In other words, this is a time when the integrity of your skepticism is put to the test. It's really easy to be skeptic for things that aren't that relevant, but it becomes way more difficult when it is about things that basically relate to your actual freedom and future.</p>
<p>As I discovered when talking with Maddox about this, they are just basically lashing out on easy targets, with a naïve belief that by doing that things will go back to normal.</p>
<p>They do not realize that in fact it is them who are the problem.</p>

        <p>I went from being pretty happy with the government and society to being completely disenchanted.</p>
<p>I never payed attention to 911, I didn't take the toxic left seriously. I thought the PC stuff was bullshit - as long as it didn't affect my life I didn't care. I  thought when I heard of "anti maskers" they were ridiculous and why would you care? just don't wear them. Living in my own world carefree.</p>
<p>Now I realize that I am an anti masker.. and I also realize that labeling us as anti maskers and 'anti science' delegitimatizes us. It is about so much more than masks.</p>
<p>This covid thing has turned my world upside down- it brought me from living in a world where I more or less got along with everyone to where it is "us vs them". I have mentally written off every single person who associates with it. I look at them as lesser people. Watching people drive by wearing masks and hearing about families who refuse to meet up inside... GAG.</p>
<p>It's bad, but I can't help it. I guess that is the downside of being unplugged.</p>

        <p>This comment, to me, does not count as data. If you have some peer reviewed research that you can cite for your overwhelmingly clear data, I’d happily investigate. I believe you could be right and am willing to accept the new data if you have it. </p>
<p>So far, though, from my friends on both sides of the aisle the amount of legitimate data I have received is sparse at best. Mostly it’s lofty claims about how totally wrong the other side is, without supporting references - i.e., your comment. I find it unlikely that so many people disagree with your conclusion, if the data really is so overwhelmingly clear. The fact that the data is controversial should give anyone pause before they claim that it is “overwhelmingly clear”. If that’s true, then either half of the population is just idiotic (which I don’t believe) or you are missing something.</p>
<p>This just further highlights the danger that this article describes - the use of “science” to support claims that are not “scientific” (typically, as I’ve seen, for political purposes) is destroying the validity of science  as an argument and the trust that the general public puts into the scientific method.</p>

        <p>Again, you just made a huge claim about how right you are and how wrong everyone else is, without citing any real sources or providing and real data. This is an opinion, not legitimate scientific data. You could call it a “hypothesis” that needs to be proven. </p>
<p>Your hypothesis stated could be “all data points to masks being ineffective in preventing the spread of Corona virus”. Now, as a scientist, you would need to do testing of that hypothesis. If you find even one case where the data indicates otherwise, then you need to revise your hypothesis. </p>
<p>Here is one case: 
-https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf
This is research conducted by the university of California (or atleast they cited it on their website). Here’s one of the conclusions:</p>
<p>“Although no randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the use of masks as source control for SARS-CoV-2 has been pub- lished, a number of studies have attempted to indirectly esti- mate the efficacy of masks. Overall, an evidence review (29) finds "moderate certainty evidence shows that the use of hand- washing plus masks probably reduces the spread of respiratory viruses."</p>
<p>So I’d encourage you to revise your hypothesis. Maybe “most” data indicates that masks are ineffective. But it is not “every case and mortality curve on the planet”. </p>
<p>Im not trying to tell you what the truth is about masks. I don’t really think I have the necessary info to do that. What I am saying is this: please stop citing “data” and “facts” in your arguments on important issues without actually providing those data and facts. And please, for the love of god, don’t mar the beautiful efficacy of science by citing its validity for obviously un scientific 
Claims.</p>

        <p>They are saying it themselves "no randomized controlled trials", what this means is that most of these studies are observational studies, which really do not translate well in the real world, for things like community transmission, since there are so many variables and things going on, that's why there are RCT studies in the first place, and why they are seen as the gold standard in medical studies.</p>
<p>Thing is, there are about 2 RCT's that have look into the efficacy of Masks, one in a Hospital Setting, done back in the 2009 pandemic, and one in Community Setting, done this year.</p>
<p>Both of them give inconclusive results, which at least means that even if they are effective, the effectivity is so low that the results become inconclusive.</p>
<p>The thing is the following, most of the mask support comes from very simplistic modeling, when it isn't even that clear the dynamics of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, and there is more and more evidence that asymptomatic patients, who are the whole reason why there is a call for wide community usage of masks, really aren't a main drive for the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>It would be more rational and evidence based if masks recommendations were targeted at people with actual symptoms, but even then you need to make a risk management assessment about benefits vs risks that masks bring themselves.</p>
<p>There is also observational studies that have shown that masks might be a source of infection if not used correctly, not to mention of the societal and mental damage it can have in different populations.</p>
<p>The thing is, the current way masks are being pushed is not Evidence based, and it is not at all science based, since even questioning the effectivity of masks and talking about things like risks have become somehow frowned upon.</p>
<p>The main reason why they are being pushed is just what has kept this whole debacle alive for so long, irrational fear.</p>
<p>When there is a high rate of irrational fear, things that otherwise would be ignored because of low evidence or probability of actual benefits is seen as a "posible salvation", and people will do ANYTHING to keep themselves safe.</p>

        <p>Clear observational evidence from every location that has mask mandates.  You are so disingenuous with this because there is a plethora of content out there pre-pandemic pointing to limited efficacy on masks and now we have widespread observational evidence that places without masks (Florida, South Dakota, Iowa, Sweden, Egypt, etc) are in no worse position than anywhere else.  When your interventions have no discernible effect, it means they don't work.  I'm not throwing around the term "science" here, you are.  The evidence is clear and you're just not willing to look at it.</p>

        <p>I genuinely would love to see and evaluate this data. Do you have links or references that you can share friend? I assume we’re on the same team - we both want people to be healthy and safe in their everyday life. If masks don’t really help that in any way then by all means, let’s drop ‘em.</p>
<p>Is this, perhaps, what you are referencing?
-https://tomwoods.com/covid/
Tom argues here that mask mandates are not having a significant impact on positive test cases for Covid - he cites state specific data on positive test cases and compares that to the start date of mask mandates. Let me know if I’m looking at the same data as you.</p>

        <p>Not really. He still understands that the virus is really not that deadly, and understands that there is no hard evidence for mask wearing, but he chooses to go that route because he just "wants to go back to normal" and sees masks as a "provable way to do it".
I discussed with him, and in the end it became really clear that he was just looking someone to blame for the what is going on, and saw blaming people who are against masks as the easy target, since "it is so easy to just wear a mask".</p>

        <p>Nice, I like this a lot.</p>
<p>It very much relates to how governments and idiots keep shoving the word "science" down our throats while producing very little of it. </p>
<p>If only I was clever enough to realise this promotion of atheism and science as a religion was leading to the retardedness of 2020 ten years ago. </p>
<p>I was attracted by atheism myself but seeing how religious people are more likely to be aware of what humanity is and what human dignity is and that no man has a right to dictate over your life as long as you aren't harming anyone. It's really got me feeling different about the whole thing and suspicious about why atheism was pushed so hard in the first place.</p>
<p>I don't trust anything anymore. All those anti Vaxx subs that popped up a couple of years ago. You really think that happened naturally or do you think it could have been preparation and conditioning for this year? We need to all start realising these things are real. Ideologies are pushed to change the way you see yourself in the world. </p>
<p>Another thing to add to this would be the conspiracy theorist articles that popped up in every major publication in November last year. It's obvious once you see it.</p>
<p>So yes, the fb group "I fucking love science" is of course the same thing. Nothing to do with science but conditioning people to think that they love it and that it is their new religion. </p>
<p>Bam. Now we can manipulate you by saying "science" every other word.</p>

        <p>I hate to say this, honestly, but I feel like 2020 was the year science fell the fuck off and jumped the shark.
I don't mean this as a slight to any scientists!  Much respect to the people doing all the hard, boring work of trying infer theory and truth from observed evidence and possibly even develope sound predictive models and efficacious agents of utility.  </p>
<p>The problem, for me, is the exploitation and likely hijacking of scientific institutions and the creation of celebrity scientists and simplistic, shrill narratives. 
My faith in (what the public thinks of as) science has been severely wounded by the commercial conflicts,  authoritarianism, scientism, pseudo science, hysteria and orthodoxy with which we have been beaten down all year.  I have basically fallen fast and hard toward the dark side of doubt, solipsistic pseudo skepticism and unfaith now.  There remains tons of great science out there, horribly boring to read and pathetically quiet in the face of media narratives, authority and profit motive.  The truth is out there, hidden on page 3 of a google scholar search or buried the the link tree of an obscure podcast.
It's not that I doubt the scientific method so much as that it is being applied with any ethics or consistency within the massive corporate and public institutions who use the idea of it and their funding of it to give their agendas credibility and clout and to make people afraid.
R/science is so much garbage!
My thinking and sense of civic duty as a response to "the science" has absolutely plummeted.  I am afraid they will try to segue this covid hysteria into climate apocalypse doomsday cult.  I am dismayed that I now view climate with some of the same skepticism I have for public health.  I feel like science has officially become the (bad?) religion of all the secular liberals by whom I am surrounded, regardless of their degree of literacy or faith.</p>
<p>I consider myself somewhat scientifically literate by lay person standards and also very curious and open but we have now politicized everything past the point of reason.</p>

        <p>I dunno.  I haven't the time now to dig through literature on masks.  They were never the hill I wanted to die on.
I cant imagine that masks are normal in Asia for no reason.  I suppose that they have their place and some degree of efficacy.
But debates about their efficacy and debates about their use or mandating them are different discussions altogether.
I believe that their being effective is the end of one conversation and the beginning of several others.</p>

        <p>Anyone who spouts "trust the science" really doesn't understand it as much of the current British Medical Journal is full of debates on whether the vaccine trial designs can even answer the key decisions policymakers will ask, retractions are at an all time high (even the first paper on using PCR for COVID is trying to be retracted, ) and only 5% of COVID clinical trials meet the gold standard of being randomised, controlled, and double-blind.</p>
<p>Another scientific epistemic crisis existed before COVID in the form of a reproducibility crisis (a staggering amount of study results fail to be replicated in subsequent ones.) </p>
<p>The entire philosophy of science is rife with debates on its base being in the works of Hume rather than Kant, on the problem of induction, etc.</p>

        <p>That dude is so angry and I love it.</p>
<p>Something you have all probably noticed is when people come in here to "debate" with us, all they do is throw insults and cuss a lot. They never actually provide any of the science and evidence that they say backs them. Likely because most of them have never actually seen it themselves. CNN had a few "experts" come on and say "Scientific consensus is..." and these people just took it at face value and accepted it as absolute truth. </p>
<p>You'd think if all the evidence was on their side, they would be eager to shove that evidence in our faces and stick it to us and wouldn't need to shout us down and ban us. Instead, getting them to provide a scientific study as a source is like pulling teeth. They spend comment after comment using ad hominems (Conspiracy theorist!), strawmen (You don't believe COVID is real. COVID denier!), appeals to emotion (People are dying!), anecdotes (COVID doesn't only affect the old. A 25 year old in Maine died.), and appeals to authority (All these scientists say so. Here is a link to the CDC saying so.)</p>
<p>At one point I did FINALLY get someone to send me a link that did have some citations at the bottom that referenced actual studies.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24229526/</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.05.20207241v3.full-text</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917603/</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087517/</p>
<p>But all of these studies involve having a person put on a fresh mask, coughing and talking, then measuring what comes out. To me, this doesn't fully consider mask efficiency with all day wear, adjusting, taking on and off to eat, etc. When I brought this up, it was back to insults calling me a science denier.</p>

        <p>I work in clinical research. While I’m not a covid denier, I believe the restrictions are absolutely unwarranted. People are dying from this, yes, but it’s nowhere near what the numbers would have you believe. If you’re old or are generally in poor health, just be careful. But otherwise there is no need to shut down the whole world just to protect a small fraction of the population who are more than capable of taking measures to protect themselves. </p>
<p>It’s painfully obvious at this point that the virus is just being used as a vehicle to control us under the pretense that it’s “for our best interest”. And those who don’t see it that way have either been brainwashed by the media, or they see it and just don’t care.</p>

<p>Like many others of these "non-PC liberals". Bill Maher for instance. </p>
<p>It's just more evidence that being a little bit "edgy" and liking "politically incorrect" joke isn't and wasn't enough to resist the brainwashing. Many of these "edgy" libertarian/ish comedian types have succumbed to the Trump Derangement Syndrome and then the Corona Derangement Syndrome. (In many ways, the CDS is peak TDS anyway. Hysterically supporting a police state and global house arrests is just something you have to if you want to be accepted by the Orange-Man-Bad cult.)</p>
