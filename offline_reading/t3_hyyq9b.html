        <p>People can scream about it but the fact is that no one in attendance at this would be the ones screaming about it. These people who bought tickets and attended accepted the risk and will continue to accept the risks. The people screeching will still be screeching in 2025. They’re bitter that people still seek to enjoy life and have a grip. They’re mad that not everyone is a scared as them. They will get louder as more people move away from the doomer side of things. It’s nice to see this push back for normalcy. I don’t doubt it will continue. Now on top of not being concerned about covid, these attendees will be annoyed that people gave them shit for enjoying life.</p>

        <p>These doomers want to ruin anything fun or meaningful to people. I’m getting really tired of their whining. But what do you expect from the generation offended by everything? </p>
<p>And especially since the show was for charity. If their cause had been raising money for “essential workers” or “BLM” or something the doomer crowd approved of, it would have been OK.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it would matter what they were raising money for. If they were raising for BLM they would have been accused of trying to play the “woke virus” loophole. </p>
<p>There are people on social media trying to rationalize they having 100k+ crowds in the streets is okay but having this smaller event where they at least tried to social distance was not.</p>
