    <strong>Report: Moving from California to Puerto Vallarta, MX</strong>
    <p><p>Greetings all, just thought I'd do a quick write-up on my experiences moving from a locked-down place to an open place, as many of you are considering this type of move right now.</p>
<p>I do speak Spanish, and I've lived/worked in Mexico before, so my experiences might be different from yours, etc.</p>
<p>Emotional:</p>
<p>I honestly feel happy for the first time in my life. I'm living on next to nothing - $3-5 USD a week - and I haven't been this happy in months. Just content and relaxed and ready to face the next challenge. </p>
<p>Logistics:</p>
<p>I chose to volunteer my time, as it's not easy to find work here if you're a non-citizen. In exchange for my volunteering, I get to stay in a dormitory where I share a kitchen and bathroom with about 15 other volunteers. So I pay my rent by volunteering 25 hours/week. The work isn't difficult, and no one wears masks so I've already been able to make friends. My long-term plan is to start working part time as an English teacher (as I have a lot of experience/qualifications in the field). </p>
<p>COVID restrictions:</p>
<p>Basically, there are none. Masks in some stores, but not all. No "mask police" anywhere, no shaming, etc. About half the people walking around outside wear masks. EVERYTHING is open and operating normally. No restrictions on traveling here if you fly (but no land crossings for tourists). Customs and airport security was super tight but I made it through :)</p>
<p>Long-term goals:</p>
<p>I'm considering advertising myself as "ingl√©s en persona" because the schools here are still closed but most of the locals I've met seem to be done with COVID and are impatient for the schools to open, so I might find a niche market of private clients who prefer in-person learning. Facebook is really popular here so I'll be working on networking through that platform plus the old fashioned method of putting up flyers in stores, as many stores here are happy to put up my flyer, and I got great responses the last time I tried that method.</p>
<p>I can probably continue volunteering for at least two months, and there are hundreds of similar volunteering arrangements all over Mexico, so I don't anticipate having to look for a place for at least 4-6 months, which is great as it gives me time to focus on job hunting.</p>
<p>General lifestyle:</p>
<p>Smiling at people and seeing them smile back is just amazing. Sitting inside places is equally wonderful. The beach is also open and one block away. No one wears masks there and it's safe for swimming, etc. Live music seven nights a week all over the city. A general friendly, laid back beach town vibe. No one hates me for "bringing the virus." Mostly they either want to sell me something or just welcome me to the town.</p>
<p>I'm so glad I made the leap and did this insane move. Best decision I've ever made. Happy to answer any questions you all may have, and best of luck to you in lockdown land. It really is better on the other side of things.  Really :) </p>
<p>Peace and love to you all.</p>
<p>Edit: it‚Äôs 3-5 usd a day, not a week. Ooops ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p></p>

        <p>It depends what your goal is here. If it‚Äôs to find work with a local company, then probably not. If it‚Äôs to work online while living here (what most non-citizens do), then yes your Spanish is definitely good enough for day to living. It‚Äôs also good enough for volunteering, which is what I‚Äôm doing now. </p>
<p>Also if your goal is to work here, I can recommend a great online Spanish course that is specifically geared toward business Spanish with a focus on learning the Spanish you need to know to find a job in a Spanish speaking country. It starts next week and the teacher is excellent.</p>

        <p>I get sent back in six months so the clock is ticking to find a job before then. Once I get a job I‚Äôll have a work permit and residency. It‚Äôs not that hard, I‚Äôve gone through the process before. I have also heard of people exiting and re-entering to get an additional six month tourist visa but I‚Äôve never tried that myself so I don‚Äôt know if it will work. </p>
<p>Tourists are not allowed to drive or walk across the border so I had to fly. Customs was a lot tougher than normal and I had to fill out a health form that basically said i don‚Äôt have covid and i haven‚Äôt been around anyone with covid. I had to show that health form constantly and there were many temperature checks and my bags were searched and I had a pat down. So yeah security is tighter than normal. That said once I was finally in the country there was no required quarantine or testing.</p>

        <p>The hardest part was convincing myself to do it. And to be okay with not having a permanent home for awhile. But now that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm being really careful with money it‚Äôs not so scary anymore. But I am also the type to travel super light. I only brought a very small suitcase and a small backpack with me, and I don‚Äôt plan on acquiring more things until I have a job. The rest of my stuff stays in storage at my friends house back in CA until I can get more settled, and that could be at least six months, given the way things are with my profession right now (I‚Äôm a teacher). </p>
<p>I would say if you do come here just get an Airbnb for a week and then find something super cheap in centro. Just walking around I see many for rent signs offering better prices than anything I saw on Airbnb. Also I don‚Äôt think A/C is necessary- and a lot of these rooms for rent come with a private bathroom, small fridge and a microwave. Anyway, if you can swing it financially, go for it! It will seriously restore your soul to be in a normal city again.</p>

        <p>Haha I look like a super duper pale face gringo. The first question people ask me here is ‚Äúdo you speak Spanish?‚Äù Because people who look like me usually don‚Äôt. As for rent, I‚Äôm volunteering in exchange for a bed in a dorm right now so I‚Äôm paying for rent with 25 hours of work per week. I‚Äôm also applying for English teaching jobs as that‚Äôs my profession. Once I have an income I‚Äôll probably live in a hostel because it‚Äôs the cheapest way to live in Mexico and it‚Äôs great fun as well.</p>

        <p>Awesome post. So stoked for your new situation! Do you know when the schools will be opening up again? What cities in Mexico do you recommend for TEFL? I'm interested in teaching English in Mexico but am so unsure about whens the best time to make the move. </p>
<p>Currently in Florida, teaching English online.</p>

        <p>The first thing you need to know about TEFL in Mexico is that it is extremely low paying. I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or eat meat. That‚Äôs how I can afford to be a teacher in Mexico :)</p>
<p>If the low pay doesn‚Äôt scare you off, then I think the best cities are the smaller tourist centric ones, like cities in the states of Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo, Jalisco, and Oaxaca. I did try working in Mexico City but it‚Äôs impossible to live there on a teachers salary so I don‚Äôt recommend it. </p>
<p>Also the best way to find a job here is to do it in person. It‚Äôs not easy to find work in Mexico remotely. Most people come over on a tourist visa, find a job, and then go through the legal work permit/temporary residency process. It‚Äôs not that difficult, but it is time consuming and it requires you to leave Mexico for a short while to complete the process at a Mexican consulate in the US. </p>
<p>So that‚Äôs basically it. Low pay, amazing country/culture/food, great students. Right now the market is a little weird because schools are closed, but everyone here tells me that schools should be open by the end of the year and many private  schools do hire year round. So right now I am volunteering while I wait for the market to open back up again. </p>
<p>Today I got hired by Open English. It‚Äôs an online company that has only Latin American students and is very well known in Mexico. They also have a low salary and they require you to live in Latin America. They also want you to have conversational Spanish. I will be teaching online for them until I can find an in-person position, and I‚Äôll continue volunteering as well.  The open English online teaching job, combined with volunteering, will definitely look great on my resume when I apply for in-person teaching jobs. </p>
<p>Hopefully this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

        <p>I'm aware of the low pay working in Mexico as a TEFL teacher and I accept it. I genuinely enjoy teaching so it doesn't bother me, especially since I am new to the field. I will be teaching online with VIPkid to supplement my in -person income. What types of schools in Mexico do ESL teachers typically teach at?</p>
<p>A friend told me September 21st is when you can enter Mexico by car. If this is true, I am considering this option so I can use it as my main transportation while living there. I'm still open to flying.</p>
<p>I actually applied to Open English a couple weeks ago and they ended up not hiring me. Congrats though, it seems like a great platform.</p>
