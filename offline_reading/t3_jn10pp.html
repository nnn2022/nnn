    <strong>Disturbing new trend in kids</strong>
    <p><p>I have been noticing a disturbing trend.</p>
<p>Parents walking with their 4-10 year old outside and the kid is the only one wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Just today I say a little kit in the back seat of a car muzzled while the parent was not.</p>
<p>I believe kids think it's cool.</p></p>

        <p>I think they’ve been so conditioned to wear it by teachers and other authority figures everywhere they turn that they now wear it even when they don’t have to. But I do know that some of these kids rebel when they see me maskless. Suddenly they don’t want to wear the mask anymore simply because they’ve spotted one adult defying orders. Even though kids are superbly brainwashed at this point, I think it will unravel quickly as soon as enough people defy the mask orders in mass. Kids remember why they don’t like it when they suddenly see others also not following it. Kids follow by example. So they just have to see other examples to be reminded of what’s normal.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen some (the youngest ones who shouldn’t even be in a mask by law) rip the mask off when they see me maskless and throw a tantrum when the parent tries to force it back on their face. The parent usually gives up at that point.</p>

        <p>I work in a school and I've not heard one kid complaining about wearing a mask, actually its quite opposite, they LOVE wearing them. </p>
<p>Masks have become the in thing. Social media programmed youth a long time ago to go along with whatever influencers were pushing (usually left wing agenda) and kids will go along with anything these days to be mini SJW's or politically correct in the eyes of their peers.</p>

        <p>Yep. I have a nephew that called me a “Karen” because I don’t believe in masks. He’s 10. It’s the trendy thing to do, and it’s pushed everywhere. Of course kids are picking up on that. It’s simultaneously infuriating and heartbreaking though.</p>

        <p>Yes I have also seen this. Its terrible. Think of all the trauma and conditioning this is causing. In 5 years there will be people in treatment for mask related neurotic behaviour. Think about what it does to the human psyche if you grow up with these masks on faces everywhere. Its just insane</p>

        <p>Well, to be fair, my son has kind of a anti-establishment personality, so he wears it in the car with me specifically BECAUSE I’m so against them. It’s his bit of rebellion, so that’s also possibly one explanation as to why these kids want to wear it.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think it’s healthy that he is willing to counter the viewpoints of his mother. It shows a willingness to think for himself, which is something I always encourage, even if I will ultimately disagree with him. </p>
<p>And, tbh, he’s really just doing it to piss me off because he knows how much I hate them and he hears me ranting about them. He thinks they’re stupid, but literally wears it because I’m anti them. If I was scared and pro masks, he would refuse to wear them everywhere.</p>

        <p>Yes! I’ve seen this so much. I think it boils down to a few factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kids imitate whatever the adults are doing. </li>
<li>Kids are afraid of being ostracized for going against the crowd. </li>
<li>It’s ridiculously easy to convince a kid to do something. </li>
<li>Their parents have slowly changed their minds as new information comes to light. Kids are too undeveloped yet for complex risk assessment, so they will wear masks until their parents tell them, emphatically, to stop. </li>
<li>They’re being forced to wear at school and kids can get used to anything. </li>
<li>Propaganda aimed at them, as it’s the ideal age for brainwashing.</li>
<li>Some may have been scolded at moments for taking it off.</li>

        <p>I can't help but notice that the r/teenagers crowd are among the most militant supporters of the "New Normal..." You see nothing but extreme condemnation of anyone questioning any aspect of the narrative (if you don't think lockdowns are the right solution to the pandemic, you're an evil antimasker Karen. Just wear the {insert swear word} mask you COVIDIOT!!!!!). Crazy stuff. </p>
<p>Poor kids, I honestly feel sorry for them knowing they'll grow up in a dystopia and not know anything different.</p>
