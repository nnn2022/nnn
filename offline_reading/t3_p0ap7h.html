    <strong>Covid mortality rate</strong>
    <p><p>Quick question, whatâ€™s the actual percentage of people that have died from Covid that have been infected? I did some calculations and I got 2.1% based off of a google search. Anyone know the correct number?</p></p>

        <p>A while back, CDC did their own estimates on how many people had been infected in the US.  They said 114M.  This was at a time when maybe 32M had been known to test positive. More or less that means you can divide your 2.1% case fatality rate by 3.6 and come up with an IFR of 0.6%, which squares with what the Diamond Princess case told us back in Feb of 2020.  </p>
<p>WHO did some calculating at .23% a while ago as well. So, that is likely your range .2-.6%.  But that's just an overall number.  If you are healthy (zero comorbidities) you can roughly divide that estimate by 10.</p>

        <p>I don't know any numbers but the chances of dying have gone down now that they're learning how to treat it. They found in most cases the ventilator did more damage than good. They still use them but as often.</p>

        <p>I don't have the number at hand, but when making the estimation, please use fresh numbers. Fatality has been decreasing for a while already as virus mutates to less fatal.</p>
<p>For people below 60y the number is way way below 1%. For people below 50y it goes to 0.1-0.01%. I'm close to 50 and deduced from official statistics that driving car poses bigger risk to me than covid.</p>

        <p>No way to know, the hospitals got money for positive patients. I heard from nursing fam about pneumonia from masks being listed as positive Covid. Everything became 'Covid.' I'm shunned for having a headache every month. Because apparently the only time you're allowed to have a headache is when you get Covid!! Forget menstrual side effects and other chronic illness related issues - ITS COVID !!</p>

        <p>There is no way to know forsure, but it is much less than what they say. I work in a covid unit and at least half the deaths are...88yr old presents with a urinary tract infection/sepsis/a-fib/diabetes/heart failure...has no common covid symptons...doesn't even require much oxygen...has a positive unreliable covid test and dies later with a hypotensive crisis and elevated lactate.  Had nothing to do with covid...would've died either way, but goes down as a covid death. Not even kidding. This is how it is. You will never find real numbers, but go with half of what the cdc says and you're close.</p>
