    <strong>So, your thoughts on this? Am I understanding this correctly? Any researchers in the house?</strong>
    <p><p>If I am understanding this correctly, the percentages we have been given are not that "95% effectiveness" means 95% of people will NOT get the COOF after the shot....but that 95% of people saw a measurable reduction in chance of getting the COOF and that the actual reduction in risk was SUPER LOW. As in single percentage points of lower risk... Meaning the "JABS" are effectively useless and perhaps why 40% of new COOF cases are "VAXXED" people...</p>
<p>So, am I reading it correctly?</p>

        <p>The 'experimental mRNA gene treatment' tells your cells to produce a spike protein, which can only 'match' or 'recognize' a part of the covid19 virus, so only offers partial protection if any.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional vaccine, which would introduce your immune system to a 'dead' version of a WHOLE Covid19 virus, and train your antibodies FULLY against covid19 should it appear.</p>
<p>Moderna describes their drug as a 'plug and play app', 'designed to plug n play with other apps'... who knows if the current spike protein produced will 'plug and play' with other spike proteins, that future Moderna 'plug and play apps' will come together to form whatever the F they would like.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't accept experimental software meant to override my ability to monitor and shut down 'instructions to my cells' to become printing processes with no kill switch.</p>

        <p>Yes and no. You are quite correct in your assessment that the actual reduction of risk towards nCov-2 lies in the single digits.
But the 95% refers to relative risk reduction, which means in layman's terms "after taking the shot, your personal risk, as does the risk of those who did <em>not</em> get the shot, of getting a positive Covid test (we're not even talking illness yet!) is about 5%."</p>
<p>So after the shot (and in case you wouldn't get one) there's a 5% chance of being positive. Now of those, a certain percentage suffers from complications (with different risk levels among the age groups).
Of those with complications, the ones with the shot are supposed to suffer less symptoms, but that's just what they claim and I have not seen any reliable sources proving this as of yet.
I should add, that it is quite possible the vaccinated would show less symptoms, that's how we interpret the vaxx's mechanisms currently.</p>
<p>Now we know that in about 1% of cases you will have a better outcome jabbed than un-jabbed in regards to catching the coof. We did not yet take into account adverse events though.</p>
<p>And that's why these bs gene therapies are so horrible.</p>

        <p>My understanding, concretely is that 90% reduction is a reflection if relative risks.  So, if you have 100,000 people in group A and 100,00 people in group B and group B gets the vaccine, then you measure what happened 2 months later, that's how these vaccine numbers were developed.  So, if group A had 1000 covid infections and 20 deaths and group B had 800 covid infections and 2 deaths, you could say that the vaccine was 20% effective in reducing infections and and 90% effective in reducing death.  But in reality, you went from a 99.98% chance of survival to a 99.998% chance of survival.</p>

        <p>The 95% came from the initial study where the control and trial groups each contained 20,000 people.  After the several month trial period 160 people who received the placebo tested positive for covid and 8 in the vax group did.  (160-8)/160 is where the 95% effectiveness came from.</p>
<p>Yes, the absolute risk reduction was incredibly small because the vast majority of people didn't contract covid over the trial at all.  This was also done earlier in the pandemic when mostly the original strain was around. The J&amp;J and it's 60% effectiveness was tested later, so it's entirely possible that more resistant strains with different spike proteins caused this and that's why the Pfizer is showing up with less efficy now too.</p>
