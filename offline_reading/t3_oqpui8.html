    <strong>Pushing the narrative</strong>
    <p><p>If you noticed one thing in common with this , last year there was no narrative to have the vaccine and us un vax got along quite well with the vaxed. </p>
<p>And we all went on our merry way. Since the covid vaccine implement and forced againts your will this year.</p>
<p>The vaxx are pushing the narrative like we are the ones spreading this virus like wildfire. Even though they have had x2 jab(s) got covid . Or had major side effects or not. Varies in person etc. </p>
<p>All I have seen in the news... women who's son is in hospital tells people to get the jab </p>
<p>Man un vaxx begged for jab </p>
<p>Doctors admitted un vax patients </p>
<p>Or dead people were found to be un vaxx </p>
<p>If you can see a patten from here than your clued up just as I am.</p>
<p>We are ( will ) be blamed / named /shamed against. </p>
<p>I read an article in another country ( don't know which one ) or if its true. But the un vaxx will be hunted down. </p>
<p>Its like a witch hunt and a blame game. And in there eyes we must pinpoint and blame the un vaxx </p>
<p>Segregation is here again people..  its in the mist... </p>
<p>Be cautious be prepared and keep watching ðŸ‘€ </p>
<p>Peace and love from me ðŸ–¤</p></p>
