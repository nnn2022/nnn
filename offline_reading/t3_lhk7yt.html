    <strong>So what are you gonna do if you guys are wrong</strong>
    <p><p>No really. The description says you guys are skeptics...so you guys want to believe you guys are always right and no one else except you is correct. So what if someone came here and had so much proof masks work and covid is real that you guys couldn't just ban that person. You y'all be willing to accept you guys we're wrong for once? Or will you guys just deny it because "you are always correct"</p>
<p>I, myself understand the possibility of being wrong and I see that as find</p>
<p>But are you guys willing to understand that you might be wrong yourself</p></p>

<p>Deep down, I know that there is a miniscule risk I could end up in the hospital, on a ventilator. Not bloody likely, but I objectively know the risk isn't zero.</p>
<p>With my last dying breath I would still advocate for the lockdowns to end.</p>

<p>I've been guilty of immediately telling people off who come in here to troll... But some of these people may actually have an open mind and might be willing to reconsider the position they have been fed.</p>

        <p>If you have any empirical evidence masks work to reduce cases, show me. Healthy people wearing masks amongst each other is still going to be pointless.
Not many here think the virus is fake, it’s the over reaction to it that we are skeptics about.</p>

        <p>Those countries can never reliably open up again. Vaccines don't give 100% immunity (or anything close...). PCR tests give enough false positives that there can <em>always</em> be a 'case.' There is no way out of this save just learning to live with the virus. Everything else was a forlorn hope just delaying the inevitable, and wasting lives while doing it.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if that sounds heartless, we could loot all the tax-dodging companies that allowed our health services to be so neglected, and all the military organisations that sucked up technological research that should have gone on healthcare, and drive cronies' dark money out of global healthcare organisations. They're the human reasons we were hit so hard.</p>

        <p>This.  Skepticism means questioning the narrative, questioning the conclusions, the methods, the data, the basic assumptions, the omissions, the confounding factors.  Draw conclusions based on the data and studies you have, then question those conclusions too.  It's the ONLY way to be scientific.</p>

        <p>Sounds like Florida.  Or South Dakota. Back in school, indoor dining, maskless.  Not like that awful california and new york, with tons of restrictions, more deaths.  What did the restrictions accomplish?</p>
<p>The real problem with comparing one state to the next, or country to the next, is normalizing the data.  </p>
<p>How many are being tested?  How many PCR cycles?  WHO is being tested?  Everyone?  Sick people?  Old people? Volunteers?  The same people every week for their jobs?  How much have these factors changed over time (covidtrackingproject looks at the US testing by state, and shows how their reporting rules varied month to month.  Were duplicates recorded twice?  Were all negative tests recorded?  Were antigen tests recorded the same way as PCR?  What was done to account for the base false-positive and false-negative rates of the testing kits?)</p>
<p>How are deaths being recorded?  Is everyone with a positive PCR test in the last 28 days assumed to have died from covid?  Just those with positive tests while in the hospital?  Just those who showed actual covid symptoms?  Just those who died from covid-related complications, and not those who died from renal failure?  Or full "if the doc thinks covid may have contribute to this auto accident traumatic death, it's a covid death" as per the official WHO guidelines?</p>
<p>What is the actual rule and mask compliance?  How dense is the population, and how mobile?  How old, how ill, and how were the last couple flu seasons (to establish health context a la 'mortality displacement')?  How many old people are gathered together in nursing homes vs back with their families, less likely to spread a disease to other vulnerable people?</p>
<p>This is why the "country a vs b" anecdotes are essentially meaningless.  Unless you start to control for these sorts of variables, your data MAY be skewed beyond any statistical value whatsoever.  </p>
<p>This is what real (data) science and stats are about, and studies which leave all this behind are either doing so intentionally, or too ignorant to understand the implications.  This is why it's so easy to manipulate people, because people who don't do this for a living don't begin to think of the various confounding factors.</p>
<p>If you see, in the news, a simple comparison of a couple/few locations and how they handled covid, and broad sweeping conclusions drawn from a couple data points, be skeptical.  Ask these questions.  Ask how one might mitigate these sorts of problems.  Ask if the creator of the study has attempted to do so.  Usually, there are two methods: normalize the data according to the variables, or make a study so broad that they become less important.  This is what sets many people in this sub apart.</p>

        <p>If I'm wrong, the death numbers and leadership behavior will confirm it.  When our government officials hold everyone to the same standards and follow those same rules themselves, I will take it more seriously.  </p>

        <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>So I would like.... Neh love to be wrong in this.</p>
<p>Being "right" has meant rejection, abuse, ridicule.... It is far from convenient as a position to adopt.</p>
<p>I am certainly open to being wrong.</p>
<p>But I have this horrible, nagging feeling in my gut that I am right.</p>
<p>I do not question that the virus exists. Most people here think it exists. Just that the risk is massively overblown.</p>
<p>I would add as mine, that the disproportionate, non sensical measures are being drip fed to gradually bleed away and strip us of essential freedoms. Freedoms that make life worth living for in the first place.</p>
<p>I would love to be proven wrong. And that the steady decent into a medicalised, authoritarian, police state, all over the world that I witness with my own eyes is some kind of imagining. That the distopian hell we inexolerably slide towards will never come to be.</p>
<p>But by my best sense and understanding.... This only stops when enough people say "no"</p>
<p>Time will tell, one way or another. And I don't suppose you or I will change each others opinions in the meantime.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

        <p>I am willing to change my view with the data, just as I did through the summer and fall.   We started out in March strict.  We didnt know what we were dealing with.   By the end of May we decided it was probably safe enough to go forward with our family vacation to the beach.  We enjoyed our family gathering in early Sept to celebrate our granddaughter's 3rd birthday.  And we are very glad we did both of those as 1 week after her birthday, our granddaughter was diagnosed with leukemia.   We also held family Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners as one of ours is cancer terminal.</p>
<p>Now, should the numbers (not your feelings) change or the facts/data change, we would too.  But, the data has remained unchanged.  This is dangerous to the elderly and compromised.  Open your businesses. </p>
<p>Economic downturns and worldwide depressions are how world wars start.   Hunger fuels war.   How many people are you willing to plunge into poverty, starvation, or war?  How many people are you willing to kill to force healthy people to wear a mask (that doesnt work)?</p>

I teach thousands of children at numerous schools who constantly grab me, hug me and cough or sneeze around me.  I have NOT seen one person sick, collapsing nor dying. I myself have not been sick at all despite so many calling me a selfish asshole and claiming I’ll get Covid and die soon.... Well, I’m still here and fine so NO I’m not wrong, Covid is a hoax</p>

        <p>Well look at the data and information and come to your own conclusions. Right now there is no evidence of a virus called SARS Cov 2 even existing 🤷‍♂️ </p>
<p>Lots of evidence that the epidemiological data is an outright lie when you read the footnotes and it says even if covid was suspected in the death they treat is as a covid death without testing for it. Which again is a problem as the virus hasn’t been isolated nor proven to cause the disease known as COVID. </p>
<p>Follow the data. It’ll lead to the truth.</p>

        <p>COVID is real, the response is a hoax.  Scientist have known for years that masks don't work for respiratory viruses, they knew that in 1920 and they know that in 2021.  Masks are a tool so that people can believe they can do something, it provides them with mental hope but no real efficacy.  The lockdowns are they same story, they know they don't work and are harmful but do them anyway.  The Vaccine is also another tool to make people hopeful but they admit it doesn't prevent you from contracting or spreading the virus.  We know young people aren't seriously affected by the virus but those same young people are the most fearful of it.</p>

        <p>The ability to be critical of your own ideas and positions is vital.  Any scientist worth their salt questions their assumptions and data constantly, and when (not if) they find they are wrong, adjust to take the new data in to account.  If everyone did this, we'd all be in a better place.</p>
<p>I question my approach to all this constantly, because I have a wife, parents, children, neighbors and friends, and countless others that are affected by what I do.  I read the best studies I can find, I read studies that are heavily biased, I read analyses of these studies.  I check with friends in the medical industry, ems, my wife as a bio phd, a friend who now (angrily) does nothing but pcr tests all day long, and any other contact or source I can question about specific details.  (I don't watch the news.)</p>
<p>What I find however has now been increasingly consistent for months.
- PCR isn't medically diagnostic, so we have ZERO idea how many people have died WITH covid, much less FROM.
- comparing states to states, countries to countries, and timing of lockdowns and mask mandates shows ZERO correlation with "case" count, icu utilization, or mortality
- kids are safe, schools are safe
- the damage the lockdowns are doing is quite possibly the worst disaster of any form mankind has ever faced.  the deaths from untreated and undiagnosed cancers and other diseases, the suicides, abuses (domestic and child), violent crime, worldwide hunger, the poverty which is setting countries back by decades in terms of stability, equality, and healthcare, the failed attempt at schooling...  hunger alone is expected to cause an additional 10 MILLION starvation deaths, given an extra 150 MILLION in extreme poverty.  as much as people hate discussion of the economy, it's a great predictor of a country's health and well-being, and we're destroying economies left and right.
- when all is said and done, and deaths in 2020 are totaled, the final numbers are as high as 2006 or 2008 in the US, and closer to 2018 in europe.  regardless of what caused that, it's not world ending or even particularly life-altering.</p>
<p>I read and I read and I read, and nothing runs counter to these findings.  Until something does, I'm going to make sure my kids don't wear masks, socialize as much as they can, are educated in a manner I see fit (they're pre-school, so this is easy for now).  If I am presented some indication that they're at risk, that covid is actually a serious disease, that an alteration of behavior would benefit ourselves or others, I will consider it.  So far the pop media has only gotten more sensationalist and less scientific, suggesting even they know they haven't got a leg to stand on.  Maybe in the next couple years the population will realize they've had all their rights stripped away and actually start to be skeptical too, but I wouldn't bet on it.  (Hell, maybe if everyone were skeptical, the media and government would work to actually produce compelling arguments instead of just fear.  Maybe they DO have good data, but don't bother because fear manipulates people better.  I still think that's morally and legally wrong to hide information of this nature.)</p>

        <p>Even given the idiotic counting we're using, every state and country in the world reports covid is less of an issue for kids than the flu.  You have to simply ignore every bit of data to miss that.  But then if that's the only thing you got from my post you've missed pretty much everything going on.  Begone.</p>
