    <strong>Lies. Lies. Lies. - Part 2. Vaccine rollout at my workplace</strong>
    <p><p>In a previous post, I discussed the ongoing misinformation (propaganda) campaign going on within my employer - the outright lies about how dangerous CCPvirus is, the lies about the effectiveness of "health measures", the lies about how herd immunity works. And the lies about the effectiveness and about side effects from the "vaccine".</p>
<p>I got an internal email last week about how they intend to vaccinate employees. Words like "voluntary" and "private" keep getting thrown around.</p>
<p><em>It's all another lie.</em></p>
<p>- The easiest way to ensure anonymity would be to simply set several different times and dates and tell people "If you want to get vaccinated, show up. If you don't, don't show up." <em>Nope. Everyone has to show up in a set block of time, whether they want a vaccine or not, and sit through an "information briefing" AKA harangue.</em></p>
<p>- Once everyone has been fed their dose of pro-vaccine propaganda, they are broken off and individually go into a room with a medical practitioner, where they must fill out a bunch of paperwork. <em>The claim is that is is to allow "informed consent". But no information is provided about what the vaccines contain, what the actual risks are, how the risks differ by age, etc. On top of this, you don't get to even choose which vaccine you get. So much for "informed consent"...</em></p>
<p>- This is the point where you get to refuse "if you wish". <em>Guaranteed you will get grilled, wheedled at, threatened, and generally have your time wasted before you finally get to leave. Your decision is recorded in a "medical database" that supposedly senior management doesn't get to see. And I've got a nice bridge to sell you...</em></p>
<p>- If you get a vaccine, you get a card. If you don't, you don't. <em>Cue unethical bosses attempting the "Show me your fucking vaccine card or else!!!" shit on junior employees. No vaccine card? Blacklist for you!</em> </p>
<p>- We have already been told that no vaccination may limit you from certain tasks, business travel, foreign postings etc. How would your boss know this, you ask? <em>Simple, he can see it in the personnel database - where your medical status shows up as "red", or "green". Anyone really think these guys won't ask why you are "red"? Anyone really think they won't put two and two together and realize it's because you refused the vaccine?</em></p>
<p>That's where we are "for now". Hints keep dropping that us refuseniks could have our employment jeopardized in the future.</p>
<p>Welcome to the beginning of vaccine apartheid in Company XYZ...</p></p>

        <p>Just decline their offer and counter offer that they need to remove it from your system at the end of every shift. Also they’ll be liable for any side effects and would need to present you with a certificate of insurance. </p>
<p>Honestly start learning a trade and be in a role that’s indispensable.</p>

        <p>Yeah, at my workplace, if you refuse the vaccine you have to wear a mask. But we're all already wearing masks now anyway. Pre-COVID, you had to do the same if you refused the annual flu vaccine. They make you wear a mask as a punishment, a scarlet letter, basically, to try to get you to conform. Joke's on them though because I won't be shamed into giving up my bodily sovereignty for these meddling, totalitarian dweebs. There's also supposed to be "privacy" regarding your vaccination status, but like at your work, it's all lip service. It's pretty obvious who has and has not been vaccinated just by dent of how they make you take time out of your day (which requires telling your coworkers so they can cover for you) to go to the medical tent to get your jabs. It's hardly secret. Anyway, I feel your pain/anger.</p>

<p>The first part sounds like how they treat children in school on vaccination days. Sucks. It’s your body which they seem to have forgotten. You could insist that they sign something making them fully liable if anything happens. But I wouldn’t take it anyway of course.</p>
