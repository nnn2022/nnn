    <strong>How i treat family from BeerViruses-guide.</strong>
    <p><p>As a young medicine student. Do not take this medical advise as true. Always consult your doctor lmaoo. This works for all diseases, especially almighty corona scamvirus.</p>
<p>What at least i do(i nor my family havent taken any antibiotics because of my techniques since 3 years):
-vitamin d is better in liquid form(oil), i take 10k IU a day from liquid oil form
-take also around (below)200IU of vitamin k2mk7
-vitamin C, i take  2GRAMS a day, mine comes in powder form, i order it as ascorbic acid. I just put 2g in a cup, mix it with warm water and drink it. If i am sick(i had corona), i would take 2g per every 4 hours until i feel the need to go to the toilet, this is your bodys response, that i you had too much at this time of vit c.
-i take multivitamin(with zinc), everyday one capsule, any brand will do, though i recommend NOW FOODS as a source for all legitimate vitamins, but you can choose your own</p>
<p>Now when i am sick(rona virus or whatever):
-i take frequent really hot showers, every 4 hours or so, just to get my body temperature to rise and fight any virus
-ginger in tea, just grate like couple of grams of ginger into a cup and pour either hot tea on it or hot water and drink it throughout the day
-hot tea all day instead of water to get my body temp higher to fight any infection
-if you got access to sauna go there at least once everyday to raise temp
-measure your body temp every like 5 hours, if it raises near 40 celsius, take some ibuprofen 500mg every 7 hours(paracetamol is more toxic imo) to lower the temp below it since it is not healthy to have it above 40 celsius</p>
<p>To summarise: 
Your vit d level in your body(the recommended test for measuring it is 25 OHD) should be above 50. 
The most natural way of getting immunity is going outside for a walk at 12AM without sunglasses to absorb the vitamin from sun, if you cant do it, supplement is fine
Even conventional medicine is saying this... this is THE MOST IMPORTANT VITAMIN IN YOUR BODY
After that is vit c as i said</p>
<p>Youre welcome, if any questions arise, feel free to msg me privately here.</p>

<p>Isn't 12,000 mg/24h of vit C too much, esp. for those with haemochromatosis? Vit C hyper-doses also increase the amount of oxalate secreted by your kidneys, which means that the probability of kidney stones also increases.</p>
