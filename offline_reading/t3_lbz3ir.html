    <strong>Goodwill Mask Nazis</strong>
    <p><p>This afternoon I went to my local Goodwill store, maskless as usual, and I did not expect anyone to bother me, as people here in southeast Iowa don't seem to really care about mask compliance. However, to my shock -- and for the very first time -- somebody threatened to call the <em>cops</em> on me! Here's what happened...</p>
<p>I walked into the store, and within five seconds I was addressed by an overweight female employee, who barked at me from across an aisle, "Sir! Sir! You need to wear a mask in here."</p>
<p>"I have an exemption," I explained.</p>
<p>"We don't allow exemptions here," she said.</p>
<p>"It's okay, I have a <em>medical exemption</em>," I insisted.</p>
<p>"But Goodwill corporate policy doesn't <em>allow</em> for exemptions," she insisted back at me.</p>
<p>"So then what? <em>Disabled</em> people can't shop here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not without a mask. It's corporate policy."</p>
<p>"Really?" I paused for a moment in disbelief. Unable to think of any other response, I asked, "So what're you gonna do? Call the cops?"</p>
<p>"If you don't leave the store, I'll have to call the cops. Yes."</p>
<p>'Just wanted to hear you say it,' I thought. I then replied, "I just don't understand why you can't exercise discretion and accommodate people with a medical exemption."</p>
<p>"I understand what you're saying, but unfortunately I'm not <em>allowed</em> to use discretion."</p>
<p>"But you're a human being. You have freewill."</p>
<p>"But I'm forced to follow corporate policy."</p>
<p>"Who is forcing you? Does somebody have a gun to your head?"</p>
<p>At this point another employee, who must've been the store manager, joined the conversation. She was remarkably pale and sickly in her appearance, like a female Nosferatu with scraggly ginger hair tied back in a ponytail. She glared at me menacingly and interjected, "Is there a problem here?"</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to understand your policy, because I have an exemption," I answered.</p>
<p>"We don't allow for exemptions here, so you'll have to leave," she said.</p>
<p>"I just find that hard to believe, because everywhere else I've been to recognizes exemptions."</p>
<p>"Well, Goodwill <em>doesn't</em>. And if you have a complaint, you can Google the corporate office's phone number and talk to them."</p>
<p>'Seriously? Google?' I thought. "I don't <em>have</em> Google. Just give me the number," I demanded out of spite.</p>
<p>"Fine. Step outside first and <em>then</em> I'll give you the number," she countered.</p>
<p>"Alright. Let's go," I commanded as I marched to the exit.</p>
<p>She went to retrieve her supervisor's phone number, and as I waited by the door, the first employee stood near me and watched. </p>
<p>"I'm just trying to live my life like normal," I explained to her.</p>
<p>"I understand, but unfortunately we're forced to follow company policy," she repeated.</p>
<p>"No, you're not. You're just putting the blame on someone else," I corrected her.</p>
<p>I glanced around the room to find several people staring at me from behind their masks. They truly seemed like frightened cattle, and I felt a twinge of pity mixed with contempt.</p>
<p>The manager then returned and handed me a slip of paper with a name and phone number handwritten on it. "Here. That's the district manager. You can call her and she'll tell you the same thing that I did: we don't allow exemptions."</p>
<p>I shook my head and puffed. "I'm just shocked, because this is literally the first place I've been to that did not <em>respect</em>," I let that word sink in, "people with exemptions." I glanced at the slip of paper. "I'll talk to the supervisor and hear what they say, but I'm pretty sure you can exercise discretion and accommodate people with valid exemptions."</p>
<p>"No, actually, I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not? Don't you have freewill?"</p>
<p>"No, actually, I don't."</p>
<p>"<em>Really</em>?! You don't have freewill? Wow."</p>
<p>"You can leave now, sir. Before we call the cops."</p>
<p>"I'm leaving."</p>
<p>"Have a nice day, sir."</p>
<p>I slowly turned, in silence, and I walked out the door. And even though I was outside in the crisp winter air, I felt strangely claustrophobic, with the walls of tyranny looming ever closer around me. A year ago this incident would have been a horrible <em>nightmare</em>, but now it's just another dark winter day in what used to be my homeland, but now is a foreign country.</p></p>
