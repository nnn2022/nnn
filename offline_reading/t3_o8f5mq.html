    <strong>We need a plan for what will happen if we succeed</strong>
    <p><p>Covid sceptics have done a good job at exposing the contradictions and lies in the mainstream narrative, but this is not enough. We need a plan for what changes to make if we succeed in defeating this agenda. We have resisted the ‘new normal’ but we cannot simply return to the ‘old normal’. It was the old normal that led to the situation we are in today, and we must build a world where this can never happen again.  </p>
<p>Below, I have given some proposals for changes. There is a lot I’m not sure about. I hope the community can add their own ideas and maybe we can create a full manifesto. We need a common vision for a post-covid world. We cannot abolish the current political system without a plan for what is to replace to. Doing so will lead to chaos and civil war.  </p>
<p><strong>1. (USA, UK, Canada etc.) Proportional representation</strong></p>
<p>Although it has become clear during this crisis that the majority of people are incapable of critical thinking and easily manipulated by media, social pressure, and authority figures, democracy is the best hope we have for a free world. The ‘first past the post’ voting system, a legacy of the British empire followed in the UK, the USA, Canada, and other former British colonies, is undemocratic and must be replaced by proportional representation in all applicable countries. If an anti-lockdown party were to arise in a country following the ‘first past the post’ system it would have almost no chance of success and fail to win even a single seat. An anti-lockdown party in a country with proportional representation would win at least some seats and thereby have a chance to make their case to the public, debate the current government, and prove their competence.</p>
<p><strong>2. Political campaigns and funding</strong></p>
<p>There should be a limit on the amount of money an individual or organisation may donate to a political party or candidate. Donations from corporations should be banned. The amount that can be spent on an electoral campaign should also be limited. Broadcasting time for an electoral campaign on television or radio should be limited. Political advertisements on the internet should be banned, although political content on a party’s own website or channels will of course be allowed.  </p>
<p>These regulations already exist to varying degrees in several countries, such as Finland, Japan, Canada, and New Zealand.  </p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralised government</strong></p>
<p>In the USA, resistance to authoritarian responses to covid has been possible due to the autonomy of states and limits on central government. This is in contrast to the UK, which has a strong central government, and Canada, where resistance has been weak despite it also being a federation. I am not sure why resistance was so weak in Canada – maybe simply because there are fewer provinces and territories in Canada than American states and hence less chance of an ‘outlier province’? Perhaps others can give their views on this. In any case, decentralisation is a positive thing and should be a goal for the future. Decentralisation should increase where it already exists (e.g. decreasing American states’ reliance on federal funding, eliminating whatever factors caused such weak resistance from Canadian provinces) and encouraging decentralisation in more centralised countries (e.g. giving the constituent countries of the UK powers comparable to American states).  </p>
<p><strong>4. (UK) A written constitution</strong></p>
<p>The UK will be given a written constitution modelled on the American constitution and Bill of Rights.  </p>
<p><strong>5. Limits on states of emergency (including war)</strong></p>
<p>Any state of emergency that suspends the rights of citizens normally guaranteed by the constitution, including war, must reviewed every year by popular referendum.  </p>
<p><strong>6. A free internet</strong></p>
<p>The internet is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is the greatest tool ever invented for sharing alternative views and information. Without the internet, the old media would have been able to create the illusion that the entire population supports lockdowns, vaccine passports etc. and would have censored all dissenting views and arguments. ‘Mega-sites’ such as youtube, reddit, and facebook act as central hubs for sharing information that make information even more easily locatable and accessible than if it had been hosted on an obscure website.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, the control of much of the internet’s content by these mega-sites has created new opportunities for censorship. Google’s algorithms censor content that its owners disapprove of. On youtube and facebook, content that goes against the owners’ political views can be banned altogether. One could argue that if we are not satisfied with google, youtube, or facebook we are free to create rival sites. However, no-one is going to switch to a rival of youtube when whatever content you can think of is already on youtube and a rival would have much less content. Likewise, no-one is going to switch to a rival of facebook when everyone is on facebook and a rival has barely any members. This allows these sites to have a monopoly and do virtually whatever they please.  </p>
<p>I’m not sure what should be done about this. Is there a way to have all the advantages of the internet with none of the disadvantages? Can sites such as youtube and facebook somehow be democratised?</p>
<p><strong>7. Data privacy</strong></p>
<p>One of the most disturbing goals of the enemy is mass surveillance. The ‘track and trace’ scheme, ostensibly introduced to control the spread of covid, is a gross violation of our civil liberties and only the first step in creating a totalitarian mass-surveillance state. Moreover, companies such as facebook and google have amassed vast amounts of data on private individuals. Facebook, for example, has access to all of the private messages of its users and has been reported to retain this information even when accounts are deleted.  </p>
<p>Again – I’m not sure what should be done about this. Websites that keep their users’ private data could just be banned, so there would be no facebook any more. Maybe there is a way such sites can be regulated, but I don’t see how it would be possible to have a website like facebook that doesn’t store its users’ private data (e.g. messages, comments, photos).  </p>
<p><strong>8. (UK) Defunding the BBC</strong></p>
<p>Little attention is given to old media in this document, since they are expected to continue to fade into irrelevancy anyway. However, an exception is made here since they must be allowed to wither away and not be artificially propped up with taxpayers’ money. We therefore propose the abolition of the TV license fee that is used to fund the BBC, although   there may be little left of the BBC anyway after most if not all of its journalists have been imprisoned.  </p>
<p><strong>9. Reparations</strong></p>
<p>While the middle class has been decimated during the covid crisis, the wealth of billionaires, many of whom are complicit in the ‘great reset’, has surged. Those who have profited from this crisis, including pharmaceutical companies, must be made to reimburse those who have lost their businesses and homes in full. Pharmaceutical companies must pay compensation to those who have had negative side effects from the vaccines, and to the families of those who have died from the vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>10. Medical liability</strong></p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies will be held liable for negative side effects of any future vaccines and other medication and be required to provide compensation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Prosecution of the enemy</strong></p>
<p>All journalists and politicians complicit in this conspiracy (for example, by promoting lockdowns or vaccine passports) should stand trial. On the other hand, public figures who have spoken out (for example, Dr. Mike Yeadon and the governors who refused to lock down their states) should be recognised and publicly honoured.  </p>
<p><strong>12. The positive aspects of the ‘Great Reset’</strong></p>
<p>Some aspects of the ‘new normal’ are good. This does not mean that those promoting the Great Reset are benevolent. Indeed, the inclusion of these positive aspects may be nothing more than a tactic to reduce opposition to the Great Reset and create an illusion that it is entirely positive. Remote working, environmentalism (which is important whether or not global warming really exists, since it is undeniable that pollution and depletion of resources exists), automation, and reduced working hours are all desirable and there is no reason they need to be accompanied by mass surveillance, abolition of private property, and restriction of freedom of movement, freedom of association etc. We cannot simply ignore the problems being caused by damage to the environment, overpopulation and mass unemployment due to automation. Hopefully, these ideas can still be up for discussion if we manage to prevent the ‘new normal’.</p></p>

        <p>I fear everyone already inside political organizations needs to independently and genuinely come to the realization we have if there’s any hope of anything getting better. And that seems biologically impossible right now. The sheep are happy and don’t want to wake up. </p>
<p>Even still, the existing structure has favoured additional corruption from the start. It’s easy to slip in and make it worse. But nearly impossible to fight your way in and make it better. </p>
<p>I fear the people most responsible for the worst parts of the response actually know fully that what they’ve done is wrong. This wasn’t an accident. </p>

<p>I agree. It can't be changed from the inside. There will inevitably be bloodshed. The key thing is whether a system is put in place when the dust settles that is less easily corrupted.</p>

        <p>Excellent write-up.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about how we should continue to use the sub to expose all of the corruption and anti-democratic measures that lead to this insanity.  We need to stop this from happening again.</p>

        <p>You don't need any of the OP's list. All you need is a strict prohibition on political speech, plus explicitly legalizing calls to violence/incitement.</p>
<p>"Political speech" is and has always been communist speech. There is no reason to tolerate it.</p>
<p>Allowing calls to violence and "incitment" means that measures for disciplining politicians/bureaucrats will open up to incentivize not doing 2020 type behavior.</p>

        <p>Resistance was weak in Canada because they were paid to be.</p>
<p>They could 'afford' to be complacent and apathetic.</p>
<p>It was profitable for many to play along, to play it up, to exaggerate (or embrace) their fears.<br>
No one protests, or analyzes if measures are warranted if they're getting food on their table and their bills paid.</p>
<p>No one questions the hand that feeds them.</p>
<p>I understand this was an emergency and benefits were warranted, but helped contribute to apathy - while their country was destroyed.</p>
