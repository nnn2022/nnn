    <strong>Do you think lockdowns work?</strong>
    <p><p>Ok, people of this subreddit. Firstly, I apologise for mobile formatting. Secondly, I come in peace. I am a person who believes in lockdowns. I obeyed all the restrictions and precautions. I am very lucky as a New Zealander to be back to normal. I was able to finish my final year of high school and interact with my friends and girlfriend in person due to the lockdowns happening and being obeyed. I was able to complete university papers a year above my level and be recognised by my school for my achievements both academically and onstage in my dramatic pursuits. So, coming from a country that obeyed all the restrictions and is now back to normal (and due to being back to normal, I got to have what I can say was the best year of my life in what should have been a terrible year even without covid for me), why do you think the restrictions don't work at fighting the disease? I want to understand so everyone can come together and agree on something</p></p>

        <p>No, I don't believe they do - nor does essentially anyone here.</p>
<p>Even if they did work, the repercussions of them far outweigh the harm of the virus itself. I'm in the US. Lockdowns here cause a massive economic crash, and huge spikes in unemployment, poverty, homelessness, starvation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, suicide, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Many detractors simply say that we just don't care about lives and that we're stupid, selfish people, but it couldn't be further from the truth. We just think the "cure" for this virus has far outweighed the potential harm of this virus itself. In addition, we believe that people should generally just take personal responsibility for their own health. If you're so terrifird and paranoid about this weak virus, simply stay home. It's easier than ever to do so. Protect the vulnerable, take any personal precautions you feel are necessary to feel safe, and love your life how you see fit and let others do the same. Just take basic personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Also, if lockdowns (amongst other things as well) truly worked, we wouldn't still be dealing with this virus a year later. New Zealand isn't at all like the rest of the world, in most senses. What works for New Zealand isn't likely to work for India, isn't likely to work for the United States. Everywhere is different, and everywhere needs to handle this virus on it's own - there's not necessarily any right or wrong way. Like in the US, there are spots that have essentially never even started to really open up all year that are going though massive surges </p>
<p>I think what all of this proves is that no one truly has a solid grasp on how to handle this virus well, particularly because everywhere is so different. What we've been doing isn't working, and I think the best thing we can do for the greater good of everyone is to open things up and get back to normal, while protecting the vulnerable and taking any personal precautions we deem necessary to stay safe. Just let others live their lives, and you live yours.</p>
<p>Lastly, you aren't being hostile or asking loaded questions, but you still may receive a little hostility back. Forgive them, this type of question gets asked several times every day, normally accompanied by a slew of insults by someone who has no intention of having any kind of real discussion.</p>

        <p>I agree that what works in New Zealand doesn't always work in other countries. However, especially in America, people were protesting as soon as stay at home orders were enacted saying that their freedom was violated. I find the "lockdowns don't work" idea and the protests for "freedom" simply hypocritical. If everyone in the world had self isolated for a month (which I know is unrealistic) these problems would have been gone. I think one of the best ways to reduce the economic impacts of these lockdowns is stimulus money. Again bringing up NZ, but here I was offered the option to keep being paid directly by the government. I turned it down, as it was not much and as a high school student I don't need the money, and I know paying everyone what they would have made out of the governments pocket is unrealistic, but more comprehensive stimulus action would have helped. Sorry for the rant btw</p>

        <p>&rt;people were protesting as soon as stay at home orders were enacted</p>
<p>I'll say what I did on one of your other comments:</p>
<p>Maybe in certain particular areas, sure, but it's not like the entire world is totally fine and we're the only ones still going through all this. Things have calmed down since the beginning of this all, and if all of these lockdowns, restrictions, and mandates truly worked, we'd be in the clear by now.</p>
<p>&rt;saying that their freedom was violated.</p>
<p>Well they certainly were violated. I'm not getting political, or saying whether it's right or wrong here, but the US was founded on, and is still very much about, personal freedoms and rights - whether you agree with them or not. Which is another large reason why mass-scale mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns could never work - especially a year into this thing. So one has to realize that all of these things just aren't going to work, and that the best thing the US can do is open back up.</p>
<p>&rt;If everyone in the world had self isolated for a month (which I know is unrealistic) these problems would have been gone.</p>
<p>I don't disagree, but like you said, that's (hugely) unrealistic. It's hard enough to get all citizens of one country to lock down for a couple weeks, let alone the entire world for a month. Hell, even then, we don't know for sure that all this would be over eith.</p>
<p>What we do know, is how all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns have massive and now obvious downsides. Downsides that disproportionately harm young and/or very healthy people. And all of this is for a virus that you may possibly sorta catch, that kinda maybe potentially has the chance to do some kind of harm to you. Again, just protect the vulnerable and take any and all personal precautions you feel the need to. We live with risk every single day of our lives. We need to adapt.</p>
<p>&rt;I think one of the best ways to reduce the economic impacts of these lockdowns is stimulus money.</p>
<p>You can see the huge downside of this though, yeah?</p>
<p>It really comes down to this for me:</p>
<p>Option 1: Totally shut down the economy and pay people, encouraging them to stay home and not go back to work (amongst other issues regarding paying all your citizens). All the while dealing with massive spikes in all those areas I mentioned earlier, and also trampling over any personal freedoms and liberties your citizens had. Not to mention the total upending of society as you know it.</p>
<p>Option 2: Open up the economy and encourage people to go back to work amd live their lives. The cases and deaths will rise, yes. As they inevitably do when people simply don't stay inside all day every day. Just make sure to protect the vulnerable and take personal precautions, like with anything else in life, and the risk can be highly mitigated. Keep the rights, liberties, and freedoms of your civilians intact.  Don't upend society as we know it.</p>
<p>I like option 2 better.</p>
<p>It's cool, I out-ranted you lol.</p>

        <p>Because if they did work the virus would have been wiped out in the places that have been on lockdown for months now. They are following all the rules and yet the virus still spreads. So clearly lockdowns are ineffective and in fact do more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Devils advocate here... OP is from new Zealand... So they ALLEGEDLY have no cases for months now.</p>
<p>They are also forbidden to leave....</p>
<p>I'm from a small province in Canada that has had the lowest number of cases consistently.. we had a full lockdown at the start and it still managed to kill over 60 people in our old age homes.</p>
<p>Telling me I can't go to the beach didn't save those people, which at the risk of sounding cold... May not have made it past this current flu season.</p>

        <p>I meant here in the states, they asked if I believe lockdowns work and for my part from what I've seen here the evidence points to that they don't. If it worked for them that's great, but it just doesn't here. </p>
<p>And I totally get what you mean, it may seem a bit cold but it irritates me how whenever any older person dies of Covid everyone acts like it's such a shock, as if that person wasn't more susceptible to every other virus that's out there and couldn't have just as easily died from that. It's insanity</p>

<p>I, along with a fair amount of others here, also believe that masks aren't going to act as a cure-all for this virus - similar to lockdowns. For me, the biggest reason is that the vast majority of people don't wear theirs properly, store it improperly, touch it incessantly, and/or don't wear a quality that's actually effective. That's not to say they never work in particular scenarios, but the notion that masks are our saving grace is silly. It's really all a charade to make people feel better, at this point. If I go without a mask, I'm seen as a stupid, selfish person by society and media - but they're cool with you if you wear a dirty old piece of cloth that's been crumpled up, tossed around, and touched over and over again for months, even though it likely causes more harm than wearing no mask at all.</p>

        <p>No you’re wrong here. The virus had been spreading since 2019.  It was when the media started fear porn 24/7 and the states started enacting lockdowns people started protesting. And remember this was not at the federal level so you literally had one state in complete lockdown but if you took a short trip in either direction over state lines, you could be free to live life as you wished before Covid constrictions depending on your latitude and longitude.</p>

        <p>First of all, thank you very, VERY much for being civil. It's greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: <strong>Lockdowns don't eradicate the virus for the vast majority of the world - they just kick the can down the road, while causing ghastly second-order effects. Covid is real, and should be treated with caution - but without grinding the entire world to a halt.</strong></p>
<p>To better answer your question -</p>
<p>You say you're from New Zealand, so one of the very few places that actually had a chance of containing it, and that seems to be the current scenario - but it needs to be said that containing it does not eradicate it. You now essentially have a virgin community that cannot open widely again for free trade or tourism for the foreseeable future. Humanity is incapable of 100% compliance to anything - eventually, the virus will be reintroduced, and you'll continually be returned to square one.</p>
<p>Despite recent vocabulary changes, herd immunity is something reached when a virus spreads naturally throughout a population over time. The vaccines don't seem to confer antibodies yet (tbh I'm not sure what they do - sounds like just will give you a lighter case if you catch it?), and the side effects are brutal. Until a better vaccine comes out, what's the end game? Stay locked down until that time, with no tourism until further notice/years down the line?</p>
<p>For all non-island nations, there aren't strict entry/exit points that can be monitored. And even the harshest lockdowns didn't shut down essential infrastructure - as long as there's essential workers, there's still potential spread, and thus eradication is off the table. So what, then, are the lockdowns for?</p>
<p>It was originally sold as 2 weeks to slow the spread, so hospitals could prepare - and yet here we are 8 months later and they're acting like everyone's hospitals are still in march. We built field hospitals and never used them. They keep talking about surges but nothing has arrived that our hospitals can't handle. Now they're asking us to lock down like in March, as though nothing's changed - except a lot <em>has</em> changed. There's millions more in poverty, people being told to shut their businesses without being provided necessary compensation, and then are fined thousands while they're attempting to feed their families. But for <em>what?</em></p>
<p>What do we have to show for it? What's the end goal?</p>
<p>Excess mortality in Europe shows no correlation between lockdown and saved lives. Scroll down to Z score. UK and Spain locked down the hardest. Regardless of lockdown status, a spike happened at roughly the same time and continued in roughly the same way.</p>

<p>Tuburculosis kills 1.5 million each year, and lockdowns have set progress back years, if not decades:</p>

<p>At-home gatherings account for potentially up to 74% of new cases - and yet lockdowns remove all other potential options for social interaction.</p>

<p>Speaking of cases, there is no officially released data for the false positive rate of the globally used PCR test, nor is there a gold standard to compare it to.  Anything over 20-25 cycles is likely to be a false positive. The average PCR cycle in the US is 40.</p>

<p>Quick edit to add a proper conclusion - New Zealand may have kept the virus out for now, but that's only as long as you stay entirely isolated from the rest of the world. Lockdowns elsewhere have barely made a dent in their case count, while simultaneously wreaking havoc on the economy, as well as decimating progress in the fight against hunger, abuse, and other welfare campaigns. And yet, somehow discussing alternatives is still taboo.</p>
<p>The virus seemed scary at first, yes, but all evidence is pointing to it essentially being a nursing home pandemic, leaving the young all but untouched. But even with that knowledge, entire generations are being forced to give up months/potentially years of their youth to save the elderly, while those same revered elders are being forced to spend those 'saved' months in complete isolation and fear. I sincerely hope it's better in nursing homes in new zealand, but most I've heard from are nothing short of hell. No family visits, no socialization allowed. Just isolation, with masked carers, almost inhuman looking in full PPE. The best they have to hope for is waving at blurry family members on a screen. No one wins in this scenario. That, more then anything, is what baffles me about the reaction to this pandemic. Simply being alive is not the same as living, and not enough people seem to understand that.</p>
<p>I'm happy that you're currently able to go out and about and live life as normal - but if/when another case is detected, are hard lockdowns the only solution currently on the table? Or has your government discussed gentler measures of mitigation?</p>

        <p>Biggest Takeaway: New Zealand is essentially still in lockdown, so it can’t be technically said they eradicated anything. They simply sealed themselves up hoping for another country to find a cure, or waiting for global herd immunity.</p>

        <p>People that compare New Zealands lockdown success to the rest of the worlds failings are missing a few brain cells. One is a sparsely populated Island in the middle of nowhere. The other is, well, the complete opposite. Kind of obvious to see the problem right?</p>

        <p>Seeing as Covid was confirmed here in the US and other parts of the world in 2019 for a solid 5-6 months before any lockdown or mask mandates were implemented and life went on as normal it proves a lockdown wasn’t needed. People got sick, stayed home, got better and kept their jobs. No. Lockdowns were not needed and hospitals were not overrun and the economy wasn’t tanking.</p>

        <p>I think lockdowns don’t work (in this situation) because it just prolongs the virus. From a completely logical standpoint a virus easily spread but not deadly will just dwindle and slowly continue to infect people. Instead of being like a typical flu, one and done.</p>
<p>From my personal opinion, I hate the authoritarianism and think freedom is more important than <em>security</em> and in case you’re wondering, I’m not American. Sometimes I wish I was though. I respect them for being the pinnacle of freedom and liberty in the world.</p>

        <p>This is kind of like asking a pro-life crowd if they think abortions are a good solution for population control. We’re a little biased here. With that said... I think I have a somewhat nuanced opinion that’s hated by all sides. Soooooo...</p>
<p>Yes IMO lockdowns when implemented properly work. But we have never had a real lockdown in the United States. We’ve had a series of half assed half enforced half participated in so called shutdowns. Our freedoms and the fact that we are almost like 50 individual countries in one border have hindered our ability to get on the same page and deal with this one way or another. Please don’t mistake my observation as advocating for giving up any of our freedoms, I’m not offering opinion here but what I believe to be fact.</p>
<p>In countries like yours which are mostly culturally and racially homogenous like so many of the European countries that practice socialism successfully, in addition to countries that lean more towards totalitarianism, for example China and Thailand, you guys have been wildly successful in combating coronavirus. You don’t have our issues. </p>
<p>We are widely culturally, ethnically, racially, and politically divided. I think we went from a melting pot to a tossed salad a long time ago. In this event we know as 2020 diversity has not been our strength.</p>
<p>Now so that I won’t be branded a Nazi or sheep, I want to be clear that I have never been in favor of shutting down our country or our economy to protect maybe 20% of the population from a flu that has a 1% chance of killing them. </p>
<p>I think the world has lost it’s fucking mind in 2020. But I would’ve rather have had a real shut down for 45 days and burned it out than go through the bullshit we’ve gone through this year and that I believe we will continue to go through for who knows how long. I hate this planet.</p>

        <p>No, I don't. So, are they allowing people to travel in and out of New Zealand freely, and if not then what do they think has to happen in order to open up?</p>
<p>I have to say, I saw an interview with Jacinda Arden where she was talking about the quarantine camps with a very disturbing cackle and side grin when she was explaining how people can opt to take the tests or stay in there. The emotion seemed non-congruent to the topic. </p>
<p>And I've heard something about migrant workers being confined in the resorts. Also, the homeless rate increasing. Can you share anything about that?</p>

        <p>NZ is allowing people in, but they must stay in a 4 star hotel guarded by military for 14 days while being tested. Could you please provide the clip of this interview. And no, I've never seen or heard anything about migrant workers being confined to resorts or the homeless rates increasing. I don't doubt that the homelessness rates are going up due to the world wide recession, but can't provide any concrete data</p>

        <p>I thought it would be easier to find it again but apparently a lot has happened in the past 3 weeks that's been posted on youtube about New Zealand. Last time I looked, there hadn't been much at all in recent search results. Sorry!</p>
<p>Will vaccines be mandated for citizens?</p>

        <p>Thank you, and to answer your question about whether or not I think the restrictions fight the disease, we've never been able to isolate the virus and the PCR tests don't detect the live virus. So the case counts are a farse, and every reaction based on them.</p>

        <p>New Zealand being an island can tightly control people coming and going. A few isolated cases is easy to deal with but containment has failed for the rest of the world and the virus is now endemic. Lockdown until eradication isn't feasible there are too many animal hosts and doubts about long term immunity. New Zealand travel restrictions will far outlast restrictions in other countries for fear of a single case.</p>

        <p>POV from the UK. We have ten times your population with a slightly smaller landmass so it was always going to be harder. Boris dithered on lockdown until it was too late and the virus got out of control. This first one was quite well observed, including by me. </p>
<p>Now we’re looking at a third one in January, many areas have been in lockdown in all but name for several months. People are sick of it and not complying. Jobs are being lost, people are relying on food banks and going hungry. The more times we lock down, the more this sentiment will grow. “Third time lucky” is not based on science and people know this. </p>
<p>Combine this with the hypocrisy and mistrust of the government and people wonder if there’s anything to be gained from listening to a word they say. Do lockdowns work? Not under these conditions, they had their chance and they blew it.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is like a gated community.   Great that you are privileged enough to live on a wealthy island that enjoys the protection of the US military but it's not reality for other countries. </p>
<p>If US wasn't protecting you, NZ would have been taken over by China or Russia long ago and you wouldn't be so cozy.  If you weren't so privileged NZ would need tourism to stay afloat and you wouldn't be so lucky.</p>
<p>Have some self awareness that you are essentially the 1% of the 1% of the world that enjoys those type of living conditions. </p>
<p>Also, let us know in 6 months how that is all going because your situation won't stay this way permanently.   The virus will come to your island and you'll see there never was any way to prevent it, only delay it at great cost.</p>
