    <strong>Questions about how to argue with people who are pro-lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of my family members are pro-lockdowns and will obey public health measures because they are scared of Covid-19.</p>
<p>So if I say that masks and whatever are a restrictions on civil liberties what do I say if they tell me that hospitals are at full capacity and people need to be transported to other hospitals and that young people are dying from the variants?</p></p>

        <p>I mean there’s really no single moment where you’re gonna just blast their eyes open. Eventually over time they will either not be able to reconcile reality with what they’ve been told, or they will shut down harder and not take anything in. Keep going if you want, but for your own sanity you need to accept that if you do have an impact it will be a gradual one, and there will be lots of resistance either way.</p>
<p>A good fun fact to share though is per capita death rates vs lockdown severity. Peru had an extremely strict lockdown and one of the worst outcomes for deaths.</p>

        <p>We don't know what's gonna happen yet. The fake stuff could be an inb4. </p>
<p>Predictive programming is their thing. I wouldn't be surprised if they were leading us into a false sense of security and fuck us in the ass when we least expect it.</p>

        <p>If they say that hospitals are overwhelmed just tell them if they remember when a country had like 20,000 cases and spitals already said they are almost full capacity. Now there are countries with millions of cases but still somehow they managed to survive and nobody has ended up being thrown out on the street. If they argue against that don t continue and try changing their minds, it is pointless.</p>

        <p>Technically .. you don`t. Because if they did not realise on their own in 1 year that something is wrong, you`re not the one to convice them for sure. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But if you really want to try .. just ask them "If the virus is real, how come it`s not in the vaccines like the old normal ones ?" ... The wont have an answer to that trust me, because they wont find any research document to say the virus is real. Yeah, you heard me right .. Up to date no vaccine contains the isolated inactive viral genome, AZ / J&amp;J / Sputnik V and "Wuhan" vaccines contain the new 'discovered' fragment + monkey / human DNA build up on a computer program to resemble a normal virus (not the isolated virus as it would be normal) and there is no research out there to state otherwise. If they don`t understand this, don`t bother.</p>

        <p>If lockdowns worked. They would have worked. NZ is the only place that has had success. so 99.5% of the time lockdowns failed in almost every location they've been tried. Only the completely braindead and brainwashed still think its a good idea. Go to <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org">gbdeclaration.org</a></p>

        <p>Just ask them why the military doesn't set up military hospitals then? We have medical military personnel at every level, from National Guard to the Reserves to Active Duty. If the hospitals were overflowing it would be as simple as setting up field hospitals and triage centers for these people. That's EXACTLY what would happen if we were ever attacked and suffered massive casualties throughout cities.</p>
<p>If civilian hospitals can't handle the load, we have MORE than enough resources to augment that care.</p>
<p>As to the virus itself and its variants, just ask them to show you a picture of the virus, in isolation, with an electron microscope. They won't be able to pull one up because it doesn't exist. Now, ask them to pull up actual photos of other viruses just to ensure that the technology exists but nobody has isolated the Covid virus because it's all fake.</p>
