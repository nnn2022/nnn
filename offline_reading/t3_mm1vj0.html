    <strong>Findings of the Milgram Experiment and How It Relates to Today</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;With few exceptions subjects were convinced of the reality of the experimental situation, that they were administering shocks to another person, and the most potent shocks were extremely painful. </p>
<p>Basically this was a test to see if people would obey authority to the point of possibly killing someone against their own values. The authority tells the subject to press a button which shocks a (unknown to the subject, fake) victim, and this is repeated with higher voltages and more horrifying feedback (ie the victim pleading and screaming), ending with a lethal voltage. Please do yourself and the world a favor and read the <a href="http://library.nhsggc.org.uk/mediaAssets/Mental%20Health%20Partnership/Peper%202%2027th%20Nov%20Milgram_Study%20KT.pdf">full pdf of the experiment here</a> at some point.  Let's look at some of the findings and how they explain 2021 culture. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Out of 40 participants, 26 listened to authority figures all the way to "killing" the "victim". Nobody stopped before the midway point. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every subject went beyond the predicted quiting point and the earliest to drop out was at level 20, with the "victim" kicking on the walls and injured beyond the ability to communicate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While many of the 26 felt extreme stress, even laughing uncontrollably or full blown seizing in some cases, they continued anyways.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it is also noted some of the 26 never lost their calm. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I quote: "Subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will. Yet, 26 subjects abandon this tenet in following the instructions of an authority who has no special powers to enforce his commands. To disobey would bring no material loss to the subject; no punishment would ensue. It is clear from the remarks and outward behavior of many participants that in punishing the victim they are often acting against their own values. Subjects often expressed deep disapproval of shocking a man in the face of his objections, and others denounced it as stupid and senseless. Yet the majority complied with the experimental commands." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reason why people may have obeyed is, and I quote: "The experiment is sponsored by and takes place on the grounds of an institution of unimpeachable reputation, Yale University. It may be reasonably presumed that the personnel are competent and reputable..." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another reason: "Obedience occurs not as an end in itself, but as an instrumental element in a situation that the subject construes as significant, and meaningful. He may not be able to see its full significance, but he may properly assume that the experimenter does." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It notes: "satisfaction of the victim and the experimenter are mutually exclusive. Moreover, the resolution must take the form of a highly visible action, that of continuing to shock the victim or breaking off the experiment. Thus the subject is forced into a public conflict that does not permit any completely satisfactory solution." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also: "The experiment gives the subject little time for reflection. The conflict comes on rapidly. It is only minutes after the subject has been seated before the shock generator that the victim begins his protests." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final paragraph concludes: "At a more general level, the conflict stems from the opposition of two deeply ingrained behavior dispositions: first, the disposition not to harm other people, and second, the tendency to obey those whom we perceive to be legitimate authorities." </p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>If you already see how this ties to 2021, thanks for coming, please leave your thoughts. Otherwise.... </p>
<p>People obey authority, and for a variety of possible reasons. They obey authority to the point of torturing on command, murdering on command. More horrifying, they obey no matter how much their body, mind, and spirit resist. They obey against all raised and ingrained values, and some of them without ever questioning or doubting the authority at all. People obey authority even when they are free not to, even when there will be no repercussions for them they still submit. Even if they full on believe what they are doing is wrong or pointless, even if they question the morality of the authority, they obey. </p>
<p>One fascinating way to make people obey is simply by using reputation. If it comes from the right source for your audience, they will adhere without question, even when those sources are constantly caught lying and flip flopping. </p>
<p>Another way is to convince them what they are doing is meaningful and significant, like saving millions of lives and making every conformer a Saint, even if the claim is baseless. It doesn't even matter if the audience cannot see any change from their behavior, they have faith the authority sees what they cannot. </p>
<p>Further, once people do submit to the authority, they keep doing it out of loyalty and a feeling that if they stop it will be a matter of public embarrassment, like idk, getting doxxed online. This is all kept in place by a rapid pace, insuring the subjects do not have time to question what the authority is making them do. </p>
<p>In the end, for the average person, submission to authority ends up replacing their previous values no matter how difficult that may be.  This includes authority being able to - easily and without any threat of punishment - override their disposition to not harm others.</p></p>

        <p>The Milgram Experiment is considered one of the progenitors of 'junk science'.</p>
<p>Not to say it isn't an interesting result that tells us quite a bit about human nature, but it can't be considered scientific by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Research into psychology tends to have these problems.</p>

        <p>Honestly this point should vanish, both WWII and Panic 2020-21 prove Milgrams results even if Milgram had never done the experiment</p>

        <p>This point will never vanish because it's undeniable.  Milgram's experiment didn't 'prove' anything, other than the effects of misreporting on the "I fUcKiNg LoVe ScIeNcE" crowd.</p>
<p>The subjects were coerced into completing the experiment, even after exhibiting symptoms that would have had any ethical researcher ushering them out the door with a thank-you and a small stipend.  If anything, the results prove the opposite of what everyone thinks they show.</p>
<p>It's touted as "look how readily people will visit unpleasantness on their fellow man!" when the results are actually "look how we can force people to visit unpleasantness on their fellow man even after they've started shaking and crying and we tell them they have no other choice".</p>
<p>See the difference?  Yes, people believe bullshit when it's shoveled by an authority figure.  You don't need to be a Yale researcher to see that.  They'll do terrible things.  No one's arguing that, but this experiment doesn't show the mechanism by which it happens.</p>

        <p>&rt;"look how we can force people to visit unpleasantness on their fellow man even after they've started shaking and crying and we tell them they have no other choice"</p>
<p>Exactly. Which is objectively true, and is happening right now. The interesting this is specifically that they did violate ethics imo. I'm not saying you should think Milgram was a good person. I'm saying he proved the same thing as wwii, that the average majority can be forced to obey even when they are shaking and crying in moral rejection of the act. This is absolute fact, it's how genocide happens.</p>
