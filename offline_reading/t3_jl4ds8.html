    <strong>Hello people of no new normal i would like to have a calm understanding discussion with you about your views! :)</strong>
    <p><p>I am truly interested and as long as i get treated with respect i shall treat y’all the same
1. Why are you against masks
2.Did you start not wearing mask by yourself or something you read/heard?
3. This is more of a bonus question! Are you against vaccinations? </p>
<p>Thank you i look forward to reading your responses</p></p>

        <p>1.I’m not against masks, I’m against mandatory masks. 
2.I’m not against vaccines, I’m against mandatory vaccines </p>
<p>This is about control, not a virus, I believe. Not only is the virus not very deadly (My parents grew up in a 3rd world country and I lived there for a bit, and you see real menaces there like tuberculosis and malaria, so gives me a bit more perspective against this 99.9%+ survival rate virus for healthy young people) but the measures taken in response are totalitarian. No freedom of assembly. Restricted freedom of movement. Restricting freedom of expression. Online, restricted freedom of speech. This is the beginning of the kind of totalitarian nightmare envisioned in 1984, and people willfully follow their ruler’s dictates for the illusion of “safety”.</p>

        <p>Just look at what’s going on in Australia.  Talk about extreme lockdowns.   Hell they even broke down a door to a PREGNANT woman’s home and took all her computers and phones simply because she spoke out against the lockdowns.  </p>
<p>of course they have a different stance on freedom of speech but do you really want that to happen here in the states?  Government breaking your dooor down when they catch you saying things they don’t like?</p>
<p>Only times that should happen is if you made threats to government officials, or you are a child predator.</p>

        <p>It's mostly Victoria. I'm in rural New South Wales and we've forgotten about the virus for the most part (we're already talking about it in the past tense) and they have let us go back to more or less "normal".</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the stupid rules still surrounding church, the pub, some shops, etc. which at this point are really just an elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it's like an experiment to see how different areas end up with different levels of restrictions and enforcement of safety measures, and we're some kind of control group.</p>

        <p>Shit in Melbourne is insane. </p>
<p>They just recently “exited” lockdown, which means they are now allowed to: </p>
<ul>
<li>leave home for any reason (as opposed to only for approved reasons) </li>
<li>be outside as much as they want (as opposed to 1 hour per day) </li>
<li>have up to 2 visitors, from the same household, over (so if you have 2 adult children who live separately, they are not allowed to come over together for a family dinner) </li>
<li>travel up to a generous 25 km from home without papers </li>
</ul>
<p>This is their <strong>post</strong> lockdown state.</p>

        <p>That survival rate is not accurate at all. And if it's about control, why obey any laws? This seems like a pick and choose what to be mad about type thing, usually based on some fucktard on the internet telling you what to think.  Unless you're a complete anarchist and ignore every law, that comment doesent really have any credibility</p>

        <p>I must apologize i misread ok so imma go in order 1. I support most of lockdowns but i feel the gov. Should be giving them a higher of money if unemployment was caused due to covid 19 2. About mental health where i am at we are aloud to hold gatherings of max 5 people so that excludes loneliness and therapists are still available 3. They are just studying the disease i see nothing wrong with it and finally the air raid sirens thats wierd asf. How are they using them</p>

        <p>Thanks for your comment.</p>
<p>I don't support the lockdowns, as they tried this before and the fall out due to lose of jobs, and businesses having to close was high. The government can only give out so much money..which is why furlough has now stopped.</p>
<p>Why can they not try another way?</p>
<p>Mental health is more then just being able to see other people, it's reading all the MSM constant depressing reports and the fact that we the people are being blamed " we are in lock down because it's your fault you're living your lives to much" it's the anxiety of not knowing what is next, not knowing if we will have jobs next month..</p>
<p>Yes they are studying the virus, but it's been proven that the tests they are using were not manufactured to be used for this virus.</p>
<p>The false positives are very high. Meaning people are staying home with no pay for 2 weeks for no reason.</p>
<p>In march 2020 in London, the city was recorded by quite a few people,  testing the 4 minute war sirens..</p>
<p>France are now using the sirens to tell people when they need to be inside of their homes, if they are caught outside they are fined or/and arrested..</p>
<p>Google Paris 4 minute sirens. https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSCpSq5H/</p>
<p>Germany have said they are testing their sirens.</p>
<p>So for a virus which is not deadly, we are living through this hell..</p>
<p>The times magazine has this as their current front page cover, the great reset. https://mobile.twitter.com/time/status/1319563867345879040 </p>
<p>4/5 months ago whenever someone spoke about "the great reset" they were called crazy, now everyone is talking about it..</p>
<p>Yes I get some people will die if they catch the virus same as some people will die from the flu. But we can't stop the world and ruin the economy for this..it's going too far.</p>
<p>Sorry for any spelling errors my phone auto corrects everything..and I can't be bothered to go through and check everything..</p>

        <p>I'm not necessarily against masks, I'm just against the enforcement of wearing masks. I was actually all for the shutdown at the very beginning because I got too caught up in the news telling me what to do because it was good for me. Now I'm against the whole lockdown and mask enforcement because the people of this country have become sheep it seems like.</p>

        <p>The economy has been negatively affected by it, which hurts people in the long run. It has caused many people with mental illness a lot of problems since they can't socialize like they use too. People can say to just use zoom or something to chat but it isnt the same as being in person face to face. I "graduated" this year and got half of my senior year taken away. I can barely remember what school was even like because this whole year has been a jumbled blur and time has been strange. And also the hypocrisy that some groups of people can get away with not social distancing for political reasons but the rest of us have to be locked up in our houses like good little sheep.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone should be forced to wear a mask of they don't want to. Let people take the risks that they're comfortable with and live the consequences. I never started wearing masks. I was scared of the virus initially, but then I remembered how bird flu, swine flu, and zika were all going to be some global pandemic. It's the little boy who cried wolf except with a pandemic. In regards to your question about vaccines. I'm only against them if they're frivolous. The polio vaccine was amazing because it actually eradicated a virus with very severe complications that killed a lot of people. The flu vaccine in my eyes is relatively pointless because even if they do guess the strain right the flu doesn't usually kill you or leave you with severe after effects. For a vast majority of people it just lays them up in bed for a week</p>

        <p>Because there were already other respiratory viruses before Covid going around and killing people with pre-existing conditions and it was just accepted that we didn’t all need to wear masks because of it.

        <p>You’ve been great, but please try to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a lot of people here are suffering greatly in various ways as a result of lockdowns, and they are naturally getting angrier the longer it goes on (particularly because the world either ignores their harms or dismisses them as unimportant) and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this sub has recently been heavily brigaded by people who are NOT interested in discussion, but only in calling us selfish grandma killers </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, those factors tend to make people grumpy and very suspicious of the “I’m just trying to understand” posts. </p>
<p>That said, you have been very cordial and this topics deserves a good discussion, so I suggest you write a similar post in r/lockdownskepticism - perhaps more directly asking about why people oppose lockdowns; you’ll find that most people oppose lockdowns specifically because they <em>do</em> care about others ... they’re just thinking and caring about a much bigger group of people than you are, and that changes the analysis dramatically. </p>

        <p>Oh, and to answer your questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not opposed to masks, I am opposed to mask mandates after thoroughly reviewing a significant amount of evidence (studies, systematic reviews) and learning that it overwhelmingly supports a conclusion that masks are ineffective. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally disliked masks, but I went into the research with an open mind. I was very surprised by what I learned. Without getting into a technical discussion, I’ll say that after reviewing the body of peer reviewed research I would absolutely be okay with a surgeon going maskless while he fiddles around with my innards - because I believe in evidence-based practice, and the evidence says masks do nothing. This, btw, was not a controversial stance until a few months ago; hospitals commonly questioned the use of masks due to the evidence against their effectiveness (conclusions are always the same: no evidence but keep masks because they make people feel good). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am all for vaccinations. I am not willing to take a vaccine for which only very short term data is available, when the disease it protects against is extremely unlikely to cause serious harm if I do get it. By the way, I know many doctors (neurosurgeons, cardiologists, internists) who will absolutely not take the vaccine until longer term data is available. Our testing requirements are the result of very painful lessons from failing to test adequately in the past; only idiots repeat the same mistakes.</p>

        <p>I’m not against masks. I’m against the way it’s presented and that were derailing the lives of many for those of the few. </p>
<p>If you’re sick stay home</p>
<p>If you’ve been sick or exposed to someone who has or are in a risky job, wear a mask. </p>
<p>The mask should be actually somewhat effective, not a hanky, T-shirt, or whatever other bull shit people are telling you “may be better than nothing”</p>
<p>If you’re high risk, YOU should be the one staying safe, not locking down everyone else. </p>
<p>If you’re going to require a mask, you better provide it, not let me dig the old gaiter I’ve been wearing and not washing for 8 months out and pretend we are safe. </p>
<p>If you want to open your business, that’s on you, and the people who want to visit it.  You can’t tell me people don’t make decisions every day to eat somewhere else based on cleanliness, same principle applies here.  </p>
<p>Basically, your protection should be your business, not the government or anyone else’s, I don’t give a shit about your grandma, her safety is her and your responsibility.</p>

<li>I’m against masks being mandated by the government because I don’t think the government has the right to make that choice for me. If you want to wear a mask that’s fine I just am against them being mandatory. Also there’s a lot of evidence questioning whether they work or not (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jkgi3i/these_12_graphs_show_mask_mandates_do_nothing_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">x</a>) (<a href="https://archive.is/VFKzK">x</a>) and while I’m sure you can poke holes in any study, the fact that there are this many studies questioning their effectiveness is proof governments really shouldn’t be mandating them at least without further research.</li>
<li>I wear a mask because otherwise I would be denied the ability to go to school in person. </li>
<li>No as long as they are tested properly and shown to be effective. </li>
</ol>
<p>Also masks aren’t really the biggest focus, pro lockdown advocates put so much emphasis on them to make our criticisms of the policies seem trivial.</p>

        <p>Well it’s pretty similar to my views on masks. If you chose to avoid contact with others that’s fine and may work for some people but it’s not realistic in the long term and what it actually does when forced on the population is trade the lives of the young who die of suicide, poverty or lack of medical care for the lives of elderly people who were on their way out in a few years and could’ve died just as easily from flu season. I’m not trying to say their deaths aren’t sad but death is a part of a life and the life of someone who lived a nice and happy 75 years is not as tragic as a 20 year old who spent their last few months isolated and killed themselves.</p>

        <p>No to both and I’m actually a registered Democrat but I don’t like the lockdowns and mandates going on.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that yes the virus is real and yes there are <em>some</em> deaths but it’s not the 200k they’ve been reporting. The case count is also blown out of proportion as there are a lot of false positives especially from hospitals that raise their case and death count to get funding. </p>
<p>I believe people have the right to wear a mask if they chose to but that it shouldn’t be a requirement.  High risk, the sick and those who want to take caution should simply stay home and not throw their fear on everyone else. </p>
<p>I believe BOTH sides have made it political.  The right for claiming it’s a Democrat hoax and the left for issuing said mandates, and automatically assuming anyone who questions this is a trumper/conservative.</p>

        <p>Tell that to California. They're literally throttling Thanksgiving where you can only have 3 families over at a time (where's the metric in that???) and it has to be outdoors. [I probably butchered the exact quantity but you get the idea]</p>

        <p>I think I heard about that.  Are they actually gonna patrol each home and break down the doors of homes that have multiple cars in the driveway? (Not knowing one home may have 2-3 cars already)</p>

        <p>Doubt it. They don't have the manpower. You have to realize what little power the gov has and that they just want to indoctrinate sheep into <em>fearing</em> the government. It's all security theater. Same with TSA. TSA is actually shit at detecting stuff, it's all theater.</p>
<p>They are also setting up people to rat on other families. Say if you have 6 cars in your driveway when you normally have 3, the rat would feel like "I'm doing my part for my community" to rat on the family having people over. It's incentivized in some countries to tell on your neighbor. They just want to indoctrinate the fear and make you feel like they have power when they actually don't. You don't have to wear masks in most places... I haven't done it in months!!! (besides me traveling on airplanes where I could get black-listed)</p>

<li>
<p>i’m against masks because i shouldn’t be forced to do anything I don’t want to. I hate when people compare it to wearing clothes because clothes don’t cover up half of my face. Unlike some people, I take pride in my face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i started watching the news and listened to my father, who i thought was very intelligent even before this. the whole thing seems blown out of proportion to me, especially after seeing these subs confirming my ideas. i still wear a mask at school because otherwise i wouldn’t be able to do in-person learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I take any vaccine I need to stay healthy and I’d choose to vaccinate my child if i have any in the future. I don’t think vaccines should be mandatory, though. I also don’t see the point in taking one for coronavirus because coronavirus hasn’t proved that it can do shit to me. Too many loop-holes and unanswered questions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the mask stuff really matters, though. I would be irritated but I wouldn’t be as enraged as I am if it wasn’t for the lockdown. </p>
<p>Ruined my life and ruined the lives of countless others. I wasn’t made for a life of isolation and it’s driving me closer to ending it everyday. That’s the main reason these subs are a sanctuary for me.</p>
<p>the lockdown is putting people in poverty, causing starvation, suicides and overdoses are increasing, domestic abuse is a lot more prevalent, small businesses are losing money and closing down. </p>
<p>not to mention the remote learning BS. I only got one year of a genuine high school experience before I got thrown out because of these fear-mongerers so you shouldn’t be surprised to realize that I’d rather kill myself than live in this new normal for another year. </p>
<p>I was decently popular, had friends and a few girls liked me before this. Now I spend most of my days in complete silence and isolation, thinking about what used to be and what I could’ve done differently. </p>
<p>This is the only place on the internet I can express my frustrations without getting told to ‘suck it up’ or ‘just wear a fucking mask’.</p>

        <p>Hi from a friendly Canadian liberal! (Former? kind of?  .. I dont know anymore!)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For me masks are a symbol of the "whole thing" which I am convinced is a power grab by various forces.  I believe there is a virus, and I believe it can kill people, but I think the danger is being exaggerated in order to further agendas that people would resist otherwise.   When people say "Is it really such a big deal?" Imagine if someone came up to you and wanted to touch you intimately somehow.   Is it really such a big deal if a stranger touches your genitals for a second?  Why make such a big deal out of it?  "C'mon!  It's just a little grope!"  See what I mean?  It's the &rt;principal&lt; of the thing.  If I really believed in the legitimacy of the situation i would have no problem wearing masks, and I do wear them when I must (although I make it clear I am not enjoying myself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never "into it" because I was skeptical of the situation from the beginning. So when the masks came into the story my opinion was the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was never <em>previously</em> against vaccinations, but this year has changed my opinion on them overall. I would still take a Covid vaccine, but I would honestly prefer to wait a few years and see how things work out. But I know I will be severely disadvantaged until I take the vaccine, so we will see.   I dont think the vaccine is going to murder people, but I do think it is the excuse to implement the "vaccination system" which will include an app to show you are "safe" and checks everywhere.  And then eventually money will go all digital, and eventually since you have money/vaccination history/birth certificate/driver's license all on some kind of app .. a chip or tattoo will be the next "logical" step.  Out of "convenience".  But then once humans are inherently "on the grid", then human society can be "optimized".  And I dont like that idea at all.</p>
</li>

        <p>But I think its a good comparison.  Imagine if someone came up to you and touched your nipple.  Technically, it really isnt that big of a deal, right?  A little nipple touch!  Just one finger!   But it <em>is</em> a big deal, because someone is touching you without your consent.  And consent, and body autonomy, is a big part of this issue for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>I against masks because they don't work (that's according to many peer reviewed papers... Including the cdc) and they actually increase infection. How often do you see people grabbing them right in front of their nose to readjust?</p>
<p>I don't wear one in public, as rare as it is for me to be in public per my situation. I wear one in stores bc 1- it's private property. They can have whatever dress code they want. 2- I'm often in too much a rush to deal with maskholes. Quicker just to throw one on so they shut up.</p>
<p>I think vaccines are great. We're reaching herd immunity via natural infection -if we aren't there already- and I'm fine with everyone getting them at their discretion. I know some people just can't take them. I usually ignore the flu vaccine since I'd rather someone that needs it get it and I always end up sick if I get one. It's also a guess on the strain... They aren't efficient but they aren't bad. </p>
<p>I'm really happy to talk civil if you are. Id rather tell you there's nothing to be afraid of instead of calling you an idiot.</p>

        <p>Think of it this way. You're under the assumption that anything that catches it, or at least someone who is at risk, is a guaranteed death sentence. Did you have the same concern during any other flu year? Swine flu? MERS? The first SARS?</p>
<p>If you trust that lysol to kill 99.9% of germs, maybe apply that same principle</p>

        <p>Also a masks only  truely work if you keep them sterile.  That’s what hospital workers do.   But the average joe, chances are they are using that same mask daily and keep it on their car seat or hanging off their rear view mirror or gear shifter and they touch it constantly.</p>

        <p>Please don’t rewear masks that long. </p>
<p>If you wear a mask, it is important to adhere to good mask hygiene - do not wear them for more than a few hours without washing or replacing. The purpose of masks is to collect shit that would otherwise pass through it; ignoring viruses, you are breathing bacteria onto the mask, which (thanks to your warm, humid breath) is a perfect breeding ground.</p>

        <p>That’s ... the point. </p>
<p>Proper mask hygiene is incompatible with daily human reality. Wearing a mask for a short, set period of time is one thing (and something that most people can do hygienically) but wearing masks 100% of the time you are outside of your home? Hygienic practices are practically impossible to maintain due to the high costs and inconvenience.</p>
<p>Mask mandates set unreasonable standards that lead to extremely poor hygiene for the typical person - even people who genuinely make a sincere effort to comply all of time succumb to unhygienic and arguably counterproductive habits for the sake of convenience (like reusing a mask “only” once). </p>
<p>As for the consequences of that, who the hell knows? Turns out we have absolutely no idea what breathing through a surgical mask for prolonged periods on a daily basis does to someone, if it does anything at all. We’ve never studied that, ever - why would we have? And honestly, I’m not sure such a study would even be approved due to ethical concerns. </p>
<p>Now, I’m <strong>NOT</strong> claiming that extensive daily use of masks is dangerous - I’m making the much more limited claim that we literally have no idea either way. We can’t, because we’ve never studied the safety of such prolonged daily use, much less the safety of such use of a <em>reused</em> or <em>overused</em> mask. It is entirely possible that breathing through a fibrous material all day, every day, has zero significant consequences for the person ... but based solely on what we know about inhalation of chemicals and fibers, it’s a little silly to just assume that there is NO consequence. </p>
<p>People who are so concerned about covid should be equally concerned about their lungs - our current use of masks (daily basis for long periods of time by the entire population) is arguably more novel than this coronavirus is. Health comes before convenience and economic factors, yes?</p>

        <p>No, they do NOT wear them the same way that someone working 50 hours a week at Walmart wears a mask - you cannot assume that regularly wearing a mask, with proper mask hygiene, for a few hours at a time is the same as wearing a mask <em>without</em> proper mask hygiene all day, every day. </p>
<p>Sure, they MAY be equivalent - but there is no basis for <em>assuming</em> that they are.</p>

<li>The evidence for masks is flimsy. Studies from before covid vary from not showing a strong correlation with masks and preventing infections to even correlating mask usage with increased infection spread. They're just being mandated so politicians can look like they're doing something. </li>
</ol>
<p>I do think they probably have some effect if they're worn correctly. The problem is the vast vast majority of people aren't wearing them correctly. They need to be changed every two hours, every time you touch the front of it, and every time it gets wet. We have people carrying a mask with them in their pocket and putting it on when they walk by someone. People are encouraged to put their mask on between bites at restaurants. They're not washing their cloth masks between uses. </p>
<p>So the virus could be on the mask and then they just handle it like it's nothing. Watch any news cast that shows people walking around in public and most aren't wearing them right. People can wear one if they want but they're a useless measure to mandate for the general public. All it's done is make people hate each other. </p>
<p>2   I wear a mask because I want to keep my job. </p>
<p>3   No. Just got my flu shot last week. I won't be quick to get the coronavirus vaccine though. It will not only be the fastest vaccine ever made, but the first vaccine for a coronavirus.</p>

        <p>I personally am against governments mandating masks because I don't believe other people should be responsible for my health (other than not trying to actively attack me). If someone requests me to wear one I will either wear it or leave. I won't stay by them if they don't want me to.</p>
<p>I started not wearing it on my own ( I'm not allowed to go many places now, as you can imagine ).  I've had difficulty wearing them since I was a child, when trying to wear masks around cleaning chemicals and dust.  I get very dizzy and feel like I'm going to pass out, and have fallen over before, as well as had muscle cramps, disorientation, and delayed muscle reaction. I don't understand why, but I finally found a mask that doesn't give me such bad reactions.</p>
<p>I'm not against vaccines, and have had many.</p>

        <p>1) I am not against masks, I wear one while grocery shopping.</p>
<p>2) In the spring I think everyone knew that masks might be useful, but the people in charge said "Don't wear masks". I think they did this to save the masks for the hospital workers who really needed them. I also think they lost a lot of public trust by doing this. Catch-22 there.</p>
<p>2.2) I am all for vaccinations that have been proved safe again and again over the years. While I am tempted to say that "Vaccine X should be mandatory because it is 100% safe" I actually don't go that far. The reason is this: although I generally trust vaccines, I can't guarantee that everyone should trust every vaccine in the future. I've read a bit of history and it isn't much of a stretch to imagine that vaccines could become quite harmful, either through malicious intent or just incompetence. So yes, please vaccinate your children, but also it is good to have some skeptics in the bunch to keep an eye on things. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Overall, I am here because I have an innate distrust of... well a lot of things. Anytime I see something go like wildfire on social media, it is cause for concern to me. Anytime it seems like <em>everyone</em> is marching in lock step singing the same songs I get a little freaked out. As they say:</p>
<p>"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"Never let a good crisis go to waste."</p>

        <p>Regarding masks, the fact that there is no standard for how good a mask should be is proof that there is no reason to wear a mask beyond dumb obedience. At work, in stores, wherever I HAVE to wear one (I refuse otherwise) I just wear a 2nd t shirt over my shoulders with the collar pulled up. </p>
<p>But it isn't about masks, it's about hiding. I could wear stretched pantyhose material shaped into a mask and no one would think anything of it because it doesn't actually matter.</p>

        <p>Also with the whole “don’t wear masks” thing in the beginning so we can save some for hospital workers is pure BS as Mask manufacturers send totally different shipments to hospitals and other health care facilities.  They don’t get the same shipments let alone masks the stores get.</p>

<li>I have God given rights and it is my choice to wear a mask or not. Wear one if you like, I don’t want to. </li>
<li>Lockdowns are crushing the economy and it has second-order effects that are worse for society than the virus: suicide, drug abuse, domestic violence. </li>
</ol>
<p>In short, this is wrong. What governments across the wild are doing will be looked at as crimes against humanity soon enough.</p>

        <p>Don't listen to any haters. If we have any hope as a society, it is that people like you will continue to cross the aisle and have honest conversations and ask questions in good faith. We can't just pull away from everyone we disagree with, we need to have real constructive debates.</p>
<p>Kinda hard to do that in lockdown though, since the internet tends to isolate and sort everyone into their ideological silos. One more reason for no new normal haha</p>
