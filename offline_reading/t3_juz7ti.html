    <strong>I could use some help</strong>
    <p><p>So I work in New York and Gov. Cuomo has said multiple times that everyone in New York will have to be vaccinated in order to keep their job. (Obligatory I'm fully vaccinated but I don't trust this one)</p>
<p>With this news on the horizon I'm trying to get prepared. Hopefully I can show my coworkers documentation and studys on why this vaccine isn't safe. So if you guys can post any and all links to serious and respected sources that I can print out and show to them I would really appreciate it. I'm hoping to put together a whole folder of information that I can copy and hand out.</p>
<p>My hope is if I change enough minds at work we will have strength in numbers.</p></p>

        <p>I think that's the only way, handing out information and hoping they wake up and say no in large enough numbers. That would be a nightmare of a situation for me because never mind the fact that I'm against vaccines with every fiber of my being but it could potentially seriously injure me and I don't even have a doctor or anything as I take care of myself. If my arm isn't falling off you won't see me near any of the establishments, they can't do anything for me I can't do better myself through more natural means.</p>
