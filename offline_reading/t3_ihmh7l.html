    <strong>I'm leaving New Zealand, one way or another</strong>
    <p><p>I’m an 18 year old international student from China, currently living in Auckland, New Zealand. My family and I are victims of persecution in China, therefore when I left my country 4 years ago, I vowed to never set foot in China again.</p>
<p>I spent the last 2 years in Canada to pursue my hobby of flying, and I passed my private pilot check ride at the end of 2019. I came to New Zealand in February after being accepted to a foundation programme at AUT, which, upon completion, allows me to gain admission to any universities in New Zealand. This was an excellent opportunity for me because otherwise, I would not be able to study at uni since I never got to finish high school.</p>
<p>I’ve always considered New Zealand a very progressive nation. As a leftist, I was a huge fan of the Labour Party, and the Ardern administration. I admired their achievements, such as abortion legalisation, higher minimum wage, referendum for legalisation of marijuana and euthanasia, etc. I was planning to live here for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just when I arrived in New Zealand, the pandemic arrived soon after, and I suddenly found myself in lockdown. At the time, I had no friends, no furniture, and nothing to do, but I still reluctantly supported the government’s policy, because it was considered a ‘once in a lifetime event’, even though I felt it was completely unnecessary, and a blatant human rights violation.</p>
<p>However, less than 2 months after life returned to normal, we are once again in lockdown, and it made me realise how ridiculous this so-called ‘elimination strategy’ is. Sooner than later, more cases will appear, and the government’s strategy will constantly put us back in lockdown, causing significant disruptions in the economy and our daily life. I’ve always suffered from mental health issues, but in the last two weeks, I had more suicidal thoughts than the rest of my life combined. This made me reconsider the idea of living here permanently. I did not come to New Zealand just so I can live under yet another authoritarian regime. It is appalling to me that, in a supposedly free country, basic civil rights such as freedom of association and freedom of movement can be abruptly taken away, for a completely made up reason.</p>
<p>When I finish my foundation programme, I will leave New Zealand as soon as possible if European universities accept my qualification. At the moment I am considering between Sweden and the Netherlands, although the Netherlands seems more likely since they have more English-taught programmes available. If this doesn’t work out, I will finish my bachelor’s degree here in NZ, and go to Europe for my Master’s. But either way, I will NOT be staying in New Zealand for the rest of my life.</p></p>

<p>Yes, they are. That's why they're closing the borders, as the farthest left countries always do.</p>

        <p>Best wishes to you, friend. I would opt to leave sooner rather than later. This treatment of citizens seems unprecedented. Not all stable democracies stay stable democracies. I would be fearful of getting locked in and not allowed to leave. Things are getting worse and not better. I hope you can make it to Sweden or the Netherlands.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, your safest bet will be to move to a population with a high density of smart, free-thinking, liberty-minded folk who can overwhelm the local government and keep law enforcement from going rogue. You have to find a pocket of people like that, which could be anywhere. Or, somehow convince a mass of people around you to smarten up, which, in my experience, is impossible, because when someone places their trust in celebrity, they'll never listen to friends or family.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your story. Sorry to hear that NZ has gotten crazy with the elimination strategy. I have found other accounts of people caught up in this, for example exchange students from Europe, they had a difficult time also. Stay strong and best of luck.</p>
