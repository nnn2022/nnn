    <p><p>I really want to try sometching out with the "jUsT weAR A f*"รท;%g mAsk" crowd.</p>
<p>I want to look them dead in the eyes and ask if they went to a country like Pakistan (for some crazy reason) or other another country like such where women must cover their face by law, would they contact the authorities to report a woman not wearing a burka? Would they alert their husbands to make sure they get the beating they deserve?</p>
<p>It's just a face covering, right?</p>
<p>I honestly cannot see a difference with the way some people think. I welcome discussion to prove me wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Want to know the real answer?</p>
<p>If a woman not wearing her burka was a threat to <em>them</em>, or the government told them it needed to be done "because reasons", then yes, they would totally sell those women out.</p>
<p>But the answer they will give you is "No, because it's not a health hazard".</p>
