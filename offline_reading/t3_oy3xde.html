        <p>The vaccines say they lock the spike proteins in a form that cannot bind to the ACE2 receptors, and I haven't found anyone explicitly refute this, but spike proteins binding is the only explanation for a lot of the adverse events. Wat up wit dat?</p>

        <p>Oh this is actually really cool. Its one of my favorite things in biology. Vaccines don't lock up the spike proteins. Special proteins called Antibodies do. What the vaccine does is train the body to make the antibodies without actually exposing you to the virus itself.</p>
<p>When your body sees a new thing like a virus it says, hey get that out of me, the vaccine is just doing that with part of a virus not the whole thing.</p>

        <p>That's a non answer. Don't condescend to us if you want to do this. I'll revise op's question, if there are more spike protines than antibody's at any point after inoculation during the process of immunization, can the spike protines adhere to the ace2 receptors? Bonus question: for mRNA vaccines, what stops the mRNA host cells from making spike protines after the immune system has sufficient antibody count?</p>

        <p>To answer your question about mRNA. The vaccines do not actually have much RNA in them and your body cant make more of it. mRNA needs to be made from DNA and the pfizer and Moderna vaccines dont contain any DNA.</p>
<p>RNA gets broken down quickly in your cells, DNA is more stable. </p>
<p>Naturally your body reads the DNA of your chromosomes and produces mRNA then it reads that mRNA to make all sorts of proteins that make you function.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines are using that last step by giving your cells mRNA to synthesize into spike proteins. But since there is no DNA the mRNA gets broken down in a few hours.</p>

        <p>Sorry maybe i didn't understand the question. Yes absolutely. This is one of the reasons you can still get infected after you've been vaccinated. If there is too much virus your immune system gets over whelmed. </p>
<p>Even from when youre body has inbuilt defenses so that it doesn't get infected from a single germ. This is called innate immunity. </p>
<p>What vaccination does activate your adaptive immune system to raise the amount of virus your body can fight off before the virus takes hold inside you. </p>
<p>Does that help more? Let me know if you have more questions.</p>

        <p>Another non answer, we know people can still get infected after the mRNA injection. The question was can the spike protines made by the mRNA shots bind to ace2 receptors in the body and what eventually stops our mRNA host cells from making spike protines after the shots.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the answer! Like the other poster said, it didn't quite get at the question I had. The covid vaccine is supposed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay at the injection site</li>
<li>Anchor the spikes to the cells expressing them</li>
<li>Render the vaccine generated spike proteins inert and unable to bind to receptors. </li>
</ol>
<p>It demonstrably failed at the first 2 and seems to be failing at the third but nobody has explicitly confirmed that. Is there any knowledge you have about that aspect specifically?</p>

        <p>I don't know about the first 2 very much so please link me some info about them. I've heard it said on this sub that the engineered spike protein breaks off but I haven't had a chance to go and read about it properly.</p>
<p>I actually don't see why this would be a problem, you want your body to attack the spike protein, it doesn't really matter where it is, the body will find and attack it. Could you link me any info on this? </p>
<p>Even if the vaccine made spike proteins bound to ACE2 receptors somewhere there's no virus attached to them, the spike proteins can't replicate by themselves. </p>
<p>The last point is really cool. Your body has these specialised cells called naive B cells <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell</a> which sit around with all these different types of randomly generated antibodies at their surface. When one of these antibodies binds to something the cells starts to produce more of that specific antibody to attach to the thing it bound to. In our case it will make antibodies to bind to the spike protein. It's like an inbuilt drug discovery factory it's really amazing.</p>

<p>Follow up question! Do you have strong opinions on the covid vax being called a vaccine if it only gums up one aspect of the virus but doesn't address the actual virus or immunize the recipient?</p>

<p>Viruses are pretty simple organisms so if you gum up one aspect of it the whole thing dies. Like if you stop any of your major organs working you'll die, but at the molecular level.</p>

<p>So reading this you can see that they've actually used a really really really high dose of the RNA compared to what they use in the vaccine they administer to humans. This looks like a toxicity study, which is something done pretty commonly in animal models where you give a model organism (in this case a rat) a much higher dose than you plan to give to humans and see what happens. Likely this was one of many studies they did. Pretty interesting, probably was done as part of the regulatory approval process.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can see that in the human trials they used doses in the micrograms, 30 to 100 micrograms for a whole human. Translates to much less than the 1mg/kg they used in the rat study. </p>
<p>human trials <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4</a></p>
<p>The marketted vaccine contains 1 30 microgram dose. Like any drug the vaccines have safe levels of administration, you wouldn't swallow a whole bottle of asprin. 30 micrograms seems to be the safe and effective dose levels. There are reports of people getting 4x the recommended doses with no side effects. </p>
<p>Someone else shared some articles about liver damage so I'll go read those now.</p>
<p>Happy to think through more questions.</p>

        <p>I actually dont understand what they mean here so you'll have to link me more information about this specific case.</p>
<p>Generally isolating a germ, in this case the coronavirus means growing it outside the body in a purer form to study it. In this pandemic it was first done in wuhan but we've since done it many times and even been able to synthesize it from scratch which was first done in Melbourne Australia.</p>
<p>Isolating a virus is a pretty technical process so its not easy for any given lab to do. Let me know if you have more questions.</p>

        <p>Can you try and explain why we shouldn’t be afraid of antibody dependent enhancement or liver failure? After looking into the storied history of rna vaccine failure it’s hard to trust this new experiment. Here’s some of what I’m talking about. None of the “trust the science” types seem to be able to dispel ade. All they say is we have no evidence of ade yet.</p>

        <p>OK i see where this is coming from now. These liver damage concerns came from a toxicity study, and a few other places which gave very very high doses of the vaccine to rats which had liver damage. These were extremely high doses compared to what is administered in the vaccine. they gave 1milligram per kilogram of body weight to the rat. By comparison the pfizer vaccine given to humans contains 30 micrograms of RNA. You would need to take 2333 doses of the vaccine to get to the same toxicity levels. So as long as you don't go chug a city's worth of vaccines you don't need to worry about liver damage haha. In the same way you don't need to worry about the lethal side effects from high doses of asprin so long as you don't chug the whole bottle.</p>
<p>Most of the studies you linked aren't too relevant and mostly relate to experimental candidates of the original SARS virus but I'm happy to go through them if you like.</p>

        <p>Yeah, id say they are relevant because they showed why all these other rna vaccines failed. Its not like they tested for this in the clinical trial. There is no real reason to believe the ade problem is fixed without evidence. They didn’t even study carcinogenicity how are we supposed to believe it’s safe.</p>

        <p>As a working scientist I can tell you from experience there are reasons things fail all the time due to a lack of funding. For the first time this century we were given a blank check to buy whatever we needed to and employ the best talent to get this done and save lives. It was hard work and I am forever in awe of my fellow scientists. I can't tell you how depressing it is seeing the best talent of the field constantly leaving because governments keep cutting research budgets. There were several candidates for SARS vaccines but they were ended due to funding cuts. <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-were-so-close-three-potential-covid-19-vaccines-had-funding-cut-20200407-p54hw9.html">https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-were-so-close-three-potential-covid-19-vaccines-had-funding-cut-20200407-p54hw9.html</a></p>
<p>Ok i'll go through these studies you linked.<br>
<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/cvi.00609-15">https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/cvi.00609-15</a> This is for a different virus, not SARS-COV2. This mentions a failed vaccine candidate which experience the awful, but understood phenomenon where a vaccine actually causes infection to progress faster. This happened in infants where immunisation is very difficult because their immune systems are not developed. If such a problem had occured with the current generation covid vaccines you would have seen deaths in vaccinated people occur at a higher rate than unvaccinated people. Instead you see the opposite where unvaccinated people are much safer. </p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</a> This is for SARS-COV1 vaccine candidates that raises concerns about issues in the pre clinical stage in animal models for certain vaccine types. Note they don't test mRNA vaccines. They reference the work above. They (rightly) urge caution in moving to human trials but again such issues would have been picked up in the large scale stage 3 trials and certainly now that billions of doses have been administered. If you look at the end of the study they conclude exposure with the S protein is a safer approach. Seems like good research. Was a very interesting read thanks for that.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11408775/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11408775/</a> I don't really feel qualified to comment on this. It doesn't seem relevant to SARS-COV2 except they find certain white blood cells in infected or stressed lungs. Tell me if I missed something.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15569476/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15569476/</a> This seems like a succesful pre clinical study for a SARS-COV1 candidate vaccine in animal models. Interesting that it concluded that an innactivated virus vaccine which was different to the 2nd study you linked. (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</a>) Likely more work was done and the candidate failed in a later stage or it lost funding. Would be possible to check. This doesn't really indicate any concern to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC525089/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC525089/</a>  Here is the full study for the penultimate article you linked. They found that a specific type of vaccine, not an mRNA vaccine or any other type of vaccine I know of that is approved for SARS-COV2 caused liver damage in an animal model. Again, I don't really feel like this causes concern as the current generation vaccines have passed much more stringent tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23/51">https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23/51</a> This study seems well researched but the conclusions they draw are not valid. For example their point that many people have antibodies which attach to components of the mRNA vaccines and thus the vaccines will not be therapeutically effective is not valid. These vaccines would not have passed clinical trials if they were innactivated upon entry to the body. They also bring up antibody dependent enhancement which I have mentioned earlier, if it were occuring in vaccines administered to humans we would have seen it by now in the population. This is why we do clinical trials. They also mention some very poor in silico modelling, which is my area of expertise. These methods are not accurate enough to draw the conclusions they do in the paper.</p>
<p>Essentially all of these studies raise issues that have already been resolved in clinical trials. If these concerns were true you would have seen more people die of covid who had the vaccine than the unvaccinated, instead the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Put it this way. We have been able to collect enough statistics to find adverse events that have a 1 in 1 million chance of occuring. So any further adverse effects have to be less likely than 1 in 1 million. These are very good odds by any stretch.</p>
<p>carcinogenicity, you're essentially asking to prove a negative but it is something they test for. </p>
<p>As part of the toxicity screening they will give an animal a dose of the vaccine and observe them over very long periods of time and observe for all sorts of things. This will be done concurrently to other studies, varying the dose and interval between doses. I can try and find the specific studies for these vaccines that did this if you like.</p>
<p>I had a simple blood transfusion months ago in the control group for a clinical trial and I have to go in in 6 months for a check up. The vaccines would not have been granted regulatory approval if they had produced tumors in animals or humans.</p>
<p>These were interesting reads I'd be happy to answer more questions.</p>

        <p>But these "vaccines" aren't training to target a virus, but only the s-protein, which is why the inevitable variants are able to evade them so easily. Was there something more substantial or inherent to the virus they could have targeted?</p>

        <p>Some viruses mutate faster than others. We're still learning about how quickly covid mutates, from what I understand it's not as fast as the flu for example. Given the amount of scientific funding for fixing the problem I'm hopeful we'll find a technique that works. I can find some links about this if you want. I've been meaning to learn about it it's pretty interesting. If we get a vaccine good enough against enough variants then we can probably very effectively control the spread. There are some very interesting techniques they're working on to make a single vaccine protect against many variants. The mRNA vaccines and a few other candidates are also very easy to tweak to protect against a specific variant. Let me know if you have more questions! I'm tryna get to everyone but I actually find this question really interesting so I might come back later.</p>

        <p>I think given the amount of interest in the problem we will be able to very effectively control the spread of coronavirus with a combination of vaccinations, medical therapy and public health measures. They are working on more vaccines with very interesting techniques to protect against multiple variants at the same time. I don't like these solutions but the alternative is people get very sick and I don't really see that as an option. Let me know if you have more questions.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of interest in the last 20 years in drug repurposing, and if it worked then it would be cheaper and people would use that drug instead. A far more effective method of treatment has been found to be making drugs that are fit for purpose. Part of my research has been on drug development.</p>

        <p>Interesting question. You'll know that the more the virus spreads the more it mutates. By the nature of evolution you will see that the types of viruses that spread are those resistant to specific vaccines but this spread will always be lower because when it mutates to avoid a vaccine the virus actually might have to make a trade off to not function as well.</p>
<p>Note that we saw the rise of the delta variant without any vaccinations. </p>
<p>The best defence against variants is to suppress the spread of the virus to stop it mutating as much as possible. The best way we have to do this at the moment is through vaccines. </p>
<p>Let me know if you have more questions!</p>

        <p>Personally I think it more likely came from an animal reservoir. The Wuhan Institute of virology was specifically set up because bats in the area are carriers of various sorts of coronavirus.</p>

        <p>A weapons lab and gain of function research are different things. Yes I still think it's more likely that it came from a natural reservoir. I haven't seen evidence of gain of function research with live bats, only a study rand paul showed fauci which was in vitro, not with live animals if i remember correctly. Do you have a link to another one?</p>

        <p>From what i can tell these concerns mostly stemmed from a misreading of a toxicity study they did in rats where they gave them the equivalent of 2000 doses and it caused some damage to the rats liver and ovaries. I don't know of any evidence to suggest the 30 microgram doses given to humans would have the same level of toxicity. Many drugs become toxic at very high doses. you wouldn't eat a whole bottle of aspirin to overcome a headache. </p>
<p>Do you know of any other evidence to suggest the mRNA cause infertility that i didnt mention?</p>

        <p>I had a quick read about this. The concern seems to stem from the similarities between the amino acid sequence of the syncytin-1 protein and the spike protein. I ran a simple BLAST alignment to check the similarity between the sequences. The similarity is less than 7%.</p>
<p>https://www.uniprot.org/align/A20210808A084FC58F6BBA219896F365D15F2EB4400461FX.aln</p>
<p>I model protein structures for a living 7% is completely unremarkable and is probably within the bounds of statistical noise. When similarity is &rt;50% there is often a lot of similarity between the protein structures but there are usually very significant differences in function and the same antibody might not work anymore. Antibodies are extremely specific. </p>
<p>Quite likely there are other proteins in the human body which are closer in sequence to the spike protein but the human proteins still do not react to covid antibodies. Here's a study where they studied nursing and pregnant vaccinated mothers and found no syncytin-1 reactive antibodies<br>

        <p>I'll add that in my work I've found that a single amino acid change can completely destroy the ability of an  antibody to bind its target. so changing 93% of the amino acids would mean that the spike targetting antibodies can't target syncytin-1.</p>
