    <strong>Simple way to stop companies and universities from mandating vaccines.</strong>
    <p><p>Make them liable for any deaths or severe complications due to vaccines. As it stands now, they can order you to take a vaccine on threat of termination. If you should die or get severely ill due to the vaccine, they are protected from any lawsuits. Since they consider vaccines to be so safe, they should have no problem with accepting liability. They need to step up and put their cock on the block.</p></p>

        <p>If you can demonstrate that the mandated vaccine has cause illness or injury, you can then make a claim against their workers compensation insurance. While not the same as a suit seeking a large payout it’s most likely significantly greater than anything you could hope to receive from the federal government.</p>
<p>I agree with your premise though, if they could be held liable, they would be less inclined to mandate it.</p>

        <p>Honestly, fighting the current that we are now in seems useless to me.  I agree with your point but do not think it is remotely possible for anyone to take liability.  </p>
<p>The manufacturers have ZERO liability.  The govt, at both federal and most state levels, is pushing and supporting mandated vaccinations of federal and state workers as well as by private companies via their statements and more so - their providing of vaccine passport platforms for use by non state industry.  </p>
<p>That ship is NOT going to turn around.  I don't like it but that's the case.  </p>
<p>Plan for the future (near and far) - don't live in the moment bc the tide is heavy and going one way only.</p>

        <p>No, because the cdc is actually producing patenting and profiting from their own vaccines. They are all in each other pockets. That’s what our government has become. Therefore, it is not our government anymore.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you should die or get severely ill due to the vaccine, they are protected from any lawsuits. </p>
<p>Are you sure about that? I was reading some insurance industry blogs about whether their business insurance would cover that sort of thing, and for the most part the answer was no; in other words the company bore the liability.</p>
<p>Adding: one issue about worker's comp hinged on whether the policy was necessary to conduct business and unique to the job. I'm paraphrasing. But in other words you might need certain health measures as a pilot or a commercial diver, related to your job. But vaccines might not be considered that way. I'm still a bit unclear on those implications, but I'm sure there must have been claims already so I wonder how they resolved.</p>

        <p>IANAL but I think there's going to be some interesting and hopefully successful legal approaches. The fact that one lawyer quoted by CDC-NBC says it's a health and safety issue is not particularly compelling, especially when the virus that the vaccine was designed to address is now all but extinct. </p>
<p>Rumor has it, for example, that the family of Tiffany Dover, the nurse who collapsed on live TV and who is believed to have died, was paid a large sum to stay quiet.</p>
