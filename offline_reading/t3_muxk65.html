    <strong>I stumbled across this subreddit and I’m pretty confused.</strong>
    <p><p>I know I’ll get downvoted or whatever for this, but I’ve looked through a few posts and while some are pretty fair points, others seem to encourage people putting others at risk of harm. I don’t know if there’s something I’m not getting, but I don’t really understand people’s point of view on this subreddit and why they believe what they do. Will someone explain?</p></p>

        <p>Broadly, anti-lockdown people believe, to varying degrees, the following 3 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The danger posed by the virus is overblown. Even if the number of 600k or so who died <strong>with</strong> COVID all actually died <strong>from</strong> COVID, that still isn't nearly as much as our monkey brains think that it is. That still isn't even the number of heart disease and cancer deaths in a given year. Statistically, it is a blip on the radar, because 600k sounds like a fuck ton, but in perspective of the number of Americans it actually isn't nearly as much as you think. And that's without bringing up just how sketchy the COVID death counting has been</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the vast majority of lockdown measures have, at best, negligible effect on COVID outcomes. Maybe the first couple weeks of lockdowns had some positive effect, but beyond that, it simply failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, lockdowns have massively damaging second-order effects, including loss of civil liberties, loss of development, mental health issues, and economic despression</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>This is a nice list. Add that the overwhelming majority of those 600k deaths are in the 65+ age bracket (and a lot of those in nursing homes, looking at you Cuomo and Whitmer) just makes point number 1 even stronger.</p>

<p>Like .. about 10 years ago my great-grandmother passed away from pneumonia.</p>
<p>So .. who would you say was responsible for that?  Who killed her?</p>

        <p>Your question is a bit broad, but I will attempt to answer your concerns as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>We do not encourage any one to put others at risk. However, we do encourage people, if you are sick, stay home and get better, or see a doctor. </p>
<p>Secondly, we are against governments assuming powers that were never given them, or exceeding their granted authority with the excuse of "public policy" or "public safety." It is widely known that when governments exceed their granted authority by the people, they rarely ever rescind it. Just look at NY, NJ, CA, MI, or PA as examples. You will notice, too, that States with stricter measures are worse off in terms of alleged COVID-19 cases versus States with little to no measures. You need to ask yourself, why is that?</p>
<p>The more you look into this "pandemic" the more questions arise. For example, why are hospitals using a test, the rt-PCR test, that does not test for infectious disease? Even the inventor, Kary Mullis, said, this test should not be used in diagnosing infectious disease! So it begs the question, why are they using a tool that isn't designed for disease diagnosis?</p>
<p>When I first started digging about this, I had similar view, but once you start digging, you will see there are a lot of questions the media or the "experts" can not answer.</p>
