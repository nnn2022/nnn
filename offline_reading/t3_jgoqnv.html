    <strong>Looking for advice on saner places to move to</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a EU country where there is no public debate of any kind on the covid status quo. I am unemployed and starting to look for jobs. (I know, perfect timing!) I am now actively looking to move elsewhere in Europe or the wider world for a bit of much-needed sanity.</p>
<p>As so many here, I am fed up with the intolerable lockdowns, the mind-numbing covid obsession, the climate of fear, and the dystopian masks. For me, the truly abhorrent part is that basic aspects of ordinary life are being arbitrarily dictated without consent and we are being forced to self-destroy as individuals and as communities. This has set a frankly terrifying precedent and bodes ill for the future.</p>
<p>I don't want to wait around hoping for a return to sanity. I have a history of severe anxiety and have learned that agency and resourcefulness (as opposed to helplessness and passivity) are crucial for well-being in general and mental health in particular. For the sake of my health and sanity, I wish to take matters into my own hands instead of leaving it to hope and chance.</p>
<p>So I humbly come to you asking for advice: Where in the world should I move to and look for work? A promising place that has mostly kept its sanity (effectively if not politically) and displays structural resistance to this contagious madness. I would love to hear your suggestions, your experience, and your personal accounts. Please don't hold back. General advice is also welcome.</p>
<p>I guess Sweden might be the obvious choice but I would also like to hear from you about other places in Europe and elsewhere. I must admit much of Europe has lost a great deal of its shine given its inept, irresponsible, reckless, and disproportionate reaction to this otherwise minor crisis.</p>
<p>(Note: This is a throwaway account.)</p></p>

        <p>I can only comment on the USA.....I'm not sure that helps you but.....</p>
<p>The best place I've found is the intermountain west in a "conservative" state.  I found Utah and Idaho to have a much calmer attitude when there this summer.   Places like Arizona  (which is trending liberal) and Colorado would not be a good idea.</p>
<p>The absolute best place (as good as possible) for me would be Salt Lake City Utah.  A conservative state with a conservative government and has very good job opportunities.</p>

        <p>I agree with this. Utah, has been relatively chill through all of this, and it has one of the strongest job markets in the the country at this point.</p>

Sweden would be first choice based on being able to move there and meet people and some type of a normal life. Avoid the UK.</p>

        <p>Is it that bad restriction-wise in Portugal? I'm sorry to hear that, haven't yet got the chance to visit your beautiful country, but I'd absolutely love to, only heard positive things! Here in Austria unfortunately they're tightening up on the restrictions and especially in Vienna it's becoming more and more dystopian, although we're lightyears away from the situation in France for example. 
I live in an immigrant district where the regulations are not so enforced, I often go grocery shopping without a mask and no one says anything, same counts for the gyms. And in the countryside people are more chill as well and still gather and people are questioning the narrative more (at least that's what I observe).
But tbh if things continue to worsen, I'm also considering a temporary move to Sweden.</p>

        <p>It was getting better but they are once again tightening restrictions, especially mask-wise and rule-of-six type things. I have no idea how it compares with Austria in terms of restrictions, but the official covid death toll has been only slightly higher than Austria, i.e. minimal and not abnormal. It's all about "cases" now...</p>
<p>It is certainly not as bad in Portugal for now as it is elsewhere in Europe but the level of covid obsession and mindless compliance here is really unsettling. Even in some very small towns, I always get asked to put my mask on when I go grocery shopping. People seem to just accept the narrative and the only objections that one ever hears, very rarely, seem to come just from a super-tiny fringe party nobody listens to.</p>
<p>Someone else wrote this recently and it seems fairly accurate: https://lockdownsceptics.org/2020/10/15/latest-news-163/#postcard-from-portugal</p>
<p>In the UK, they speak of "saving Christmas", here it's "rethink Christmas". What the hell?!</p>

        <p>Wow, just reading this article already was depressing. I'm sorry so many people in Portugal are complying uncritically to all these rules, even in the countryside, and a second lockdown is already in the making. And rethinking Christmas... Gfto with that dehumanising bs !!
 Here in Austria we're definitely not there yet. I've talked to colleagues from Turkey today, they visited in the summer where basically everything was open and no one cared, and now the situation got way more restrictive, and you have to wear a mask anywhere and weddings are only allowed to take an hour etc.
Too bad, I thought they were not giving in to this, was planning to escape to Izmir for a bit :( I'm also running out of ideas where to leave to...</p>

<p>Can you please elaborate? The other US-centric comments in this thread omit Arizona. And one of the comments even says explicitly that Arizona would not be a good idea.</p>

        <p>Netherlands was doing good and resisting pretty decently until a month or so ago. Then everyone panicked and the government suddenly started putting all sorts of restrictions. So i dont recommend my own country anymore sadly.</p>

        <p>Well if you look to move out of the EU to the states, personally I would recommend rural Nebraska or South Dakota. South Dakota has not shut down at all and they have a wonderful governor who has respected the right of the people who elected her. I live in rural Nebraska and life is essentially going on as normal. No mask mandates here just normal people and there's many job opportunities out here as well</p>

        <p>Olá! I can relate so much. I'm taking a break from Uni this year and I'm seriously considering moving abroad in November. I'm so fed up with Costa, Temido etc! I've been looking at Sweden mainly, because it's still in the EU and I want to be able to do simple things like shopping and using public transport without a mask + I could really use the novelty of being in a new and saner country. DM me if you want :)</p>
