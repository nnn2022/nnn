    <strong>More Harm than Good</strong>
    <p><p>Depression and domestic abuse cases are at all time highs. We increased national debt by trillions. The U.S. dollar has also drastically inflated losing its value. Political division is at all time highs. I’ve seen more riots during the lockdown than I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Our government shifted to become comfortably more authoritarian. Thousands of small businesses closed while rich mega corporations managed to profit from bailouts and also the loss of competition. </p>
<p>Those ruling over us who placed these mandates and pushed the lies and propaganda for over a year will say they did this for our safety, for a disease with a 99.98% survival rate.</p></p>
