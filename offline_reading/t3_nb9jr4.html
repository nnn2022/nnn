    <strong>Death, but not COVID. Personal.</strong>
    <p><p>I think this belongs here so I will share, as he was a member of this subreddit. </p>
<p>In a perfect world, he’d be alive, doing what he loved most - bartending and serving people. He was carefree, insanely smart, and knew this was all bs from the beginning. He was slightly neurotic - he read relevant books (I will list them here for those interested), traced back, made connections, researched and posted about it for others to see. His own friends thought he was crazy, but I knew he was onto something. The coincidences were too crazy (The great reset, Huxley, Schwab, agenda 2030 - it all made sense). He dug even deeper. Eventually, our families started seeing it. Eventually the world caught on -  something wasn’t right. We are being lied to. </p>
<p>He was offered a bartending job but they told him he had to maintain 6 feet of distance at all times, never touching anything (surfaces, people, things) and immediately sanitizing everything. Not speaking to people unless necessary (in a hospitality business this is impossible!!). Of course the mask thing too. This “list” of the job requirements was about 2 pages long. Long story short, he didn’t want to partake in that and politely declined the job offer. When asked why, he explained that he does not agree with the “orders” and thinks they’ll be damaging to the morale of the team, the customers, and environment/context of this job. He stuck by his principles. He loved this job (he did it once before and was invited back) but didn’t want to put up with the bs. </p>
<p>Anyways, COVID lockdowns have destroyed many lives, including our bright future. He’d be doing what he loves right now and everything would be different and he’d still be alive. He got a different, dangerous job, which was the cause of his death. He didn’t die of COVID but he died during this craziness which makes me blame the fucks responsible for this “new-normal-lock-down-forever-wear-a-mask-save-grandma!!” bs. </p>
<p>He was 23. He was my husband and soulmate and had his whole life ahead of him and now he’s gone. Did anyone care for his life or suffering? Or is it still about saving a life of a hypothetical “grandma”!? I hope, like everyone here, the world goes back to normal soon because I will lose my damn mind without him. </p>
<p>The only thing that keeps me sane is this subreddit. He told me to join it a few weeks before he passed and I did and you guys have kept me going. Thank you for reading this far and God bless.</p></p>

        <p>First, I want to commend you for your bravery for speaking out about your loss.  23 is really way too young for the world not to be able to enjoy what he had to offer.  It especially hits hard as someone who worked in the service/hospitality industry in a brain-washed city and had a manager who also tried to also “re-train” me despite me having worked for more than year than them (which led to me quitting on the spot).</p>
<p>Outside of some of the bots and the doomers, I think there’s a running theme of the mental and emotional damage that this lockdown has caused in this sub.  Sometimes I have to take breaks because it gets too much and I get sad and angry that no one is doing anything about it or even acknowledging it because of the “hypothetical grandma” you mentioned.  And for sure, it’s the people who can work from home or are dependents who are mostly preaching it because they’re so out of touch with the fact that people need to work to feed themselves (and their families).</p>
<p>In my neighborhood, tons of bars, restaurants, gyms, and small businesses have closed down.  What happens to the people who worked there?   Probably taking up jobs at the local Amazon warehouse.  </p>
<p>Funnily enough, a few miles away there are neighborhoods where people are less paranoid.  Bars have indoor seating, people are out playing volleyball, running, and are just overall happier.  There are pockets of sanity and in a way, hope, out there if you could find them. </p>
<p>I’m not sure if what I offered is comforting or of any worth at all but if it’s not, that’s okay too.</p>

        <p>Thank you for responding, in any case. We’re all an odd bunch here and I’m so happy to listen to opinions of people who are like minded considering I’m in a brain washed city as yourself. I agree that these people who work from home and never want it to end - they’re the selfish ones. They’re the ones that work from the comfort of their homes, not realizing people are risking their lives out there so they live comfortably. It sucks that these people might never even consider that they’re wrong. There’s some hope that businesses in neighboring towns/cities will do well and the tyrant cities will be forced to follow. Sorry, my mind is all over the place but I thank you for your input!</p>

        <p>I am deeply sorry for your loss. This is tragic and heartbreaking. Rest assured that no matter what the history books say or headlines read, he was on the right side of history. Everyone not brainwashed knows the lockdown and approach to the pandemic was a mistake. The things I saw (police brutality, mask shaming, ect)on this sub are horrifying and it will scar me for life. I will not come out of this the same man for I have seen the worst in humanity.</p>

        <p>I am sorry your husband was of the opposite side of the covid death spectrum. I would call it a covid death, even if he didn't die from covid. These are ALSO preventable deaths many seem to forget about. This broke my heart to read, especially because you're so young.. I hope you find solace in your memories. ❤️</p>
