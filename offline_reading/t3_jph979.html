    <strong>In a world on fire with information and disinformation, how can we determine the truth?</strong>
    <p><p>I wanted to write this post to get opinions from members, so I can evaluate for myself to determine what is true and what is false through reason and research.  I think it is very hard to determine what is true and what is false these days.  I much like many others, don't know who to trust.  So for those reading through this post to try and learn what is actually going on, remember to take the comments that follow with an open mind but also a grain of salt.  Assume you know nothing and go from there.  If a comment doesn't match what you think is going on, evaluate why!</p>
<p>Here are my two questions:</p>
<p>But first some context.  If the CIA are the ultimate propoganda machine, they must have the ability to topple a regime if it is absolutely neccessary for the national security of the USA?  After watching the video with Glenn Greenwald on Fox News w/ Tucker Carlson, Greenwald states that the CIA and other interests are censoring and controlling information, that their powers have turned on the American people.  Now really what we have to determine is if they are doing this for our own good or for another agenda, i.e. the New World Order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is the CIA using COVID to make it easier to bend the rules of election, to allow mail in ballots, to rig the election in favor of Joe Biden?  It seems to me that they don't want Trump to win.  It's obvious if you look at the information war that's going on right now.  Preferring Joe Biden has gone mainstream, anything hurting his chances has been censored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the FBI sit on the Hunter Biden story?  Was it to not interfere with the Dia's candidate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does this all tie into the NWO?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Rules:</p>
<p>There's no actual rules you have to follow, but it would be nice if you include a source, and a description of why you think the source is not spreading disinformation.</p>
<p>Let's get down to the bottom of this shall we?</p>

        <p>As for #2, there are many theories and possible reasons why the FBI/DOJ may not have releases the Hunter Hard Drive information.</p>
<p>1)  When actively investigating money laundering as well as many crimes, there are others involved.  Not divulging the investigation allows for better chances of gathering data before the others can destroy it.</p>
<p>2)  Unlike 2016, they didn't want the "interfering with the election" story line again.</p>
<p>3) More nefarious would be the connections between Director Wray and Bill Barr to Hunter's business dealings.  Wray and Barr both were working for law firms prior to taking their current positions.  Wray's firm represented the Russians in the deal where the China Energy firm purchased a 14% stake.  Hunter represented the China Energy firm.  Barr's firm represented the Brokerage firm that put the deal together.</p>
<p>Those are just the reasons off the top of my head.</p>

        <p>Once something gets censored I pretty much believe it. However, Reallygraceful on Youtube puts out awesome work and she is surprisingly not taken down yet. She is great because she talks kind of calm and in a way that could be more digestable for folks who have a hard time not wanting to disrupt their reality.  Her videos are always fully sourced and seem to check out from what I can tell.</p>

        <p>Game theory and Occam's razor. </p>
<p>Ask yourself what the parties involved have to gain from the actions they've taken and things they've said. Think through both positions. Assume everyone is acting within their best interests to the best of their ability. </p>
<p>Secondly, assess which conclusion is simplest. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&rt; After watching the video with Glenn Greenwald on Fox News w/ Tucker Carlson, Greenwald states that the CIA and other interests are censoring and controlling information, that their powers have turned on the American people. Now really what we have to determine is if they are doing this for our own good or for another agenda, i.e. the New World Order. </p>
<p>Which is simpler? That an attorney-turned-blogger has the sole inside scoop on the most powerful clandestine intelligence agency's grand conspiracy to assert a New World Order? </p>
<p>Or that Greenwald &amp; Fox benefit financially from whipping you into a panic about clandestine conspiracies, since you'll keep watching &amp; reading their content? </p>
<p>&rt; Is the CIA using COVID to make it easier to bend the rules of election, to allow mail in ballots, to rig the election in favor of Joe Biden? It seems to me that they don't want Trump to win. It's obvious if you look at the information war that's going on right now. Preferring Joe Biden has gone mainstream, anything hurting his chances has been censored. </p>
<p>Which is simpler? A paramilitary organization is engaged in a multilateral conspiracy to "rig" 50 separate electoral processes that involve thousands of volunteers and employees in vague, indefinable ways such that the overall vote counts land just enough in favor of a milquetoast former V.P.'s campaign while failing to swing control of the Senate to that same party? </p>
<p>Or that because of the real risks of spending time in public, more Americans chose to use mail-in ballots, which have existed in their current form unchanged for decades? </p>
<p>&rt; Why did the FBI sit on the Hunter Biden story? Was it to not interfere with the Dia's candidate? </p>
<p>How does the FBI "sit" on a story? Are they a news organization?</p>
