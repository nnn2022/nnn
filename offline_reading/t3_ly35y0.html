    <strong>Got rejected from a job because I had the audacity to say that masks were uncomfortable</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys. So, I’m still reeling from this experience that I just had. I use care.com pretty frequently to find nanny jobs. Over the past week, this woman reached out to me several times as she was interested in hiring me to look after two children, who are six and eight. The job would be part time- 9-5 three days a week. For context, the parents both work from home and their children do remote learning, so I’d be working in their home exclusively. Our communication had been going really well and she seemed desperate for childcare.</p>
<p>Here’s where everything soured. We set up a phone call where we discussed my hourly rate, what my job responsibilities would be, etc. She hired me on the spot and told me she was looking forward for me to start next week. After we got off the phone, she texted me “Hi! I forgot to ask you about this on the phone, but would you be okay with wearing a mask in the home?” I replied “I’m totally okay with wearing a mask in public spaces and when otherwise required, but to be completely honest, it’d be pretty uncomfortable to wear one for eight hours straight. I’ve been social distancing pretty heavily the past couple of months, and the only people I come in regular contact with all work from home so my exposure to covid is low. However, if you feel uncomfortable with me not wearing a mask, I’m sure we can work something out.” </p>
<p>I felt nervous after I sent her that text, but I assumed everything would go well as it was a fairly diplomatic and polite response (or so I thought). After about twenty minutes, she texts back “thank you for taking the time to talk to me today but we’ve decided to move in another direction for childcare.” So, to make a long story short, I didn’t get the job. Honestly, the most annoying part is the fact that I didn’t even outright say I wouldn’t wear a mask, I said I’d be willing to work with her. This is what really gets me about the groupthink that covid has brought out in people-if you express ANY amount of dissenting thought to a certain individual/group, they write you off immediately.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes me laugh is the fact that I’d be in extremely close proximity with her children for 24 hours a week, but somehow wearing a mask would totally mitigate covid exposure! Never mind the fact that I’d be touching surfaces in their home and interacting with them and their children heavily. Also, I really doubt that their family would wear a mask the entire time that I’d be there. I’m just bummed I didn’t get the job because I really could’ve used the money. If you’ve made it this far, thanks so much for reading, I just wanted to vent.</p></p>
