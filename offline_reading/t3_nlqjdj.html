    <strong>Admitting defeat</strong>
    <p><p>Fuck everything about how COVID has been twisted into something it isn't. I contracted it in December and it almost ruined my Christmas, my sense of smell is still not normal today. I survived like 99.xxxx% of others and hate what the governments of the world have done to is. </p>
<p>All the measures in place are means of control because a good crisis should never go to waste. </p>
<p>My workplace changed a few things last week and I will have to wear a mask if not vaccinated. I could lie about this but I would be in violation of our integrity policy which was signed when hired. I have a job I love and I know I will grow in this company. I'm afraid higher leadership will me wearing a mask still and assume things. I am not anti vaccine, just this emergency use, no liability bullshit. </p>
<p>I have a trip coming up to meet my girlfriend's family for the first time ever and was set on just getting a negative test before going. I scheduled a vaccine appointment today and I couldn't be more disappointed with myself. I know this sub gets it. I am selling my convictions for ease, just like they want. I can't handle the stress anymore of trying to live and improve my life. I'm still in this fight and will forever know that this was about money and control, ot about me, a civilian. </p>
<p>Just need to get it off my chest and thank everyone on this sub for making me feel strong. I will not virtue signal, accept any money, or free bullshit. I will continue on as an observer of history and always remember that governments never had our interest at heart.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of subs hate this subreddit. I wish they could stop trolling us or attacking us. I worry that our sub will get nuked by the Reddit Admins for breaking some stupid rule. I'm at a point where I've contemplated on ending myself, as I don't want to live in this demonic run world anymore. But I have people to take care of, and so I don't want to leave Earth yet. Anyways, a lot of people are suffering tremendous pain (body, mind and soul), and I think this is the greatest battle over our future. We just have to say "No" to these very questionable vaccines, and see what will happen next. Thank you.</p>

        <p>It sounds like the only thing stopping you from leaving your mask at home and skipping the vax is the possibility that you'll violate the company's "ethics and integrity clause??!!" What the fuck??</p>
<p>That's your reason for getting the vax? So you don't violate some silly, unenforceable ethics clause? Did you cross your heart and hope to die? Pinky swear?</p>
<p>If you don't want the shot but reaallly want to keep your job, then DON'T get the shot and act like you did. If someone asks, say you got the shot. Easy fucking peasy.</p>
<p>It seems to me that THEY are violating all kinds of ethics and integrity by pressuring you to get injected with an experimental gene therapy shot.</p>
<p>And here's one more tip...your employer doesn't give a fuck about you. They will show you no loyalty even if you show it to them.</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>

        <p>Haven't they just announced today that those who have had covid still have antibodies longer than first thought? 
If you can prove you have had covid already, then maybe that will help you? </p>
<p>If not, there is this info here on the laws and the vaccine:</p>
<p>https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.org/legal/vaccines-the-law</p>
<p>According to that, an experimental vaccine cannot be mandated. </p>
<p>I understand if you're tired from it all and go for the vaccine anyway, but thought I'd share anyway.</p>

        <p>Yeah it has been a while since we had covid and I was happy with my all natural vaccine. I'm not mandated by anything in my life right now nor is anyone trying to say I have to get it. </p>
<p>I have worked in corporate America now for a while and soon my company will return to working at the office. What is really my breaking point is my career. I am good at my job and finally getting the recognition for it. I will grow here. With everyone returning to work in the office the policy is that you are vaccinated or wear a mask. So what's the problem? </p>
<p>The problem here is that now leaders who I meet with will see my mask. We will be singled out in our own way now at my place of work If even one person on an interview panel makes some assumption(as this sub proves everyday) it could harm my growth. The message from the company will be that this should not happen, but it will. </p>
<p>I do appreciate the share though!</p>

        <p>This just isn't right. I work in a health-care setting and plan to go to graduate school to further my credentials. And I've just felt so depressed as of late because I know that I will not go far in my field without getting the vaccine. You should never have to surrender your medical autonomy in order to live your life on your own terms. </p>
<p>I'm sorry that you felt so cornered and ultimately felt you had to concede. I am afraid that judgement day for me is coming very soon.</p>

        <p>So they say they will not ask for records but if I knowingly say I got the vaccine and don't wear my mask, I am in violation of our ethics and integrity clause. This was signed when I first joined the company.</p>
<p>Full transparency,  I'm going to plenty of places without masks knowing I'm not vaccinated that recommend you be maskless only if vaccinated. That is because I do not believe masks to be effective like controlling governments say. Fear is motivation. If this were my younger years, I would not care what my company said, I'd lie, but I plan to retire with this company and won't risk it.</p>

        <p>Honestly you made the right decision, many on this sub are idiots who deny science. The vaccine is safe and effective, be happy that you now won't get this disease and you can move on with your life. BTW I am pro vaccine but anti mask and restrictions, the two are mutually exclusive you can be pro vaccine but think all the other pandemic crap is bullshit. Again don't listen to these people they are the opposite of the masks and lockdown forever people</p>

        <p>So I'm torn on your comment. I already had COVID last December. I agree thay there is science behind vaccines but also the recovery rate from COVID is ridiculously high. </p>
<p>I don't get flu shots today and have not in two decades. I don't see a need for me to get this vaccine, that's the problem, I now feel I have to get it. </p>
<p>I understand I could say no and possibly lose my job and really upset my SO. I don't want to lie to my employer and now those who wear masks at my place of work going forward could be labeled as "Idiots who deny science." You just proved how quick someone might be to rush to judgement. </p>
<p>I appreciate the candor and again agree with you on the merit of the vaccine. This sub is important however, I felt very alone until finding a few people in my life that share my views, including this sub. So much of this is about money and passing legislation with hidden crap in it. I will not forget freedom fries and the Patriot Act. This needs to end, and others who don't want a shot shouldn't have to feel like I do.</p>

        <p>I mean I agree I don't think the shot should be forced (especially not by the government) but at the same many of the people on this sub are complete idiots. They should have the right to voice their dumb opinions but they are still dumb and need to be called out on it. I mean I too normally skip the flu shot because they are completely useless for me (I'm 24, I'm not dying of the flu so getting a shot will only help if it prevents illness and the flu shot doesn't) I got the COVID shot because of it's high efficiency figures and will happily continue to get boosters if they keep that efficiency up. Also finally I agree it's complete bullshit we don't acknowledge immunity from infection, it clearly exists and while it shouldn't be promoted as the way to get immunity it should be acknowledged for the people who have it.</p>

        <p>There are no long term clinical trials on the co-vid vaccines.  There very well could be long term effects from the vaccine that are unknown.  That is why long term trials are done.  The individual must weigh the potential costs and benefits for themselves.  The chances someone in my age range with no comorbidities dying from Covid are close to zero so I will not get vaccinated until more long term data is available.</p>
