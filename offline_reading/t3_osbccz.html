    <p><p>Recycling the propaganda from last year since the "begging for the vaccine as they died" propaganda was flop.</p></p>

        <p>Another load of lies. Gautantee if his medical records were exposed we would see mal practice. I wouldn't doubt if he was vaccinated and they all are covering it up. Hospitals in Fla. are destroying evidence that incoming are vaccinated. This is getting to Desantis but he says it's only unvaccinated. Anyways this woman just wants to be on cnbc &amp; cnn so she can try and convince the world she's not as stupid as her son and that his death was necesaary to change the minds of the unvaccinated. Maybe the potus will have her on too so we can hear more of his hard plaque dementia breakthroughs.</p>
