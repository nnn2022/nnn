    <strong>Is anything we have been taught real?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been wondering about pathological viruses. I searched the internet for actual pictures of one but they all look computer generated. Are viruses even a real thing? It seems that all these diseases are caused by toxicity or deficiency....</p></p>

        <p>Right I've heard of some similar theories. It's frustrating that no one will listen to anything  that isn't a corporately backed "expert" source. People like us, who are simply asking questions, are genuinely concerned about the human race. I do research and analyze these things because I care. </p>
<p>But hey, check out blushield. I have one at home and I have been feeling much better!!!</p>

<p>The way people look at pathogens now is backwards; if they were all very deadly we'd all be dead, so its also a matter of how susceptable we are to certain things and why, in combination with how deadly a pathogen is.</p>

        <p>From a paper by Walls et al. about the spike protein. It first came out as a preprint in February I think, but was published April in the journal. "Cell" https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30262-2 </p>
<p>Walls had done similar work on SARS 1</p>

        <p>Yes, A and B are actual electron micrographs that use electrons to 'photograph' the virus instead of photons like a regular microscope and camera. There are some scientific images that clearly show the famous spike, which does not look dramatic like the computer-made images you see in the news, but cant find it right now. </p>
<p>D and E are different; some scientific representations are indeed what they call 'cartoons', they are drawn representations of the virus. They have various ways of representing viruses etc, some are better for showing their charge patterns, bonds, or various structures etc. to help understand its properties and how it behaves</p>

        <p>Right on, are you a scientist? All this stuff is a little much for the average guy to understand. What's your tale on the pandemic? And what's your take on the flu about disappearing since april?</p>

        <p>Sorry for the delayed response.  I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and that certainly is one of the primary problems with this, that the good information is buried in academic papers that might be difficult to understand , I wish there was a way I could help more with that. </p>
<p>No, I'm not a scientist, but I have worked for one and I have liked and read about science my whole life and I've been watching Covid since January.
There are many aspects to the 'crisis', but I'm here in NNN because I believe all of this is wrong on every level. </p>
<p>There are so many aspects of this to have a take on. It upsets when some people say it doesnt exist, the virus certainly does exist, and it is a bit different from the other coronaviruses, but the big joke is that its not at all what they are saying it is. Then they are using tactics to mitigate that were never considered before even in the worst circumstances. </p>
<p>I don't want to see real science die with this, its dying here as people just make sh*t up and claim its science. They threw out all the science that has been done over the last century, the only part of science they have kept is pychology;  the psychological tactics that they have used from the start to manipulate people are incredible and will be hard for many to resist.</p>
<p>No one should be forced to get vaccinated, and this vaccine is very different from traditional ones, and they did that because traditional vaccines dont work for coronaviruses. They also wanted to try mRNA tech for vaccines because it wasnt working for what they intended (multiple doese were needed and multiple dosing caused dangerous side effects) and were losing tons of money.</p>
<p>Flu I dont know. Theres something called viral competition that might be making it hard for flu to  be as succesful due to Covid. They have new dual disease tests for flu/Covid that might not 
work well. The probably dont even test for anything else if someone already has a Covid positive. Some places have openly got rid of "influenza like illness" (ILI) and have labeled it "Covid like illness" (CLI). All flus didnt really disappear, they're still there somewhere, just not sure what amount. </p>
<p>This needs some focus, try to get all of us on the same page at least from science/statistics standpoint even if we differ on rights/philosophy isses</p>

        <p>Wow, thanks man. I think science is heading to a place 6 feet under for a few reasons. One is that people leave all this research to the experts. The second is that media manipulates the expert's opinions. Everyday people have the ability to seek out information and use the scientific method for themselves, but would rather just watch cute puppy videos all day. Bread and circus keep the masses down, dumb, and... "entertained". Godspeed to u my friend and see you around the NNN</p>
