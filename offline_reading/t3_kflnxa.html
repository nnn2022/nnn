    <strong>Do you want to travel in the future?</strong>
    <p><p>(First posted in r-LockdownSkepticism, but removed by admin)</p>
<p>Do you think you want to travel in the future? Do you look forward to it? What is your opinion on being a tourist again? Do you miss it?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I wants to do in the future. I enjoyed tourism before the restrictions. I loved traveling abroad, visiting art museums, look at architecture, try out new food, see tourist attractions and experience something new. I liked taking photos, walking in the streets, feel free, take a break from my daily life and live luxurious for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure how traveling and tourism would be like in the future, and if it would go back to normal after the vaccine comes. I've noticed outside of lockdowns around the world, there are a lot of social distancing, security theater and restrictions everywhere. There are groups restrictions and so on. There are even security theaters on airplanes, including several hour long trips.</p>
<p>If restrictions stays in most part of the world, in airplanes, trains and so on, I think the point of traveling goes away for me personally. Tourism won't be as enjoyable if it continues being heavy restrictions. I want to go to the buffet to pick my own food, go to museum and walk freely around.</p>
<p>In the beginning when it all started I missed traveling. I've not traveled abroad since February 2020. In June/July I missed it a lot. Now, I don't miss it as much anymore. I think many countries are very similar and not very enjoyable to tourism in because of restrictions. I feel like a foreigner in a foreign place regardless of where I goes anyway and a home sickness. I probably need to feel at home at home and see the world going back to normal again before I would think of traveling again as a tourist.</p></p>

        <p>Homesick, even at home.</p>
<p>What a real description. That’s how I feel. </p>
<p>And I agree that travel has no appeal if a lot of things are restricted and you can’t even smile and interact with people. Nothing but security/safety theater and big ugly face diapers everywhere. It’s sad and creepy.</p>

        <p>I always dreamed of going to Japan when i was younger, finally saved up and made the decision to live that dream and fulfill it. I remember buying tickets in the beginning of January and getting a text about the Virus from a friend and if i was worried.  Was supposed to go in Feb 2020 but had to cancel it 1 week prior to actually doing it. At the time i thought "hell, maybe come June things will be better!" It's now December and i can't even go to another state.</p>
<p>I still plan on going next year if they open up, hadn't i went 3 weeks prior i would of had the chance. What hurts the most is, if i was able to do it earlier i would of been a whole different experience than moving forward.</p>

        <p>You sound like what happened to me and my hubs. His life long dream was to see Ireland and we got so excited that we saved up every penny and bought tickets, hotels, rental car we were all set for March 21st. March 13th they locked down the borders. One fucking week. One week. His dream was taken from him. Now who knows if it'll ever be normal enough to spend money in that country again.</p>

        <p>Same here.</p>
<p>I have two airplane tickets and a week in a hotel in Venice in the bank right now.  Got cancelled and credited, but the hotel stay is only good through Halloween next year.  I'm starting to wonder if the world will even have its collective head out of its ass by then.</p>

        <p>Ill just go to countries with the least restrictions (relatively speaking). The areas that impose ridiculous measures won’t get my money.</p>

        <p>Good points! I hope not all countries have mandatory vaccines either. Where did the "My body, my choice" go?</p>
