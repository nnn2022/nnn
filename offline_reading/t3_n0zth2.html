    <strong>MSM lies vs reality: India's "covid crisis"</strong>
    <p><p>In the last few days British bourgeois media have been brainwashing the British population on the subject of the "second wave of covid" in India. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9wer54E6Q8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9wer54E6Q8</a> The MSM reports have had all the usual attributes of "covid" horror shorts - panic, twenty doctors crawling over a patient, the sullen atmosphere, people wearing ridiculously useless facemasks on hospital beds, preventing themselves from breathing properly, and so on and so forth. To someone who is not in a state of panic and who can think clearly and logically, such things look like a circus show (which they are). That is the fantasy constructed by the MSM, but what is the reality? Here is the reality <a href="https://vk.com/work_way_com?w=wall-162034604_49123&amp;z=video193972340_456243208%2F3be5affe90a6d55b4c%2Fpl_post_-162034604_49153">https://vk.com/work_way_com?w=wall-162034604_49123&amp;z=video193972340_456243208%2F3be5affe90a6d55b4c%2Fpl_post_-162034604_49153</a> Indian people chasing away the "covid" astronauts in their full body plague gowns.</p></p>

        <p>That is a video in the begining of the pandemic, almost an year old. Certain people were found positive, they were traced back to a locality. Upon reaching the locality which is minority dominated, the medical nurses and cops were assaulted with rocks and stones, bottles filled with urine and female nurses had their clothes torn off.</p>

        <p>This is the news when Scamdemic had just begun. No one knew it's a scam. They were testing people and a few who came in contact with certain outsiders were traced to a certain locality. When FEMALE nurses and cops went to the location dominated by minority, they were beaten, urine filled bottles were thrown at them, female nurses had their clothes torn off during the assault , stones were pelted at them and the cops.</p>
<p>Again, this is when the pandemic had just begun.</p>

        <p>I can see that you're trying to appeal to emotions just like MSM. So what if they were females? If they choose to collaborate with fascists and kill people, including old people AND FEMALES, by "treating" them according to deadly covid protocols (with antimalarials, immunodepressants, blood-thinners etc.) after those people have a positive PCR test that according to its inventor Kary Mullis is not designed to diagnose anything or to find any viruses, then that's what they deserve. Although, such details as "urine filled bottles" and "tearing clothes off" sound like the typical MSM bs aimed at the audience's emotions, not rational thinking.</p>

        <p>You just saw the video of locals assaulting the medical team. The nurses and cops were assualted with stones and had urine throne at them. This became major news and the culprits were caught and charged for assualting medical official with stones and urine filled bottles. Just because it doesn't happen in your part of the world doesn't mean it can't happen somewhere else.</p>

<p>Nice try, Russian bot.</p>

        <p>First of all, do you have any evidence that it's a year old video? And second, calling someone "a bot" trying to discredit them is petty demogogy.</p>
