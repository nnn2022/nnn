    <strong>Mask rhetoric and Trump</strong>
    <p><p>Since the Trump diagnosis, the pro-mask narrative has really ramped up.  Everywhere I look I see comments about how Trump wouldn't be sick if he wore mask.  </p>
<p>What the actual fuck?  I thought that the mask was to "protect others?"  But now if Trump wore his magical mask there is no way he would have gotten the virus?</p>
<p>Also, if mask wearing is so effective, then why doesn't every state open all schools, restaurants, arenas, shopping centers, etc. at 100% capacity, provided everyone wears a mask?</p>
<p>I don't understand how anyone with a functional brain could think that a paper or cloth mask is somehow the answer to all of our woes.</p></p>

        <p>I've spent the past 2 days in a hospital and in casual conversation with every professional who we interacted with I haven't found a single one who didn't think the hysteria was completely ridiculous.  This was in the Houston Medical Center.  There is hope.</p>

        <p>I have interacted with my children's pediatrician, my OB, and my family doctor over the last few months and they all rolled their eyes at the idea of masks.  The pediatrician says that those in the office only wear the masks around patients.  Ditto for the OB.</p>

        <p>Yeah my doctor flatly stated that this is all a huge overreaction.  His office even sent out an email to all patients back in April that basically said:</p>
<p>"If you think you have coronavirus,  dont come here. We'll just send you home anyway.  Stay home and treat it like any other rhinovirus. Fluids and rest.  And as usual, always get plenty of exercise, eat healthy,  and maintain general good health and you should be fine from this and many other common contagions."</p>

        <p>No, you need to learn how numbers and statistics work instead of basing your worldview on your feelings and what the tv tells you to think.  I'm so sick of people screaming "science" and not giving a fuck about actual data.</p>
<p>I was at one of the major hospitals in the med center.  For months we've all been told that the med center was running close to capacity and people were dying right and left.  Not a single person I spoke to said that was ever the actual case.  That doesn't seem a bit odd?  If you wanted info on what was going on in a hospital who would you trust as the source?  The CNN or Fox anchor or the people at the hospital actually treating patients?</p>
<p>I mean, our media is well known for sensationalizing shit.  It's not exactly outside the realm of possibilities.</p>

        <p>There's no such thing as a final hypothesis. A hypothesis supported by well substantiated evidence becomes a theory. That theory is never final and is either revised or rejected as new evidence comes about. So there isn't such a thing as a final theory either  - even a theory supported by the strongest evidence should be open to change should further evidence support itself in the future. Sure, the theory that smoking causes cancer is supported by mountains of very strong, high level evidence. But, that theory is technically open to change should plenty of stronger evidence in the future refute that.</p>
<p>I agree with what you are saying but you're mixing up what a hypothesis is and how it becomes a theory. :)</p>

        <p>You’re right, I was thinking hypothesis and theory were synonyms. I did t articulate it well but I’m glad you got the gist.</p>
<p>And also yes, I meant the remaining theory really isn’t final like permanent, it’s just the last one standing until it is challenged by new information.</p>

        <p>I was more commenting on the fact that the numbers presented in the media don't match what people are seeing in reality.  Also, the fact that the data has been found to be wrong repeatedly along with the fact that the apocalypse we all expected never actually happened suggests that there are either shenanigans at work or plain old sensationalization.  As much as I love a good conspiracy the simplest answer is usually the most likely so I'm going with sensationalization by the media combined with the desire for real-time data which is notoriously inaccurate causing a giant feedback loop which has a lot of people in panic mode.</p>

        <p>I actually kinda agree with you there. But then you see, what people see is distorted. If you live in an area with low population density then Chances are you won’t see as much infected. But the issue is that just because I have not witnessed people dying of car accidents doesn’t mean they don’t exist. It is how the data is represented as well as the credibility of the data. Let’s say if the media exaggerates the deaths cause by covid by 20 fold. There is still 10k deaths which is still significant. My point is, covid is real and it doesn’t matter how much the media is sensationalising it for clicks, we should just assume the worst and protect ourselves right. Wear mask and stay away from sick people. The media may be sensationalising it, they may also underreport it for political gains such as votes and saying it’s “not as bad” , we will never know. Hence, no matter what the media says, protect yourselves and the others around you, by ways which have proven to be effective by science</p>

        <p>&rt;we should just assume the worst</p>
<p>That is the opposite of a calm, rational and targeted approach based on data.  That's called panic and it is destroying lives.</p>
<p>Some people do need to be protected, that's not in question.  Asking the population as a whole to sacrifice their livelihoods and starve their families is not an acceptable solution.  You target the vulnerable populations and allow the world to keep turning.  That was the correct answer here and we blew it.</p>

        <p>Of course the economy is going to suffer, but there are policies like subsidies in order to buffer the economy for a recession. But then considering the fiscal position of the US government at a deficit, it’s has proved difficult. The economy should be open to a greater extent ofc with more protocols and regulations put in place. But I think income redistribution during the pandemic is a good idea, increasing the marginal tax rate so trump pays more than $750 In taxes so to put the government in less of a difficult position is what we all want. What I said “assume the worst” is not just going batshit crazy like people assumed pro-maskers like me as. Going bloody crazy helps no one and makes the situation worse, but then again let us not act like this thing doesn’t exist. Opening the economy with strict regulations like distancing and face shields etc, coupled with increased subsidies is a good way to deal with this pandemic. It shows, look at Singapore, no matter how strict the government is, effective policies are put into place and people listen, community cases are single digit for such a densely populated area</p>

        <p>From your linked study : </p>
<p>"Our findings indicate that surgical masks can efficaciously reduce the emission of influenza virus particles into the environment in respiratory droplets, but not in aerosol"</p>
<p>So if you are wearing a mask, you can now sneeze and cough in people's faces, but makes no difference for normal breathing, talking etc</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>"Another limitation is that we did not confirm the infectivity of coronavirus or rhinovirus detected in exhaled breath"</p>

        <p>Another factor is that the efficacy of masks reducing the emission of droplets is <em>wearing them properly</em>.  If the staff at the restaurant I visited last night are any indication, most essential workers are wearing them below their nose when they can get away with it and frequently adjusting the mask (and then returning to cooking/serving food).  I don't blame them -- it's probably hell on earth to wear those things over your nose all day long -- but it just shows you how the efficacy of the mask mandate depends on a large number of links in the causal chain, not just one.</p>

        <p>“On average, viral shedding was higher in nasal swabs than in throat swabs for each of coronavirus (median 8.1 log10 virus copies per sample versus 3.9), influenza virus (6.7 versus 4.0) and rhinovirus (6.8 versus 3.3), respectively. Viral RNA was identified from respiratory droplets and aerosols for all three viruses, including 30%, 26% and 28% of respiratory droplets and 40%, 35% and 56% of aerosols collected while not wearing a face mask, from coronavirus, influenza virus and rhinovirus-infected participants, respectively” the limitation is that they did not culture the viruses but only have gathered the percentage of aerosols that contains viral RNA. If only you read the line immediately below that. The point is, the “limitation” doesn’t prove the virus is infective, but it doesn’t disprove it either.</p>
<p>Next point, masks stopping respiratory droplets and not aerosols doesn’t make it useless. From study : “We also demonstrated the efficacy of surgical masks to reduce coronavi- rus detection and viral copies in large respiratory droplets and in aerosols (Table 1b). This has important implications for control of COVID-19, suggesting that surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission.” Wearing a mask doesn’t mean you have to cough in people’s faces, but I’d rather someone wear a mask and cough than someone not wearing a mask and cough. Masks stop droplet transmission, it can’t do wonders like totally block off 100% of the viral particles but your statement does not prove that masks are useless. You see people calling me out for “only reading the first line” yet their own arguments consist of cherry picking limitations which doesn’t even disprove the efficacy of masks</p>

        <p>Read carefully, your other quote is in the paragraph below. Also, nothing is proven yet disproven is for the infectivity of the virus, not the amount of virus. The amount of virus has been measured. The thing is viruses can be deactivated so it just means that further studies have to be done on the rates of viral deactivations. But by common sense you should know that reducing the concentration of viruses will reduce the infectivity right ?</p>

        <p>I dont dispute that a mask can stop droplets, that's common sense... but when you touch it to put it on or take it down or adjust it a little or whatever reason you have to touch it, you also touch all these droplets and then you touch something else, so you're still spreading the droplets but just differently. I dont think these masks make that much of a difference to how much this thing is being spread like the government wants you to believe, the cases are still going up yet almost everyone is wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>You raise some interesting points. While there is the suggestion that masks may reduce transmission, canwe say tbat they would be effective in a real world scenario?
For example, the participants had trained researchers correcting their mask use
Does out current guidelines tally with the suggestion from the study that one would need extended contact for transmission to occur? Eg we have to wear masks in shops, where this condition is unlikely to be met, but dobt have to wear a mask in a restaurant were it is likely?
Finally, do you think the sample size and results are persuasive enough, given the above factors i have mentioned, are enough to mandate universal mask use?</p>

        <p>Ok you wanna talk about sample size right because it’s very significant in statistics, things like sample mean can be affected a lot and the sample size can greatly affect the order of magnitude of significant levels. If you want to look at the most accurate scenario where the sample size is millions, compare US to Singapore. Masks are mandated there (You can get charged without a mask in public) and community infections are single digit in a population of 5 million. Most of the infections occur due to foreign workers. Compare it with US where people cared about “personal liberty” at the expense of others’ (and their own) lives. Does millions not sound persuasive?</p>

        <p>Masks are also mandated very strictly in Spain, where infections are rising dramatically. Masks arent worn in Sweden, and we all know about their infection rate. I think it's hard to come to any conclusions looking at infection rates vs mask use in individual countries as there is no obvious pattern as yet, and it's impossible to apply any controls.</p>

        <p>I'm saying that there are no patterns. We cant just say singapore masks, no cases, masks win.
People in Sweden dont live in huts miles away from each other, Stockholm is a thriving, densely populated city.
There are thousands of multivariant factors as to why each country has a different result, regardless of the lockdown they have applied, their mask mandate etc.
To just list population densities as if that explains it all is very reductionist.</p>

        <p>What exactly do you think your Singapore/US comparison shows? </p>
<p>With retrospective studies, which you’re looking at when you compare cases in mask-mandated Singapore with the US, you can identify correlation but NEVER causation. You understand the significance of that? </p>
<p>Do you understand why retrospective - observational - studies are considered at most cause for further research to test causation? </p>
<p>Do you understand why retrospective - observational - studies are inherently subject to tremendous bias? Or why they are never as compelling evidence as an rct is?</p>
<p>&rt; Does millions not sound persuasive</p>
<p>Ah, the trusty appeal to emotion. </p>
<p>No, the number of deaths from a virus is not in any way persuasive when it comes to <em>how</em> to respond to the virus. Logic is fun.</p>

        <p>With informed decisions based on all available evidence. </p>
<p>For instance, I just responded to someone (was it you? These discussions get mixed up easily) who claimed that, out of 1,000 people who get infected with covid, 500 of them would require ventilators to survive. That person is working with objectively incorrect data (data? Can we still call it that when it is apparently just made up?). </p>
<p>You use all available evidence to understand the risks/scope of the problem. This is important, because this determines the amount of “costs” that are warranted to address the problem. If we have a virus that kills one of 1 billion people who get infected, then perhaps ZERO costs are warranted. We need this information to do cost/benefit analysis ... people like “500 ventilators” guy are making decisions based on a flawed understanding of the problem. </p>
<p>Then you similarly use all available evidence to understand the options for addressing the problem and their effectiveness. </p>
<p>One common issue here is cherry picking: people (on both sides) see one or two pieces of evidence, draw a conclusion, and that’s it. Both are wrong - to make informed conclusions, you need to look at and properly consider everything. A single data point - hell, 20 of them - proves nothing without knowledge of what other data exists. </p>
<p>Btw, if you’re not 500 ventilators guy... </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If 1,000 random people get infected, how many of them will die? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many will be hospitalized? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People with two very different understandings of a problem are unlikely to ever agree on a solution/response.</p>

        <p>Hey you’ve been pleasant to talk with. You may want to check out lockdownskepticism - it’s a bit more oriented to evidence-based discussion than this sub is. It’s also got a fair number of scientists and medical professionals. </p>
<p>As long as you are civil and stick to evidence and reasoned arguments (no “you’re all stupid murderers” nonsense), you’ll generally be able to have great discussions.</p>

        <p>Then I think you will fit <em>right</em> in at lockdownskepticism :) no one there will assume the worst of you if you give them the same courtesy (which is really so silly ... NOBODY <em>wants</em> people to die, so that isn’t the source of disagreement).</p>
<p>One note though: recently all of these subs have been swarmed by people who like to call us stupid grandma killers... so people are a little on edge lately. You may get an initial response from someone who assumes your objective is to just tell them how stupid and evil they are - if you just stay civil, you’ll find that the tone switches <strong>very</strong> quickly. If it doesn’t, please tag or message me and I will make sure you get the friendly, reasoned discussion that is usually available in that sub.</p>

        <p>As a a healthcare professional who is working in a hospital that has zero patients on the COVID unit, I can confirm that most of is think it’s a joke. Unfortunately what you’ll hear in response to this from laypersons is that we’re not “epidemiologists or infectious disease specialists,” and don’t have training in this. Which is beyond ridiculous, as both epidemiology and ID shows up on the board exam for physicians. </p>

        <p>the mask nazi's also fail to realize that demanding healthy people wear 'just a piece of cloth' to 'protect' them from something i don't have, under threat no less, is a selfish and disrespectful act in itself.</p>
<p>even if these useless face diapers were sold to protect me, i would not wear one. </p>
<p>i stay as far away as possible from people who wear one, and since that is the entire aim of the exercise (to keep us from socializing with each other), i reckon face diapers do work for that</p>
<p>the masks make it easy to see who is a brain dead follower of unlawful dictated orders from the paid agents of the lying thieving murderous state.</p>
<p>i would rather die of the covids than be a brainless member of the covid death cult.</p>

        <p>My theory is they do nothing.</p>
<p>Not because they technically "do nothing" (which a case can be made for it), but because wearing masks was mandated on a point in the timeline where the virus had already been in its "genie out of the bottle" stage.</p>
<p>That is: you could wear a mask if you wanted to, but it's not likely to do any more or any less than it's "supposed" to.  In part due to the fact that the virus had gotten everywhere already, but also general misuse makes it worthless.</p>

<p>No, but there will be restrictions. First it'll be, you don't have to wear a mask in stores if you prove you took the vaccine. Then, it'll be no air travel unless you have the vaccine. Then no school, no cities.</p>
<p>A vaccine where there is no way to study the long term effects because of the immediate world wide roll out.</p>

        <p>So, you don't have a problem with society and/or the law placing conditions on you for your participation, and you can be ostracized from society if you refuse or even question those conditions?</p>
<p>Now, think hard on this: it might be mask usage, proof of taking a vaccine, believing in a a particular god, or allegiance to a particular social movement.  </p>
<p>Because that's what I see masks leading to.</p>
<p>Slippery slope?  Perhaps, but not an unreasonable one to assess.</p>

        <p>Biden's campaign team must be up at night deciding if they should get Biden to announce that he is also positive. If he is, they could blame it on Trump. Biden wouldn't have to campaign and if they make things seem to get worse up until election, they can elicit pity votes. Then again they would also need to put the blame on Biden for getting the virus as they did with Trump.</p>

        <p>Masks are not 100% effective, but not 0% either, which allows the doomers to claim that we should <em>both</em> muzzle up <em>and</em> do the rest of their stupid covid worship rituals.</p>
<p>I'm personally against mandatory masks but fully understand scared people who want to wear them, because the lirerature supports a partial effect in limiting virus spread.</p>
<p>What I strongly object to is the idea that virus spread among the young and healthy population needs to be limited at all. Slowing down herd immunity will eventually put fragile people at risk.</p>

<p>I'm 100% for freedom of choice.  That is:, if you choose to, but your neighbor doesn't, you possess no moral authority to verbally or physically assault your neighbor for the choice you made.</p>
<p>Rather, what you have the freedom to do is clear the path.  You are perfectly free to avoid people who aren't behaving the way you want them to.</p>

        <p>I went to my primary doc in July, and she said the same thing. She said at best, masks maybe prevent 2% of infections. Unsurprisingly, she said the best ways to prevent the virus is to keep your hands washed and stay an arm length away from people. Isn’t that a concept?</p>

This woman is walking by and she peeks over at me and when she passes in front of me she turns her umbrella to the side like a shield to protect herself from me and then puts it back up when she takes 2 more steps.  When you're directly in front of me 20+ feet away you needed to shield yourself.  You take 2 steps and now you're safe from me?  I'm just standing there and this woman is terrified of me.

        <p>Here is a prime example. There must be an on/off switch in some brains that has lost its reasoning and needs to be stimulated with logic before the light bulb comes on. I think all of the commercials and ads telling us to "mask up and be a superhero" is helping to cement the notion that masks are good and not wearing one is bad are there to keep that switch flicked off. A reinforcement for those that logic switch remains off, and complete fodder for those with our switches on. </p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this for months.  If masks work so well we shouldn’t need anti-social distancing, nothing should be closed or restricted, and we should be back to normal with the exception of mask wearing.</p>
<p>Masks are not for protecting you, they are for protecting others, but only work if you wear a mask that doesn’t protect you from yourself.  It makes ZERO sense. </p>
<p>Masks don’t work and none of the restrictions have anything to do with health.  It’s about compliance and control.</p>

“I could go on about the insanities that are loose in this country, all of it tolerated just so a bunch of aggrieved weirdos who don’t fit in can feel better about themselves. They control many of our institutions, our universities, our major media outlets. They all have cushy jobs, they never seem to get fired or laid off.”</p>

<p>A) Some people are against any mandates like this whatsoever</p>
<p>B) Some people are against mandates without any kind of science to back it up - but would voluntarily wear them if the science did back it up</p>
<p>C) Some people are forced to wear them in certain states / businesses but refuse to wear them where they’re not required</p>
<p>D) Some people are deaf or autistic - basically making it very hard for them to communicate without seeing facial expressions or reading lips</p>

        <p>It’s “scapegoat” not “escape goat”:</p>
<p>https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scapegoat</p>
<p>Noun: “a person or group made to bear the blame for others or to suffer in their place.”</p>
<p>Our politicians and public health officials cannot stop a virus so they’re just pretending they can and blaming others for their very obvious failures.</p>
<p>Primary mode of transmission of the virus isn’t spittle droplets, it’s in tiny aerosols that are much, much smaller than anything you can see and they are not stopped by your crappy cloth mask. The mask literally only protects you from people spitting on you.</p>

        <p>Well no shit sherlock. I have no idea what we are even arguing about at this point. Do you think that masks are accually useless, or that they are useful but something politicis? Like dude, this sounds like anti-science bullshit. Masks obviously work and slow down the spread of the disease, And slowing down the disease prevents hospitals getting overcrowded. In Poland accually all hospitals had to have a number of beds and a percent of those had to have respirators, basically ensuring that Hospitals dont get overcrowded too easily. Right now Everyone HAS to wear a mask in Public transport and are asked to wear a mask in shops/schools. But generally Poland wasnt struck that hard thanks to good job our goverment did and good job we citizens did at following the guidelines.</p>

        <p>Not everyone uses a mask, you can get a disease through other media like contact, and there are a lot of people who dont get sintoms but who do spread the disease. If we all used disposable gloves, used a mask and respect the 1m distance thing we wouldnt suffer from viruses.</p>

        <p>Because the real number is around 6. 6 out of 1000 and those 6 people would most likely be 75-80 years old. And that is probably a high estimate.</p>
<p>I read an article where the WHO estimate 750 million worldwide have had Covid and 1 million deaths.. giving an IFR of 0.13% which would mean if 1000 got COVID your going to expect 1 or 2 deaths.</p>

        <p>That is because you are mixing all the countries together. The countries that have more infected per capita have more deaths and are less transparent with their information. Thats why I said that each country and place have different death rates. In my country its about 3%. But when there were no beds left the mortality rate rised up to 10%. See what I mean? Plus there have been cases in which a young person with no preexistent conditions died.</p>

        <p>First... you think that if 1,000 people get covid 500 of them would be sick enough require ventilators? Do you have <em>any</em> evidence for that claim? Because I think you might be using facts from a different reality... </p>
<p>Second... is “hospitals running out of ventilators” the last news you heard on the subject?</p>
<p>Did you miss the stories about how <strong>oopsie, turns 
out ventilators were actually not the right treatment after they killed tons of people by sticking them on ventilators</strong>? </p>
<p>I mean, if they put 500 of those people on ventilators, the ventilators will unnecessarily kill a bunch of them. Or is that the crux of your statement? “It depends how many of those 1000 people I get to kill.” If so, why do you want to kill people?</p>
