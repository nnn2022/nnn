    <strong>The lung microbiome is the most important unspoken factor in all of this</strong>
    <p><p>The lung microbiome, according to wikipedia,is the pulmonary microbial community consisting of a complex variety of microorganisms found in the lower respiratory tract particularly on the mucous layer and the epithelial surfaces. These microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, viruses and bacteriophages. </p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://books.google.pt/books?hl=pt-PT&amp;lr=&amp;id=VGqPDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=10.1183/2312508X.10015718&amp;ots=-XAwWjCzuW&amp;sig=vrXzs8nNrq9J9c2Gj7iPaCYWr5M&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=10.1183%2F2312508X.10015718&amp;f=false">section of the book "The Lung Microbiome"</a> (I reccomend reading the whole chapter even if you're not in this area of expertise), we should think in terms of ecological factors, namely immigration (through inspiration), elimination (through expiration and cough) and relative growth rate, with an existing balance between them.  According to the book, if there's a shift in the balance dysbiosis happens.</p>
<p>What is dysbiosis? A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dysbiosis">dysbiosis</a> can be defined as a reduction in microbial diversity and a combination of the loss of beneficial bacteria and rise of harmful bacteria. Of course, this implies many illnesses, including cancer:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304383517307607">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304383517307607</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673614611363">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673614611363</a></p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imm.13139">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imm.13139</a></p>
<p>Why am I talking about this? Because of the masks, of course. The ecological factor of elimination is seriously impaired when using them, that's the whole point of them. The immigration factor is also involved but to a lesser extent. Relative growth rate changes because temperature and humidity of the air changes as well.</p>
<p>Ask yourselves, why didn't the masks stick after the pandemic that started in 1918? Why the old presumption that only sick people wore them?</p>
<p>Anyone in this community with the means to arrange a scientific study, please consider to make one where you make an accurate assessment of the lung microbiota pre and post-extensive mask wearing. The results will be very interesting, and the world will thank you for it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: Also mentioned in the chapter "It was observed that changes in the microbiota of the oral cavity caused by oropharyngeal disease such as periodontitis also causes changes in the composition of the lung microbiome, which could lead to the development of lung diseases like COPD".</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/05/mask-mouth-is-a-seriously-stinky-side-effect-of-wearing-masks/">read this</a> and make the connection.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; a combination of the loss of beneficial bacteria and rise of harmful bacteria. </p>
<p>With facemasks you have much more than just bacteria, like all kinds of microfibers constantly released, as one breathes through the fabric. Doing so for a quick task might no be a problem but wearing it all day long, day after day, you end up with worse problems than even smoking cigarettes. </p>
<p><em>Does breathing fibers in, damage health?</em></p>
<p><em>The presence of microplastics in human lung tissue was already demonstrated in the 1990s by scientists investigating lung tissue of cancer patients, who expressed their concern that plastic fibers may contribute to the risk of lung cancer.</em></p>
<p><em>Research showed that plastic particles might persist in the lungs, especially in people with lung disease. When particles would remain in the lungs, they likely stay there for a long time because they are bio-persistent, which could cause inflammation. It also matters how long the fibers are because longer fibers appear to be more damaging.</em></p>

        <p>Could inflammation from these fibres cause problems, short-term and long-term, similar to flu, pneumonia etc?</p>

        <p>My memory could be off but I don’t remember hearing about the proposed “Long COVID” until after mask mandates. These bio-persistent fibres could very well be a key factor in not only the initial infection of (what is diagnosed as) COVID but could also account for the instances of long-term respiratory difficulty following recovery too. Interesting.</p>
