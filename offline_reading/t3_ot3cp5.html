        <p>He's probably one of the few presidents that hasn't enforced any mandatory restrictions. And he gets so much hate for this. I've literally heard people saying: "why aren't us Mexicans being protected like the French?". WTF! Colonization is so bad in Mexico, you wouldn't believe it.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile in Chile kids between 12 -17 are already being vaccinated. And to make things worse, they want to vaccinate even those younger than 12 in the near future.</p>

        <p>Funny.  Normally I think this guys is a complete moron. He is a deep-end socialist who just continues corruption in Mexico as it has always been.  With that said, he is a populist - that's how he got elected.  And I think he knows that most people in Mexico don't want to experiment on their kids.</p>

        <p>A lot of people in Mexico don't know about the biosecurity agenda and bio-domestic surveillance totalitarian regimes want the world to turn into. I've also noticed how most people think he's a moron (much like you) when he clearly isn't. The opposition in the country is very determined to get him out that if he would be as stupid as you claim, he would've already been assassinated, knowing how politics in Mexico usually kill any sign of their opposition. </p>
<p>With the Scamdemic, the economy going south, and a class and race divided country, pushed by this very opposition through cheap propaganda, I'm really amazed how the country isn't as bad as when EPN was president. </p>
<p>He's already challenged Monsanto from taken advantage of Mexico's agricultural law, he's even challenged Bayer (big pharma) from doing illegal activity in the country. He didn't apply any enforced restrictions and lockdowns bc he clearly understands how economically undeveloped the country is. If that makes him a populist, he's being a lot more human than E. Macron, A. Merkel, S. Morrison, B. Johnson, J. Biden, J. Trudeau, etc, etc. It's funny and ironic when he was called a dictator even before Mexico's elections in 2018, saying how the country would turn into Venezuela or a "communist" regime (whatever the hell that means today).</p>
<p>The PMs or presidents from first world countries are in fact turning into authoritarian regimes, if you haven't noticed. It would be a lot more convenient for these countries to have something similar if they would want to get re-elected don't you think? Bc people elect or re-elect someone when they're doing the job they're supposed to, despite the corruption.</p>
<p>Don't believe what either his or the opposition's propaganda say about him. Don't believe what I'm replying. Go to the facts. Look it up. It's there. The link I'm referring in my post is from the opposition and it is precisely published to make him look bad, how irresponsible he is for not letting big pharma experiment with children. Yeah. He's such a moronic and terrible statist. lol</p>
