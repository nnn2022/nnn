    <strong>So frustrated with men dismissing women’s reactions to the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>So... LOTS and I mean LOTS of women are reporting drastic changes to their cycles after getting the vaccine. The most common seem to be :</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting their period early (2,3, 4 weeks early) shortly after the vaccine </li>
<li>Missing their period and not being pregnant </li>
<li>Extremely heavy, irregular bleeding with heavy clotting and heavy cramping that isn’t normal for them</li>
<li>Irregular spotting </li>
<li>Getting their period despite being post-menopausal and not having a cycle in months or years</li>
<li>Suddenly having irregular cycles despite always being regular</li>
<li>Any combination of the 6 you can imagine </li>
</ol>
<p>What are all the covid worshippers (particularly men) saying? “Oh, it’s just stress throwing your period off” these women then explain to them despite going through periods (hah pun) of extreme stress, they’ve always had normal cycles. “Oh, it’s just an immune response it’s normal to miss a period/have a heavy period etc when your immune system is working” these women then explain that’s never happened to them with any illness or vaccine. And they still get dismissed. Doctors all seem to be dismissing it as an immune response or stress. NO ONE IS LISTENING TO THESE WOMEN! It’s infuriating. What happened to the same thing all these mostly liberal people were screeching - “believe all women”? But if they’re saying something that might go against your precious vaccine, oh we don’t believe THOSE women do we? </p>
<p>It makes me sick. Definitely not getting the vaccine, if I ever do it’ll only be years from now when studies have shown these women going on to have full term healthy pregnancies.</p></p>

        <p>It makes me sick too. I read an article that stated women might be having issues with their menstrual cycles due to the “sheer relief” of getting vaccinated. Like how dismissive and condescending is that lol</p>

        <p>Oh my god it makes me so angry. In one article they said that covid has been making women "hyper-vigilant" to changes in their body over the past year, so that could explain it. You know what this language reminds me of? When women were diagnosed with "hysteria" on a regular basis in the 1800's and ignored or institutionalized. It's the same old shit, you think we've moved on from patriarchal controlling of women's bodies through medicine? </p>
<p>WHERE ARE THE FEMINISTS?! What exactly been the point of women's rights over the last century?</p>

        <p>I use to be in a cult as a child, due to my parents being in it. My parents figured out that it was, indeed, a cult, and I was out by early high school. Lots of my family is still in it, and I have a theory that since me and my immediate fam. went through this, we are immune to the brain washing. It’s INSANE how exactly similar people are acting about covid and the vax. Jehovahs Witnesses are horrible.</p>

        <p>This is nothing new with doctors. Most of them couldn't care less. I told one doctor I didn't want an IUD because TWO of my friends suffered a perforated uterus and were hospitalized. She said, without looking up, "so I guess all your friends are doctors?"  I took my script for regular pills and never went back. I tried another bc years later. I gave it 1.5 years because you're supposed to get used to it, but this shit had me bleeding for ten days about every other week for over a year. Without bc my period was regular and lasted only three days. I came in for my appt to remove it and she kept trying to just prescribe me pills to regulate my period without taking out my other bc. She completely ignored how relieved and happy I was to be getting rid of it. I was super vocal about how bad I wanted it out. They don't give a fuck about our health. They just want us on these drugs so they can get that bonus check.</p>

        <p>You take one drug for THE problem and then you need two other drugs for the side effects. And so on and so forth. I work in a medical field now and if an older patient tells us they aren't on any meds, we double check with the doctor. It's that rare. I think I've seen two patients in a decade that don't take medications. Last year I saw one taking 30 medications and they were under 20 years old.</p>

        <p>It’s so infuriating. I’m actually not fully anti covid vaxx, and as of now, don’t think there’s anything purposely insidious put in the shots (though that may change). But the fact that so many medical professionals are dismissing these drastic, scary changes in women’s cycles as StReSs or “it’s normal to bleed for 20 days straight and lose clots the size of your palm - it’s an ImMuNe ReSpOnSe” makes me wanna slam my head into a wall.</p>

        <p>I just got the Moderna vaccine two days ago. I'm postmenopausal (2 years since last period) and today I've started bleeding. All afternoon I had painful cramping and pressure that I just chalked up to my usual fibroid and andemyosis issues. Did a search for possible reasons for bleeding after two years and found posts about the vaccine. It didn't even cross my mind!</p>

        <p>I think there are probably thousands of women out there who haven't made the connection between the vaccine and their irregularities, which is understandable, but also means this issue is much larger than it seems.</p>

        <p>This is the first I have heard of this personally. But at least you are in the right place. If the vaccine is related to population control I would imagine it would affect women's cycles along with mens sperm count and even more than that. What you are saying shouldn't be dismissed, because it follows what this sub has been saying for a while
Good luck</p>

<p>Now you see it. Now, imagine this on a worldwide scale. They're beyond normal human intelligence, they've descended into the ultimate of obedience, willing to literally do anything their programming calls for, and do it without question.</p>
<p>They're this dumb because the MSM, political officials, and even the education system has rewired them to be this way. They're willing to do all this because they think they're morally and mentally superior to you and I, to everyone not like them, and they need arguments to prove their high ground. Without it, they have no basis to degrade you.</p>
<p>I'm not a female, but by God hearing what tHe VaCCiNe can and has been doing to women is a serious cause for concern. All side effects like this should generate concern for <em>everyone</em> but the brainwashed people think it's all normal.</p>

        <p>While I don't have faith in the vaccine, I still think this is a pretty cooky line of thought. These are multi-million and billion dollar for-profit organizations. No way they risk their stock price for whatever population control goal a shadowy group of elite individuals is trying to achieve. <br>
I'm pretty sure what you're talking about is nothing more than a horrendous side-effect of these rushed, barely tested drugs everyone is clamoring to inject themselves with.</p>

        <p>Idk.  The elites funding the vaccine including Bill Gates are not only the richest and most powerful people on earth who have enough money to do whatever the heck they want, but they have openly stated de-population as their goal.  Combining that with the overwhelming amount of anecdotal stories about miscarriages, pregnancy issues and period irregularities already in this very short time since the vaccine has rolled out, and I don’t think it’s cooky at all.  I don’t personally outright believe it to be true yet, but I don’t think it’s too far-fetched either.  I’m watching closely and all I know is I’m not getting that vaccine and telling everyone I care about not to as well.</p>

        <p>I noticed a lot of men including Alex Berenson completely dismissing this. It’s maddening because I am one of the women who may have been affected by the vaccine! I’m not vaccinated but my husband is. I haven’t had a period in a year thanks to birth control. (I skip the placebo week). Last week I randomly had a period! Longer and heavier than it was prior to stopping it with BC too!</p>

        <p>Right? Mine has never synced up with other women! Hell I have a teenage daughter who lives with my full time. For as long as she’s had one, it’s come the week after I had mine! I can’t find the IG account where all of these stories started coming out, I am assuming they either got banned. But I have seen screen shots and I personally believe all of those women. It is not a coincidence or periods “syncing”. I mean how do they explain the women who were around vaccinated men???</p>

<p>This actually is a thing, but not from visiting a female friend for a couple of hours.  I've experienced it twice while through-hiking with other women on their periods.  You're basically together 24/7; at night your tents are typically 5-15ft apart so I guess even close when sleeping.  No way are you getting it from lunch out with the girls, though.</p>

        <p>This is actually the first I’ve heard of that, that’s super interesting. </p>
<p>And yes, I think the syncing cycles thing is mostly woo-woo. I’ve never ever synced up with any woman, even women I’ve lived with/worked with everyday etc.</p>

        <p>Just dont get it at all.  Covid isn’t any more threatening to you than the flu unless you’re over 70 or have specific underlying conditions that put you at a greater risk such as obesity, diabetes, etc.  And even then the vaccine side effects also similar to covid poses a greater risk to that same group of people as well 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>Thank you! My wife is overwhelmed with it. She’s tried to get the girls to at least hold off on the vaccines for a while ( until the side effects are a little more understood) To no avail. the oldest is doing her thesis and going through a possible first relationship breakup along with the stress of soon moving to grad school, I’m here doing research for her because she’s at her wits end with concern. We try to keep talking daily and monitor from a distance. Frankly it’s a little terrifying with all the adverse reactions going around and the almost complete censorship of open, honest conversations like this. 
Thank you again ( everybody) for your insights and advice. I’m getting pretty disappointed in our recent crop of physicians and their commitment to actually listening to peoples concerns.
My mother was a lifelong RN and sternly warned me to trust but verify with most doctors.</p>

        <p>Right? Like I hope and pray the vaccine doesn’t affect fertility. Unlike doomers, I don’t celebrate when people suffer. But sadly the evidence is a little shakey right now on how it can affect fertility, and I’m not at all comfortable taking the risk.</p>

        <p>WOMEN OF REDDIT!--</p>
<p>Okay...I really feel that this is important to everyone but especially women. What I've recently discovered, and also personally experienced was, frankly terrifying, and although I'm exhausted I feel like people, but particularly women, need to hear this. </p>
<p>I was lurking reddit with my long ago banned account and saw this thread and had to say something.  So here’s my new account please forgive its lack of post history etc. </p>
<p>Okay, so on Saturday my gf and I spent the entire day in close contact with my parents.  They are both fully (both shots) vaxxed, and my gf and I are not.</p>
<p>Now by Monday, my gf (38-totally healthy) started getting hot flashes.  Pretty serious ones. It was weird cause usually I find the room hot and she is the opposite, and we bug each other about it.  But  I came out of my office and she had all the windows open and said she was having hot flashes and just didn't feel well (crampy etc).  I kinda bugged her about "you're only 38 you shouldn't be in menopause yet."</p>
<p>Little did I know it wasn't so funny.</p>
<p>Last night, Tuesday she continued to feel shitty and I was doing my nightly research and started finding some pretty disturbing stuff:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/.../</p>
<p>are_unvaccinated_people_being.../</p>
<p>https://montanadailygazette.com/.../unvaccinated-women.../</p>
<p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CNtG01Ggsly/...</p>
<p>Here is a page with MANY accounts discussing this:</p>
<p>https://covidvaccinereactions.com/?page_id=634</p>
<p>and lastly a very recent video about a woman specifically in Alberta (my province). Watch the first few minutes and then skip ahead to about the 43 minute mark to get to the relevant conversation.  It's pretty intense.</p>
<p>https://rumble.com/vfvrqt-infertility-crisis.html</p>
<p>So, almost like clockwork, my gf and I go to bed and we are watching tv and she disappears into the bathroom.  Long story short her period kicked in early and it was "horrific" (her description).</p>
<p>I know nothing about women's periods outside of the very basics from sex education in high school.  But this was a lot of clotty blood. I didn't see much I'll be honest, but my gf gave me a very vivd description that was scary.  I don't know what else to say: it was bad.</p>
<p>We've been together for a decade and I'm terrified.  Of this and so much more.  I'm finding hard to even contemplate the future anymore...my thoughts grow increasingly dark by the day. </p>
<p>Anyways, if you put all of this together, hopefully you all understand why I'm concerned.  I'm concerned for the obvious immediate crisis, but also one has to ask:</p>
<p>What else are vaccinated people potentially passing on to those not vaccinated? Viral shedding seems like a real possibility and one no one is discussing (to be fair all of these developments are like within the last 2-3 days).</p>
<p>Equally concerning is looking at the effects of the vaccine on the cycles of women who have been vaccinated, as some of you have experienced. It's absolutely shocking. There are an IMMENSE amount of women, from both the skeptic perspective , but just as many from women believing the narrative, who are having SEVERE effects on their bodies.  Thousands.  Too many to read.</p>
<p>These could be potentially terrifying developments in this nightmare we find ourselves in.  I fear for humanity.  Are we witnessing a potential "Children of Men" type dystopia?</p>
<p>I thank you for reading this far.  There is no agenda in this post except letting women know about my personal experience and providing some information, please don't attack me.  Ive been banned from most social media months and months ago , so I had no account or any idea where to post this, I just knew I had too.</p>
<p>Godspeed everyone.  Stand strong and together.</p>

        <p>Thank you for caring about this Eric! So many men are dismissing it because they don't want to hear about periods but this is way more important than that. I don't know what to do. I have heard people shed for 3 weeks post vacc, does that line up with your experience?</p>

        <p>I can't say I'm surprised people are dismissive of women's reactions. Look at the pill. It has serious side effects--hello, more blood clots--and is not even used primarily as birth control but to regulate period cramps, hormonal acne, etc. A male birth control pill was created years ago, but the unpleasant side effects for them was enough to kibosh it. Sound fair?</p>
<p>I'd really be curious to know what these women's health statuses are like who are having vaccine reactions, eg., are they on birth control? What kind? Do they have comorbidities? Etc.</p>
<p>I work with a lot of women who've been vaccinated, and hearing about vaxx shedding does give me a knee-jerk bit of anxiety. I haven't had any symptoms myself (normal flow; no b.c.). I don't vaccinate, and I highly doubt I ever will.</p>
<p>I think we women need to be proactive and educate ourselves on our own health rather than voluntarily become guinea pigs.</p>

        <p>You're right about female bc but I wouldn't trust a man to be as diligent about taking it every day. I'm definitely team vasectomy once you're done with children but some men won't do it and expect their wives to take bc their whole bloody life. Bc also can tank your sex drive but maybe they assume women don't enjoy sex anyway :( I'm feeling very annoyed as I get further down this thread. It's like we don't really matter</p>

        <p>I think vasectomies are a great route too. Believe me: I feel your frustration. Personally, I think men should be educated on women's reproductive health instead of keeping their heads in the sand. After all, most men will have women in their lives, and I would hope would want the best for them. And as for women: we'll just need to speak up louder.</p>

        <p>Personally I do. I don't feel as embarrassed talking about these things as some women seem to (some women are ashamed, which is awful) so I do talk about it with my boyfriend and he understands a bit. My dad is like disgusted by it, which is childish imo. Love him but he's very old school. Women bring life into the world so I don't think it is a disgusting, shameful thing to talk about womens reproductive health.</p>
<p>I kinda hate how women can feel like absolute death during their periods but we just have to keep going to work and school like everything is normal. I don't know what the answer is though. I've seen people say we should have additional leave for bad days but that kind of makes us clearly not the same as men and "weaker".</p>

        <p>I agree with you, but I don't see how we can reconcile that with women should be paid the exact same as men. In reality women will be penalised for having time off (or potentially having time off even of they never do), even the women who don't have painful periods or any at all, or never have children. I just don't know what the answer is. We're currently trying to shove women through the same box as men and I get why but it doesn't work for anyone.</p>

        <p>That's refreshing to hear. :) Not so much about your dad. Some people can be pretty old school, which does more harm than good imo. Maybe it's the West's bizarre polarized approach to sex.</p>
<p>I don't have answers either. And I can't imagine what it must be like to have severe period cramps, etc, that would require additional leave from work and school. Again, I think we're damaging ourselves tremendously in the West. Girls are getting periods earlier than in other parts of the world; women are getting more autoimmune diseases... it's time for a wakeup call, I think.</p>

        <p>Here's the truth. If women would just bow out of the whole Covid narrative, this would all collapse almost overnight. Women have been prime perpetrators of all the social nastiness associated with the restrictions. Most women need to snap out of it badly. Not to wish any harm on them at all, but sometimes a stiff reality check is exactly what the doctor ordered. Here's to hoping they wake up en masse!</p>

        <p>I'm angry for you! I hate how this crap just gets treated as 'that's what you get for being a woman'. Some women suffer terribly from endometriosis, no one gives a shit. </p>
<p>I once had a coil fitted (bullied into it by bf because I was young and an idiot) and I was in so much pain from it, I could barely stand up straight. I couldn't get anyone to take it out! Not the clinic where it was fitted, not A&amp;E (pushed me back to clinic). I'm in terrible pain and didn't drive so had to get buses and walk to and from these places and no one would fucking help me! (Eventually I did get it sorted, a gyno I know took it out for me immediately, I didn't even have an appointment. God bless him)</p>

        <p>I will not be getting the vax. I started back on birth control in early March, because without BC my periods would be every 5.5 weeks, but extremely heavy. With BC we're talking 3-4 days on regular tampons, very little spotting. </p>
<p>Being around vaxxed people made my most recent period 2.5 weeks, with spotting. Cramps were hell. I can't tell anyone really because even the conservatives I know here are getting it.</p>

        <p>I met a 22 year old recently who was fully vaxxed and spewing the normal rhetoric about Florida and Texas, talking shit about her friend who wants to go away now she’s vaxxed. I said your 22, relax and enjoy life. She tells me her doctor told her she WILL die if she got covid because she has asthma. I tell her that’s one of the most irresponsible things I’ve ever heard come from a dr. But she honestly liked being a victim I concluded. </p>
<p>It’s the same with woman’s cycles. Dr’s and health officials are minimizing it blaming stress. It’s all gaslighting. The whole American medical system can’t get any lower than this honestly</p>

        <p>There's a reason why the advice was that pregnant women shouldn't get the vaccine. I, as a man, have similar concerns to women with the vaccine. There's been no studies on how it affects sperm count and I'm not taking the vaccine unless I know for sure I won't be infertile</p>

        <p>yeah.. this is sadly nothing new. Women's health has not been taken seriously for centuries and their pain is often dismissed, even before this whole vaccine thing. </p>
<p>We literally know less about every aspect of female biology compared to male biology. Women make up 70% of chronic pain patients, 80% of pain medication has been tested only on men. A study found that women in emergency rooms are less likely to be taken seriously than men and are less likely to be given effective painkillers than men. The amount of black women that die in childbirth each year is insane and it all could be prevented. Even female fertility is not as up to date as it should be and most women are taking outdated advice from the 1900's in rural France. </p>

        <p>The funny part of this is that doctors also don't care at all about long covid symptoms of actual covid patients. If you go to long covid support groups, you will find A LOT of womans telling the exact same testimonies: irregular periods after Covid are a common post covid symptom.</p>
<p>But after whole year into this pandemic, there's no research neither interest on explaining it. </p>

        <p>Listen, no matter what happens, anything that challenges their fear, their accepted reality is not real. Women having issues with the vaccine is not real, people who had no change of dying from covid, dying of the vaccine is not real, blood clots are not real, masks not doing shit, is not real. Im sorry but you are not dealing with people capable of compassion.</p>

        <p>It is insanity that these are the same kind of issues that have been pushed in the medical profession for the last several years (I mean actually listening to women and trying to be less biased towards women's health). You would think with the high visibility of COVID and vaccines right now, they would be extra careful to take women seriously.</p>

        <p>Why are you targeting men? This isn't a man vs woman, black vs white, liberal vs conservative issue, it's a stupidity issue. The real question is  why are these women taking an experimental vaccination being funded and promoted by a man who has clearly stated that  if implemented well vaccinations can reduce the population, for a virus that is mathematically no more dangerous than a flu (despite their efforts to fabricate the contrary)? It seems that  pledging allegiance to the MSM and virtue signaling is more important that their health or their ability to conceive.</p>
<p>Sorry if I sound apathetic, but the facts and the science are out there and they are clear, so if people are choosing to take it, what do you want other people / men to do? Of course the narrative is going to deny and downplay the side effects, which for the record includes many woman, I'm pretty sure Belinda Gates is right by good ol Bill's side. </p>

        <p>They recommended pregnant women refrain from the experimental vaccines for 2 years back in like November last year because there was some scrutiny and no tests were done on pregnancy or fertility. This went very quickly from "refrain" to pregnant women promoting it on their social media after getting their own jab.</p>
<p>It's very fucked up. Anyone with influence who's promoted this, to pregnant women especially, should be done for crimes against humanity.</p>

        <p>Some easily researchable info everyone should know about Pfizer, make sure to research the info yourself so you know it’s not just a wall of lies. Downvoting this is harmful to others, nothing listed is fabricated or made up. People deserve to know about the companies past, pro or anti vax. Like I said it’s all in the open (for now). This is the kind of company we’re dealing with. If you have symptoms, REPORT them -</p>
<p>Pfizer received the biggest fine in U.S. history as part of a $2.3 Billion plea deal with federal prosecutors for mis-promoting medicines (Bextra, Celebrex) and paying kickbacks to compliant doctors. Pfizer pleaded guilty to mis-branding the painkiller Bextra by promoting the drug for uses for which it was not approved.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Pfizer was involved in defective heart valves that lead to the deaths of more than 100 people. Pfizer had deliberately misled regulators about the hazards. The company agreed to pay $10.75 Million to settle justice department charges for misleading regulators.</p>
<p>Pfizer paid more than $60 Million to settle a lawsuit over Rezulin, a diabetes medication that caused patients to die from acute liver failure.</p>
<p>In the UK, Pfizer has been fined nearly €90 Million for overcharging the NHS, the National Health Service. Pfizxer charged the taxpayer an additional €48 Million per year for what should have cost €2 million per year.</p>
<p>Pfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that it had bribed doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.</p>
<p>In 2011, a jury found Pfizer committed racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug Neurontin. Pfizer agreed to pay $142.1 Million to settle the charges. Pfizer disclosed that it had paid nearly nearly 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals some $20 Million for speaking on Pfizer’s behalf.</p>
<p>In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had reached a $45 Million settlement with Pfizer to resolve charges that its subsidiaries had bribed overseas doctors and other healthcare professionals to increase foreign sales.</p>
<p>Pfizer was sued in a U.S. federal court for using Nigerian children as human guinea pigs, without the childrens’ parents’ consent. Pfizer paid $75 Million to settle in Nigerian court for using an experimental antibiotic, Trovan, on the children. The company paid an additional undisclosed amount in the U.S. to settle charges here. Pfizer had violated international law, including the Nuremberg Convention established after WWII, due to Nazi experiments on unwilling prisoners.</p>
<p>Amid widespread criticism of gouging poor countries for drugs, Pfizer pledged to give $50 million for an AIDS drug to South Africa. Later, however, Pfizer failed to honor that promise.</p>

        <p>Barely any drugs get tested on female rats/female humans in the first place... Our hormones are tOo ComPliCaTeD. xx cells react differently than xy cells to tons of meds, but only after countless women have been harmed or killed, do they actually recall the drug. The book 'everything below the waist' is a great resource of how the medical field lets women down. </p>
<p>Medicine is the new religion. Ppl are supposed to blindly follow drs, and if you dare even question, then you're a hysterical witch who needs to be jabbed for her own good.</p>

        <p>women are dismissing women's reaction to the vaccine. Including the women who are having adverse reactions and still telling other women to take it, and promising them that it doesn't affect fertility as the are literally in the middle of an early period.</p>
<p>Don't make this about how men are bad. Doomers are bad, not men.</p>
