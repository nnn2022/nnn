    <strong>Any realistic way through this?</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: How do you all think this will play out among citizens in the coming years? Do you guys have hope for the future?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>With a decent chunk of the population totally and religiously devoted to wearing masks and keeping the pan(den)ic alive, how do we move forward? It was reasonable to be worried about this whole situation last march, but now things are just becoming ridiculous. </p>
<p>I'm starting to realize that I live in a different reality than some people. I'm a college student, but unlike so many of my peers it feels like I'm living in a logical mentality whereas a lot of people are operating out of pure passion. I needn't explain the folly of masks and lockdowns. But for some background here are some personal experiences with this whole COVID thing: </p>
<p>- I know 4 people personally who got Covid, all turned out fine within a week, and are now equally annoyed about masks.</p>
<p>- My grandfather, who suffered from several co-morbidities like dementia, died of "COVID complications" in a nursing home. We were never allowed to see the body and still haven't got the death certificate. Strange, no?</p>
<p>- My step-mom got tested for covid, came out negative, and was still marked by the hospital as a covid case. </p>
<p>BUT, even with my personal experiences, rudimentary logic, statistical evidence, a large amount of peer reviewed microbiology sources, etc., there's no way to enlighten people who seem to be glued to CNN or any other media program and are living in constant fear. Do you guys have hope for the future? Or do you see nothing but police state and loyal pawns? </p>
<p>I just want to get a feel for what others are thinking moving forward. Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>I have hope. Public opinion is only trending one way: ours. And most of our harshest critics, as loopy as they are online, are pampered work-from-home luvvies who wouldn't risk a hangnail for their easy-come, easy-go 'beliefs.' They've done a complete 180 since March and they'll do a 180 again. The only faction to which proactive commitment comes naturally is ours.</p>

<p>They know themselves it's a hoax but are simply paid (maybe some not even paid, though that were even more pathetic) shills, that's why they are so dishonest and why they use nonchalantly and deliberately all kinds of manipulation tactics and logical fallacies.</p>

        <p>Agreed 100%. </p>
<p>If you browse this sub you'll find people venting about their own issues or making actual arguments, whereas places like r/antimaskers have no actual arguments or personal feelings, only taunts and regurgitated propaganda.</p>

        <p>&rt;It was reasonable to be worried about this whole situation last march</p>
<p>I was and am worried about the blatantand massive fascism, but lived through enough of their scams that I knew from the beginning that it was yet another hoax. That was its own toment though, seeing many people fall for their cheap and obvious propaganda tactics. But I think at this point, the majority is against it, it may depend on where you are living, but that's what I see in the real world and in the yt comment section.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Do you guys have hope for the future? Or do you see nothing but police state and loyal pawns?</p>
<p>I ask myself this constantly, and depending on the day I shift between being crushed and on hopium.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know, but what concerns me is that even if most people disobey, it still doesn't go simply away, the politician scum have their armed thugs, and at some point may simply go with even more brute violence and fascism. If one side is armed and the other isn't - there wont even be an actual fight.</p>

<p>This is so fucked up. I'm in europe and here you are forced to wear a muzzle, yet most people actually disobey/ignore it, which even surprised me. </p>

<p>The best thing about most of the us is that you guys actually have guns, which is necessary for real resistance. People here are completely fucked, because here only the fascists are armed - and even heavily armed.</p>

        <p>It's not that bad here because the worst thing that can happen from not wearing a mask is getting kicked out of a store. </p>
<p>But I'm sorry to hear that it feels helpless over there. On the bright side, fascists don't usually live very long, with or without guns.</p>

        <p>Same, I try to hope but my hope seems like it is based on nothing. Everything that comes out of Government (at least here in the UK) is talk of more restrictions over ever-longer periods of time (winter 2021 being the latest hint).</p>
<p>I would go and protest all of this, but I can't weigh up whether or not it is worth getting a criminal record. Call me a pussy but I really find myself in a true dilema... If we don't protest this then our futures may be ruined, but if we do we are liable to become criminals which will also ruin our futures.</p>

        <p>I don't think this ends without blood being spilled.  I hope I'm wrong. I don't think things are going back to normal without a fight. Here in America,  we're likely not getting our rights back without a fight.  The people that inflicted this on us will likely never face any punishment outside of the possibility of mob justice(just like the elected officials,  bureaucrats,  and judges who have been acting against the constitution for decades).</p>
