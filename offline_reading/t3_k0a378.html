    <strong>Awesome relevant sci fi thriller - Orphan Black (corrupt science &amp; govt working together, fighting for individual autonomy and "greater good" at all costs narrative) (will try not to have spoilers)</strong>
    <p><p>I recently rewatched this show and not only is it exciting, funny, and heart wrenching, with great acting, but I find it extremely relevant in my opinion. The "bad guys" are scientists with god complexes, and the corporations they work for, with the govt in their pocket. The science they belong to is actually a cult! The "good guys" are forced to be subjects to these scientists. The scientists argue that the experiment will do great things for humanity (obviously it's not, it's for power and hubris), whatever the human cost and ethics violations-- and that it's ok to sacrifice individual freedom for it. The show is about the good guys fighting to own their bodies and live free of prying examinations, and treatments they do not consent to or have any information on. </p>
<p>I could just hear today's viewers being like "whAts ThE biG DeAL? The experiments aren't that bad! Just sacrifice a little freedom! Trust the experts!" It shows the fight for freedom verses "safety", as the fight against the bad guys leads to lots of suffering--but they value their autonomy more. It is tempting for them to just give in and go under the "protection" of the scientists, even though the scientists were the ones endangering them in the first place!</p>
<p>It's a long show, and centers around a group of young women in Canada, but if you love sci fi you will love this show!</p></p>
