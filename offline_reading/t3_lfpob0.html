        <p>The motto of the pro-lockdowners is to ‘save lives’.</p>
<p>...Unless those lives happen to suffer from
-Suicide
-Overdose
-Car accidents
-Homicide
-Drowning
-Heart Disease
-Starvation
-Cancer
-Old Age
-Seizures
-Lightning strike
-Firearms
-Stabbings
-Fires
-Lack of medical care
-Anemia
-HIV
-Diabetes
-Food poisoning
-Obesity</p>
<p>If you mention the number of deaths from any those above, they won’t give a shit. Other deaths don’t matter. Mental health effects of the lockdowns don’t matter. Children’s education doesn’t matter. The rise in obesity doesn’t matter. The economy doesn’t matter. Only coronavirus.</p>
<p>When you think about it, it’s really not about ‘saving lives’ at all.</p>

        <p>They only ever cared about moral superiority. Caring about people catching covid makes it look like they care about the survival of their fellow men. That's why they tell people to wear masks, why some of them proudly flaunt that they've stayed home for the entirety of 2020, and also why they're proud to announce that they'll be one of the first "lucky" ones to get the vaccine early.</p>

        <p>I also was (partly) a sperm cell once, yet you do not want to ban condoms.... But your response probably has something to do with an arbitrary definition of personhood/life.
Anyway, I don't want to die, other people don't want to die, so we made the rule that we punish people that kill other people. We don't make that social contract with animals because they cannot participate in it, we have less empathy for them and they are pretty much powerless. The same is true for a fetus.</p>

        <p>A fetus isn't an animal. They feel pain and cry and kick as you kill them. </p>
<p>Look, either we're all important or it's all arbitrary and society can deem you nonhuman and kill you.</p>
<p>Why don't we just deem you nonhuman and kill you now?  You're just an animal to be muzzled, tracked, traced, vaccinated and sent to slaughter.</p>

        <p>Like animals don't feel suffering... And yes, society can in theory deem me as nonhuman, but realistically that will never happen for the reasons I mentioned before. (+ some others, if suddenly a rule can be made that I can be killed without repercussions then there is no reason that couldn't happen to some random other person. So logically people don't want that to happen.) What's your point?</p>

        <p>&rt;I noticed you left out suicides, and drug overdoses. Hospitals are turning people away because they're only concerned with covid. Oh and there have been plenty of fatalities regarding chemotherapy since it has about a 3% success rate in treating cancer(s) so I don't know how preventative it actually is when it has been demonstrated repeatedly to accelerate malignant growth.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It seems you're also unaware they canceled oncologist appointments and other surgeries in favor of more covid testing and treatment so that adds to the death toll you're so desperately trying to keep low, as if no one has ever died before in the history of man.</p>

        <p>Covid is already manageable. If it wasn't they wouldn't have shut down the make shift hospitals for overflow patients in the summer of 2020. Some of which never saw a single patient. </p>
<p>A good chunk of hospitals are empty right now. This has been confirmed repeatedly. You people are delusional. My mom's own hospital department was shut down for several months when they could've handled the spill over they predicted that never happened. A lot of the experts predictions were way off the mark, embarrassingly so. Remember Neil Furguson who went to bang his mistress during the first lockdown in the U.K? He predicted 2.2 million in the first 3 months? We all know how that turned out on top of his hypocritical behavior yet you and everyone else continues to trust proven liars, I'm starting to wonder if you're willfully ignorant or hopelessly brainwashed?</p>

        <p>ah yes i must be brainwashed to trust scientist and experts. at the end of the day you can clearly see what’s happening in hospitals all over the world, they are over stretched as it is without having people with a highly infectious disease being admitted. wearing a mask and only going out for essential travel isn’t that hard; yes it’s annoying and frustrating but the sooner we get on top of the virus the quicker we can get rid of the restrictions and live again. but i suppose i’m not going to change your mind and you’re not going to change mine. stay safe</p>

        <p>Are you the sort of person that would tell a depressed and/or suicidal person to "man up" by any chance? Also the fact suicide rates are higher than covid deaths in Japan should probably tell you that "Just" wearing a mask isn't really sufficient or as important as you may think..</p>

        <p>no i wouldn’t, suicide has always been a crisis and always will be. i think you’re getting angry at the wrong people, it isn’t the fault of people wearing masks that is increasing suicide rates, it’s maybe the fact that most governments are cutting mental health funds and not providing people with support.</p>

        <p>Japanese people have been wearing masks for many years. Wearing them in 2020 is not likely to be primary reason for a Japanese person to off themself.</p>
<p>Their suicide rate is up 3% since the previous year. Most of the approximately 20k Japanese suicides would have happened anyway, unfortunately, like they do every year.</p>

        <p>Sure, because there's nothing dark or depressing about the last year that might increase the number of suicides.</p>
<p>I'm sure the two people I know that killed themselves in the last year would have died anyway too, right? The incredibly good looking guy who does well at his job, with a beautiful family and everything going so well for him? And the schoolteacher with no history of mental problems?</p>

        <p>Not at all. I mean Japan specifically. Their suicide rate is very high every year, and only increased 3 percent in 2020.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I'm just feeling the same way myself. I have a wife and 4 kids so I have to push through, but... Even more than what has happened over the last year - the fact people have gone along with it and even advocated for it is what depresses me most.</p>
<p>The New Normal waiting for us on the side of this is a dark, terrible place so it is bizarre to me that people advocate the policies that are taking us there.</p>

        <p>I don't share your fears of a New Normal, and I am instead looking forward to returning to relatively the same normal as before. That's what I expect to happen.</p>
<p>However it shakes out, I do encourage you to try and take care of yourself for your own sake and that of your family. There are free mental health resources that could help. Good luck and best wishes.</p>

        <p>TL;DR: I estimate that a Japanese person is 50 times more likely to die of suicide than of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Japan has a high suicide rate. They had about 3% more suicides in 2020 than they did in 2019, which has got to be due to COVID lockdowns and fear and so on, but the overwhelming majority of those suicides would have occurred anyway.</p>
<p>Japan has a weird relationship and history with suicide. In many cases it is preferable to living with dishonor. Their suicide rate is about 15 per 100,000 people, and with a total population of about 125 million they see about 20,000 suicides per year.</p>
<p>What I could find about Japan and COVID is that they have an infection (not even death) rate of between 7 and 20 per 100,000 people in their top 10 most populous cities, varying from city to city. So even if you live in the city in Japan, you're about as likely to commit suicide as you are to catch COVID. Since COVID is not likely to kill you, you'd be at least 50 times more likely to kill yourself as die from COVID.</p>

        <p>Want to see something crazy? Look up "depression" and "suicide" on Google Trends and tell me those aren't fudged reports.</p>
<p>What you'll see is minimal to no change in those search terms, and there's no way that's possible in these times.</p>
<p>PS. I know two people who killed themselves during the lockdown and I've never felt so miserable in my entire life... I have a funny feeling I'm not alone in that, and seeing no unusual movement in those search terms is more than a little suspicious.</p>

<p>I said the numbers are fudged. They aren't real. They're as intercepted and manipulated as your searches about anything Covid related are.</p>

        <p>Can confirm. Certain things are unsearchable. There was a violent protest in DC a few nights ago. I was looking for it on Google. Only three videos (via Twitter, from a well-known conservative, gay, Asian-American author’s account) and only one article covering it (not even from a mainstream publication).</p>
<p>There was a video on this sub of Wendy Williams on Dr. Oz doubling-down on claiming that she would refuse a vaccine. The next day, not only was it deleted from this sub, but I couldn’t find a trace of it on Google.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on trying to Google anything about CoVid that isn’t the MSM narrative.</p>

        <p>Yes! And thanks for responding. Hearing that someone else sees things for how they are gives a badly needed hint of hope in these dark times.</p>
<p>Want to see another weird search?</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>"what is covid really about"</p>
<p>In Google WITH QUOTES. Apparently I'm the only person in the country who has asked that question...</p>
<p>Is that even possible?!</p>
<p>Then try: "what is happiness really about" WITH QUOTES and you'll get 159,000 results.</p>

        <p>Yes! These articles exist for everything. Any time I try to share info with anyone about what is actually happening, when they search for themselves - their searches are intercepted by these "fact check" websites which are all funded by people, organizations, and corporations that gain power and wealth from lockdowns, Covid-19, and the general response to all of this.</p>
<p>When a person does that search - unless you have an incredible rapport with them - they walk away thinking YOU are crazy.</p>
<p>By the time the average person realizes what is happening - it will be too late.</p>

        <p>Fuck old people I guess? America sure is a harsh place to live. Imagine normalizing killing people above the age of 45 like they do not matter to make a point. Is it worth it to murder 10 people above the age of 45 to save 1 person aged below 25?</p>

        <p>Death rates in the US has increased and the US had 299,028 excess deaths as of October 15 2020. With 2.5 months left the stats for excess deaths will increase and the mortality rate in America has increased because of covid infections. It is a leading cause of death for all Americans. </p>

        <p>Yes, the restrictions and new norms in society has actually reduced the spread of influenzas and norovirus. It is a very good thing that we started using masks, distancing and not being so many in the same place like before so that this could be possible. Imagine how many dead we would have if we did not do these things? The American healthcare system would be completely wiped out.</p>
