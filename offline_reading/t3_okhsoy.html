    <strong>California has a QR code system for "proof" of vaccination. I, unvaccinated, have a code.</strong>
    <p><p>A  lot of people in my doomer state of California seem to think that the ridiculous QR code system the government "unveiled" last month will be  the be-all-end-all to the pandemic. A lot of large events in California  that are happening later on in the summer are requiring local people to  show this QR code as "proof" they are vaccinated, so then they will be able to attend the event maskless. No, really. They get a nice  "vaccinated" wristband that they have to wear at all times.</p>
<p>Except...I  got a QR code somehow. When the system came out, I decided to just try it to see what would happen. I put my name, date of birth, email... and there I was. My health insurance info is in the database with  a vaccine even though I was never jabbed. Apparently, I got the J&amp;J in April.  So, now I will be able to walk around maskless because of someone at Kaiser's...mistake? I  highly doubt I'm the only one this has happened to.</p>
<p>If this isn't absolute peak security theater, I don't know what is. I got my code, so I must be "safe" then, right? <strong>Right?</strong></p>
<p>Doomers  don't like to talk to you when you bring this up and they say it's  ridiculous, but I wonder how many other "plague rats" there are in  California who also somehow got a completely valid QR code.</p></p>
