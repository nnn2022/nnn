    <strong>Interview With Dr. Judy Mikovits (post-vax-rollout)</strong>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm guessing there are plenty of people here who know of Dr. Mikovits and appreciate her work.</p>
<p>This is an eye-opening interview I thought you'd enjoy listening to (whether you're familiar with her story or not). Just ignore the theme/views of the podcast as a whole (eg. topics covered in other episodes)--that's not relevant here.</p>
<p>Some of this material she discusses coincides with docs that have been posted on here as well.</p>
<p>Starting at 2:36 (when playing the podcast): I would like to have some more info here. I'm not doubting the integrity of her sources, but it would be nice to obtain more info on where the stats were uncovered. This would give more credibility when discussing this with others. Let me know if you have any related sources/links/data to share...thanks.</p>

        <p>She was censored heavily April last year. I remember her one interview with Patrick Bet David, it was so fucking informative. Anyone who’s heard/seen it wouldn’t doubt her for a sec. i saw it on yt when it had roughly 1-2m views after 3 days.. by 5th day it was gone. Then they ran a smear campaign in the media. PBD did a follow up though where she was supposed to debate the popular Dr. Bright on his show, but he backed out last minute. Go figure</p>

        <p>I'll let people investigate for themselves instead of trying to convince anyone one way or another. But those two links at least show her actual work so that others can do just that. On the other hand, anything found on Google/Wiki doesn't even state work/projects...it's all just slander. </p>
<p>As far as that goes...it's definitely been revealed that social media and search engines (Google, YouTube, etc.) have done a lot of censoring throughout all of this, in order to skew search results a certain way. If you want to see more info on that aspect, it's covered in a well-known documentary, in which she briefly appears. (I probably can't type the documentary's name here, because it would trigger censorship <em>hint hint</em>)</p>

        <p>Seems Dr. Mikovits got the Bernice Eddy treatment. Which is what happens if you threaten a sacred Pharma racket.</p>
<p>&rt;”Few back then grasped that these vaccines might also be a huge, inadvertent, uncontrolled experiment in interspecies viral transmission. But <strong>from 1955 to 1963,</strong> according to a 1976 US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, <strong>98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses. <strong>Such contamination often spoiled cultures, including those of an NIH researcher named Bernice Eddy, who worked on vaccine safety.</strong> In 1959, fresh from co-reporting that the mouse polyoma virus could cause cancer in other animals, Eddy tested the rhesus monkey kidney substrate used to make polio vaccine. She injected 154 newborn hamsters with extracts of the cell cultures: 109 developed tumours. Next, she ground up three of the tumours and injected the residue into other hamsters. The animals receiving injections from two of the three tumours developed cancers. But when Eddy put the substance back into the monkey cell culture, nothing happened, and she couldn't isolate the suspected virus.</p>
<p>&rt;In The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed, Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher report that in 1960, <strong>when Eddy presented her results to her boss, a polio vaccine champion named Joe Smadel, he was livid and disbelieving: “Its implications—that something in the polio vaccine could cause cancer—was an affront to his career.”</strong> Her discovery also threatened one of the USA's most important public-health programmes. “By 1960, tens of millions of Americans had been vaccinated against polio, and it was federal health policy that everyone should be vaccinated and continue to receive Salk booster shots.”
<strong>Eddy tried to get word out to colleagues but was muzzled and stripped of her vaccine regulatory duties and her laboratory.</strong> However, two Merck researchers, Ben Sweet and Maurice Hilleman, soon identified the rhesus virus later named SV40—the carcinogenic agent that had eluded Eddy.”</p>
<p>&rt;”As of 2003, SV40 had been <strong>found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that the rates of <strong>SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine,</strong> including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>

        <p>This is misleading. The Cutter incident is is a tragedy in disregarding safety tests during manufacturing of the polio vaccines. The polio vaccine itself is effective and not cancer-causing. Bernice Eddy was not questioning the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. She was warning us of an improper manufacturing technique used to produce certain batches of vaccines. She used proper tests and produced proper results, and was silenced tragically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dr. Mikovits is claiming that the vaccine is detrimental to our health, regardless of manufacturing technique. Her claims are based on invalidated research.</p>
<p>Please do not equate the two. I hope you see the difference.</p>

        <p>SV40 goes far beyond the Cutter Lab debacle. They’re different events but part of the same corrupt “polio” vaccine protection racket.  Scientists knowingly injected hundreds of millions globally with SV40. They had known since 1960 and let it continue for years. Didn’t want to bust up their scam.</p>
<p>We know governments, their captured agencies and politicians lie: <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFederalReserveConspiracy_568/page/n1/mode/2up">The Federal Reserve cartel,</a> <a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/2017/06/17/watergate-downing-nixon-part-1/">Watergate,</a> Iran-Contra, WMDs in Iraq, Epstein/Maxwell etc.</p>

<p>Somehow vaccines are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jul/14/health.medicineandhealth">“safe and effective”</a> because corrupt pharmaceutical industry <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-vaccine-idUSL1N0YQ0W820150604">$cience</a> and lying governments tell us they are.</p>
<p>“Polio” is a <a href="http://whale.to/a/bealle2.html#December%2016,%201955%20VACCINE%20FRONT">classic scam</a> of grouping DDT/other paralysis-inducing poisoning, GBS and other forms of paralysis under one banner to sell the panic. Then once you starting doling out “polio” shots you reclassify or re-diagnose things as needed to uphold the Pharma “polio” vaccine racket.</p>
<p>”Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the <strong>Rockefeller Institute</strong>. Among them have been the <strong>supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.”</strong> ^1:110</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Much of what you have been led to believe about immunizations simply isn't true.”</strong> ^2</p>
<p>&rt;”If immunizations were responsible for the diminishing or disappearance of these diseases in the United States, <strong>one must ask why they disappeared simultaneously in Europe, where mass immunizations did not take place.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</p>
<p>Mutant Strains Of Polio Vaccine <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">Now Cause More Paralysis Than Wild Polio</a></p>
<p>“In addition to the rise in AFP that correlates with rising OPV dosing in India, there are numerous reports of vaccine viruses mutating to virulence, causing polio outbreaks in China, Nigeria, and India. As always, the finger is pointed at under-vaccinated populations rather than at the vaccine itself or the myriad other causes of viral mutation. ^3</p>
<p>Apart from the resilience of circulating wild-type viruses, major problems have emerged as a result of intrinsic properties of the OPV. <strong>It has the propensity to escape its designated role as a protecting immunogen by circulating in poorly immunized populations, thereby evolving into highly neurovirulent poliovirus strains after recombination with other enteroviruses</strong> (Kew et al, 2005; P. Jiang, J.A.J. Faase, A.E. Gorbalenya and E. Wimmer, unpublished data). This independent occurrence in different
parts of the world causes yearly outbreaks of poliomyelitis.</p>
<p>We often hear that OPV circulating in poorly immunized populations is wonderful because the unvaccinated get the benefit. <strong>But OPV vaccines will always be able to recombine with enteroviruses no matter how highly vaccinated the population, and dangerous recombination viruses that cause paralysis will not be called “polio.” This is one way that a mountain of new AFP cases builds, while GAVI and WHO celebrate eradication of polio.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>”In Biskind’s opinion, the spread of polio after the Second World War was caused “by the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history.”</strong> ^141 Along with DDT, the much more poisonous DDE was also used in the USA. <strong>Both toxins are known to break through the hematoencephalic barrier, which protects the brain from poisons or harmful substances.</strong> Nonetheless, housewives were urged to spray both DDT and DDE to prevent the appearance of polio. <strong>Even the wallpaper in children’s rooms was soaked in DDT before it was glued on the wall.</strong> ^4</p>
<p>A look at statistics shows that <strong>the polio epidemic in the USA reached its peak in 1952, and from then on rapidly declined. We have seen that this cannot be explained by the Salk-inoculation, since this was first introduced in 1955.</strong> There is a most striking parallel between polio development and the utilization of the severe neurotoxin DDT and other highly toxic pesticides like BHC (lindane), which was also hard to degrade and actually much more poisonous than DDT. While use of DDT was eventually drastically reduced because of its extreme harmfulness, the use of BHC was curbed because it produced a bad taste in foods.</p>
<p><strong>“It is worth noting that DDT production rose dramatically in the United States after 1954,”</strong> Jim West remarks, “which is primarily connected to the fact that <strong>DDT was increasingly exported to the Third World,</strong> to be used primarily in programs to fight malaria or in agriculture.”</p>

<p>The Poisoned Needle by Eleanor McBean is not a reliable source. It is under the assumption that germ theory is incorrect. Her main argument against the germ theory is from volume 6 of THE HYGIENIC SYSTEM. Quote from Dr. Herbert M. Shelton:</p>
<p>&rt;Anti-toxins, antibodies, antigens, etc., have never been isolated.</p>
<p>This is not true. Antibodies have been isolated, and are currently being isolated in research. You may even isolate antibodies yourself if you have equipment.</p>
<p>Germ theory is widely verified by experiment. The argument that vaccines are ineffective because germ theory is wrong is therefore invalid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You are also claiming that vaccines are causing more harm than benefits.</p>
<p>&rt;Mutant Strains Of Polio Vaccine <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">Now Cause More Paralysis Than Wild Polio</a></p>
<p>Please do not fear-monger by misleadingly quoting the article.</p>
<p>Yes, there are cases of vaccine-caused paralysis, but the elimination of wild polio by the vaccine is a great success. Also, oral polio vaccine is used only for its low cost. Risk assessment favors taking polio vaccines.</p>

<p>Please tell me the source of where you learned this. Publishing companies generally do not fact check before publishing and expect the author to conduct their own fact checking. I believe this includes Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
