    <strong>Antibodies</strong>
    <p><p>I have several friends and family members RUSHING to get the shot, just after recovering from C19, or had C19 in the past few months. Honest question - <strong>Do the majority of people have</strong> <strong><em>any</em></strong> <strong>clue what antibodies are?</strong></p>
<p>You can receive an antibody test (at least here in Michigan - Kroger grocery store) for 25 bucks. I have no idea who accurate they are - but wouldn't that be the <strong>first thing you would want to know after recovering?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural Antibodies</strong> - may last years or decades (Some remaining Spanish Flu survivors still exhibit antibodies.</p>
<p><strong>Covid Shot</strong> - Sounds like the therapy may last 6 months, perhaps longer, we'll see. But the booster shots are already in the works.</p>
<p>I am seriously concerned a large amount of people in this world <strong>have no idea what antibodies are</strong>, and a healthy human body that is not immune compromised is capable of doing magnificent things.</p></p>

        <p>The reason most people are getting shots anyway is because the IDIOTS in charge of governments and health policies refuse to acknowledge natural immunity from antibodies as being a thing. They expect everyone to get the shot to return to normal, so people feel like they have no choice. It’s utterly pathetic and absurd.</p>

        <p>It's not that the governments don't know that natural immunity is a thing, it's that the drug companies that own the politicians don't make money from people who don't get the shot.</p>

        <p>Most people seem to be grossly under-informed on the topic, particularly in how it relates to COVID-19.  Even more troubling than the lack of baseline knowledge is the aversion to learning anything that doesn't confirm their individual biases.</p>
<p>Human immune systems primarily rely on T-cell crossover responses when fighting off a Coronavirus. Human immune systems generally don't take the infection seriously enough to store long term antibodies because they just aren't that threatened by this particular family of viruses. T-cells use memory from prior infections to attack the virus and they learn valuable information that will be used to fight off future infections.</p>
<p>People may have antibodies for some time after infection.  There is little reason to believe that those antibodies will remain in their system longer than 6 months - if they have them at all.  However, their T-cells will have the experience necessary to respond to future infections.</p>
<p>One of the problems with antibody tests is the timing of when it's administered. Test too early and you can miss an early stage infection, test anytime after antibodies have been produced and you run the risk of misdiagnosing a recovered person.  Test a recently vaccinated person and you can inflate your case numbers.</p>
<p>The PCR test has its own set of problems unrelated to the antibody response. Amplification cycles in excess of 30 dramatically increase the likelihood of producing a false positive. When 32 or more cycles are used, it virtually guarantees a false positive if viral RNA fragments are found anywhere in the sample. </p>
<p>The US has been running up to 40 amplification cycles for most of the last year.  I read a few articles that indicated Germany would not run more than 36. Asian countries like South Korea wouldn't even administer a test without a corresponding pneumonia diagnosis. It's impossible to compare the various countries' actual case counts under these conditions. The country that tests every carbon-based sample that walks into a clinic and runs the swab through 40 amplification cycles will ALWAYS look worse in raw numbers.</p>

        <p>The life of IgA and IgM are only a few weeks, and IgG is a few months isnt that right? So a fairly small window especially considering IgA is the one that would be most likely to made in the nasal/mucus membrane, GI tract where it would first encounter a virus</p>

        <p>Thank you for pointing that out.  I am going to do something that you don't see much of online...</p>
<p>I think your assessment is correct. My use of "anytime after antibodies are produced" was hyperbolic. I should have been more careful with my wording.</p>

        <p>The government can’t admit that the natural infections confer immunity. They would be forced to admit that the PCR tests had a ridiculous number of false positives or be left with a ton of people that thought themselves immune from a false positive that then did not get their magic science juice.</p>

        <p>Antibodies after infection are inconsistent, they depend on the severity of the infection and a person's immune response. A very small number don't get any immunity and a larger minority may have immunity that's not that great. That being said at the same time a person who has recovered could have even BETTER immunity than what the vaccines provide it just depends on the individual case. The experts recommend getting vaccinated even if you had COVID because you don't know what camp you fall into while the vaccine derived immunity is pretty consistent among different populations.</p>
