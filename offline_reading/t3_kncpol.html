    <strong>My first interaction with a distressed elder</strong>
    <p><p>Today I was up and early in the morning to help out a family member raise his driveway since the ground has sunken over the decades. Said family member lives directly across an elderly home at my village. I was prying loose some tiles with a shovel when I looked over the the elderly home across the street.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When I looked over, I saw an elderly woman standing at a primarily glass side door (Wooden frame but a lot of glass 10% wood 90% glass) gesturing me over. Me being the helpful young man that I am, walked across the street to see what she needed. She was trying to open the door but it was stuck from what I presume to be a lock at the top so only the bottom part swayed a little. I gave the door on my end a small tug to see if it wasn't just a bit stiff from the cold weather, it didn't budge. I quickly stopped trying since I didn't want to be liable for any damages by tugging hard on a door which may damage the frame.  </p>
<p>I asked the elderly woman behind the glass door if there was a latch or a lock or something up at the top of the door, she shrugged and said she just wanted some fresh air (I couldn't see any windows open on the entire side of the building facing me). I said sorry to her that I couldn't help her since I don't want to damage someone else's property and be held liable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The woman gave me a sigh and placed a hand in front of her mouth as to imitate a face mask. She said to me (Roughly translating from Dutch to English) "The nurses are being uptight and very mean to us." in a worn down and defeated voice.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I returned back across the street after saying sorry again and the thought is still lingering about that poor woman. She was part of the generation that rebuilt my country after the Germans bomb it to bits and occupied it for five brutal years. Is this how we repay that generation? Locking them up in an elderly home, not even opening a window for them for fresh air and stripping away their rights and liberties?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This post is probably longer than it should be and turned a little in a rant but I just honestly can't fathom the idea that you'd treat people like that.</p></p>

        <p>Couldn't she just walk out the front door? Her window being stuck is hardly anybody else's fault.</p>
<p>Certainly nobody is responsible for locking her up in her home and "not even opening a window for them for fresh air." That's clearly hyperbolic af.</p>
