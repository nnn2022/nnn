    <strong>Don’t Forget Where This All Started</strong>
    <p><p>While we’re all (rightfully) focused on advocating against lockdowns and vaccine passports, China has really been flying under the radar. </p>
<p>China has apparently been open since before the new year. I looked up their covid stats and they have logged &lt; 5,000 deaths and as a country record under 50 cases a day. A country of 1,400,000,000 people. For reference my city with 0.1% of that population records more than that. I remember when they first reopened the narrative was their super strict lockdowns eliminating the virus. I think we can clearly see from Australia’s feeble attempts to keep out covid that this is fucking impossible, especially when I haven’t heard anything about intermittent Chinese lockdowns since they reopened.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago China openly rejected a WHO plan to investigate Wigan for the virus’ origin. Well isn’t China a trustworthy country to deal with isn’t it? </p>
<p>The thing I do find funny though is covid has probably been running as rampant through their population as anywhere in the west and they’re just not reporting it. At the same time I also have no doubt they’ve been operating as normal. Really makes you think what’s possible without a 24/7 covid fear campaign doesn’t it?</p></p>

        <p>Shows you really who had the most to gain fr all that. They started it. Overhyped it. And then started to pretend they don't have it, as they know it is not as dangerous as they said. And they fully control media and health system so there will be no dissidents.</p>
