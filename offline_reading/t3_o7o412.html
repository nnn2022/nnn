    <strong>My thoughts on "unruly" passengers</strong>
    <p><p>First off I don't condemn violence. I don't think people should be throwing punches at anyone that decides to wear a mask or not wear a mask.</p>
<p>That being said I don't believe "anti-maskers" or "unruly" passengers are lashing out for no reason. Unless we are there to witness it we don't know what's happening on these planes. It's possible a few of these "unruly" passengers "went crazy" the moment a staff told them they needed a mask. Yet here's what I believe is going on.</p>
<ol>
<li>People who are vaccinated or feel safe from the virus enough to not wear a mask are being told to wear one regardless. Even if the "state" isn't requiring them anymore the public transit feels they need to follow the "law" Biden put in place until September 13th. Even then they could come up with some bullshit of how "it's their policy" to make you wear one.</li>
<li>While some "can breathe fine" with a mask on some are not wearing masks because they can't. Some haven't been for nearly 2 years now and they didn't get sick to the point they needed to be hospitalized. Yet they are being treated like "unruly" passengers for wanting to go visit their grandma, mom, dad, etc. without a mask on. THERE NEEDS TO BE EXCEPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO WEAR A MASK.</li>
<li>I am sure a lot of fights are being caused not only just from the staff, but from the other passengers that don't like "anti-maskers". All what these people want to do is visit someone either their family, loved ones or work without a mask on and they can't even do that. Staffers are bothering and kicking people off flights for not wearing them. Like no shit these "unruly" passengers are going to get pissed off. They paid money and had to deal with the whole boarding process that I am sure is even worse now with these new Covid checks in place.</li>
</ol>
<p>The transit mask police is what's causing these passengers to be "unruly". It's not coming out of thin air that "because of Covid" they are angry. It's because YOU KEEP FORCING PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS AND GET TESTED WHEN THEY ARE NOT EVEN FEELING SICK! Yet their answer to the rise in "unruly" passengers is to get "more help" instead of trying to fix the problem when THEY ARE THE PROBLEM.</p></p>

        <p>I never understood the paranoia with masks on airlines when they use some of the best air purification systems you can find. I'm certainly not saying you can't catch COVID on a plane but the maskers take it to the next level on those things.</p>

        <p>They did studies. Masks did nothing. The filtration did all of the work. There hasn't been a single case of COVID-19 traced to an airplane.</p>

        <p>I think 99% of angry passengers are just sick and tired of the mask nazis and are rightfully snapping and lashing out. I’m on their side. Flight attendants going on power trips need to lose their jobs</p>

        <p>It’s sucks pretty bad wearing a mask on a plane. I use to fly all the time but when I wear a mask I get motion sickness due to the lack of air. I’ve almost used those silly puke bags…</p>

        <p>The stories are being used to push masks forever. The flight attendants union wants this so they can get out of drink and food service as much as possible.</p>

        <p>TL;DR and don't care. Cause my flight to be diverted because you can't act like an adult and I'll be the one bringing out the duct tape. </p>
<p>I don't <em>want</em> to wear a mask either, anymore than I want to contract or transmit the virus, but you can't always get what you want.</p>
