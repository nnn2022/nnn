        <p>I don't think Biden is a patsy or as "senile" as he appears. This is all a play act. Fauci and Biden are probably high ranking members of whatever club these degenerates are a part of. </p>
<p>It's a pretty big club, too, and we're not in it.</p>

        <p>Well, <em>someone</em> has serve as the target for all the US citizens' wrath during this shit show we're experiencing. By calling Biden a patsy, I'm not claiming that the NWO is screwing him over. I'm claiming that Biden is a willing patsy playing a part of which he's fully aware.  </p>
<p>I agree that if the NWO exists, that Fauci and Biden are both loyal members. </p>
<p>IMO, the NWO certainly wouldn't want it's best and brightest to be "at the helm" and take the fall for our entire global system failing. They'd use someone who has already shown themselves to be loyal to them for decades, who is already ready to step aside and retire, but who can serve in one last mission in which their reputation can be sacrificed, since the end of their usefulness to the group is looming on the horizon, anyway.</p>
<p>Or, if <em>that</em> person can't maintain the semblance of coherence long enough to fulfill their duties, then the job of sacrificing their reputation falls to their second in command, whose political future and usefulness to the group was never going to amount to anything stellar anyway.</p>

        <p>Ah, okay. Thanks for clarifying, and yes, I agree with this assessment.</p>
<p>I do believe Biden, to some extent, understands what he's doing and what the plan is. The dementia people joke about, I believe, is faked and he's just toying with us. As in, us, the "conspiracy theorists". </p>
<p>Same with Fauci and his "flip flopping". He's not an idiot. He and Biden are just played off as "morons who don't know anything" but they are feeding into the misinformation and contradictory information campaign meant to further divide the populace.</p>
