    <strong>There's no one to talk to about any of this. [except online]</strong>
    <p><p>I have been withdrawing from people thinking why bother? I can't talk about anything I know or feel except online. I can talk to husband but the Covid disciples with their blind obedience are constantly bragging of their shots to him. They are all falling like dominoes.</p>
<p>I don't feel the same about people anymore. Facebook is a big joke. I have been so isolated for a year and half, I know it psychologically has affected me. If they don't care about the kids and basically have traumatized them and now are poisoning them with the Covid vaxx no one is going to care about a disabled old lady who had all her social groups and outlets shut down. I have escaped into books gardening and other hobbies.</p>
<p>I am beyond disappointed with people. I do have to live in secrecy. I lost a few friends even from my anonymous blog, those with access to it, and have to stay quiet. In real life, I can't talk about any of my feelings with these people around here. I don't know if it is because this is a more affluent community or what is wrong here but something is off. I have never seen such a conformist place in my life. </p>
<p>I know some of you feel safe enough and have lives where there are people allied with you on this but there is no one in my area here. Husband is supportive but I fear the pressures he is getting from all the zombies. I wish they would shut up about their damn shots. Some of us are in complete isolation on multiple levels.</p>
<p>Everyone is acting here like everything is okay. I feel like I am being gaslighted to death. To survive mentally I just go inward and focus on art, spirituality and other things.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do. While I have husband convinced of the problems with the vaccines, I worry in the long run. He is a leftist like me and in that world to understand the influences. I even said to him while crying today, [I am upset over the one person who had problems] "What if they make this shit mandatory?" He said, "That will never happen",</p>
<p>Hey I find myself hoping he is right and my conspiracy and bible prophecy past has influenced me so much, but then inside I think no the lines already been crossed, nothing will ever be the same, the things I am thinking.</p></p>

        <p>I read your post. I don't think you should call yourself a leftist, you seem like you just lean left but not a leftist. The leftists are people who prioritize following and obeying government rules and following trends of the popular mainstream media above all else. The leftist ideology believes that people who have opinions contrary to mainstream media are bad and should be shamed/persecuted.</p>

        <p>I could be your classic moderate but then I hate the centrist DNC, and have a few views considered ultra progressive, but why even label myself for a corrupt broken system. Barely any of it means anymore to me. Watching leftists adapt the mainstream makes me want to puke. I can't go right wing either, not going to happen. Was correct during my conspiracy days when I said both wings of the same poisonous bird. I think I am done with politics. Don't care anymore.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you got redpilled. Head on over to /pol/ and click on shit with ridiculous titles you'd never want anyone knowing you'd ever read and become amazed at how much sense it makes and how much statistical backing whatever you're reading has. It's not your fault that you went liberal until recently, that was (((their))) goal, which has been achieved through indoctrination in school, media and advertising. If you have kids, this was inevitable. You'll be happy to know that conservatives have higher IQ's than liberals by an average of 5pts, so you're undoubtedly smarter than your dipshit neighbors who drive around or go for walks wearing masks.</p>

        <p>There is no left or right anymore, there are only those who see what is going on and those who do not or do not want to.  There are plenty on both sides out here who feel just like you.  If the people around you have already been vaxxed there is no reason to discuss it, shake your head when they say they have, make no further comment regarding it and move on to a new topic.  They have already chosen their path no reason to argue that.  If you want to be around them, be around them.  If you don't want to be around them don't.  Bring your group in until it is just the people you care about being around.  Keep your faith!!!</p>

        <p>Yeah more and more left and right are meaningless to me and more so as terms too. I am avoiding topic of Covid and vaccination, change the topic, don't talk about it. It will go to a bad place. Yeah I figure whats done is done, why bother discussing it. I don't feel like being around them out of concerns over spike proteins but in general how close could I really be? Some are nice people so it's a shame.  Socially I may give up. I've lost too many people to moves, to death, groups shut down. I may be happier taking the pressure off myself. For whatever reason a social life or having people I could relate to failed in this life. I could blame my autism, but I was happy in some places and had some connections that were later lost. I just keep meeting more of the same people. I don't expect ideology tests in friends but sadly that favor didn't get returned often. I don't understand or relate to most people especially after all this happened and I'm tired.</p>

        <p>Hope you don't lose your job. I feel like they set up the work rules to add to the oppression, all that at-will employment so one can't fight back. Sorry to hear you are isolated too and family lined up. I have lost a few friends and have avoided the subject with most knowing ostracization would come, I think some have noticed me withdrawing but then maybe not. I know this is scary isn't it.

        <p>Thank you, maybe it'll be a blessing in disguise if I get let go. Maybe I'll become a permanent hermit in the forest. LOL! </p>
<p>I've known for a long time sinister, insidious malevolent forces run the world from behind the scenes. One rule that I always followed is that whoever is the poster boy for a particular issue is not the one pulling the strings. Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci, and a slew of other characters that we see on TV aren't the main villains. </p>
<p>I think we're going to be in a long-drawn out battle for way of life. Our very souls are at stake here, and I do hope more people wake-up to the deception befallen planet Earth. </p>
<p>I hope your days at work and life in general will be pleasant and okay. You have a community here that will be your pillar, so if you need to vent, then vent away. I'm all ears. :) </p>
<p>DM me anytime. 👍🙏</p>

        <p>I believe this world is run by evil people. I have the Christian fundamentalist past but now even with different religious beliefs, I see this place was run by the evil still. Maybe the people with archon beliefs are on to something. I wonder why this planet always defaults to evil as well, there definitely seem to be "controllers" with malevolent intents.  Oh definitely Bill Gates and Fauci are just front men. Even Gates is getting exposed. They could be throwaways one day. I think they are destroying life as we know it. They want human slaves and they want freedom of spirit and spontaneity destroyed. I believe religion itself can be used as a control matrix too so my spiritual beliefs I know are maybe unusual so it's weird I know that I see the vaxx as a "mark of the beast" too but I really do. I hope people wake up too. I feel like people are even being hypnotized or something, maybe via the media.  I am trying to seek out the pleasant things I can, and glad I have husband though I don't have anyone else, my groups are friendly but I can't be close and open about this matter. Thanks for offers to DM. :)</p>

        <p>I think you might like Gab as a social network if you're losing lots of accounts. I know I love it there. I really understand what you mean too. I've never been so disappointed with my own species before last year when they all just rolled over onto their backs in submission. It angers me.</p>

        <p>Exactlyyyyyy!!!! At first they were showing people dying and heaving and puffing and agonizing on their backs in China. Like... The big thing!  </p>
<p>And here? I just see people with face diapers on them. In their cars, in their yards, in public, even all alone. I don't see no one on their backs, wheezing and puffing and coughing. I just see brainwashed people everywhere, but no actual threat or danger. It's all about compliance, not a virus.</p>

        <p>Your not alone we're a legion they keep us apart to prevent revolution. I never felt right about the world I saw even as a child it always felt like a staged play. Don't give up and don't fret. Anytime you need someone to speak to please message me as this is apart of the fear and misery the Lucieferians promote. Unfortunately the plot if this play is about to turn ultra dark. Also unfortunate anyone at a certain success level is complicit in the Eugenicist Genocidal agenda of the Saturnalian Death Cult.

Husband and I have immediate family close by that are on the same page as us but not a lot of friends (also a lot of our friends have kids and are just doing their own thing) One thing I found helpful is traveling to an area with more people that are on the same page as you if that is a possibility. It really helps to see that there are others out there that feel the same way you do, life is still going on, and the earth has continued to spin as it always has. <br>
You're not alone, and don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise :)</p>

        <p>That's a good idea to travel to an area with more people on my page, maybe in same state. I know it would help me a lot to meet people on the same page in person. I am disappointed with my friends [online and elsewhere] in a way that is hard to articulate. I left things at "it's your own personal choice" and did not want to lose more friends over politics but if someone is going to obey the system to the extent, it's hard for me. I know some people are living life in the old way. I'm so isolated. I wish I could talk husband into looking at other options, I really do. I know he's tired and worries.</p>

        <p>Where my husband and I live there's a lot of people who are not on the same page as us, and after a while it does get to us. So we drive 1.5 hours to visit my parents for a weekend where people are more so "going about life as normal" or "life as it was before 2020" ha and it's so refreshing to see. I also hate to lose friends over politics, and I don't want to put anyone in a box solely based on their political views just like how I wouldn't want it done to me. That being said, to be very honest with you and based off my observations after traveling around this past year, it sounds like you're living in a very blue area and people with more of the mindset you're looking for tent to be in red areas. Obviously that's a generalization, there's all types everywhere. But maybe this proves that political views really are more of a spectrum and there's still room to meet in the middle on some of these things  :) (if that makes sense)</p>

        <p>I'm becoming more apolitical. I regret I judged people on the right and agree with them now and there were a few lost friendships. I lost people too from my side where I wanted to stay friends with them but they dumped me. I am scared now to open my mouth as there would be MORE lost friends so I am exhausted honestly.  I think this area is very blue, the Republicans here too are very affluent...[I am on the lower end of the scale but this is a very affluent area] and they all believe in "The system" because well these are professional types the system has rewarded. I think I was happier in a far more working class place, I never got used to the formality of people here.  We are leftists [but what does that label mean anymore among these medical dictatorship authoritarians?]  so it's weird I would rather be in a red state. I could go travel to a few small towns that definitely have be on the "red side" of things.</p>

        <p>I agree with what you're saying. If this year has proven anything, it is that both political sides are the wings of the same bird. We never had a ton of trust in the government but now we really don't. I don't even trust our state government not to shut down again this fall as soon as the next "scary flu or bug" comes alone. And things here are just finally starting to open up again. And yes, we generally don't bring up politics in public either, I guess you could say we are conservatives (not repuiblican and definitely not libral) but as you said, at this point it's hard to say what any of those titles really mean any more. </p>
<p>Definitely look up some cute small towns near you and maybe make a day or over night trip! The further from a major urban area probably the better ha. It seems people in "small town usa" are more so going about life as it was and it's a breath of fresh air :)</p>

        <p>Thank you. I agree about visiting some small towns. I live in a more medium size town, glad it is not a metropolis. Yeah what's going to keep the govt from shutting things down constantly? Glad you relate on both parties being wings of the same bird, yeah the labels barely mean anything anymore. I think I need some day trips, I may go to some little towns not that far from me, under 1,000 in population.</p>

        <p>I've been wondering this myself (about continued shutdowns). What is going to happen come fall/winter and flu season when things get "scary" again? Things are just starting to open up here in MI and I'm sure as hell not gunna sit around for another lockdown. MIOSHA actually submitted an approval to have our mandates made permanent (basically put on the books to whip out of their butts when they or the governor see fit) and it actually got 1/2 way through approval before it was thrown out Thank God. But yea, will "new varients" or a whole new bug (they're already reporting on h1n03 or something) cause this whole shit show again? I pray not and hopefully enough people are wise enough to not let it happen again. As for small towns, the one my parents live in (where life is fairly normal) has a population of a little over 4000 if that gives you any reference ha</p>

        <p>Michigan is one of the worse. I think if another shut down happens, small business outside of some take outs and necessary places like car repair places are going to be toast. I think making the mandates permanent is crazy. I am glad it got thrown out. Yeah I saw the bird flu, hell they could come up with something new every 10 minutes.  Glad your parents are in a more normal small town. That has to be a relief.</p>

        <p>Oh for sure, they've already said over 1/3 of MI small businesses had to shut their doors and likely for good. Exactly, I mean why stop now hey walking outside could kill you soooo lets never leave the house again lol. But yes, highly recommend taking a weekend trip if you can. And I know it's tough when you feel like you don't have friends to interact with, and how do you even make friends as a "grown up"? lol I feel like it's so hard! Hey, at least we didn't have to try dating over this past year lol yikes</p>

        <p>Yeah Michigan is in bad shape and that's a lot of small businesses that are gone. Don't give them any ideas, soon they will make it illegal to be outside. Thanks about trip. I may have to stick to day trips but that would be nice, just to go somewhere more sane and rural. One small town, it's close by. I may even eat lunch there. I know that place is pretty "backwoods", it reminded me of my old small town the few times I was there.  I meet people online who tell me they have no local friends, community really has broken up in the USA. It is hard. Glad I am married, can't imagine how hellish dating is now. If you are single and want small town rural people.....try Farmersonly.com</p>

        <p>I dropped Facebook and stopped watching news. Stand by your views and resist the pressure as long as you can. The world is still turning. Reject this new normal and enjoy the sun on your face.</p>

        <p>I'm done with news. Turned it all off. Don't care anymore. It's all lies. With Facebook, I have contact with a few friends there I don't want to end and one group I admin but my wall is deader than a doornail.  I need more time outside and need some real local friends, not sure how I am going to make the latter happen.</p>
