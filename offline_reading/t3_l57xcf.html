    <strong>Social distancing &amp; mask have ruined my college life</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a very introverted person and didn’t have much friends in High School so I thought things would be different when I moved away to college. My university has canceled every social activity &amp; clubs. I have a harder time finding people I can relate too without knowing that we both have a common interest (Ex: if I joined a club then I would have known that all these other people in said club have the same passion for it) but now I can’t. I have to sit a full seat away from anyone during time in the classroom and everyone sounds so muffled it’s hard to hear what they’re saying. I hate this college experience and I have yet to meet anyone.</p></p>
