    <strong>So sick of seeing restaurants and bars vilified</strong>
    <p><p>I'm pretty sure we've all seen the comments from doomers:</p>
<p>"Well maybe if  SELFISH people weren't out partying at  CROWDED BARS we'd be over this by now!" </p>
<p>"I can't believe people are out at restaurants during a pANdEmIc!"</p>
<p>In addition to media articles saying how risky and dangerous local restaurants are while miraculously Target and the ilk are not.</p>
<p>I'm in NY and we have some of the most ridiculous rules when it comes to bars/restaurants, especially the one where you must order food to get a drink. The establishments are bending over backwards following the rules because if you don't you'll lose your liquor license. But somehow people are still terrible for going to bars/restaurants because "muh cases". </p>
<p>I lost my restaurant job where I was making about $500 a week from 3 shifts. I did manage to get a new job where I am happy at but because of capacity restrictions, I am lucky if I make $100 on a Saturday night. </p>
<p>I'm so sick of hearing blame piled on local small businesses who are struggling so hard to survive. It's maddening.</p></p>

        <p>It really should show just how arbitrary and worthless these decrees actually are. And yes, businesses are being extorted into playing along, but they have to either be part of the solution or they will continue to be part of the problem.</p>

        <p>Genuinely curious, how is a business supposed to fight back? It's a $10k fine if you break the rules plus possible loss of a liquor license. Additionally, many places lost tons of income between March and June- many did not open for takeout at all since it was too hard to break even. Other than a bit of snark on social media, I'm not sure how a place can get away with much right now. Again, I respect where you are coming from and am curious what can be done.</p>

        <p>Agreed that they are in a hard spot. I'm not sure exactly how this ends.  First thing people could do is take the ADA tack, as in "if you don't have a mask on, I will assume you have a medical condition that exempts you from wearing one, and that due to the ADA I'm not allowed to challenge it." We don't enforce masking in our retail shops, due to safety issues. Too much tension abounds and asking checkout clerks to do that would be akin to chasing down shoplifters. Too dangerous and well above their pay grade. One doesn't have to be SS to be nominally a nazi. (bad example, good analogy. There's a difference between going along to get along and being a zealot.)</p>

        <p>Exactly, if this virus is SO DANGEROUS that I need to wear a mask to walk into a restaurant, then it is so dangerous that the restaurant shouldnt be open at all.</p>
<p>The fact that you dont have to wear a mask while seated proves that this is all nonsense.</p>

        <p>My mom, stepdad and I made reservations at a pub-type restaurant a couple weeks ago. We got there and my stepdad said he forgot his mask. My mom said just cover your face with your shirt because it’s only a short walk to the patio and then the table. My mom and I DID have masks. </p>
<p>We get to the patio and the server refuses to seat us because “masks are required,” she said. My mom said well he just forgot his mask. The server said “We really do encourage masks.” (Well you can’t require them and encourage them at the same time, so which is it?) I had also given my name for our reservation. Again. Two of the three of us were masked and we were still refused service. My stepdad had to go home to get a mask before we could go anywhere else, but we ended up at a restaurant where we had a nice meal and good service. The pub place will never get our business again.</p>

        <p>Yep - it's past my tolerance threshold to have to mask up to walk to the table or go to the bathroom, but sitting at the table it's fine to go without. So much obvious security theater that I can't suspend disbelief to think that this might just be helping something.</p>

        <p>My boomer coworker that has spent the last 40 years of his life living in excess in bars and restaurants keeps snidely telling me to not go to the bar. When he was my age I’m pretty sure he was in a bar 5 nights per week. Now that he’s 200 pounds overweight and at risk he tries to make me feel guilty for going out and tries to scare me about getting COVID. It’s all so ironic.</p>

        <p>It astounds me that people don't see these "protective measures" as 100% security theater and nothing more.</p>
<p>I've said this before, but imagine being so privileged (one of their favorite trigger words) that you cannot see what a hit these security theatrics are taking on so many people. It's not "just a mask," and they keep reverting to that shit because the actual magnitude of the repercussions of this never-ending circus is not something they are ever willing to admit.</p>

        <p>Isn't it absolutely obvious that the measures aren't helping when they see people doing things like pulling down their masks to talk to someone, or to drink, or worn around their chins?

        <p>Agree.  There are so many people on the west coast who accost people for daring to question masks or lockdowns and have published the name and phone numbers of business owners who dared to open up, urging others to harass them....then they whine about their instacart guy not getting the right kind of cheerios or that they weren't able to be the only human on their running path that morning.

<p>I went to a bar yesterday to watch football and I ordered a second beer (that I barely drank) just to take a photo of me and my drink <em>clearly inside a bar</em> and posted it to FB with “Yay football season!” I’m sure my FB crowd is <em>full</em> of judgy people looking down their noses at me, but nobody had to guts to shame me for it.

        <p>Here's a fun info-nugget.  In CA, they opened indoor dining for about 2 weeks back in May.  It's been closed every since those few precious weeks.  Cases continued to climb, even with indoor dining and bars closed.  There wasn't even any real contact-tracing effort devoted to analyzing the effects bars/restaurants were having on the case numbers.  They just pretended that was the reason, with no evidence.</p>

        <p>PA didn’t re-close indoor dining but they cut capacity back from 50 to 25% due to a “surge” that they claimed was coming from bars and restaurants. When restaurant owners asked for the data and to meet with the Wolf administration, the administration said they didn’t have the data but contact tracing proved it. I certainly don’t think it’s unreasonable to show numbers that justify your decision but Wolf hasn’t exactly been transparent for months now.</p>

        <p>I took my daughter clothes shopping yesterday at a big department store. She has grown a lot and I’m not sure what size she wears now so she wanted to try everything on. We get an armful of clothes and head to the dressing room but it’s blocked off with a sign saying “closed for your safety”. Huh? I might as well buy online, at least I can check a size chart, check reviews and do free returns. We stuck the clothes on a rack, left and ordered her clothes on Amazon instead. </p>
<p>Another dumb thing is only one store entrance was open. So more people are crowded into a smaller space? So fucking stupid.</p>

Luckily there's no mask mandate in pubs or restaurants anywhere in the UK so its literally just normal other than paper menus. Feels good tbh just wish clubs were open.</p>

        <p>Honestly; if they are making their employees wear masks, I hope they go out of business. Fuck them. I hope someone with half a brain buys out their space and re-hires the employees who lost their job due to this idiocy.</p>
<p>It's one thing for these doomers to deem mask-wearing acceptable for 15-min - hour at a time, but for 8-12 hours straight? Go straight to hell. For the record I disagree with all mask-wearing because society wearing a mask for 15min intervals is pushing these idiots to mandate it to their employees. The mask-zealots are about to get REALLY fucking sick this fall, they have been depriving their immune system of vital practice for months now so they are about to get sicker than they have ever been in their lives; not with covid since it doesn't exist(hasn't been isolated STILL!) but with everything else. Good luck to everyone, hope you've been giving your immune system vital practice during this whole thing.</p>
