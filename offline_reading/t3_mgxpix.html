        <p>Not exactly. Obviously Covid has Jacome a political issue, doesn’t mean the person doesn’t believe in the science. Acknowledging climate change may be politicized, doesn’t dismiss the science. And finally, talking about a conspiracy doesn’t automatically make them a conspiracy theorist.</p>
