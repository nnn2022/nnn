        <p>This info has been out there for months, but has been ignored by the mainstream. Maybe they are going back now that the vaccine is being rolled out so it looks like less cases.</p>
<p>Just like how they very recently and very quietly went back on the hydroxychloroquine treatment now that Trump is out of office.</p>

<p>Not a Trump supporter by the way, not even American, but not at all happy with the constant lies and deceit.</p>

        <p>The very sad truth is that most average people are lemmings. They seem to think if there was any problem then there would be outrage in the media. Like the media wouldn't lie to them.</p>
<p>The majority are parroting shit they heard on the news or shit they heard from other people, and somehow they believe they are in the know.
They will ask for proof of what you tell them and they will ignore the proof when presented to them. </p>
<p>I have no hope for anything anymore. I know if everyone wakes up we can stop the few that are controlling us, but little can be done by yourself. 
I truly cannot see any change for the better coming.</p>

<p>I believe you are correct, here. People are way too trusting.</p>
<p>This would certainly be a bombshell story for anyone who wants to do some good investigative reporting. I could see NYT or 60 minutes possibly doing it. Anyone else would be ignored. Perhaps something like this will happen after the inauguration?</p>

        <p>With the heavy censorship that's become the norm this year, I highly doubt it, but I hope so.
I don't know what the agenda is but it's clear there is one. I think even if someone reported a bombshell story like this, reuters or politifact or some other Bill Gates funded "fact checker" would have it debunked pretty soon.</p>
<p>That's another thing I can't believe this year, these fact checkers rarely show proof of their statement, but somehow are the ministry of truth.
We literally live in a pretend society.</p>

        <p>Exactly, that's why the WHO is publishing this just as the vaccines roll out. Flu season will generate genuine cases too.</p>

        <p>That's what irritates me tbh, we're in flu season.... 'the hospitals are overwhelmed', if one was to compare them to previous years they are in line with the same capacity for this time of year... Hospitals don't keep their lights on by being half empty</p>

        <p>So my basic understanding is that the longer they leave the test the more positive results they are going to be?</p>
<p>I don't speak doctor whatsoever and if someone can translate to human please do so</p>

        <p>The more cycles you do the, less relevant the outcome. It's magnification to point where you will detect something and it's a false positive.</p>
<p>Basically if you have the virus, if should be found within 10-20 cycles. 30 at a push but that's trace amounts. They are going as far as 45.</p>

        <p>The test amplifies DNA of interest, easier for a human to work with 1microgram of DNA than 100 atoms, it doubles what you are looking for if it's there in an exponential manner with each cycle. So from 1copy -&rt;2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384 copies of the DNA string  &amp;c... </p>
<p>If the cut off to test positive is let's say <strong>20000 copies by step 10</strong> you'd need to start of with 20 or so strings of DNA (and let's suppose that 1 string of dna is 1 virus).</p>
<p>Then again if you have just 1 string (as 1 virus) you could get the same result if you let it run 14 cycles instead of ten. </p>
<p>Someone with only trace amounts of viral DNA (who may have been exposed but their body fought it off  and controlled it in an afternoon) would then test positive for the  virus.</p>
