        <p>nothing. that's the worst part. everyone is so concerned about grandma that they're forgetting that they're messing over a whole generation's future. I'm one of those people that will most probably suffer from the economic collapse that is going on. not only that, but the mental health consequences that are going to occur. depression rates are already high right now, but in the future it's going to soar in a pretty chilling way. sometimes I feel like screaming at these people what they're selfishness has done to people like me. It's difficult being optimistic as time passes by. however, I'm not going to hurt myself because of their selfish behaviour.</p>
