    <strong>How representative would you say reddit is for people's opinions on lockdown?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been browsing the UK covid sub and other national subs and I'm really hoping they aren't representative.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think Reddit is representative of people's real world opinions on the lockdown. On reddit, I see a ton of people saying they barely left the house since March, won't see their family unless outside, distanced and with masks, etc. I don't know anyone in real life who is still maintaining that kind of isolation. I think most people are following the mask order and feeling like they are saving lives but still going about life as normal - go on vacations, see friends and family, go out to eat, ect. They just wear a mask everywhere. This mask bullshit needs to end. Sadly, I think it will be the very last thing to go.</p>

        <p>Are most people in the U.K. for lockdown now? It’s funny I was on there in Feb/March and most people were against it.</p>

        <p>I feel like most are indifferent to it, or comply because they have too.  There’s still a lot of people going to the pub and other activities but the way I’ve heard people talking about second lockdowns, second waves etc it seems like things that they are either expecting or are fine with it.  I’ve heard a few people talk about the economic impact but it’s rare.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I come from a place where people are really really over it and the official rules are pretty lax. I guess it’s because we’re poor and have real problems xd. I’ve just arrived in the UK a few days ago and the guy who drove us home handed us leaflets about covid rules when we arrived and refused to get too close to us. He even wanted to tell us to keep one seat apart in the bus and then remember that we are the same family. At home the heat wasn’t working so we asked a guy to come over and repair it. I talked with the guy’s son and he said that it’s “better to stay at home during this time”, complained that people aren’t taking the rules seriously and mentioned a woman with a child running away from him in a shop because he wasn’t keeping the 2m distance. A neighbor told my Mom to stay home when she was walking over a couple of meters in front of our house to take something from the car/try to start the car/talk to this man about shopping for food. People are really scared. I was too. I was trying to convince my parents to stay home during the lockdown. 2 months, nothing happened. When the lockdown was over I wanted to keep staying at home and my Dad told me that I was crazy. So I went out, paranoid about the distance at first, but I soon got over it. I attended large events (distanced to be fair) weekly, where there was singing involved. I regularly went out with small groups of friends and even been to a crowded place once or twice (granted, by accident). I used public transport, sparingly, but I did use it. All of this was for 4 months. And nothing happened. I live with two high-risk people, one of them was the one that pushed me to live a normal life in the first place. Guess what, nothing happened to any of us.  And the infection rate was much higher than it was in the UK. Those 4 months cured me of my covid fear and made me more accepting of our mortality. I am getting the general impression that the UK needs the same therapeutic experience. I hope that I am wrong and that most people are over it here too.</p>

        <p>Not very at all. For example, the Australia sub is insane. Doesn't represent reality at all. I think a certain type are attracted to this platform and to participate in the covid nonsense here.</p>

        <p>In the Bay Area, I’d say it doesn’t accurately portray the actual experience (many friends are really depressed) but it does accurately portray the support. It’s infuriating. I’ve found some closet skeptics but not many.</p>
