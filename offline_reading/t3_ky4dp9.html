    <strong>If a true pandemic happen, what would you do and which laws would you support?</strong>
    <p><p>I think I and others on this subreddit can be agree in that the world overreacted to COVID19, and the lockdown and restrictions were unnecessary. They did more harm than good like affecting the economy, education and mental health negatively. COVID19 has over 99,9% survival chance and most experience mild, flu like symptoms. The cure was worse than the disease.</p>
<p><strong>But I'm wondering what you would do if a true pandemic happen. Example like Ebola, 1918 flu, the plague etc.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What would you do? Take precaution or live normally - and risk it?</li>
<li>Which laws and solutions would you support?</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: I'm asking out of pure curiosity. I'm against the COVID19 lockdown and restrictions.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t see the reason to legislate anything in nature of a pandemic. </p>
<p>If a real, perhaps deadly pandemic broke out, I think people would actually take that seriously, and decide for themselves whether or not they want to risk to hang out and see people (as it should be - a choice).</p>
<p>If coronavirus was so bad, I’d certainly be dead by now.</p>

        <p>If it was a real pandemic, almost everyone would know someone who was affected by it and we would see much more visible changes in our lives. The numbers of deaths would be much higher. We wouldn't need a government that constantly sent fearmongering 24/7 to know it was a pandemic. It's only in "pandemics" that aren't really dangerous we need the constant reminder to know it's one.</p>
<p>If people didn't wear masks and society didn't lockdown, I wouldn't have known COVID19 existed and assumed it was just another flu.</p>

        <p>As an anarchist I can only support voluntary associations and the authorities of knowledge and service, not compulsory mandates and patronised authority. People would be free to obey their own will: stay and accept the rules of their own community, formed by a consensus of experienced do-ers, or leave to find another. Anything that doesn't provide for this is guaranteed to be a flustercuck, as we've seen.</p>
<p>As a Christian I'd have to obey the commission: visit the sick; feed the hungry; welcome the stranger. So, I'd probably catch the plague. We can't live forever. Well, not on Earth.</p>

        <p>From what I have seen from this ScamDemic (the total, arbitrary usurpation of our rights), I don't believe governments can be trusted with these types of powers. They will always abuse them, and try to maintain and increase them - forever.</p>
<p>The camel doesn't just have it's nose under the tent, it's laying on the couch drinking your beer and banging your wife.</p>
<p>Your God-given rights are either absolute, or they do not exist at all. Any right that can be taken away at the stroke of a pen isn't a right at all - it's a privilege.</p>

        <p>thats a great question and why this drawn out bullshit is such a waste of capital, energy and motivation.  Everyone including my cynical conspiracy thinking self locked down willingly in march, because the existential threat ranged from bad to unknown.  Thats where this trick will always work because it takes us all a year to figure out otherwise.  yes the diamond princess cruise gave us a look in, but the emphasis that was placed on this being a novel sars like bug made us have to do something, because wolf was cried.  crying wolf by the leaders of the world almost always works.  its only nearing governmental breakdown that it doesnt.  democracy is a peacetime thing, once a crisis breaks out, we are at the mercy of the rulers/leaders/officials.</p>

        <p>I'd still go to work but I'd go out for unnecessary reasons less often.</p>
<p>I do not support any restrictive laws no matter how high the IFR is. I would be OK with some other measures that don't violate human rights, like loosening regulations on who can work in certain health care jobs, increasing funding to hospitals to expand capacity and hire new workers, and explicitly temporary subsidies for manufacturing PPE.</p>
