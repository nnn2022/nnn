        <p>They really don’t. Face masks/gaiters are disgusting .... people take them on and off all the time and put them on tables in coffee shops, shove them in bags and pockets .... they are so unhygienic. I thought we were supposed to be touching our faces less ... now everybody touches their face more than ever. That’s how everyone gets sick at the same time and then there are more  ‘cases’! Wash your hands often any time you are out and then again when you get home. Be safe out there.</p>

<p>No mask fanatic will answer what level of COVID spread leads to masks no longer being required.</p>

        <p>This is the main reason I attribute how slowly cases* have fallen in Texas compared to its Sun Belt counterparts like Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia, and Florida. We're the only state of of the 5 to have a mask mandate, and Florida especially is known for its high elderly population, but they're doing better than Texas. I work in retail, so I should know just how often people are touching their faces with the masks. The few who don't almost never touch their faces. Funny how that works when you don't have an itchy piece of cloth on your face!</p>
<p>*Not to mention how unscientific the testing procedure is. I've done PCR before, which is one of the main testing methods, and I can tell you that 37-40 cycles is too much, you only need 25-30, maybe as high as 33 to get an accurate idea of what is going on. The false positive rate is in the 40-90% range, depending on the region you're in and their PCR standards.</p>
