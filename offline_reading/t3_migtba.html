        <p>At first I was vigilant and ordered masks and gloves and stuff to keep my family safe.  As time went on, I started to question why in a pandemic, no one I knew was sick.  It went beyond that and no one I knew knew anyone who had died of the virus. That doesn't mean much, statistically, but I still thought it odd.  </p>
<p>Then, I noticed that the places I was going for work were not taking any of this serious.  SC, Georgia, Florida...   no one really cared about the masks or anything beyond a token cloth mask in stores.  </p>
<p>And, over a year and some months, these states stayed the same or relaxed more.  </p>
<p>So, I went down the rabbit hole and now I'm just like, "well maybe  it is about control. Fuck."</p>

        <p>Back in March 2020, when my investment portfolio lost 40% overnight, I had such a severe and violent reaction to it I began uncontrollably quivering and sobbing. I've NEVER had a reaction so intense for anything in my life. I knew right then and there something MASSIVE was wrong, and I immediately did a deep dive into the mechanics of the financial markets so I could figure out what was truly happening. Turns out my worst fears were realized. The data proves we had a massive global economic collapse, and then once I began hearing allllllll the intense pushing of Coronavirus and worldwide lockdowns, I began looking into that even more. The more I studied, the stranger things became. I'm now 100% convinced that the COVID-19 pandemic was created to cover up the collapse and they're now trying to bring in a new world order by way of Central Bank Digital Currencies. The only way they can make all of humanity agree to such an intense power grab of "absolute control" (their words, not mine) is for force everyone to suffer in starvation or poverty, then the banks will come in to "rescue" us once we beg for salvation in the form of their totalitarian government control. I truly wish I were joking.</p>

        <p>Have you looked much in to the world economic forum and the discussion held at Davos? How they truly want people to own nothing and be happy about it. The worlds richest people, owners of the largest most diverse companies, world leaders, all want to be in sole possession of world resources and loan them out to the public. Not to mention the largest transfer of wealth since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The rich have got richer and the middle class and poor have lost</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely!! I've been studying the World Economic Forum for quite a while now. It’s important to know your enemy so you can fight back appropriately. It’s so fucked up!! And they are telling US it’s time for the system to be fairer. It will be perfectly fair when everyone except them have zero. Totally level playing field, except for the top 1%.</p>

        <p>The good news is there is a real way to fight this new system: it’s by buying the only asset in the world that's still undervalued. Silver. Pure .9999 fine silver, specifically. It’s cheaper than literally any other time in human history. And it has a natural supply limit that cannot be recreated in a lab or printed into existence the way paper currencies have been. What's more is, take Venezuela: a single ounce of silver can feed a family of four for an entire month. Yet its fundamental value is almost 600x the spot price. It’s literally the opportunity of 50 lifetimes.</p>
