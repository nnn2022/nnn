        <p>This is all about the elites toying with the public. A part of it just blatant selfishness, like what many of the virtue signalers do now (ex: going to a party then chastizing other people for doing the same). However, what makes this different is that they are not hiding this, they seem to be encouraging the publicization of these events. Notice how most of these politicians do not apologize for their actions either. This is because they are asserting their dominance on the populace, and they are also testing to see how outraged the majority are. Turns out not as much as they are anticipating.</p>

        <p>And the reason he didn't break the law, but those women did is: he did not drive to the location 7 miles away. </p>
<p>That is how people are defending the difference in the daily mail article lol. 
Surely on bike he would have passed far more people during his 7 mile cycle than those women would have in their cars.</p>
