    <strong>Pro-maskers will only pick on you if you're physically weak.</strong>
    <p><p>Just something I've noticed. I'm not a gigantic guy, but I am 6'0, shaved head, beard, with big shoulders. I never wear a mask and literally no one has ever said shit to me except a little old lady at a gas station who I respectfully told I forgot my mask in the car. She was 200 and I wasn't gonna argue with her or be disrespectful.</p>
<p>Anyways, my smaller/weaker friends though? They get shit said to them all time. Smug comments, insults, etc.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: most people are disgusting pathetic cowards who love to bully those weaker than them.</p></p>

        <p>A male feminist is a man who hears the phrase “all men are scumbags” and thinks, “sounds about right, since I’m just like that”. In truth, THEY are the predators projecting onto US.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, THAT guy. He’s pretty infamous among certain communities, and I have read about him extensively before. If I remember correctly, he once was asked to do an art commission of Samus vs Ridley, and got caught tracing it. So goes to show you what kind of person he is always going on about respect while showing none to his customers.</p>

        <p>Woke is used more often to refer to identity politics nonsense, so we don’t really use that word here except to mock the lunatics. Get Woke, Go Broke, and forcing bs Covid rules are the ultimate form of wokeness, so going broke will naturally follow.</p>

        <p>One of the things that stands out to me isn't necessarily the big things, like those Lib men who creepily and enthusiastically support prostitution, but how low the bar gets set on even the little things. So, 'women can be strong!' becomes a feminist statement, pat the 'male feminist' on the back, while I thought we were rather decades past the point that even needed pointing out to anyone but the most recalcitrant misogynist. So, what does it say when that's the kind of target they go for? It certainly doesn't seem as though they can imagine more radical feminist kinds of change, at the very least. Although it kind of looks suspiciously like the thing Libs can do where they readjust the bar for change so low they can comfortably step over it without having to make changes -coughclassissuescough- that might be more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>With some of the racist things, it does seem may be more people around who actually do/think those things, but my only reaction to lessons on microaggressions like 'Why you should not ask minorities which country they're <em>really</em> from' was to be amazed that anyone who would actually do that exists.</p>
<p>It's another of those things that gets messy with shared English-speaking internet, and the loudness of fringe groups too, because while the low bar of misogyny still exists, it's not necc. universally representative. At least, I'd prefer to think reddit generally isn't.</p>
<p>It's fascinating to watch on disability issues -which aren't cool and woke so the mask comes off faster- they always think they are the ones who get to set the bar for what not being ableist or an ally means, with no input from actual disabled people: who they seem to assume can't speak for ourselves. Tweeting a cutesy 'self care' infographic and a bunch of suicide hotlines thus counts as caring about mental illness, no need to listen to people with one talk about the negative impact of lockdowns and why 'don't be afraid to seek help!' so often isn't helpful.</p>

        <p>So called "male feminists" only care about women when it comes to gaining sexual favours from them. They'll willingly ignore the evidence that legalizing prostitution leads to more sex trafficking, they target teenage girls on TikTok and Instagram by teaching them that being promiscuous and mostly nude is somehow empowering, and they'll call any woman who dares stick up for themselves a "Karen" or "TERF". Liberal men view women as public property and only care about the young, attractive progressive ones.</p>

        <p>I would consider myself a male TERF. I am married with kids, and I want to make the world a better place for women. I am against legalizing prostitution and anything that turns a woman's body into a commodity. Feminism is an idea, and I would not consider those people to be feminists at all, they are simply using the term for ulterior motives.</p>

        <p>Most modern feminists, be they male or female, aren't feminists. I'd argue the only true form of feminism nowadays is radical, but that's taboo and will get you and your ilk banned from Reddit for hate speech.</p>

        <p>Yep proof that Reddit hates women is when the Rad Fem sub got banned. All we did was talk about radical feminism. No calls to violence or anything dangerous or harmful to others.</p>

        <p>&rt; I would not consider those people to be feminists at all,</p>
<p>Except you don't get to do that.</p>
<p>That's what's called a "no true Scotsman" fallacy.</p>
<p>The fact is, you can be a feminist and a shitty person.  And until feminists are willing to own their shittier elements, and get better representative leadership, feminism will pretty much have the same PR problem it does now.</p>
<p>(By the way, I'm a woman I want absolutely nothing to do with feminism, and strangely for a lot of the same reasons as I oppose COVID restrictions: namely, this idea that the collective and the collective identity rules over all, and individualism must be discounted in the name of the "greater good".)</p>

        <p>Yes! Completely. I look rather masculine and never get bothered. I do get bothered when I am with my gf. She says she literally only wears the mask bc men already harass her so much that she doesn't want to stand out and get additional harassment about the mask. So sad.. these people think they are progressive but they are the opposite. I often see couples with just the gf wearing a mask. Supporting things that amplify inequality? Shocker! Covering people to demean them? We have never see that before..</p>

        <p>Same happened to me. I was never anti-gun, but no one in my family owns guns, so I never considered owning one. My one friend who is a gun owner only became so after moving to Houston (from NJ) and having his life threatened one too many times (and one particular incident <em>after</em> he got a gun traumatized him). After this year, I've considered so much lately that maybe I should get one. All that's stopping me is lack of time and my fear of loud noise (a fear that came about after a Black Friday shooting in 2018, despite I never saw the shooter).</p>

        <p>I am of the belief that most people wear masks out of capitulation.  </p>
<p>You've been told that at a minimum, the price of entry is wearing a mask.  At a maximum, you're threatened with all sorts of punitive action.  </p>
<p>People tell you "wearing is caring".  But the truth is, you wouldn't need to paint over it with this "wearing is caring" bullshit if almost every other aspect of it weren't the marks of things that are far more sinister.</p>

        <p>As a young woman, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with how little I’ve been challenged when living my life maskless.  That being said, I’m pretty sure I project an air of defiance and have a resting bitch face, so that might contribute</p>

        <p>Also female.  I live in CA where people are <em>highly</em> mask compliant.  I refuse to wear a mask anywhere but indoor public spaces.  (Trust me, there's no "rebelling" here--they throw you out without fail.)  Outdoors, no mask.  I draw the line.  And weirdly, people are very friendly toward me.  Even masked people will go out of their way to talk to me when I'm out walking.  I'm hardly young or pretty, so I think it's because people want to talk to someone whose face looks normal.</p>

        <p>I wonder if that one worked because they're prejudiced and scared of autistic people? I'm a titchy and actually disabled woman, and in the one confrontation I've had, explaining that I have a -legit- medical exemption didn't work  to get the guy to back down at all, even when I explained that it's facial nerve damage that can make wearing masks painful, and not even when I added that I've <em>had</em> covid. But if it's something they understand as physical like nerve damage then it doesn't make ableist people nervous in the way a neurological condition like autism or mental illness -got that too so I see the difference in treatment between the two kinds of condition- can sometimes do. Unless it's covid, possibly.</p>

        <p>I’m a 5’0 woman, and have only ever been picked on by... (wait for it...) other women. Usually around in their 20s/30s. I’m not sure if I look physically weak- not gonna lie, I’m not as fit as I was before this and got a little fluffy!, but these Karen Juniors follow me around the stores and try to police what I’m doing and all that- the worst is the ones who tell me I need to go home and stuff... but they’re at the mall, too? </p>
<p>Older people- hell even younger people who have kids- are 100% over it, and could care less if you’re masked/following distancing. Some of them are doing it, and seem to be confident enough in their choices they’re not pushing it on others, I guess because they all know there’s more important things in life? </p>
<p>My go- to is to simply ignore them, when I’m shopping alone I usually listen to music anyway so I will take out my headphone and try to be polite and say “sorry I missed that, can you repeat-“ (i’m Canadian haha... polite to the death), and if they get pushy, I’ll ask if they work there (they hate that! Even though we’re supposed to worship essential workers lol) and then I’ll find someone who does and inform them “there’s someone who is harassing customers in this area of your store.” </p>
<p>Kindness really kills, guys, if you have the capacity for it- be nice and polite in this way. People expect if you are not wearing a mask, distancing or following some other dumb regulations that you want a fight. Show them that’s not the case and very quickly many people just treat you as a human again and not a threat.</p>

<p>So true - if you are a critical thinker for some time you are likely accustomed to it. </p>
<p>But if one takes a moment to fundamentally think about how absolutely fucked up and despicable it is, to attack and bully the people who are against fascism and enslavement and speak out against these atrocities, and not only after the fact, but while they are happening, which is risky - it get's really depressing. Insult to injury.</p>

        <p>What drives them craziest is when you plainly reject their premises (that safety is the highest good, that nobody should get sick, that you should be afraid, etc).  </p>
<p>I simply say, "I'm obviously not going to change your mind, but I will not comply.  I can live with my conscience on this." They usually freak out with their standard accusations about how "YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE STILL IN THIS MESS" which clearly demonstrates how little they understand about the subject, as it's ass-backwards.</p>
<p>So, anyway, I disagree and move on.  And doomers loathe anyone who rejects their fear.  I think it convicts their hearts deep down as they are forced to acknowledge their cowardice.  They don't hate you, they hate themselves and the squishy, snivelling shells of humans they have become.  They hate their impotence.</p>

<p>You are not a free thinker! You have an objectively low IQ and are thus taken advantage of without your knowledge of it. You damn fucking idiot. You are literally too stupid to be aware of people directing your thoughts.</p>
<p>Your dumbass was told there is a grand conspiracy and you accepted it as truth because you are fucking STUPID. It is evident that you do not have critical thinking skills because calling someone a freak and a Nazi for preforming sympathetic behaviour is literally too hyperbolic for you to have done on purpose. You were told one thing, and chose to believe it regardless of evidence (because you are an imbecile). "<em>'Freethinkers" </em>' are able to be malleable with their opinions because their thoughts are not chained in a piss covered, shit smelling, built for handicapped use only cage. (in case you don't understand, I am insinuating that you and your disgustingly dogmatic ideas reside in this cage of disgust.)</p>

<p>Ohhh so you see masks as virtuous? You've clearly made a value judgement about the virtuosity of mask wearing and appear to be projecting that onto me. How's that sound, little guy? </p>
<p>&rt;Be obedient like the little slave bitch you inherently are.</p>
<p>Somebody was spanked as a child by an angry parent who didn't give them an adequate explanation as to why the punishment was being brought forth. It's okay. There's one surefire therapeutic technique that is all the rave with people with disabilities like yourself. I'll wait till the end to tell you though.</p>

        <p>I’m a 5’4” woman and I’m pregnant. This is why I’m always armed. I have been confronted a few times but I always just walk away and show my hip a bit so they can see I’m armed. When I’m with my husband they never try anything. He’s 6’4” 250 pounds, got a short beard, and we live/work on his parents’ ranch so he’s buff as fuck. We never get confronted when we’re together, probably because he could lift one of those people in the air and rip them in half.</p>

        <p>Don't flash it or pull if you don't intend to use it. That's gonna get  u capped if u do it to the wrong person. All those open carriers think they are intimidating by showing what and where they are armed ,but all they do this way is making themselves open to ambush. Now that's not such of a problem in spoiled areas ,but can cost u much in ghettos.</p>

        <p>This is why I don't like the mask zealotry.</p>
<p>They start the intimidation cycle with being a doomer, up until they're given a reason to think that COVID isn't their most immediate problem.  </p>
<p>But if someone with a gun meets someone with a bigger gun, or more people with guns, then, the escalation continues.</p>
<p>It's not right.  It's also why people should mind their own business, and if they see a real and imminent threat, they should call the police, not act like they can handle the situation better than someone who's trained to.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s on most things though. I’ve been to a handful of political events in my life and it was always women who were the bravest in getting in a man’s face and being vile because they knew odds are they won’t face consequences. Same with guys on guys. So I agree with ya. People, of all walks of life, but some more than others, are generally speaking cowards.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen multiple tall white males strutting around with no mask and no one said anything , or one time, a worker said “excuse me you need to wear a mask” and he confidently said “medical exemption” and she shut right up. 
I’m a shorter mixed race female and every time I’ve not worn a mask some lady starts SHRIEKING at me.</p>

        <p>I'm the same as you. I'm mixed race, a woman and weigh 42kg. People probably mistake for a 12 year old girl from behind but I always give as good as I get. Things has eased up a bit since I started wearing an Invisible Disabilities lanyard. They aren't going to force me into it.</p>

        <p>It’s not race baiting, it’s personal observations. Where I’m at I’ve seen tons of tall black dudes not wearing masks, no problem, but I’m a smaller white female and have had a lot of issues about people aggressively approaching me about not complying with masks. Depends on the area, I think.</p>

        <p>You know the knife license thing is a meme right? You can fashion a safe reliable and concealable sheath for a paring knife out of a piece of cardboard and some duct tape and loop it in with your belt.

        <p>Be verrrrry careful about that.... if some Karen calls the cops and says you threatened her and they show up and ask you how Karen knew you had a concealed weapon, they're gonna take the fact that you DO have a weapon as proof you did actually threaten her, and now you're getting charged with assault. </p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment and an armed society is a polite society, but I just don't want to see you get rolled up into a $60k lawsuit over something dumb like that.</p>

<p>They may can't help but be attracted to you, (and probably hate that themselves) because it's very confident and powerful to go so openly against what is demanded from everyone (and on top of that being a physically strong man).</p>

        <p>This is so true. I am targeted. </p>
<p>Im 5'2 110lb female. i have legitimately been chased down by people carrying masks trying to force me to put it on legitimately causing a scene. </p>
<p>When i am with my daughter it seems to be worse, probably because i politely tell them no. Just out of respect for my child i dont ever want her to think being rude or violent is the answer. </p>
<p>When im alone i tell them no, if they persist i tell them straight up to get the f**k away from me, if they know what's good for them.</p>
<p>I never act out of violence and i will never go out of my way to get physical, BUT</p>
<p>I'm in the best shape i could be, i know how to defend myself, i will and i have. You can't intimidate someone who has the capability and experience. </p>
<p>They don't bother after they know someone isn't afraid and won't be influenced.  </p>
<p>Refuse to wear a mask and will go down fighting lol the lot of em are all bark no bite, and they know that.</p>

        <p>I''m 5'7 150 so this is prob true as I've been asked multiple times at grocery stores and big box stores. Pei Wei told me to stand outside and call in my take-out order when I walked in to place it. The suites I'm staying at have signs everywhere but nobody has said anything to me yet. I'm expecting it eventually though when I have to interact with an employee.</p>
<p>I haven't worn a mask in a few months as I just order curbside/drivethru/online and do outdoor activities /private gatherings. I feel bad for the small businesses but I'm not participating in the religious face diaper.</p>

<p>i'm an inch taller, same weight and I while I was fine since may going into stores and college without mask, lately i've been denied service in two grocery stores. The managers who denied me were a lot smaller than me, so I don't think it was 100% a size thing. </p>
<p>Seeing as the account is 27 days old, it could or could not be some sort of shill trying to make this a size thing and therefore demoralize smaller people.</p>

        <p>Good points and a lot of the time when asked it's some doorman just checking everyone at the door so that def isn't a size thing. Seeing as it's been like 9 months now and I haven't read any stories about people suing in court due to the mask ordinances it might take mass civil disobedience , shopping in groups without masks and actually pushing them to call cops and arrest us. </p>
<p>I'm all for private property and supporting a small business's right to choose, but if it's walmart or the post office fuck right off yall in bed w/ the government as close as can be. Especially since a lot of these businesses aren't doing it for religious/person belief reasons they're explicitly denying people because the government told them they had to or they'd take their business license.</p>

        <p>100% true. I'm really into fitness and weightlifting, on the face of it you can very obviously tell that I work out. I also tend to go around in work clothes or athletic wear (maskless) and literally no one has gotten so much as rude with me in my deep blue state.</p>

        <p>I don't think this is necessarily true actually. I'm a 5'8" woman, not particularly buff or anything and no one has said much of anything. Just a few weeks ago I didn't have one in a restaurant and the waiters just said "you're too pretty to wear one anyway" lol. I don't think I'm pretty, they were just being nice, but just goes to show that it's not based on much physical.</p>
<p>In fact I was traveling around a few countries on vacation this month and in one of them, the police were a lot harder on the guys I met than fellow women. No one said anything to me.</p>
<p>I live in one of the most liberal states but have traveled to 10 states this year ranging from the most liberal to most conservative.</p>
<p>No one said anything anywhere except once, while I was skydiving ironically lol.</p>
<p>I think in the US it's almost entirely based on luck. Outside, seems to be dependent on the country/region and their general attitudes.</p>

        <p>Very true. No one has EVER said anything to my husband. The Karens always bug me (indoors). I just laugh at them and roll my eyes. That said, I do curbside pickup and order online about 95% of the time. Shopping is unpleasant these days- I do feel bad for small businesses but I refuse to deal with the BS anymore. Outdoors, as I posted in another thread, no one would dare say anything to me or my children- always have my huge dog (german shepherd) with us. But you are correct- no one ever says anything to my husband- who is the nicest guy ever but looks quite intimidating.</p>

        <p>I had one big guy confront me but despite his imposing physique I could tell he was out of shape. Me? I'm fit, 5,9' 160 and told him essentially to "fuck off" then he cried to the manager who did nothing. He left me alone after that. That was at the very beginning of our mask mandate. </p>
<p>Since then I've had store employees confront me but no one else for the same reason you mentioned OP, cause most people are pussies and know I will defend myself verbally or physically consequences be damned. Not afraid of pain or jail and since the elite intend on  making this hell on Earth, I'm not afraid of death either. Part of me hopes one of these virtue signaling punks tries something but I don't want to attract that negativity in my personal sphere so I push those gently out of my mind, but boy am I ready. I've gotten good at deescalating when employees do confront me so I would imagine I would successfully deploy the same tactics. The moment they touch me though, all diplomacy STOPS and a beat down will commence at worst or a submission move at best....for them, lol.</p>

        <p>I'm a 6'3, somewhat thin and feminine male (early stage mtf) and I've not had one person heckle me except one gas station clerk. Inside of Walmart, although I am the only person not in a mask, no one bats an eye. Maybe I look more intimidating than I think</p>

Some of my smaller friends if they don’t wear their mask when outside will get shit said to them, when personally I will wear a mask inside but not outside, and nobody has said a damn word.

        <p>Pretty much the same here, I wear it if I actually like frequenting the business, if not then no. So I only wear pretty much in book stores and a few local shops I frequent, and half the local shops don't make me wear it so I don't. Don't wear it in the grocery store or anyplace else.</p>

        <p>To be honest even though the mask mandate violates the same individual liberty amendment as the curfews and stuff</p>
<p>at least a MASK can and will actually block viral propagation via aersolized saliva via cough/sneeze</p>
<p>High proof hand sanitizer also kills the virus on contact and as it, being a virus, requires a host organism to survive (host cells) a clorox wipe down of surfaces is by far enough to remove that </p>
<p>The curfews and restrictions of travel and disease tracking are the biggest pile of horse shit i've seen in my entire 31 years</p>

        <p>Ya, I had this hunch too. I have a similar build and look, and most people don't say anything. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 'new normal' for me has been walking around in stores and in public looking menacing so no one asks me to put on a mask. I miss the days of being friendly and looking in the eyes of people in public. Even if I don't feel like I'm in a situation where I have to flex at all, I still don't want to look in the eyes of someone who has a mask on.</p>

        <p>I never want to make eye contact with people wearing masks either. I'm always worried it will lead to them instantly confronting me about my mask less face. And I'm only a 5'4, 110lb woman so if I'm by myself I'm definitely intimidated. I should take some self defense classes (except those aren't currently allowed where I live) and build my confidence.
The second I see another person without a mask there's an instant connection and smile though. Wish that was more than once in a blue moon.</p>

        <p>I believe they fall in the category of gyms and group classes that are currently cancelled our closed to "bend the curve". I could maybe find a private instructor somewhere, or just start working out with my sister who is in the military. She's pretty buff, I doubt anyone would mess with her.</p>

        <p>You have to own the decision not to wear the mask. If you look uneasy or unsure, they catch onto that and will say something no matter what you look like. It's about confidence and being able to walk away from and ignore any comments or remarks before it gathers attention.</p>

        <p>Reason #1 why everyone should make physical fitness a priority. Random assholes don't give you a hard time if you look formidable. Even if you're short random guys on the street think twice about giving you grief if you've got big shoulders. It makes things a whole lot easier and as an added bonus if you do get in a scrap you'll probably win. They're called gains for a reason.</p>

        <p>I've heard this here before, but my experience has been very different. I'm 6'3", in good shape, dress professionally, and have that iconic shaved head as well. The most shocking was the time I was physically assaulted in a place that didn't even require masks, but I was also consistently confronted for having the mask pulled barely under my nose with managers becoming involved in three of those places. Maybe I've just been unlucky; one life is a pretty small sample pool.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is very true. I'm an average sized guy but I have large shoulders/upper body and a big dark beard. I never wear a mask (only when I have to inside when shopping since I don't want to deal with any gratuitous BS) and no one says a thing. On the other hand, my sister has gotten comments from others when she doesn't wear one. She said all her comments also come from women and not men.</p>

        <p>Six foot tall athletic built male here. When I walk around town without a mask, the most I will get are dirty looks, people walking into the street/crossing the street to avoid passing directly by me, or people adjusting their mask to make sure it is on right (to "protect" themselves) as we are passing each other on the sidewalk.

        <p>Oh yes I know I had braces just got them off and they called me brace face who needed braces because I spew a lot of shit. Only because I told a doctor about masks and how prescribing medicine as a doctor doesn’t work and only fails the patient.</p>

        <p>I definitely think this is true to an extent. I think a lot of it depends on location too though. I’m a larger guy (6’0 225) and people generally only say things in states that I have found are more liberal dominant.</p>

        <p>I wondered the same thing, the other day a women walking around the neighborhood walk trail shout to me (for the second time) “you should wear a mask” ...at night I told my husband and wonder if she would have said that if i was a man or had been accompanied by one...my husband was like “who cared, fuck her” but I have to say she ruined (for the second time) part of my walk.
I even double checked NJ exceptions to wear a mask outdoor and going for a walk is still one of them.</p>
