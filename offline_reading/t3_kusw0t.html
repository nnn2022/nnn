    <strong>Tearing Families Apart</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, hope you’re doing well.</p>
<p>I am extremely discouraged. All the recent events have shown to me how my mother and I are not on the same page at all. Our values are different, our meta-narratives are different, our risk tolerance is different. I live with her but it has become difficult to interact with her, and impossible to speak about any “news” event.</p>
<p>While I try my best to not let things like this get in between our relationship, it seems impossible to not let it. </p>
<p>I’m just posting to share my troubles, see if anyone else is experiencing this, and maybe see if any one has words of advice.</p></p>

        <p>See my past post on the issue. I don’t live with my parents anymore, but we’ve always been close, and this time period has either fundamentally changed our relationship, or just shined a bright light on the cracks in it. Nobody in the world wanted it to go down like this, but here we are experiencing the fallout together. And of course I’m not talking about a virus, but about propaganda. At this point people either see it or they don’t.</p>

        <p>My husband and I have been clashing over this too. I can't comprehend how many friendships and other relationships that have been ruined over this lunacy. My I think my husband for the most part agrees that this is insane but he has a bad habit of picking and choosing things, over most things not just covid garbage. Whereas I am extremely black and white. In life in general I know that's not a great trait to have but I strongly believe it's necessary in this case. So when someone says they're against the forced masks but won't travel further to shops that aren't imposing that idiocy, and will just throw the mask on and go to the most convenient shop, I interpret that as supporting this stupidity.</p>
<p>No huge advice sorry, but I guess just wanting to show that there would surely be millions of us struggling with the same trouble and we just have to find a way to be at peace with them thinking and behaving differently.</p>

        <p>most ppl are like your mother. don't let it come between you. if you have your mom, you're lucky, it's one of the most special relationships, so cherish it, and just don't talk about these things if you feel like it'll be impossible for her to change over to the other side. if you feel like you can slowly show her the way, then do, but gently. try to compare it to something else in her life that she knows first hand the media lied about – if there's anything. maybe have a gentle discussion on tv and news, in general.</p>

        <p>Same. I don't talk politics with ANY of my family, and will change the subject or just not talk to them. My mother and I do not agree on ANYTHING but sometimes I will smile and nod when it's not political. We also disagree about my sister so I had to finally put my foot down and tell her " If she wants to talk to me she can call me. I don't like that she makes up lies and you are not willing to hear my side, so let's no longer talk about her, do not bring her up to me again." I think she got the point.</p>
