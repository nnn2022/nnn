    <strong>Santa in intensive care</strong>
    <p><p>A British talk show (think it was Good Morning Britain) just had four people on to talk about Christmas after lockdown and they mentioned that there will be no travel restrictions (I'm assuming they mean domestic travel). One of the professors then started talking about how they don't know if Santa will be making an appearance. She went on to say we all know he travels all over the world so is he at risk of transmitting the virus all over the world? Then she mentioned how he's at risk himself as "he's not exactly thin" and said "if he were to catch COVID he would be at risk of catching a very serious version of it and being admitted to intensive care"</p>
<p>In the end she and her colleagues decided that because he shows up when everyone is asleep and he travels faster than the virus, it's okay to have small family gatherings. Congratulations, Boris, you saved Santa a trip to ICU!</p>
<p>This world is fucked up. She was very clearly trying to terrify children and make them feel responsible for Santy ending up in hospital if they dare to see their family and friends over Christmas.</p>
