    <strong>What could businesses do if you didn’t have proof of vaccination?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen a few posts talking about having proof of vaccination like a QR code of a phone or a vaccine card to go places. I feel like this idea will be inevitable and be in place in the next few years. I live in America so I know it’s illegal because of the Amendments, but it seems probable that the leaders will make everything a health emergency to disregard the Constitution and its Amendments.</p>
<p>So what would happen if I were to go to a grocery store to buy food, but I didn’t have any proof that I was vaccinated? Like what would they do? Couldn’t I just walk in and shop and disregard the process? Could I be arrested? Would there be guards there to stop you? There are just so many questions to ask and  I know there is no way of answering, but I’m just looking for your guy’s thoughts and opinions. It’s very scary what is happening in today’s world, and I’m afraid it’s only going to get worse. Soon we’ll all be banned from communicating because we’re “a threat to public health” or something along those lines. Might as well ask questions while we can. :/</p></p>

        <p>The Nuremberg Code
The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that, before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject, there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person, which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. 
The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.</p>

        <p>They most likely will, glad I’ve read up on it before the chance of it happening. But if they changed the definition of herd immunity, it’s very likely they will manipulate the Nuremberg code.</p>

        <p>Just remember, Biden told us that “no amendment is absolute”. I wish I were making that up. It reeks of a precursor to dismantling any laws that doesn’t jive with their policies. The glimmer of hope is that it is pretty difficult to repeal an amendment.</p>

        <p>Unsure man, but I’m hesitant regardless of what they say. It’s pessimistic to say but in 5–10 years we’ll be hearing how those vaccinated today will face problems. Optimistic enough to hope I was wrong and everyone will be fine</p>

        <p>With that many people vaccinated, even if a small fraction of a percent suffers severe longterm side effects, no amount of suppression by the propaganda outlets could possibly silence the truth. Best they could hope for would be to muddy the waters, but a total blackout will never work.</p>

        <p>Obviously, nobody knows <em>for sure</em> what measures would be in place. But here’s my (somewhat educated?) guess.</p>
<p>There wouldn’t be any guards or anything like that. Everything would look normal-ish, except perhaps, at the beginning, someone standing at the door to scan your QR code.</p>
<p>A lot of small, NNN-sympathizing businesses would quietly defy the rule at first, but this number would rapidly shrink as many businesses get reported and the owners and employees dealt with severely, thus scaring off most of the rest from continuing in their disobedience.</p>
<p>The majority of businesses from that point on would, at first, scan the QR code at the door and at checkout. Eventually, it would be understood that you couldn’t buy anything without a code, and if you didn’t have one and even went inside without buying anything, and someone found out, you’d be reported and dealt with. At that point, the code would only be scanned at checkout, likely tied to some cashless form of payment. </p>
<p>Failure to present a valid code would result in your being reported; even most of those businesses owners that resisted at first will fear what would happen to them and their family too much to turn a blind eye and not report on anyone who came in or tried to buy something without a code.</p>
<p>There will, for at least a while, be a small number of businesses that come up with clever ways to get around the system—maybe they’d have the unvaccinated shop at different times, maybe we’d use the barter system, etc. This won’t last forever, though—in the near future, we won’t have any privacy, and won’t be very difficult for people to find out about and report these businesses, and probably a lot of their black market customers (us). This will eventually reduce the black market shops either to a very small number of businesses with very seedy ties and questionable sources, or (perhaps and?) to a small number of somewhat covertly controlled-opposition shops that occasionally sell poisoned/rotted supplies and the such in an effort to weed out the remaining dissidents.</p>
<p>TL;DR You could theoretically walk in, but yes you might be arrested or worse.</p>

        <p>Wow thanks for your input. I agree with all of that. But look what the lock downs did. TONS of small businesses forced to shut down. They will continue to find ways to get rid of small businesses. I think big corporations will take over and basically eradicate the small businesses. So likely there will be nowhere to go but the big businesses. Luckily I live in a very rural area so we might have some black markets going around and crops to go around the neighborhood. Praying that we all get though this together and in one piece.</p>

        <p>Very insightful opinion. I just don’t see a bunch of $10 an hour workers giving a fuck and stopping people. </p>
<p>Food is also a basic right and need. That is why they never shut down grocery stores during major state shutdowns. Legally they cannot. Sure deny bar, restaurant, malls, public events, but they cannot stop from getting groceries.</p>
<p>Wait to see what happens when 25-30% of working people can’t because they resist a vaccine. See how quick the tax revenue drops off. I work as an engineer in the construction industry. Most tradesmen and laborers are resisting the vaccine. Imagine how fast construction alone will shut down the economy. </p>
<p>Also, all signs are pointing to a recession. You start restricting those who can work, every city/county/state will have horrible budget problems they may never dig out of. They can’t keep giving out more money. This free stimulus money and foreclosure/eviction protections was supposed to pay bills and prop up business. Not be saved, invested into bitcoin/stocks, or remodel at our houses. That is what most people are doing that didn’t actually need the money.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, a recession—actually, a depression, one worse even than that of the 1930s—is <em>exactly</em> what they want. Their agenda is the <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">Great Reset/Net Zero</a>, and they know they can’t truly do that without completely crashing the global economy first; they need a way to <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/">take away everyone’s property</a>), after all.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>Plenty of people will join out of desperation and ignorance, but it will eventually become mandatory to be part of the program. A wholly cashless society, operating, in practice, on the ration system (and thus entirely at the mercy of the government), would be ushered in. This is, again, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/"><em>exactly</em> what they want</a>.</p>
<p>Now let’s circle back to your statement on the minimum wage workers not reporting things. That’s not possible. They’ll have to; if they don’t, it will be found out (no privacy, remember? Not to mention it being encouraged to report “dissidents”), and the consequences will be severe. Their going to work and keeping up to date on booster shots are what keep them able to receive their rations, the “privilege” of being able to stay in what were once their homes, and avoid being punished in similar ways to people in China’s social credit system (it would be things like severely restricted travel, reduced rations, bans from being around other people, etc.).</p>

        <p>So I guess we’ll have to resort to small gardens and self-sustained food sources or something. We have to start an uprising if this does happen. Then again we would probably be called a “public health threat” and be jailed and maybe even executed.</p>

        <p>But it’s only a matter of time before they are stopped. The governments won’t allow it. I guess what I meant by “uprising” is looting and stealing from the stores. Not that I agree with stealing but it might have to be done to survive. It’ll be okay for BLM to riot but not us non-vaccinated peasants.</p>

        <p>Sadly, a few places have already mandated double masks or something more stringent. I think Lufthansa has required medical grade masks on their flights, and that the SDNY courthouse requires a medical grade mask or two masks (cloth mask over a paper mask).</p>

        <p>If a store truly wanted to enforce it, they could say you were trespassing if you didn't follow their rules.  </p>
<p>In practice, I'd bet that the big chain stores require the vac but that smaller stores do not.  This depends on local laws as well.  (I can see NY closing these stores down while FL would probably leave them alone.)</p>

        <p>Here's the irony: I used to work retail and people would pretty frequently walk in and take stuff and walk out. The employees aren't allowed to stop them since the store could get sued and if you steal less than $1000 its barely a slap on the wrist if you get caught so no one even calls the police. </p>
<p>In the future, if you need a vaccine pass to buy things, people will just start wearing a mask to disguise their identity, and stealing and walking out with whatever they want.</p>

        <p>Private entities are not bound by the constitution the same way publicly traded and governmental entities are. Private groups can search you when you enter their property for example theme parks. The government is, supposed to be, bound by the constitution. So the 4th amendment says a member of the government may not unreasonably search you. </p>
<p>As for the business they would say you are trespassing if you don't follow their policy. When they call you a trespasser they can have you legally removed by security or law enforcement. Once again the constitution would not stop them per any amendment. The constitution is also a piece of paper that has either authorized the shit the government does or was powerless to stop it. Don't put so much faith in a piece of paper.</p>

        <p>When the mask mandates first came out, most stores had somebody stand there and make sure everybody wore a mask. Now, most stores in my area (a suburb in one of the bluest states) don't have anybody doing that. In most places, you can walk in without a mask and nobody will say anything. </p>
<p>I bet vaccine passports in the US will be similar. There will be a rough month or two where stores will look at your covid passport. You'll have to order groceries online and they'll bring them to our cars. Alternatively, you'll have to ask one of your vaccinated friends and family to get groceries for you. But then, it'll become like the masks and people will just get tired of checking. People won't ask you if you're vaccinated anymore because they'll just assume you are. </p>
<p>I think we have to be stubborn for those few months. 20-40% of people don't want to get vaxxed, depending on where you are, and what numbers you're looking at. Businesses only care about profit. They won't do a vaccine mandate if it costs them 20-40% of their customers. We have to be more stubborn and more loud than the doomers who claim they won't support places unless they have a vaccine mandate.</p>
