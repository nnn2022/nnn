    <strong>This past year has felt like a fever dream</strong>
    <p><p>When I wake up I feel normal and then like a minute later it hits me that this is real and it's still happening. I'm still remaining hopeful, but there are too many things happening that are unconstitutional and should be illegal and no one is stopping it. </p>
<p>I just saw a video of a child getting vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine for a virus with over a 99% survival rate that doesn't even affect kids. That child did not consent to being a part of a medical experiment, we literally have laws against this. </p>
<p>I have family who supports me, but I'm worried for the future. I don't like the government having this much control over my life. I think it's evil that they keep giving us hope that the lockdowns will be lifted only to make them stricter. </p>
<p>I'm really aggravated at everything happening right now, I can't wait until it gets warm outside. I'm going to just keep my electronic devices away and be outside 24/7 so I don't have to see the dumb things they're forcing on everyone.</p></p>
