        <p>Bro, just accept that you're grasping at straws, and the "fact checkers" are cherry picking a non-salient point and portraying that as evidence.  </p>

        <p>What are you talking about? How is explaining what the 152 number really is, cherry picking? I wonder who I believe the most, people who speak Portuguese, or some blog who has an agenda. It's hilarious how all you people can when being faced with facts, is project your own insecurities on to others.</p>
<p>Please explain how fact checkers explaining what the 152 number is, is "trust me, bro", but some blog who clearly has an agenda, is telling the truth? It is stated in the court documents, that the 17000 number still stands.</p>

        <p>They cherry picked something and gave no context as to how it invalidated that number.  So, it's doctors from a certain association.  Okay, how many doctors are in that association?  How many Covid patients did they see?  How many deaths from Covid and other causes did they determine?</p>
<p>Out of the 17k deaths with Covid, let's say they only presided over 9k.  That's still a huge difference.  Possible it was only 500, but this is a government health ministry we're talking about.  It's foolhardy to think they are referring to anything but the lion's share of those deaths.</p>
<p>You're doing the same thing as the fact check article.  You've been proven wrong, and you're scrambling to manufacture reasons this can't be true.  The 17k figure of deaths WITH Covid may stand, but the number of deaths FROM Covid is a miniscule fraction of the deaths.  Just like the CDC data for the US shows.</p>
<p>You're just mad because your doomer nonsense is falling apart.</p>

        <p>Good to see you still don't understand what the case is about. The only one who cherry picked something, is the stupid blog. No, it's doctors who work with suspicious deaths. They looked at 152, end of story. What does the number of doctors and patients they saw have to do with anything? The doctors worked for the justice department, and the had 152 deaths. The rest of the deaths are from doctors not working for the justice department. It's not that difficult, at least not for me. </p>
<p>Where have I been proven wrong? Oh no, not you bulletproof argument about how people died. Why is it you people think with and of Corona is some smoking gun, that means anything? Do you think people with the flu die of the flu, or people with HIV?</p>
<p>Again, you're projecting your insecurities on to me. It's a weird defence mechanism you people think works.</p>

<p>Ah, the ol' "I know are, but what am I rebuttal", classic.  If you really thought that I was cherry picking something, then you would have led with that.  Instead, you have to wait until I conclusively proved my point.  Then, you throw in a dash of ad hominem for good measure.  I'm wrong because I'm insecure.  Lol!</p>
<p>Here's another hit to the dogma you're so desperate to hold onto.</p>

<p>And this is from one of the most Covidian-friendly states in the US.  Yeah, that 17k figure in Portugal stands alright.  Stands flat on its belly.</p>
<p>Just admit you believed the propaganda and were wrong.  That's much more resptable than burying your head in the sand when all of our "conspiracy theories" start being proven fact.</p>

<p>I have enough education not to use strawmen, ad hominem, appeal to authority or mistake correlation for causation.  Maybe one day you'll learn not to use those.</p>
<p>We show proof, but for some reason people like you don't see it.  I think this video explains why that it:</p>

        <p>No, we were talking about you not speaking Portuguese and misunderstanding a document and spreading your lies. At no point did I mention covid deaths in general. You brought up California because you think it is evidence in regards to the case in Portugal. You also think because one county made mistakes, every county is faulty.</p>
<p>What strawman? Every single one of you people use the same tactics. A couple of weeks ago you all started talking about how you've never been wrong. Weird how it's always at the same time. You also start talking about how everyone else is wrong and are sheep. I haven't met anyone a bigger sheep than you people. You blindly post blogs like it's gospel and you say the same things verbatim. </p>
<p>Show me the proof that the 152 number is what you think it is then. It shouldn't be so difficult. You haven't shown any proof.</p>

        <p>You're right.  I'm talking about Covid deaths being inflated.  These other people talking about this court case are talking about how Covid death counts are inflated.  You're launching personal attacks to say we're wrong.  Yet, somehow, we're the one's spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>And you clealry don't know the meaning of "sheep" in this context.  Sheep blindly follow what the "experts" say and don't question or do any research on their own.  We obviously don't fit that definition.  We question all of it and don't take anyone's word at face value.  The exact polar opposite of sheep.</p>

        <p>Yes, you're spreading misinformation, because you're spreading a lie about Portugal. And despite being told what it really means, you switch the subject to something that has nothing do with it. By the way, the reason for the decrease in count, is because they switched to the national standard in America. And also, there's more to the word than America. I know that's difficult for you trumpers.</p>
<p>Okay, not a sheep, you're just someone who doesn't know shit about science but thinks he does. You question things, but when shown proof you claim they are lying, and then you turn around and spread lies from someone who doesn't speak the language.</p>

        <p>What proof is that? You haven't shown any proof. You have only claimed actual facts from portugal are fake. We're not talking about blindly following science, we're talking about you not being able to speak Portuguese. Asking questions about science is fine, but when you don't understand the science and that is the reason you ask questions, then you don't know shit about science. The Lisbon case is a clear example of that. You don't even understand basic documents like this.</p>
<p>Yes, two counties used their own way. That doesn't mean all the numbers are wrong. And to reiterate, Portugal is not the same. They confirmed that there was still 17.000 deaths. I don't know why it's so difficult for you to understand. You spread misinformation, when you claim that all numbers are wrong because two counties were wrong. And you keep saying Portugal changed their numbers. If that's not misinformation, then you don't know what is.</p>

        <p>Something is off about this. Every article seems to lead to one Andre Dias who has provided a scan of what appears to be the first page of poorly redacted court proceedings at the Tribunal Administrativo de Círculo de Lisboa. However the file reference "processo n 527/21.BELSB" does not exist as far as i can tell. My money is on troll activities with a FUD side bet</p>
