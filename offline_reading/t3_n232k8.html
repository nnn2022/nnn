    <strong>Didn't we find out that Reuters fact check and the likes are funded by organizations with stakes in the game?</strong>
    <p><p>I believe I read somewhere that Reuters is partially funded by B&amp;M Gates foundation. Does anyone have a link to something citing that?</p>
<p>I'm having a discussion about covid on world news sub, and expressed my mistrust for "fact check" sites, as well as a few other reasons I don't trust the mainstream narrative to which the person replied with a Reuters article. </p>
<p>They failed to consider the fact that I mentioned how, when dissenting opinions aren't allowed it's a sign that the information being pushed is propaganda rather than fact. Brainwashed people are sad and frustrating to discuss things with. </p>
<p>So I feel my only hope is to provide proof that the fact checkers are bought and paid for. My backup plan is to ask him if he also thinks that police departments fairly investigate themselves. It's pretty much the same concept. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p>

        <p>It’s pointless to argue with these people tbh. If someone takes Reuters as their unbiased wholehearted news source there’s nothing that you’ll be able to say to change their mind.</p>

        <p>That's the truth.</p>
<p>Edit: however, I did include proof and the individual had no reply. So, there's that.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, fact checkers are a rubber stamp to the mainstream (or fake news, depending on your point of view) media</p>

        <p>Yea this is right on factcheck.orgs website ‘In addition, we received $89,340 in payments from Facebook as part of a project to debunk viral deceptions circulating on social media. Facebook has no control over our editorial decisions’... - that was just over a few months. Facebook basically bank rolls that website along with other pro big pharma and pro va x x donors  https://www.factcheck.org/our-funding/</p>
