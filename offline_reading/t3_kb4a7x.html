    <strong>If you're going through a tough time because of covid-19, please read</strong>
    <p><p>These times suck, for everyone, I'm sorry, one another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>And believe me, I know these times suck...</p>
<p>I can no longer go to school anymore (I was in a hybrid method, I would go one week and virtual the next) but because of the spike in cases, it was decided we go into full virtual, on the last month of the semester...and it sucks, but we still meet and have classes because on another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>When I did go to school, I couldn't see my favorite teacher because she has an extremely weak immune system, she isn't able to even leave her house because it's that weak...but I like to text and video chat with her when I can because on another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>I have to, admittedly annoyingly, ask my friends more than ever if we can call or video chat...because sometimes I can go from days to weeks without hearing their voice because of now permanent (untill further notice) virtual learning, but I still love those calls and will take one if they call, any day of the week because one another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>Like all of you, I hate this, I hate all of this, I hate how school is can be so confusing because like us, this is the first time teachers had to go through the process of school through a screen, I hate how a mask makes my glasses fog up and how it can give me acne on my chin, I hate not being able to give my friends a hug when I was at school because of social distancing, I hate having to wash and wipe every thing after we buy them to stay safe, and I just hate that things are not how they were before...</p>
<p>But I'd do it all over again, the mask, the virtual learning, the social distancing, and everything that went with it because I love everyone, and everyone should love one another, because one another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>Countries that got hit with Covid-19 before we did(we as in the USA) have gotten there cases and deaths much more under control than we have, some Countries who had been hit with covid took the correct precautions and now have kids going to school full time, people are going to concerts and people going to the grocery store without needed to even social distance and I've never been so jealous.</p>
<p>It should have never been like this, Covid-19 should have been controlled by now, we shouldn't live in a world when more people die from covid every day than people did on 9/11.</p>
<p>So why is it like this, and I think the answer is selfishness, every since cases started it was "<em>I'll</em> be fine, because <em>I</em> don't have an autoimmune disease" "<em>I'll</em> be fine because <em>I'm</em> not elderly" "<em>I'll</em> be fine because <em>I</em> don't have a pre-existing condition" "<em>I</em> don't want to wear a mask because it makes <em>me</em> uncomfortable" "mask don't protect <em>me</em>, so why wear them?" "<em>I</em> don't want to stay inside for this long, <em>I'm</em> bored" i i i i i</p>
<p>Admit it, we all have had one or all of these thoughts before at one point and time because of covid-19, I know I have, but this is why we are in such a bad state of cases right now, we thought of ourselves before we thought of others, when we shouldn't have because one another is all we have right now.</p>
<p>All those people who could seriously be affected, matter, the elderly, the people with auto-immune disease, the people with pre-existing conditions all matter. The people who aren't one of these people matter. The 300,000 Americans who have sadly left our world because of covid-19 mattered. The countless others in the world who have suffered from covid-19 matter. They should matter to us because one another is all we got right now.</p>
<p>Like most of you, if I were to get covid-19 tomorrow, chances are I'll be ok, I'll survive and recover, but I don't take the proper precautions, like wearing a mask for me, a mask isn't made to only protect me, it's made to protect everyone else around me. I wear a mask for the people who will die if they come in contact with covid, I wear a mask for the people who have lost a loved one because of covid, and most of all, I social distance, learn virtually, and wear a mask because one another is all we got right now, and I can't stand the thought of losing just one more person from something we could have had under control because we thought of ourselves before thinking about others.</p>
<p>So please, if you are going through a tough time because you have to follow the correct precautions to protect yourself from covid-19, just remember that you are not just doing this for yourself, but for one another, that's all we got right now.♥️</p></p>

        <p>“One another is all we got right now.” This is an empty platitude. Where were you when I was being abused as a child? Where were you when I was homeless? Destitute? Lost? Grieving? You’ve never been there for me before. Ever. We both know it. Stop gaslighting that you have.</p>

        <p>I wish I was, and I truly wish you the best. What im saying is that social distancing and mask wearing isn't a big price to pay to protect a loved one and has been proven in doing so. It doesn't take much to be safe and to keep others safe.</p>

        <p>Masks don’t just mean filtered breathing, they mean no more smiles, no more upward curl of the lip as your best friend thinks of something funny, no more little pouts or pinchable cheeks from children, no more puckered or kissable lips of loved ones. Masks erase half the face in with them we mute the smiles laughter and joy that stick forever in our memories of people once they’re gone.</p>
<p>“Social distancing“ means that during the past 10 months, there have been so many people who have not been able to visit and share their loved ones’ last moments, and there are people dying alone in hospitals and care homes, even Alzheimer’s patients who are confused and don’t understand. There are people unable to have proper closure from funerals and ceremonies, and they face judgement or even criminal charges when they do!</p>
<p>Even if you’ve experienced past lost, unless you’re in the thick of it, you simply don’t feel it in your heart the same way the person going through it does. I feel that anyone who feels in their heart that they should visit a loved one or to even gather in their honor, they must absolutely do so, it is so important. Pandemic or no, these moments are what define life itself. </p>
<p>Yes, these <em>are</em> huge, enormous, prices to pay to “protect” loved ones, because you end up “protecting” them from the very things that give life it’s meaning.</p>

        <p>I'd rather not be able to have someone see my smile for a while then have them see my smile for the last time, over 3,000 on December 9th with never be able to smile again because they died from a virus that should have been controlled by now.

        <p>They don’t get to see your smile at all anymore. The last time they saw it could very well be the last time. “A while” in the future is never guaranteed. Those 3,000 people are people dying <em>with</em> corona and not <em>of</em> corona. The all-cause death count for 2020 is actually <em>less</em> than 2019. What killed more people in 2019? </p>
<p>Also, yes, people do smile at funerals when they share in the joyous memories and celebration of life of their loved ones, with their loved ones. I may be wrong, but you sound very young and perhaps you yourself have never actually seen a tragic death take place or been someone’s last person they see, or made funeral arrangements all on your own. It really changes you and how you look at life and death.</p>

        <p>You acting like video chat isn't a thing anymore, or sending photos, I'd rather have that then possibly getting someone sick.</p>
<p>And those people did in fact die from covid-19, and you telling yourself they didn't doesn't change that fact </p>
<p>I can't believe people would honestly want to smile rather than to want to be safe from a virus that have killed more than a quarter of a million people.</p>

        <p>Their loved ones aren’t able to be there, because of these restrictions. I can’t  believe you would even suggest that video chat is any substitute for feeling and being there. </p>
<p>As of Nov 30, there were 14,000 of the more than 231,000 processed death certificates that had <em>only</em> COVID-19 listed as the cause of death. That’s not to downplay those deaths, but the average age of coronavirus death is older than the life expectancy.</p>
<p>You sound like a very young, sheltered person who wants to come off as “caring” and who wants others to see her as caring, but who doesn’t have the depth of experience to understand how it feels when you’re <em>actually</em> dealing with death, and not just thinking about it hypothetically.</p>

        <p>It goes back more than 100 years. The earliest attested reference to veiling is found a Middle Assyrian law code dating from between 1400 and 1100 BC. Assyria had explicit sumptuary laws detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society. Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so.</p>
<p>The Middle Assyrian law code states:</p>
<p>&rt;§ 40. A wife-of-a-man, or [widows], or [Assyrian] women who go out into the main thoroughfare [shall not have] their heads [bare]. [...] A prostitute shall not veil herself, her head shall be bare. Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her, secure witnesses, and bring her to the palace entrance. They shall not take her jewelry; he who has seized her shall take her clothing; they shall strike her 50 blows with rods; they shall pour hot pitch over her head. And if a man should see a veiled prostitute and release her and not bring her to the palace entrance: they shall strike that man 50 blows with rods; the one who informs against him shall take his clothing; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) on a cord, tie (it) at his back; he shall perform the king’s service for one full month. Slave-women shall not veil themselves, and he who should see a veiled slave-woman shall seize her and bring her to the palace entrance: they shall cut off her ears; he who seizes her shall take her clothing.</p>
<p>Now likewise, I have never seen more people pressed over what others wear or do not wear on their faces, even 100 years ago masks mandates were quickly rescinded because people realized how wrong they were. I suppose it may be something residual from our ancient Assyrian DNA to want to attack, punish, shame, and humiliate people for reasons having to do with how they cover or don’t cover their face.</p>

        <p>You don’t breathe through a seatbelt or wear it on your face. Whether for not you wear a seatbelt is not enforced by businesses, schools, or jobs. Again, doctors choose their profession and are well-compensated for it, it is not mandated to be a doctor. People have been wearing clothes for ages, not just for decency, but because they are utilitarian, they are more comfortable. There’s no where in the whole US right now that is warm enough to be comfortably naked. Also, up until recent mandates, if naked people wanted to gather en masses at a nudist beach, colony, or private event, there was nothing wrong with it.</p>

        <p>Countries have achieved zero cases by taking the correct precautions like new zeland for example, and I know that's hard to achieve so when I say controlled I mean not have 3,000 people die a day from it and not have 15 million cases of it, at the very least have the rate of those things go down.</p>

        <p>A ticket and after enough times probably your license taken, and businesses wouldn't have been shut down if landlords didn't still charge a crazy amount of rent while this is going on. Another way countries have gotten covid under control is pausing rent so people can get back on there feet easier and won't have to go out as much to earn enough money for rent</p>

        <p>You're under the assumption that covid is this "deadly" disease that's <em>actually</em> "killing millions" when in reality, it's nothing more than a bad flu that's been renamed, plus PCR tests being put through way too many cycles (30-40+) producing a high false positive rate thus equaling a casedemic, PLUS all other deaths being called "covid" (died <em>with</em> vs died <em>of</em> ), and ADDITIONALLY we are forced into this abusive relationship with our government. If it wasn't for the media fear porn being peddled since March and no draconic restrictions being constantly put on us ( "two weeks to flatten the curve" became 9 months, goalposts keep being moved arbitrarily to keep us isolated and miserable) then we wouldn't have been any different than any other bad flu year. Back in 2009 with the Swine Flu we never shut down the world and spoke doom and gloom and peddled a casedemic and implemented draconic restrictions and lockdowns&amp;isolation, this "pandemic" should not have been any different. Stop being afraid of covid, if you're otherwise generally healthy it's not deadly. Only reason people <em>may</em> die of it is because they're already chronically ill and have underlying/co-morbid conditions and unhealthy to begin with, or they're in their 80s and 90s near death's door anyways. Enough of the fear.</p>

        <p>Goodness you're dense lmfao </p>
<p>You freak out over a mere flu that has a 99.9% survival rate for everyone under 70. That's just sad. There's always going to be a small part of the population that's vulnerable. Have we ever shut down the world for <em>them</em> in past years, especially during worse years like Swine Flu? No? then this year shouldn't be any different. The majority should NOT be shut down and isolated for a minority. Let the vulnerable protect themselves, and let the healthy continue on with their normal lives. To restrict the movement of the sick is quarantine, but to restrict the movement of the healthy is tyranny. Never before in human history have we ever done anything like this and it's been proven lockdowns and distancing <em>do. not. work.</em> Lockdowns and distancing are doing more harm than benefit for us. Does the unseen and hush-hush mental health epidemic caused by the lockdowns not matter? countless people are committing suicide, adults and children alike, because of lockdowns. People are dying due to losing access to essential treatment due to lockdowns. Smaller businesses are going under because of lockdowns, do they not matter? does it not matter anymore that people are losing their livelihoods for a virus that isn't deadly to the <em>majority</em> of the population? Don't be so ignorant.</p>

        <p>Ok I don't care if it has a 99.999 survival rate, the 0.1 still matters and out of millions that's a big number. Not to mention even though you can recover from covid your heart and lungs might get permanent damage from getting covid.</p>
<p>And people wouldnt be losing there stores and jobs if we did what most countries did and put a pause on rent and let people get back on their feet before they pay it again, not have people have to go out to earn enough money for rent.</p>
<p>And mental health is a huge problem in this country and I do think addressing it is good, but I think the solution is better access to therapist, not preventing social distancing.</p>

        <p>So? Influenza can do the same exact things, and yet we never freaked out to this extent over the flu. This whole thing is a load of BS and you've swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. Shutting down the world for the minority is NOT the way to go. Let us go on with our daily life. Let us take risks. Stop being so paranoid and scared.</p>

        <p>So again, those who are vulnerable should take steps to protect themselves. Collectivism is not the answer to our problems. We should be responsible for our own selves, not putting responsibility on others, especially strangers we don't even know. Why should I care about the health of some random people out on the streets? I am responsible for my own health. If this really was about caring for each other's health I'd be going to peoples' shopping carts and swiping every unhealthy food item and replacing it with <em>healthy</em> food, for one thing. And we'd be mandating healthy lifestyles, not encouraging the opposite by depriving ourselves of beneficial sunlight (Vitamin D), fresh air, exercise, and essential social interaction, and ordering junk food/takeout all the time. </p>
<p>Thousands of people die daily and it always happens, no one ever batted an eye to daily deaths from everything else until this year when we got obsessed with deaths. It's utterly ridiculous now.</p>

        <p>I'm actually not going through a tough time because I realized right from the start that we were too late in containing the virus.  Knowing this, I've not really adjusted any of my behavior.   I am going out and living as normally as possible.  I still run my gaming groups (in person) and see friends/family.  I'm sorry if you were so naive to believe that if we all "just behaved" then this would all go away and gave up 9 months of your life that you'll never get back.  I know someone who refused to see her grandmother over Thanksgiving in order to "protect her." She (not the grandmother) died of a pulmonary embolism the next week. People are under the impression tjat we have infinite time and can just throw months away.</p>

        <p>Consequences are funny things.  One consequence of a very contagious disease with an exceptionally low fatality rate is that it's effectively impossible to get rid of.  Covid is like that.  </p>
<p>And that's why you're dead wrong.  We're not in the situation we're in because people selfishly refused to hunker down and wait it out.  We're in this situation because people selfishly DID.  They selfishly said "I'm afraid of this disease and the risk it poses me", and they refused to take the chance of infection.  No infection means no building of herd immunity.  No herd immunity means no end to the pandemic.  This virus cannot be waited out; it has to be survived- or vaccinated against.  That can build herd immunity, too.  But vaccines takes years to develop and more years to properly test.  So we should send the young and healthy out to catch the disease and recover from it, during the summer, when immunity's highest- but we didn't.  We thought of ourselves ahead of others.</p>
<p>Some of us choose to brave it anyway.  And what's the response?  Mockery, derision, and sometimes physical assault.  Some people have been arrested, fined, and possibly thrown in prison.  Supposedly, one guy in the Netherlands (I think) was shot and killed by the police.  I risk that when I go out.  I risk Covid, too- I'm very male, very fat, and have an (irrelevant) underlying respiratory condition- I'm probably at a higher risk than most people here.  It's still extremely low, and it's still a chance I'm willing to take.  </p>
<p>You know who else matters? The friend of mine who died when he couldn't get in to have his heart problem corrected.  His mother, who had her only child die in her arms, only to be told she couldn't even have a funeral for him by a governor her who went out mere days later to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with thousands of other protesters, and shot herself.  His fiancee, who had to face the fact that if she'd been less squeamish about moving in with her soon-to-be-husband, both he and his mother might be alive, and couldn't take it- but COULD take a half bottle of vodka and a full bottle of Tylenol.  The daughter of a high-school friend who only went a date with his wife-to-be because I literally strongarmed him into it, who killed herself at the ripe old age of <em>eleven</em> because she couldn't handle the isolation of being away from her friends any longer, and so no hope of the situation getting better.  And every other life snuffed out or crippled by these horrific draconian measures that we easily could have avoided if we just let people choose their own level of risk.</p>
<p>Go ahead and hide behind your mask.  We won't stop you- that's not our way.  But know that as long as you cling to that selfishness, we do not have you.  You are actively harming the people we're trying to save.</p>

        <p>Of course it's not all about me; that's what I said.  If it was all about me, I'd take the selfish route, wear the mask, and avoid the danger.  I don't, because I'm not selfish- that's your job.  I take the risk, and so make people safe- you don't, and so endanger them.</p>

        <p>Like I said in my first comment: the pandemic will not end until herd immunity is achieved.  Slowing the spread of the disease slows the achievement of herd immunity.  Thus, taking measures to slow the spread lengthens the lockdowns.  With me so far?</p>
<p>These restrictions are killing people.  People who can't get in to have medical procedures done, or can't even get diagnostic readings, are dying needlessly.  People whose jobs are gone can't keep a roof over their heads or feed their families.  Old people facing social isolation for the rest of their lives die sooner.  Children losing out on socialization develop lifelong mental problems that shorten their lives.  It's not just a matter of trading quality for quantity: Covid kills half a percentage point; telomere degeneration kills everyone.  You're making it worse.</p>
