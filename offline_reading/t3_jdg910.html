    <strong>I have never felt so distant from society as a whole and reality and feel utterly lost.</strong>
    <p><p>This is going to be a rant, a stream of consciousness from a 26 year old woman who feels defeated.</p>
<p>I've had these thoughts for so long, just need to write them down. About those who are dead certain that lockdowns, masks, social distance and vaccines are the only things that will save us. About my own life's worth.</p>
<p>It's easy to be the hero online. Especially young people, who are masters in the use of social media. Easy to be the good, morally superior "soldiers" in this "war". The young nowadays are not being sent to fight in trenches, with guns, under the rain, having to watch their comrades being shot by enemies and die of blood loss on the battlefield. All they have to do is wear a mask, take a selfie, add a banner like "#savelives, #ILoveNHS" etc. They know they will be immediately hailed as the true "heroes". It's just that simple nowadays. No need to gain respect through hard work, sacrifices, etc. And maybe that's why many don't (want to) question what is happening, they like thing just the way they are.</p>
<p>It's all about what other people think about you. It's always been like this for my generation. For me, too.</p>
<p>When I post something on my Facebook or Twitter that deviates from the mainstream narrative, I have to ask myself if it's really worth it. I know for a fact that 80% of the people I have on there (especially friends and family) will change their opinion about me. I used to be the diligent, perfect daughter/friend, kind to everyone and with a reputation for being caring, kind and sweet. I bet many are now thinking how utterly selfish I am for questioning the use of masks, after all, it's not as if I'm in a hospital watching people die everyday? I don't even have grandparents anymore, why should I care? Even though I have parents who are at risk. I've read so many tweets from people my age. They have profile pictures or avatars with masks. And they scream: "Just SHUP UP, WEAR YOUR EFFING MASK AND STOP COMPLAINING".</p>
<p>Is it really me, then? I suppose I'm not that lovely daughter anymore who left Italy in search of better higher education and occupation than my tiny village could offer, to pursue my 13 year long dream to move to Norway. I know my soul belongs there after having lived there during my Erasmus year.</p>
<p>I worked effing hard to get good grades despite many challenges, being away from home, losing family while I was far away, not being able to say goodbye. On a pathetically small budget. Working part-time while studying. I found a good job, through luck and impressing someone, again far from home, straight after University. I made it my priority to save up all the money I could so that I would one day have enough to move to Norway, support myself while looking for a job. I sacrificed half a year's salary to support my poor family financially, I paid some of my father's debts. I'm still doing so and can't find a way out of it. I've been financially supporting my family for 3 years while putting my life on hold, for their sake. My savings are being drained even more now because of Covid-19, my family isn't getting any support. My dream is fading. Without my savings, I won't be able to go to an expensive country like Norway. I will have to start from scratch again. In Italy, where I feel like a bird in a cage.</p>
<p>After those sacrifices, I hoped I had at least gained a bit of respect, especially from my father. But no. I'm a fool for thinking differently to him. I'm a "denier" (I've never denied the existence of the virus, just questioned the measures). Lockdowns should happen, according to him, and I should just shut up and accept it. After all, my plans can wait. I'm young. His life, on the other hand, hasn't changed much: almost always inside the house, no job, being supported by his wife and daughter - even before Covid. My depression and anxiety, he says, are just me being weak and I need to grow up.</p>
<p>Well, seems like I probably deserve to have my dreams shattered by this virus. It's not as if I have the right to have dreams and hopes, in such a time of "crisis". I think I can bear the constant sadness, the hopelessness, the no light at the end of the tunnel mentality, the lack of smiles surrounding me. For another few weeks. Or months. Or, hang on, when is the vaccine coming out? No one knows? Oh.</p></p>

        <p>This may sound backwards, but you have more hope than they do. They are afraid to die and also afraid to live. I’m female too and it seems an overwhelming majority of females are terrified more than men are. I agree to get grounded spiritually. If you’re doing something for others to gain something from them (love, respect, approval), that’s not really a sacrifice. Focus on yourself instead. 
Also, it probably wouldn’t be too fun going to Norway now with Covid. With all this going on, you wouldn’t want to see Norway at its worst, you wanna see Norway at its best. Think of it that way.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your kind words :) The problem is that I feel utterly chained and useless in Italy, whereas just being in Norway I change, I'm more positive, I feel at peace - even if I'm alone. It would probably still be like that, even though Norway isn't, as you've said, "at its best". I'd love to be able to focus on myself though. If I truly did that, I'd be in Norway by now, maybe staying at a friend's while looking for a job. But then I'd feel guilty about leaving my mother alone dealing with all the problems in my family :/ She's also rather depressed and self-destructive I'd say...</p>

        <p>True.</p>
<p>Although Norway isn't as strict as other countries, we still have experienced a lockdown and restrictions before. People are still verbally harassing you for not wearing a mask, treating people with medical conditions unfairly and Oslo has a mask mandate. If you're a lipreader, you're shown to f' off. How do I know? I'm Norwegian myself.</p>

        <p>Yes do:) and try to not become hateful. That tires you and turns you negative.</p>
<p>Just visit the places where people dance and break rules. Break the rules but do it with fun.</p>
<p>I dance and spread the fun and the media can slander, hate and try to shame me:</p>
<p>But I can dance if I want to, 
I can leave it all behind
And if they say don't dance and still I do dance then:</p>
<p>everything will turn out fine.</p>
<p>Honestly I have participated in a group hug and media considers me nearly a murderer, i have danced and got called a hooligan.</p>
<p>I have never had so much fun dancing to be honest hahaha. I live in a time where dancing with friends is a revolutionary act.</p>
<p>I will tell my granchildren the media considered my killer moves a threat.</p>
<p>It was quite the disco inferno. This revolution will be disco themed:</p>
<p>Disco fever.</p>

        <p>It's the reason why I have now backed away from society at 33.</p>
<p>We're treating people as if they're sick when they're healthy. We're destorying our young generation and society so we can save the elderly. This is where we are at. This is broken. I don't want to be a part of it anymore.</p>
<p>I see no point in playing the game, not when your career, life plans or business can be wiped out in less than a year over a virus that won't affect you and the majority of people.</p>
<p>The precedent has been set. If they can lockdown and destroy livelihoods over a virus with this survival rate, then they can lockdown for other things they deem fit.</p>

        <p>Many of us, in our 20s/early 30s, share similar stories I believe. I'm sorry this is happening to you, I am trapped in another EU country in a slightly more hopeless situation (the country I intended to move to is basically shut for the foreseeable future and my family lives in another continent). So many people had their dreams destroyed by these lockdowns and travel bans, that I can't really understand how this is not newsworthy. At least not when catching corona seems like the worst thing that can ever happen to someone.   </p>
<p>Anyway, hope you can somehow try to live normally wherever you are. It's what I've been trying to do, these restrictions are NOT normal in any sense.</p>

        <p>I hope so too, but it seems most governments are not really worried about the death of the global economy or social life anymore, so I'm not particularly optimistic. As we can see in many countries, lockdowns are coming back at the worst time for mental health.</p>

        <p>It's a trip hearing this out of a 26-year-old woman, because for at least the last five years I've basically considered women within +/- 5 years of my own age to be lost. Lost to woke ideology, lost to whackadoodle feminist ideology, lost to lockdown ideology, lost to self-diagnosed mental illness handwringing, etc etc. Every form of societal craziness and general meltdown seems to have its ground zero in women aged 20-45. Granted this is coming from a US perspective, but it's super novel to hear a woman your age speaking in opposition to the absolute tsunami of daily media messaging pushing the idea that the only acceptable woman is a woman with blue hair, pussy hat, and a face mask who goes to BLM rallies every weekend and spends every evening screeching at people on Twitter to mask up and stay the fuck home. </p>

        <p>It is. In a lot of ways this reminds me of life after 9/11. Everything shut down. People were paranoid. Anthrax was in the mail. The government began spying. Wars started. It felt like everything was going to hell and would never go back to normal. But things did go back to normal. </p>
<p>I think after the US presidential election things will calm down. Regardless of who wins. A lot of what’s happening is driven by that.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you may have more going on personally than just covid.  Maybe this is a chance to reevaluate personal relationships and gain a different/better perspective?</p>
<p>The lockdowns and associated political chaos here in the US have forced me to look at my relationships and assess them on realistic terms.  I haven't cut anybody out of my life just because I disagree with them, but I have been able to get a lot of perspective on what each of these relationships is and is not.  As a result, I am more comfortable being alone (with my spouse).</p>
<p>It's a good time to get spiritually centered, whatever that means for you.</p>

        <p>Oh there's no doubt about that...I've already changed my view about my father, I've lost a lot of respect for him sadly (he's not a bad person, but he does make lots of mistakes). My mother is the breadwinner right now and is an alcoholic. That's also changed my perspective. Sadly, that's one reason that ties me here, I can control her more being at home than if I were in Norway. It's a mess.</p>
<p>But I agree...I certainly am finding this time very enlightening. On a positive note, there is one friendship that has grown stronger during this period :) I'm glad you were able to gain something positive out of it too</p>

<p>My dear, you are fighting a losing battle with that situation. You will twist yourself into a pretzel trying to accommodate and save an alcoholic. If they don’t want to change, all you are doing (when you think you are helping, saving, controlling) is actually enabling them.  I really feel for you.</p>

        <p>Oh, Italy, that makes more sense, I was thinking here in the UK at first, so I didn't understand the cultural family-focused context. I can fight my family a lot more directly, and yet can still relate to some of what you say: these sound like issues with abusive family dynamics, not just with the covid situation in and of itself, although the conformity dynamics around covid mirror those of abuse. Honestly, reading this, my heart aches for you, you don't have to be a 'perfect' that they define for you by meaning 'compliance with what they want', and although it's hard to accept because trying to please becomes so engrained, it will never be enough, they'll keep taking more. People who tell you to wait, like lockdowns, they'll make you keep waiting. I'm 33: I wish I'd run when I was younger, when I still could more freely. Go: run.</p>
<p>It's Ok to stop debt payments right now. If you feel like you need to give a reason -you don't-, then the pandemic gives you the one you just wrote: you are unable to make them at such a period of economic difficulty and uncertainty, and need to save for your future now. If it's easier, set a short time period for payment to end. If they flip out on you, if you suddenly don't measure up in their eyes, if they try to emotionally bully you into proving you're a 'good' daughter by doing what they want, then ask yourself if someone who just had your best interests at heart would react that way to you setting a boundary, one which you're fully entitled to as an adult. As an adult, even as a child, you're your own person, not something that belongs to your father. It's not you, you're just fine and have more than shown yourself to be caring, going above and beyond, it's him.</p>
<p>Good luck. xxx</p>

        <p>I'm really touched by your reply, thank you really and truly for your very kind words...:) </p>
<p>They don't expect me to help them, they feel embarrassed, but my father has said in the past "Unfortunately, that's just how things are". What makes everything ten times harder is that I have a brother of 17. He knows that I help a lot financially, he knows the family is struggling, but I don't want him to be a victim of my decisions :( It wouldn't be fair on him...</p>
<p>Funnily enough, my best friends have all told me to just run haha I know in my heart it's the best decision for me in the end, but I also dread feeling guilty and responsible for adding sadness to my family in an already precarious situation.</p>

        <p>You hit the nail on the head in the first part. This is all about virtue-signaling. The point is to make pariahs of those of us who won’t wear masks. They simply identify which segments of the population are compliant, and which are not.</p>
<p>The vaccine is not the solution. It won’t protect anyone. (Covid is a cold virus. We’ve never had a vaccine for colds — why do you think that is?) Life won’t go back to “normal” after the vaccine. That’s  only what the media wants you to think, so that you’ll take it. The only purpose of the masks, the lockdowns, and the fear-mongering is to take us to mandatory injections. It’s all a pretense. Bill Gates has already said that we’ll need 10 years of lockdowns, even after his vaccine comes out next year. (Really, why would he give up the control he’s gained over us?)</p>
<p>The vaccine is simply a Trojan horse of animal, plant, and virus DNA. It will make lots of people sick. (Bill Gates said this too.) And once it comes out, you won’t be able to shop anywhere if you don’t have it, the same way masks are now being enforced.</p>

        <p>I too feel like you. I absolutely don't want to be a part of this <em>new normal</em> (ugh!) society they are building. I also don't think it's right to sacrifice all joy of life and all hopes, just because we have certain danger in our lives. Danger is always present, always there. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but still there. We can't live all our life in constant fear.</p>

        <p>Completely agree! I keep thinking, how the hell have we survived this far, without masks and lockdowns? Has the flu never killed anyone? Why is it suddenly incredibly selfish to question the efficacy of masks, seeing as they've only been introduced recently, with weak scientific reasoning, and not even implemented in every single country in the world?</p>

        <p>I went through a similar realization about my parents years ago. They weren't bad people they were just weak for lots of different reasons. I was lucky enough to have great friends with parents who taught me a better way. </p>
<p>My parents never tried to better themselves. They never questioned authority. They avoided any kind of confrontation. They would never stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>While I never moved far away from them physically, I put a world of distance between us in terms of behavior. I learned to ignore their negativity. I challenged their ideas openly. We still had a friendly relationship but I didn't let them drag me down their path. </p>
<p>The fact that you can see what is going on makes me feel like you have a good chance of overcoming it. </p>
<p>Even if you have to delay your dreams and goals don't give up on them. Use them as motivation to get through all of this. Keep them as a light at the end of the tunnel to work towards.</p>

        <p>Your story is very sad. It's not you; it's everyone else you know who fail to recognize what a kind, sweet, and cute woman you really are. I can tell you are from what you wrote here. It must be truly heartbreaking for someone like you to do the right thing, put in your best effort toward fulfilling your long-held dreams, and be nice and caring to others, especially your family, for your whole lifetime only to be met with betrayal when you need their support the most.</p>
<p>Know this: never let anyone else, even someone you deeply care about, take your hopes, your dreams, or your life away from you. You have a right to them, and if they don't believe you deserve to have them it is they who are in the wrong, not you. You're good enough. You deserve all of it. You deserve all the smiles, the goodness, and the pleasures the world can offer a young woman.</p>
<p>Never give that up, even if it takes great struggle. Know in your heart that I for one am of the same mind as you. In spirit you are not alone.</p>

        <p>I especially hated those who felt heroes because they stayed home during lockdown (and then stopped caring about staying home as soon as lockdown ended). I mean, it's not your choice, you're being forced by the government, how is that being a hero?</p>

        <p>Good question, I started off with "26 year old F" because I was used to seeing F and M in reddit posts (titles especially). Then I spelled it out for some reason, didn't give it much thought. I'll change it, woman sounds much better to be fair haha</p>

        <p>Thank you, I suppose..haha I like how I can write something like this. I know many are going through hard times, maybe reading a piece of messed up psychological inner turmoil might give comfort to some? I hope so at least...</p>
