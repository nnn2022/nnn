        <p>Yeah but this one is taking it out of hands! Whatever I’ll pay money for taxes and not speed and not kill people etc those make sense and aren’t evil” rules they have to happen because this many humans existing together need a frickin motion to live by or else it would be chaos. Anything that tells u that u HAVE TO personally do something is not ok! And u shouldn’t be fooled enough to. Like I should be in complete control of what happens to me and my body! It’s dead ass like government rape! Because they have more control then me ? I have to allow them to rape me!? Basically do whatever they want with my fuckin body?!? why is that any different then someone getting raped 🙄</p>

        <p>The irony of you saying “do you actually read your comments out loud?” 🤣 have you? </p>
<p>You’re equating wearing a mask with actual rape, how delusional are you? Is it also rape when a business requires you to wear shirts, pants, and shoes if you want service? After all, that’s imposing on your bodily autonomy on the exact same scale that mask wearing would. </p>

<p>No one needs to be “woken up” by someone with your level of education, or lack thereof. And before you say it, yes I can tell you’re pretty low brow based on the way you communicate and your inability to structure anything resembling a coherent argument</p>

        <p>No it’s just that you have a different opinion. So it shows who’s less educated by the way u communicate with me. Your missing the point and your just worried about the wrong stuff rn.  What is the definition of rape ? Since ur so smart and obviously much much smarter than I am</p>

        <p>It’s not an opinion, it’s facts. Facts don’t care about your feelings. Rape is unlawful sexual activity or sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or with threat of injury. Explain how voluntarily getting a vaccine fits that definition. </p>
<p>Great job on making a hollow conclusory statement and saying I’m less educated by the way I communicate with you, and then failing to articulate any concrete reasons to back that up. </p>
<p>Remind me again, what was your point? Because you don’t seem to really know what your point is at all and your comments read like an unorganized steam of consciousness.</p>

        <p>Ok so you obviously need me to hold your hand after every sentence. Like when someone has a conversation they don’t have to keep repeating what they are talking about. Its kind of obvious. U just have to follow the bouncing ball. I’m on social media I don’t really care about properly texting every word correctly.  Here I’ll give it to u. Anyways. Your an idiot.... (because ) you don’t have common logic to understand that I used an analogy. Rape= forced act. vaccine to ppl who don’t want it but have to get it = forced act. U use your body unwillingly in vaccine mandates: u use your body unwillingly when u get raped?! Do I need to write it on a board like this meme for u? you are what’s wrong with the world I simply commented on this post and you want to come for me with your no reasoning, no facts, no education and no logic. Your like a robot. You know how robots don’t really understand stuff unless it’s very very blunt? Yup that’s u 👏 but here I go explained it to u in detail why it’s just the same as fuckin rape u moron.</p>

        <p>It’s not the same, it’s a terrible analogy. And vaccines are voluntary. and it’s disgusting that you would compare public health measures with rape. </p>

        <p>Because it’s a voluntary vaccine. No, I don’t think the government should force people to take the vaccine. I do think people should get the vaccine though if they are able. </p>
<p>But, private businesses have a right to set their own rules and conditions on who they do business with because we live in a country that respects property rights. So, I think it’s totally fine if private businesses won’t let you in or serve you if you aren’t vaccinated. Just shop at places that don’t have that requirement.</p>

        <p>You do not have the right to virus-free or low virus interactions with other humans. You never had that right. Only in the last year have people invented these absurd, impossible, "No virus" rights. Viruses and bacteria have been part of the human biome for millions of years. Get over it. You assume the risk of germ spread when you interact with another organism. It's always been that way. AND IT ALWAYS WILL. Thinking you can live in a world without viral spread is the epitome of anti science. </p>

        <p>Yes because it's up to them to do what they need to do to protect themselves. If I worked at a nursing home or a hospital I would consider the vaccine but I don't. It's not my job to worry about everyone in the grocery store.</p>

        <p>.01 Percent of people have deadly peanut allergies. You don't see society banning peanuts en-masse do you? Nope! It's on them to carry an epi pen. Think about how absurd it would be to go bar to bar demanding they stop serving peanuts because one person can't be near them.  That's what you sound like.</p>

        <p>Well actually the rate for deadly peanut allergies in children is ~3% not 0.01% that’s 300 times what you said. Yes, while you are right about peanuts not being banned en-masse, people are still careful around people with allergies as severe as that. It’s Like how people that have these allergies still need to eat, immunocompromised people still need to work, and shop for food. Not getting the vaccine is kind of like eating a peanut butter sandwich around someone with severe allergies.</p>

        <p>Yes.  That is what your skull is for.  If you're doing something high impact, you may need additional protection.  But the skull may indeed suffice to protect the brain.  Just like a young healthy immune system may suffice to fight off covid and develop an immunity to it so one can't be severely infected again.</p>

        <p>You always fight Covid with your own immune system. By taking vaccine you are just training it. So if you really get it the bad issues (losing senses, cell fusing and dying,...) won't be that bad and lasting that long. So you protect other people which have not faced Covid before and are not immunised by minimising their infection risc from you.</p>

<p>I don't have any difficulty understanding any of this. But I'm thinking maybe you do, especially based on that comment. Just for the record though, I don't trust the CDC, and I absolutely don't trust pharmaceutical companies, which are 100% in this for the profit, not for saving lives. Just look into their sordid history of lawsuits and underhanded dealings if you don't believe me. If you're cool with trusting them, and the CDC, more power to you. But don't shame people who have well-reasoned issues with doing so, and won't take the vaccine. Shaming others makes you the bad guy, no matter what you may have been led to believe.</p>

        <p>No, the CDC does NOT disagree with me. You simply lack the knowledge to understand the difference. mRNA vaccine TECHNOLOGY is not new, but this is the first time it has been used in a widely deployed vaccine. </p>

        <p>No, I understand completely. You are incorrect. I thought you might try to get cute on the "technology" bit, and almost make a comment about it, but I gave you more credit than that. I guess I thought you were trying to have a more genuine conversationalist than you were. I have extremely well reasoned issues with the CDC, and I'm very well informed. You don't even know what my issues are, and you're judging them. Again, a major assumption that is in error on your part. I am completely consistent. Just because you feel shame for your poor positions, and poorly argued stances, doesn't mean I shamed you. You literally tried to come off like mRNA vaccines were not new, but threw in the "technology" part, thinking you'd trip me up (but you didn't, because I knew about that), but in the end, the reality is, that yes, for all PRACTICAL purposes, these are new to market. What I said was right. So, when I say that I think you "maybe" are having difficulty understanding, it was a legitimate wonder, because of what you had posted. Saying "if you don't wear a mask and take the vaccine you are literally killing people" is shaming. Huge difference. Again, stop with the intellectual dishonesty.</p>

<p>I don't feel shame in my positions... because they are INFORMED by actual comprehension of the science. There is NOTHING new about how mRNA vaccines work. If the viral proteins that serve as antigens in flu vaccines are "cake," mRNA in mRNA vaccines is the "recipe" so that your body can make the "cake" for itself. The concept and it's execution are not meaningfully different.</p>
<p>There is a reason that people have to go to school to work in biomedical research - you cannot reasonably claim that your own "research" is superior to the work done by real scientists.</p>

        <p>Your entire post is barely comprehensible, and no, I didn't make any "conclusions with incomplete information." As I mentioned to the other person below, you objectively, from my many years of professional years experience in the mental health field, are exhibiting behavior indicative of a personality disorder, and anti-social personality disorder in your post. Obviously, this may not accurately reflect who you are in "real life", but then that begs the question of why you act like this online? Again, feel free to laugh, but if you fail to learn from your failures (and I assure you, being an online troll makes you a failure, at least in regard to your online behavior), you're going to repeat them, and live a sad, and unfulfilled life. Up to you. I've tried to help. Be well!</p>

        <p>You shouldn't, because I am excellent at my job, have received many commendations over the years, have literally saved lives and talked people out of suicide, and have always been extremely well liked by the people I serve.

<p>You judging me as a person, because you don't like my views, opinions, or politics on the internet, knowing nothing about me as a person, makes you the asshole, and leads me to believe you are probably suffering from similar disorders as the person I was replying to.

        <p>I'm not the ignorant one, actually. I research everything very deeply, and think for myself, never letting peer pressure, or hive mind dictate my decisions. Anybody who thinks people not wearing masks are "literally" killing people, is a literal moron. Seriously. I just had to explain this to somebody else, so I'm not going through it all again, but the bottom line is that passing on sickness to others is a part of natural life, and always has been. You and I may have contributed to killing somebody of the flu or something else in the past and not known it. That doesn't mean we literally killed somebody. Unless I know I have COVID, and I intentionally pass it on to somebody vulnerable (who will still likely recover), you can't even remotely make that argument with any intellectual honesty. </p>
<p>I could get into the actual truth about the numbers of COVID deaths, and also talk about the number of deaths from other things in other years, but I know you've got your narrative, and talking points, and won't listen, so I'll save my time. To you, your ignorance is bliss. </p>
<p>No, I've never gotten a flu shot, and I never will. I have my reasons, and it's not that I'm universally anti-vax, as I've gotten other vaccines. But because I evaluate every situation I encounter in life on a case by case basis, critically, and with my personal best interests in mind, I take some, and pass on others. I've passed on the flu shot, and I'll always pass on the COVID shot. Aside from that, logically, even comparing the two at this moment is beyond absurd, as the flu shot has been out for a long time, is FDA approved, and has many years of testing, with minimal serious adverse side effects. Nothing in that last sentence can be said about the COVID vaccine, so I frankly think it's absurd everybody's rushing to take it. But hey, to each their own. Just don't try to force your low information decisions on me. </p>
<p>For the record, I have had COVID, and don't think it's a myth, and take it as seriously as it should be taken. But I don't conflate its seriousness to the doomer levels that the Media and current administration does, because I have a brain, and know it's been overblown for political and control purposes. COVID sucks! 0/10, would not recommend! But 99.9% of non-elderly or vulnerable recover, and even the vulnerable still recover. I know somebody who is almost 100 who had it, and recovered. My GF is immunocompromised and got it when I did, and actually recovered quicker than I did. I know there can be lasting issues from it, and I'm not saying go out and try to get it. But live life! Don't live in fear of it! End the lockdowns, and stop destroying businesses, and driving depressed and suicidal people through the doors of my work en-masse! </p>
<p>Also, don't assume just because I don't believe in mask-wearing, and wear them as little as possible, that I disregard store policies, get in belligerent yelling matches in public over them, or don't wear them when I'm around people at work as expected. I may not agree with all of it, but I do respect the wishes of others, when appropriate. Respect is a two-way street though, and my rights and wishes should also be honored, and not attacked ignorantly by people who are just listening to what they're told, and not thinking through everything with nuance for themselves.</p>

        <p>I'm a molecular biologist with many years of experience in BSL 3 virology/immunology laboratories. There is nothing you can possibly say about virology that can trump my extensive personal experience and knowledge, so think twice before calling me ignorant - it just makes you sound like a buffoon. The fact that most people recover from Covid 19 does NOT diminish the seriousness of the half a million Covid 19 deaths in the USA alone. When you say "you've done your research," all you're saying is that you are experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>
<p>It is NOT absurd to compare flu and SARS-Cov2 vaccines. The principle used is almost identical. mRNA vaccine technology is NOT new, contrary to popular (misinformed) opinion - this is just the first time it is being widely deployed. When you get Covid 19, the virus is rapidly producing mRNA ---&rt; viral capsid proteins to reproduce itself. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines simply use a completely safe component of viral mRNA to produce viral proteins to mount an immune response against, which is exactly what the flu vaccines are. </p>
<p>People always focus on anecdotes. "I got covid and I'm fine! My GF got covid and she's fine!" Good for you! That doesn't erase the deaths. </p>
<p>I never accused you of being belligerent in stores... but no, your opinions do NOT deserve respect simply because you have them. You have the right to your opinion. You do NOT have the right to immunity from being criticized for having an ignorant opinion.</p>

        <p>Ah, so because I'm actually a scientist, my perspective is worthless? Don't you have that backwards?</p>
<p>No, I'm not "just" here trolling. I'm hoping that someone will actually realize how crazy it is to fear this vaccine, one of the most important medical advances in recent history no less. Future vaccines will almost certainly utilize the mRNA format as it is so much faster and easier to develop. </p>
<p>I have no problem with you providing counseling to people who need it. Depression is no joke either, and if you can help people out of it, that's great. I just hope that you will realize that your opinion on things outside of your area of expertise is NOT automatically correct simply by virtue of it "making sense" to you.</p>

        <p>I'm absolutely not saying your opinion is worthless because you're a scientist. Thank goodness for scientists like you, and others, and the work you do! But I do think that there's naturally going to be a blind spot when it comes to seeing the product you're creating (remember, pharmaceutical companies view it as a product, an ends to make money - nothing else) as infallible, and that's dangerous. It's dangerous for any profession to think they're infallible, mine included. I have called out many failures in my own agency over the years, and I'm seeing a therapist myself, because I'm not perfect, and have my own hang-ups and issues to address. </p>
<p>Right now, I am highly concerned about this particular vaccine, and I have seen a lot of things to make me that way. However, I also don't see why I can't wait a year or two, see how things shake out, and if my concerns are assuaged, get it then. The PUSH is very problematic to me. Why can't people respect the fact that some people have reasons to be cautious about this? That makes the rush and the rollout all the more suspicious. </p>
<p>I'm not a scientist, but I am very intelligent, and have extremely high logic and reasoning skills. I don't rush to judgement, and I look into things, and if people can convince me a previously held opinion is wrong, logically, and reasonably, then I change. But I don't just change because common perception changes, or the media tells me to, or the Government, CDC. WHO, or Doctors and Scientists tell me to. Any of the above can either be wrong, or be corrupted, and I'm not acquiescing my brain to anybody else, without question. That's just who I am. It doesn't make me ignorant, and in fact, it makes me cautious, and well-researched. Understanding the human psyche, and mental health like I do from my years of experience in the field helps as well. </p>
<p>Again, you seem like an earnest person, and I respect that. I just think we see things very differently when it comes to COVID and the vaccine currently. I will continue to monitor the vaccine situation, and if something changes, that gives me more confidence in it, then I will re-evaluate my stance then. But for now, I'm going to pass, and rely on my God-given immune system that hasn't failed me yet, including against COVID. You take care, and good luck as you continue your scientific work!</p>

        <p>You do not have the right to virus-free or low virus interactions with other humans. You never had that right. Only in the last year have people invented these absurd, impossible, "No virus" rights. Viruses and bacteria have been part of the human biome for millions of years. Get over it. You assume the risk of germ spread when you interact with another organism. It's always been that way. AND IT ALWAYS WILL. Thinking you can live in a world without viral spread is the epitome of anti science. </p>
<p>You have the right to stay home if you don't like germs. You have the right to wear a hazmat suit or mask. You have the right to keep a certain distance from others. But that's about it.</p>

        <p>WHO and the CDC both said similar thing  last year when people started asking them what the heck they were doing, “where is the vaccine?”  Then they released information that said they had a plan to cut the normal time of making a vaccine in half, and then I guess at some point they cut the time in half again. It is pretty crazy that they were able to make this vaccine in only a year and a half after the virus began to spread, and that is assuming they started making the vaccine immediately, which in reality they probably didn’t. </p>
<p>People were so used to having a sickness pop up and then solving the issue in a couple months that this really took people for a loop. The crazy thing is with past sicknesses like the swine flu is that they already had made a vaccine. What took all the time to come out was just mass producing it. This virus seems to have actually come from no where and we were not ready for it unlike past sicknesses. This is why you have so many people who believe that it was a man made virus and not just a part of nature.</p>

<p>This virus did NOT "come from nowhere" - it is actually closely related to the original SARS virus that caused a scare in the early 2000's. The fact that these viruses are so closely related made it a lot easier to develop an effective mRNA vaccine against SARS-Cov-2.</p>

<p>This is again why people think it is man made. It is closely related to existing viruses. Normally viruses mutate over time. Scientists try and predict how they will mutate and make vaccines to counter. This is what happened with the swine and bird flu. They saw the risk and made the vaccine before it even mutated to become transmissible to humans. The Carona virus did not do this so we didn’t have a vaccine ready. </p>
<p>“It's not crazy that they were able to produce these vaccines so quickly”</p>
<p>Oh no it is totally crazy. I meant that as a compliment to the scientists though for figuring out a solution so quickly. Just because the technology exists and has existed doesn’t diminish the accomplishment. It is absolutely amazing what they did. The only question now is, “is it safe.” I think this is a valid question because, well, believe it or not people care about their lives and the lives of people they care about. </p>
<p>And before someone says well if they really cared then they would get the vaccine and wear the mask, you need to understand that those are not sure fire solutions. The doctors recommending them even admit this.</p>

        <p>I'm a molecular biologist with many years of virology research experience, and have taught a virology class at UCLA. Simply put, you do not have a better understanding of viral evolution than I do. Viruses like SARS-Cov-2 exist in the wild in an animal reservoir long before they make the jump to infecting humans. You concept of SARS-Cov-2 popping out of thin air is completely inaccurate, and is simply the result of your ignorance.</p>
<p>It is NOT crazy that they were able to produce these vaccines so quickly. It only <em>seems</em> crazy to you because you don't <em>understand</em> how they were able to do it, and it bucks a trend that you assume is predictive (it isn't). These vaccines are SAFE. Millions upon millions of people have already gotten them. The mechanism by which they generate immunity is NOT significantly different to how earlier types of vaccines do.</p>
<p>Wearing masks and getting vaccinated offer a very, very high level of protection. Nothing is perfect - but now you are quite literally advocating for letting the perfect be the enemy of the nearly perfect.</p>

<p>It is crazy. Science and technology is amazing . I’m sorry that in your infinite wisdom you have some how lost sight of how amazing  it is that people are actually able to do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>“Wearing masks and getting vaccinated offer a very, very high level of protection.”</p>
<p>No no no. If you are really a molecular biologist, (which I do believe you are by the way) then you know this statement just isn’t accurate. </p>
<p>Getting vaccinated? Sure it definitely offers a high level of protection. Again people are just worried about what comes after that, whether it be the next day or 10 years down the line. It is a valid concern. Masks on the other hand.</p>
<p>There is so much to talk about with masks it isn’t even funny. The mask is more to help other people from getting the sickness than it is to prevent you from getting it. This is something they have said multiple times, by multiple leading health professionals. I would assume it is true, but the question I have to wonder is why. If the mask can stop me from spreading it, why wouldn’t it be as effective as far as getting it. I think the answer is simple. It is because masks aren’t enough. When you out on your mask do you wash your hands for 20 seconds in warm water first? Most people don’t. If you had carona on your hands, well congratulations your mask is comprised. You go to the store and your mask itches. You reach up to readjust. Congratulations your mask is compromised. You take your mask off when you get in the car and you didn’t wash your hands first in warm water for 20 seconds, again you have just exposed yourself. If they really wanted people to be safe then they would tell them this. They don’t because they know that if they made the instructions too complicated people would just say screw it I guess I am exposed either way and not even try. I’m not saying masks don’t work. If people used them the right way I am sure you would see a massive difference in case numbers. However that isn’t going to happen, and even if all the anti maskers wore masks, I really don’t think the numbers would change much because of how easy it is to compromise your mask.</p>

        <p>When you first said it is "crazy" that scientists were able to produce these vaccines "so quickly," you were implicitly arguing that they shouldn't be trusted because it happened so fast. Now, having been corrected, you pivot to saying it's "crazy" in a good way. </p>
<p>There is nothing about these vaccines that can have any effect "ten years down the line." mRNA is transient and is generally cleared within a day of being transcribed from DNA. The fact that anti-vaxxers don't understand the science is the ONLY reason they worry about side effects on timescales that make absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>Masks are protective if worn correctly. Many people do not realize that correctly wearing a mask means ensuring that it does not allow air to travel around the edges of the mask, only through the mask material itself. ANY preventative measure fails to protect against illness when not used correctly... that isn't due to the mask being useless, it's due to user error.</p>

        <p>To your first paragraph no. I meant it was crazy because it was hard for me to understand. It isn’t crazy for you because you understand it pretty well. It shouldn’t be trusted because it literally just came out. Maybe after 5 years we can look at the data and so how reliable it actually is. </p>
<p>Too your second point there is more vaccines than just the mRNA one. The mRNA one is definitely the most interesting though.</p>

        <p>I am aware that he was talking about covid, I merely wanted to point out that covid is not ‘something as little as the common cold’. Yes, the death rate may not be terribly high when compared with other illnesses, but this does not mean that we don’t need to vaccinate against it. Also, you used flu as an example, saying that they are similar in regards to the death rate. We have a flu vaccine, if they are so similar there is no reason not to have a covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>I agree with you but why coukdnt they use traditional trued and tested vaccine technology instead of this new 9 month old mRNA tech. Seems strange and that’s the main reason I will not be getting it. I did get my flu shot last year as I am asthmatic and I see no reason not to take a proper tested vaccine that has been around for years and shown no ill side effects</p>

        <p>You are assuming that the vaccine prevents you from getting the virus. From what I have read about the mRNA vaccine what it actually does is make you asymptotic. This means you could totally still spread the virus, you just wouldn’t show symptoms, so people who didn’t get the virus because of reasons like you suggest would have no benefit. </p>
<p>Immunity doesn’t mean the virus can’t be in you and on you. It just means it can’t effect you. For example I am immune to poison ivy. I can carry that stuff around and never break out. Now if I shove the stuff down my buddys shirt, even though I am immune, he will still break out. Same principles should apply to Carona virus. </p>
<p>This is most likely why doctors still recommend people to wear masks even if they have had the vaccine.</p>

        <p>This is a single subreddit. What makes you think  we represent that majority of Americans? I’d say enough Americans and either stupid or misinformed enough to get the vaccine and make sure you get your precious herd immunity. </p>
<p>Death is a natural part of life. It’s inevitable. And if you die from a virus that has common cold symptoms and is 99% survivable, I’d consider that mercy from nature, because you could’ve gotten something way worse. Not everyone is going to survive covid and they shouldn’t. It would be unnatural. Death exists. Let’s stop acting like it didn’t until covid came along</p>

<li>I never said that you represent the majority of Americans - just that people like you represent a dangerously large plurality of Americans. Does that clarify things for you?</li>
<li>"Death is a natural part of life" - Oh brother, you're one of those. Well, guess you should never get treatment for any life-threatening conditions you develop later in life then, right? I mean, surgery is dangerous too. How far down this absurd rabbit hole have you gone? If there were an ebola outbreak in the US, would you refuse the vaccine?</li>

<p>No that doesn’t clarify anything really. Plus I’m not even American, jokes on you</p>

<p>If there’s a chance you might survive it then get treatment. But I would take that matter into my own hands, not try and force others to change for my own benefit. Every day we do things that could kill us. Driving, eating, drinking, living. Literally anything could kill us, so to try and avoid anything dangerous is ridiculous. And I’d get an Ebola vaccine if it seemed like the benefit outweighed the risk. It certainly doesn’t with the covid shot</p>

<li>Guess you don't know what the word "plurality" means then. A plurality is a submajority group of people. 40% of a population is a plurality, for example. I don't think people like you represent the majority of Americans... you represent a plurality. Is that clear enough for you now?</li>
<li>There is virtually no risk with getting the covid vaccine. Do you realize how many people on earth have already been fully vaccinated? How many do you think have been negatively affected by the vaccine vs. by the virus? Your ignorance of the data is NOT a good reason to believe whatever narrative you fancy.</li>

<p>Yes thank you very clear. I did not know what plurality meant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know plenty of people who have been hurt or killed by the vaccine, and no one, including myself, who has been hurt or killed by covid. So either I surround myself with healthy people with good immune systems (which I do) or covid is relatively harmless unless you’ve got some nasty comorbidities and the vaccine has some nasty side effects. You say there’s no risk, but the AstraZeneca vaccine has stopped being used in most of Europe for causing blood clots in waaaay too many people</p>

        <p>The AstraZeneca vaccine has an extremely low chance of causing blood clots. From the European Medicines Agency website:</p>
<p>"These are rare cases – around 20 million people in the UK and EEA had received the vaccine as of March 16 and EMA had reviewed only 7 cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels (disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC) and 18 cases of CVST. A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and deserves further analysis."</p>
<p>I don't believe you when you say you know "plenty of people who have been hurt or killed by the vaccine" unless you really just mean "have had normal side effects." </p>
<p>I never said there was no risk, I said the risk is <em>extremely</em> small. The stats I cited above back that claim up.</p>

        <p>Yes it can, I know 8 people who've had Covid,  they're all fine. </p>
<p>80% of cases are mild as per the CDC and WHO. And the overwhelming majority of people who are hospitalized are obese, have multiple co morbidities and are extremely old. But don't take my word for it:</p>

        <p>Of course intubation isn’t always the right choice. It’s pretty much the last choice when nothing else has worked. I don’t know what the patients condition were before but they are young. Working in the healthcare field I know many, many coworkers and patients who have had Covid. Many fat ones were fine and many thin ones weren’t. The issue with you people is that you’ve never actually had to deal with Covid face to face. So it’s like this imaginary monster to you. You truly know nothing.</p>
