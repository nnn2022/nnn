    <strong>Do you feel the NPC meme is true?</strong>
    <p><p>Feel free to re-post this to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart">r/iamverysmart</a>.  Forgive me if this is blunt, you may disagree with what I say which is  fine, but I need to vent. Sorry for bad English but is not my native  language.</p>
<p>Recently I have become very distant from the vast majority of people.  Not through my own decisions, with lockdown they've isolated themselves  from me (I've been open this whole time to partaking in activites).  After this is all over, they think I'm coming back and will continue as  normal? Lol, it shows what true friends they are when they wont even  meet up, even if it's legal to do so now.</p>
<p>I swear everyone I know in real life just goes along with what the  media tells them, easily drawn into the divide and conquer narrative  pushed all day every day. I can't even watch TV or listen to the radio  anymore, even for a few seconds. Even sources and organisations that I  thought were trustworthy and unbiased are deep, manipulative propaganda,  filled with hidden agendas, it feels like mind control.</p>
<p>People follow whatever is popular like sheep, so desperate to fit in  and conform with what the narratives tell them. Music, movies, opinions.  Their hypocracy is astonoshing. For example, lets say I'm talking to a  stranger in the street. I'll express an opinion, a bit later they'll  pretty much repeat exactly what I said, either to "conform" to me or  they're just thick and don't even have their own thoughts. They will  virtue signal about masks and "sTaY tHe FuCk At HoMe We'RE IN THE MIDDLE  OF A FUCKING PANDEMIC!!1111!!!", then the next day post a picture of  themselves on Facebook, at the beach, with their friends, without a  mask...</p>
<p>Life is just a game, a bit like chess, without sounding like a  sociopath manipulating people is extremely easy as the majority of  people don't seem to have much of an intuition at all. Get a 40 year  mortage, car on finance, work 50 hours a week, watch the same shit TV  series, consume plastic junk to keep up and impress with the other  normies. No wonder, when drugs, alcohol, pornography, TV, fast food turn  people into a 24/7 zombie like "NPC" state. Maybe people like us could  use it to our own advantage, if you're not already. Or maybe you're one  of those people I'm talking about, so terrified to step out of line and  do or think something different.</p></p>

        <p>Yes. That said half the people I get into conversations with on Reddit seem to be actual bots, to the point where they don't make sense.</p>
