    <strong>For all the anti-mask/vax people: what evidence do you guys have?</strong>
    <p><p>Not trying to be facetious, I actually want to listen to your POV. </p>
<p>I see people all over social media (and to a lesser extent irl) saying “everyone who wears a mask is a sheep” and all that stuff, but whenever I ask them why masks are bad (or why covid is a hoax or anything in that vein) they just respond with more insults. I’ve tried to google it but I can only find studies with “pro mask” conclusions or just people ranting on Twitter with no evidence.</p>
<p>So here I am, a “government sheep” who actively wants to understand your position. I’m not gonna be replying to comments (unless someone directs a question at me) because I don’t want this to be seen as me trying to bait an argument, I just want to see the evidence for these claims (feel free to provide evidence for any other similar, against the grain claims such as “covid is a hoax” or “scientists are lying to us”). </p>
<p>Also, I get that in order to commit to a position like the ones mentioned you have to believe that scientists are either lying or wrong, so I’ll accept “lower quality” evidence such as self conducted experiments or logical chains with no hard evidence. Cheers</p></p>

        <p>You could say that about SO many things.  That's just such an asinine statement.  </p>
<p>Here, I can play too:  Anybody who doesn't talk about the fact that over 3 times as many people die <em>every year</em>, year after year after year from hunger than have died from C-19 in every country combined, but instead only talks about C-19 deaths is not exactly a humanitarian.  Not exactly a surprise.</p>

        <p>The burden of proof is on those who would encourage us to change from what we were doing before all this bullshit started.  </p>
<p>Masks - No thanks.  If you think I should wear it, prove that it will help me. After I see your proof, I'll be able to make up my own mind - my body, my choice.</p>
<p>Vaccine - Not for me.  If it matters to you whether I get it, get bent.  Focus on your own health and get it yourself, if you care.  It's experimental, which means the safety data is not yet collected, and it's already been proven not to stop infection.  Does not stop infection = Does not work.</p>

        <p>1 - Scientists, including Fauci, said before all this went nuts that masks are not really that useful. 2 weeks later they changed the narrative completely. Same with WHO and their covid guidelines. Saying shit one week only to change it the next. I wonder what is the point in trusting people that, at the very best, have no clue about what they are doing.</p>
<p>2 - Many doctors said that mandatory masks, lockdowns and over alcholizing hands are bad because the body needs to be exposed to certain viruses in order to mantian a good inmune system. Also, lack of vitamin D. They were all censored from youtube.</p>
<p>3 - My aunt got the vax. Aswell as the entire nursing home where she works as a chief hairdresser. She got sick for 2 days after the second shot and luckily she is fine now. She wasnt given any proof of vaccination and was asked to get vaxed again. Also, she isn't allowed to work, but she is lucky I am solvent to help her economically. Others don't have that luck. So at this point she is asking herself what is the point of taking it. And so do I.</p>
<p>4 - If this is a very super duper serious pandemic, how come all the money goes to affairs like saving banks and corporations or to give it out to foreign countries while people are starving? Wasnt it that "all lives matter" and "we are all in this together"? Apparently only when we have to suffer there is "us" but not when we need help. In reality there is no "us", we suffer the consecuences and they reap the benefits. My country borrowed 11kmil Euros for "covid relief" meassures. No business owner has seen a dime yet.</p>
<p>5 - The vax doesn't prevent transmission, doesn't prevent infection, and doesn't ensure your safety even short term (not to mention long term or sterility effects are completely untested regardless of what anyone says). Plus if something happens to you because of it well "suck it up buddy", because big pharma cant be held liable nor government. Ask yourself why would they shield themselves so much if their only concern was to "save lives".</p>
<p>6 - Masks aren't "harmless". If you are using non-cloth masks you are harming the natural environment. Millions of masks are polluting the oceans as we speak. These masks are syntetic and are made of chemicals and microplastics. Plus viruses thrive in warm and humid eco-systems, just like that space in your mask when you breathe. Not to mention the oxygen levels decrease and CO2 levels increase. Yout body needs oxygen and expels CO2, think about it.</p>
<p>7 - The richest people in the planet accomplished the biggest wealth transfer in history in their favor during the "worst pandemic of all times". I am pretty sure they want it to end fast, do they?</p>
<p>8 - Bill Gates, a guy who got himself an international tech company while not being a computer engineer, is now telling you to trust his methods while, again, not being a scientist. Oh and also he is buying land like crazy now. This is the same guy who funds almost every vax in the market through Bill N Melinga Gates fundation. He has oppenly admitted several times on camera that he wants to de-populate the world. In fact, his experiments with vaxes in other countries harmed a lot of third world vulnerable people. He is banned from India. Also Big Pharma paid millions in fines for vaxes experiments and not only once. And you guys want us to trusts their vaxes.</p>
<p>I could go on the whole day but those are some points. You can perfectly google them or search in duckduckgo.</p>

        <p>First off asymptomatic spread is very rare so the entire basis for universal masking is flawed. Here is a meta-analysis of household transmission studies, one of the easiest settings for transmission, that found the secondary attack rate for asymptomatic infections is only .7%.</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102</p>
<p>Here is a review article by 2 respiratory protection specialists, it's a good read as they also have an edit defending their views.</p>
<p>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
<p>Here are two meta-analyses of mask effectiveness in regards to influenza and influenza like illness transmission.</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994-t1</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504</p>
<p>Also even the latest observational study done by the CDC which I'm sure is heavily biased at this point since they have been touting them as nearly a panacea for the past year only found an association with a 1.8% case growth reduction.</p>

        <p>I am not anti-mask or anti-vaccine.   If I eat cashews and peanuts, but don't like walnuts, it's silly to call me anti-nut.</p>
<p>(Most of this is copy-pasted from previous posts)</p>
<p>As for the shots being offered.  It is not a "vaccine". The definition of vaccine changed in January to include mRNA shots. (Compare Jan 18 to Jan 26.)</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine</p>
<p>The Moderna company refers to their technology as an 'Operating System'.   It is a money-making tool, as they can create endless RNA 'apps' to load into people.  I do not want some company programming my cells.</p>
<p>https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development</p>
<p>The mRNA shot does not confere immunity. Nor does it prevent transmission.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things that are really not well understood as people ask, why should I even have to wear a mask after I get my second shot? And the reason is very clear that the primary endpoint of the vaccine trial was clinically apparent infection. So you could conceivably get infected, get no symptoms and still have virus in your nasal pharynx, which means that you would have to wear a mask to prevent you from infecting someone else, as well as the other side of the coin, where you may not be totally protected yourself,” says Fauci.</p>
<p>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dr-fauci-says-dont-getting-124521340.html</p>
<p>mRNA is a new technology never before used in humans. It has been under experimental use for some time. The current 'vaccines' are only approved for emergency use.</p>
<p>"Researchers have been trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-1) outbreak in 2002. Thus, over a span of 18 years there have been numerous coronavirus vaccine animal studies conducted, which unfortunately demonstrated significant and serious side-effects. Either the animals were not completely protected, became severely ill with accelerated autoimmune conditions, or died."</p>
<p>https://www.biologicalmedicineinstitute.com/post/covid-19-mrna-vaccines</p>
<p>The whole charade is part of the Great Reset.   A plan to install a world-wide technocracy.   Review the excellent work of Corbett. (http://www.corbettreport.com) Also review the good work of Computing Forever on bit chute dot com.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence available from many sources outside of mainstream media, which purposfully silences any opposing opinions.  </p>
<p>I don't believe "scientists" are lying or wrong.   Fauci is not a scientist.  He's a grifter and a long time political hack who's been in that position for too long and now is drunk on his own ego.   There are thousands of actively practicing doctors and scientists who contradict all that he says.   </p>
<p>Scientists for pharma companies are paid for by them and will find results that keep them getting paid.   They are people like anyone else.</p>
<p>This should be enough to get you started.</p>

        <p>To me it's just common sense.  In the beginning, we were told a 2 week lock down to flatten the curve.  We did that.  I did that. It was a new to us virus and we didn't want the hospitals overloaded.  But then after 2 weeks, the rules and the goalposts kept changing and moving until here we are over a year later.  The general population appears to have been conditioned to feel like they are doing something wrong if they are not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>We never did any of this when there was a SARS outbreak. We didn't do this when there was an Ebola outbreak. We used to joke about how airplanes are flying Petri dishes.  Maybe we had forgotten basic germ hygiene, but even when a flu season was particularly bad, we never had this.  With the exception of the mask, your basic COVID protection plan is to wash your hands, don't pick your nose, and don't lick doorknobs and such.  Basic hygiene the human race has successfully observed for a few hundred years now without a mandatory vaccine. </p>
<p>How is it logical to have all of these lock down measures for a virus that has such a high recovery rate? Why a mandatory vaccine when there is such a high recovery rate?</p>
<p>Why was the vaccine out so fast? Does that mean that the 5 year timeframe for previous vaccines was a ploy by the pharmaceutical companies to bilk development costs? Or is that a valid timeline to test it and make sure there aren't any permanent adverse side effects? Or is this vaccine not quite as vetted and safe as they claim, and there might be side effects that we wouldn't care for?</p>
<p>My 25 yr old son has MS, and can't wait to get the vaccine.  They are rumors that the vaccine interferes with reproductive systems.  Yes, it's a rumor, but what if it's true? He and his wife might never be able to have children because of this? That's not up to anyone else to make that decision for them.</p>
<p>That's what bothers me the most. People are being denied the option to make decisions about their own health care.  Doctors are prohibited from forcing a medical treatment on anyone that is of sound mind.  But the Governor with no medical training can say you must get this vaccine?  It's just not logical.</p>
<p>Thank you for asking.  Always ask Why.</p>

        <p>Outside of the fact that the manufacturers have been released from ALL legal liability, and that the trials aren't wrapped up until 2023 I don't see a point in receiving a vax when the survival rate is already around 99%. I followed this since before it was even being talked about in the US and was flabbergasted when Biden and the rest called the move to block Chinese flights as racism, back then the CFR was expected to be high with the psyop vids coming out of china showing people just dropping in the street and in hospital hallways. Of course this was all proven to be 100% false purely by the fact that if it was as dangerous as the vids showed we would have had a massive loss of or homeless population in CA and other cities.</p>
<p>The government/people in power were willing to lie then so what is to say they aren't lying now? When wont you be fooled again?</p>

        <p>I appreciate your post and we need more dialogues to bridge the gap at a time where we are quite divided. No, I do not deny COVID. No, I am not anti-mask or pro-mask... I'm pro-choice, same with the vaccine.</p>
<p>My issue with this pandemic right from the beginning is how it has been handled. This has become so much more than an epidemiological issue and is now a media and political talking point. Limited evidence has been produced with masks. How is it that I get murdered for going into a store without a mask, but it's acceptable if I wear a scarf over my face? People are so charged against one another and identify one another by mask wearing. </p>
<p>How has COVID been handled? Snitch lines. Perhaps some people would rather risk COVID than live for years in isolation. It seems we are becoming more fearful of COVID as the pandemic rolls out. We have more treatment for COVID yet there is more fear-mongering. </p>
<p>I feel that at this point, governments have to prove that their interventions will make meaningful change. This goes for curfews, etc. </p>
<p>And... STOP MOVING THE GOALPOST.</p>

        <p>One big piece of evidence is that Florida has had virtually no lockdowns or mask mandates and their numbers related to Covid have been better than all other states that had extensive lockdowns and mask mandates, all while having a larger percentage of their population be elderly and supposedly more susceptible to the virus.</p>

<p>Probably true. If you want search results that agree with you, use Google. They are highly curated and pushing a specific narrative. If you want search results that are organic, use any other search engine.</p>

        <p>I said I wouldn’t reply but I’m making (another) exception just to clear one thing up: I typically use duckduckgo. The first page of results that I get when I look up “anti mask evidence” is stuff like “19 things anti maskers say that will make you question humanity” or “a review of anti mask ‘evidence’ disproven”. </p>
<p>Obviously I’m not saying those types of things back up the pro mask side, just that’s all I’ve been able to find when I look specifically for anti mask evidence. Using neutral language returns the results I mentioned above. That’s why I came here to just ask people directly</p>

        <p>Florida and Texas. Check the numbers. I cannot conceive of anything more damning than the cold reality that masks and lockdowns accomplish nothing. </p>
<p>The common rebuttal is so idiotic, it's hardly worth mentioning. They argue "<em>some</em> people still wearing masks and distancing are preventing the spread"... while using <em>the exact same excuse</em> for why it's spreading in lockdown states. "<em>Some</em> people aren't following the rules!"</p>
<p>Any and all arguments for masks and lockdowns are just drowning in cognitive dissonance</p>

        <p>Current Vaccines:
- Still being tested, not even halfway finished clinical trials
- History of coronavirus vaccines suggests compelling risk of ADE
- mRNA tech never been approved for human use
- Risk of Prion Disease</p>
<p>The International Journal of Clinical Practice:</p>
<p>“COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐ 19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.”</p>
<p>“The risk of ADE in Covid-19 vaccines is non-theoretical and compelling”</p>
<p>“Clinical trials of vaccine candidates have only been designed around immunogenicity as an efficacy end point and have not been designed to capture exposure of subjects to circulating virus after vaccination, which is when ADE/immunopathology is designed to occur. Thus, the absence of ADE evidence in COVID‐19 vaccine data so far does not absolve investigators from disclosing the risk of enhanced disease to vaccine trial participants, and it remains a realistic, non‐theoretical risk to the subjects.”https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13795</p>
<p>Vaccine Journal</p>
<p>“Examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of</p>
<p>page26image665152 page26image665344page26image665536
Page 26</p>
<p>different virus families. Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon.”</p>
<p>“Vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines.” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19022319/</p>
<p>Nature Microbiology Journal:</p>
<p>“Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody- dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials”</p>
<p>“For non-macrophage tropic respiratory viruses such as RSV and measles, non- neutralizing antibodies have been shown to induce ADE and ERD by forming immune complexes that deposit into airway tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways, resulting in inflammation, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. These prior observations of ADE with RSV and measles have many similarities to known COVID-19 clinical presentations.” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5</p>
<p>PLOS Journal:</p>
<p>“SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS- CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2- type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.”</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/</p>
<p>Nature Journal:</p>
<p>“Before allowing use of a COVID-19 vaccine in humans, regulators should evaluate safety with a range of virus strains and in more than one animal model.”</p>
<p>“Work with the SARS virus shows that worrying immune responses were seen in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice. Also, some viral protein fragments can elicit more potent or less risky immune responses than others, and it makes sense to learn this in animal studies before trying them in people.”https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-9</p>

<p>Journal of Veterinary Medical Science: vaccine developed against another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), increased cats’ risk of developing the disease caused by the virus. Survival rate for vaccinated cats dropped to 50%, while that of the unvaccinated cats remained at 100%</p>
<p>“In this study, when cats passively immunized with anti-FIPV-I KU-2 antibodies were orally inoculated with FIPV-I KU-2, FIP was caused at a 50% probability, i.e., FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection caused FIP by inducing antibody-dependent enhancement.”</p>
<p>“The survival rate of cats with passive immunization was lower than that of the cats without passive immunization, and the average survival time after infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was also shorter.”https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/81/6/81_18-0702/_pdf/-char/en</p>
<p>Clinical and Vaccine Immunology Journal:
“In 1967, infants and toddlers immunized with a formalin-inactivated vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) experienced an enhanced form of RSV disease characterized by high fever, bronchopneumonia, and wheezing when they became infected with wild-type virus in the community. Hospitalizations were frequent, and two immunized toddlers died upon infection with wild-type RSV.”https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189</p>
<p>The Lancet Journal:</p>
<p>“We are writing to express concern about the use of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vector for a COVID-19 phase 1 vaccine study, and subsequent advanced trials. Over a decade ago, we completed the Step and Phambili phase 2b studies that evaluated an Ad5 vectored HIV-1 vaccine administered in three immunisations for efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. Both international studies found an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among vaccinated men.” https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32156-5/fulltext</p>

        <p>Honestly reading these comments feels like we're going backwards in human evolution. I live in Perth Western Australia. We did a small lockdown start of the pandemic and have been covid free majority of the year. We aren't forced to wear masks, pubs and clubs are at full capacity. All because our leaders trusted in science. We quarantine all our travellers for 2 weeks in hotels or at their homes and they get tested, the people in my state (and a fair bit of australia too) have had a normal life this whole pandemic because of these rules. </p>
<p>Lockdowns worked at stopping stopping any outbreaks that popped up and I think you'll find the majority of australians are happy to give up certain freedoms for our countrymen. We did it during our wars, we're doing it now. If anyone was remotely curious about 'why australians would give up their freedoms' you should look into the history of aussie mateship, it grew out of the wars and is the idea of communities coming together during times of hardship. </p>
<p>I expect the downvotes but wanted to give a different perspective from the land down under</p>

        <p>You forgot to add that Australians are stopped from returning home due to flight caps. It costs the person returning $3k per person. People are locked up in a hotel for 2 weeks even without ever testing positive for Covid.</p>
<p>Western Australia has kept its border closed to the rest of Australian states for a year. You done a 3 day snap full lock down for 3 days a few months ago for 1 case. All businesses closed for 3 days except grocery stores, no one was allowed to leave their house except for 1 hour exercise a day then had to wear masks for 2 weeks straight even if you just stepped out the door. </p>
<p>The government has a big fucking boot on your neck and you are cheering it on yourself. Believe me the government isn’t believing in science, they believe in their new found Authoritarian, especially state premiers and CHO.</p>
