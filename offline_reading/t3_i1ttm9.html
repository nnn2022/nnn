        <p>That has to be the worst logic I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Should businesses not enforce any rules at all because patrons might become belligerent? </p>
<p>Are you saying that businesses shouldn't enforce mask rules because people who don't believe in their use are psycho?</p>

        <p>This is not the black death. There's no need for "social distancing" because your immune system will account for it, just like it has for many thousands of years of human existance. If you believe in social distancing or masks, then you've bought the lie.</p>

        <p>Regardless, that isn't what OP said. He said business owners shouldn't enforce regulations because people would get belligerent and attack employees.</p>
<p>So either he thinks this applies across all regulations, or he thinks people opposed to masks are more likely to physically assault retail workers for being asked to follow regulations.</p>
<p>Edit: by OPs logic, the place in the story, a bar, shouldn't cut off or refuse to serve drunk patrons because they might get belligerent and attack employees, even though that's the law. Bouncers shouldn't remove unruly patrons from bars because they're not police... This could go all day.</p>
