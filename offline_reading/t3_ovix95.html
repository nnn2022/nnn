    <strong>It’s so funny how the picture is painted as if there is no science behind the reasons for not getting a Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Before anything, regardless of whether it was intentional or an accident, we can pretty much safely say this virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a study that was supposedly put in place to learn about viruses to prevent such an event; literally ended up doing the reverse. They took naturally found viruses and made them stronger and more transmissible just to see what happens. So if anything science caused this mess, or at least this brand of arrogant science where a human thinks it is above nature and has the answers for anything.</p>
<p>Now to try to solve the problem, we’re using the same form of science again even though:</p>
<p>1- There are already signs of the vaccines being cytotoxic.</p>
<p>2- No long term studies on the effects of gene therapy. </p>
<p>3- So many females reporting ovarian type issues after taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>4- Literally any side effect getting pushed to the side, or: “we’re developing a booster shot for that.”</p>
<p>Are the above not science or scientific arguments against the vaccine? Or does science only mean just follow what you want to be true and don’t ever consider any risks, cos who needs em. </p>
<p>Just know that at one point in history, brandy was marketed as part of a good diet and cigarette smoking was the practice of the young and healthy, fridges were sold with CFC’s causing the hole in the ozone layer, and up until just recently, global warming was seen as a myth. Those ideas haven’t aged well. I guess time will tell with these rushed vaccines, but as I’m seeing it, looks like another round of humanity not learning from its history, so it is destined to repeat it.</p></p>
