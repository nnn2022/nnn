    <strong>How do you stay sane during all this?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I guess that question in the title is more of an opportunity for me to rant and collect my thoughts on this mess. Heads up, this is gonna be a bit longer. And, I know you guys don't like doomers, so tl;dr: I think doom is upon society unavoidably and I'm struggling to stay sane facing it.</p>
<p>These times are really taking a toll on my mental health. I have many things weighing on me as it is, one of which is the feeling of not belonging anywhere in this world - which now makes perfect sense, seeing how society unmasked itself to be the crumbly facade that I always sort of new it was but didn't want to be true. Spineless cowards everywhere, mindlessly regurgitating what some authority said 9 months ago, and being not only offended by me questioning the ruthless nature of that method of pandemic response - they literally treat me as a threat to public health. The deepfelt hatred I experienced from counter protesters at an ENTIRELY peaceful march continues to baffle me. How can people be so blinded? How are they ever going to turn away from their course if they have defended it with such vigour? I'm sure many of them must have doubts, subconsciously, but it scares them to let the possibility of being wrong occupy their minds even for a second. So instead of facing their feelings they pick the target the media conveniently presents to them on a sliver platter: those who want to kill grandmas. Get them! It's textbook bullying. </p>
<p>When I imagine the day some supreme court will have ruled the corona measures unconstitutional, key players are being convicted all around the world - and this is a very optimistic scenario - even then I can't see how all those self-proclaimed "antifa" warriors, those smug media puppets, nearly all mainstream politicians will say "well... guess we were wrong". It's not going to happen. But we can't put them all in jail, logistically, but also morally. People are being abused by a power they trusted to be unabuseable. They pride themselves with having overcome racism and sexism and homophobia and whatnot so there is no way this progressive political spirit can be corrupted. Hollywood and all the media cannot have lied that whole time! So they use mental gymnastics to avoid the soul shattering conclusion that our whole way of living is based on lies. Because once you accept the possibility that global leaders will go as far letting hundreds of millions of people starve to death, let alone potentially actively harm people by vaccinations, you know this extends way beyond corona. You have to question everything. It is literally like taking the red pill in matrix. </p>
<p>So it is a psychological defense mechanism of people choosing flight over fight, sort of like stockholm syndrome. I get it. For me it hasn't been easy to accept all this. I mean, there was a period in my life when I got into the whole illuminati conspiracy theories, also 9/11 left a lingering doubt in my mind. But when I got older I stopped occupying myself with these things and thought they were childish myths, that I'm sure there is a good explanation for all of this. Now I realize, some, if not most of these theories, are probably firmly routed in truth: There is a widespread global shadow government who are using their secret service to exert their powers in nearly all critical political and economic junction points. This realization is frightening. It is a seemingly omnipresent and omnipotent power that, right now, is actively attacking each and everyone of us. It's David vs. Goliath, where David has a slingshot and Goliath has a self reproducing army of droid soldiers.</p>
<p>And because I see no peaceful way out of this mess, I can't focus on building a good life for myself. All I can think about is that doom is upon society. If I'm lucky I might get out of this alive, but life as I know it will certainly change dramatically. </p>
<p>I have to think about this shit almost 24/7. I live in a big city and can't just go out in the forest for an hour or something like that. I have no job right now, no money, not many friends, I'm not dating because as you can imagine, I'm not exactly a joy to be around. I'm grumpy, I'm bitter, I try to not blanketly hate people but when I see someone crossing the street, on their own, wearing their stupid mask... it's hard.</p>
<p>I'm turning into an asshole. I wouldn't wanna meet me right now. I hate that kind of negative person I'm becoming. I'm gonna start going to therapy soon and it's about fucking time! This crisis has spiralled my depression into unknown depths.</p>
<p>Sorry to unload my self-pity in here. I'm just tired of this shit and needed to get this off my chest. </p>
<p>(can you imagine how fast I'd be banned on r/offmychest with this?)</p></p>

        <p>Good for you! I personally don't believe in God, but I have an aunt who is a very devout christian and I have talked to her about this. I told her that I don't believe in God, but I see the devil working here. It's really frightening...</p>

<p>Wow, if THAT doesn't tell your loved ones that there's something seriously wrong with this situation, there's no helping them, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>It's just like with me being a known, anxious hypochondriac with obsessive-compulsive tendencies saying this new abnormal is all BS.</p>
