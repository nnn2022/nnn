    <strong>Mask is a sheep beacon.</strong>
    <p><p>At this point,  509 days into 15 days to stop the spread, I see everyone who still wears a mask voluntarily, where it's not required, especially outdoors, or when driving in the car alone, as a zombie. A somewhat harmless, but a zombie nonetheless. These sheep just go with the narrative, quietly complying with no end goal in sight. Are we doomed, or is there a way to redpill the mask zombies?</p></p>

        <p>I wear a mask but I don't find myself superior to anyone and I certainly don't judge anyone. I wear a mask because I want to protect myself. When you go for surgery the surgeon wears a mask not you. I choose not to get vaccinated but I've seen some research that suggests that the vaccinated may be mutating and spreading a variant that would ultimately be more harmful to the unvaccinated. It's just a theory but its happened in chickens. Don't laugh!  it's called mareks disease. </p>

        <p>The mask doesn't protect you. A surgeon wears a mask so he doesn't drool on you while he preforms surgery. Thats it. </p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/black-lives-matter-protests-haven-t-led-covid-19-spikes-n1232045</p>
<p>But lockdown protests did? </p>

<p>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-anti-lockdown-protests-spread-us-mobile-data-a9520561.html</p>
<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>

        <p>You are preaching to the choir. But since this is a place of free expression, I respectfully decline and I'll wear the mask. I'm Not wearing a mask cause I've been told too. If that were the case I would just get the vaccine. Honestly we are getting fucked with all the other freedoms taken away. The mask while symbolic of the oppression is not what's costing us our freedom. Plus my personal mask stance helps me get across our anti forced vaccination stances to the super vaxxers a little better, which i think is the real war on out liberties right now.</p>

        <p>Yes yiu are an idiot if you think masks protect the wearer. They don't. Let me explain how masks work like you are someone with an iq of 12. A mask keeps you from spreading a disease to another person, it does not keep you from getting a disease. There are hundreds of thousands of studies showing this. Wearing the masks while you are perfectly healthy is worthless. It's a virtue signal for you. You just got butthurt because someone is challenging your niave worldview.</p>

        <p>It's not a virtue signal are you that insecure.I could give a fuck  less how anybody feels about me and I don't have enough energy to be some moralist and feign superiority. You are missing the point you see a mask wearer and you see red. Check yourself. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087517/">IMPORTANCE Airborne simulation experiments showed that cotton masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks provide some protection from the transmission of infective SARS-CoV-2 droplets/aerosols; however, medical masks (surgical masks and even N95 masks) could not completely block the transmission of virus droplets/aerosols even when sealed.</a>  some is better than none.</p>

        <p>No you are definitely virtue signaling...you even made it a point to say you do think you are superior to anyone. Thats usually a tactic used by virtue signaling asshats to show humility when they are bragging about something they are doing...its called a humble brag. </p>
<p>I haven't feigned superiority...I've just called you out on your stupidity. </p>
<p>Ok and your link...thats a simulation....you do understand I can program in any variable I want to make a simulation say anything I want. They are worthless and bias. Again you are spewing propaganda.</p>

        <p>Yes yes you are. Why do you need a mask if you are completely healthy and covid is basically the flu? Did you wear masks before covid? I doubt it.</p>

        <p>Yes, I worked in a hospital (security )and since I refused the flu shot I had to wear the mask. It sucked and I was the only one. Don't  trust flu or covid shots. That was from 2015-2018. Anyways you seem to like to research. So check on mareks or antibody dependent enhancement. There's bigger problems than masks. What do you personally believe the end game to all this lockdown and bullshit is? I think it's part of a plan to crash the economies to usher in a new economic system. I also think depopulation is a goal. That's why I'm set that the vaccine is very harmful and also the potential for a mutation that will wipe people out.

        <p>Yes the vaccine is harmful, I'm very aware of this. And yes I'm aware of the great reset and agenda 2030. I'm also aware of the push for socialism in the west. </p>
<p>That doesn't excuse the point that you think masks protect you. They don't and never did. Time to take off the mask and express true freedom.</p>

        <p>ps not afraid of covid at this stage more afraid of the vaccine and a potential for this partial vaccination process to mutate into a stronger strain. It's happened before https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/tthis-chicken-vaccine-makes-virus-dangerous</p>
