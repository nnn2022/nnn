    <strong>A message I'm trying to get out there to combat all the hate on social media - Self-Care Isn't Selfish</strong>
    <p><p>Trying to get this message out there to the people breathing flames over so-called 'selfish' people - the ones who blame and bash anyone who goes against lockdown policies or breaks quarantine rules, such as not wearing a mask or walking down the street for longer than an hour. The absolute hate and vitriol and turning on each other is overwhelming compared to sympathy for those with mental health issues or physical health issues affected greatly by the governments' lockdown policies</p>
<p>Self-Care Isn't Selfish</p>
<p>Before you go around calling someone 'selfish' for not wearing a mask, or going for a walk, or meeting a friend, or breaking some other silly quarantine law - remember that you have no idea about who that person is or what they are going through. Remember that you are asking them to submit to your demands so you can feel safe. </p>
<p>Remember that you aren't thinking about those with depression or other mental health issues that have had their issues multiplied by lockdown and lack of human contact, and that you're demanding they sacrifice their mental health so you can feel safe. </p>
<p>Remember that lockdown policy is directly causing the deaths of people suffering from cancer and other ailments through missed treatments, and will cause the deaths of many others through delayed diagnoses, and that you're demanding they sacrifice their health, and in some instances their lives, so that you can feel safe. </p>
<p>Remember that lockdowns in the first world are directly contributing to hunger and death in the third world, and we're not talking several thousands, we're talking millions of deaths and hundreds of millions starving, and you're demanding they sacrifice their lives so that you can feel safe. </p>
<p>The only 'selfish' ones are the people who demand everyone else must live as they demand, or else they deserve to be fined, assaulted and arrested. People don't deserve violence and bullying over masks and going outside. Everything we do in life comes with a degree of risk. You're grown men and women - start acting like it.</p></p>

        <p>I just got prescribed anti anxiety meds for the first time in my life.  Covid hysteria / restrictions are def contributing to my problem.  Oh and wearing a mask makes my anxiety much worse.  </p>
<p>Trying to exercise a lot and cut back on drinking. Just hard to have a lot to look forward to these days.</p>

        <p>I wrote something similar months ago. I'll share some rewritten edited parts. I wrote but never posted. </p>
<p>So you're attacking people for leaving their homes, seeing family and friends, going for walks, buying what you call "non essential" items (many "non essential" shops etc remained open here) when you have <em>no idea</em> what they are going through. Not even if they're your best friend, you still don't truly know. There are so many reasons why home isn't safe for everyone, reasons staying home is the most unsafe and harmful thing a person can do. I'll highly just two situations you clearly have no considered.</p>
<p>There are those living in domestic violence, which is escalating. It's a massive but largely invisible problem, people go through it hidden from public view and in silence. Your best friend, your family member, your neighbour could be living in DV and you have no idea - my best friend didn't know i grew up in and still lived in DV until last year. You are attacking people for leaving home when you don't know what home means for them. For these people home is hell. Home is dangerous. How means walking on eggshells. Home means they are now confined with their abuser who may be working from home or unemployed, with their behaviour escalating. So they need to leave their house, perhaps now even more often than normal to escape. To deescalate and diffuse dangerous situations. To flee heightened tempers and violence. To save themselves from fear, trauma, injury and even death. To give themselves something to live for. Even to just see that life outside their 4 walls of hell exists.</p>
<p>There are those living with mental health problems. You may not know this, but for these people isolation and staying home are the worst things they can do. Worsening mental illness can lead to self harm and suicide. It is the biggest killer of those aged 15-44 and in the top 3 for those under 65. That woman you're attacking for buying a bunch of plants you deem "non-essential"? Leaving her home and seeing other people, and buying those plants to care for could be the one thing standing between her and ending up in a place where she could end her life. Could be her lifeline. Leaving home and doing these things are for many keeping them healthy and alive, and you do care deeply about lives right? <em>If it just saves one life</em>? Well cool, then you'll support people doing such things right? Even the mentally healthy may not be so after being isolated and trapped in their homes.</p>
<p>Telling people to <em>stay home, stay safe</em> and <em>STAY THE FUCK HOME</em> is cruel and shows a lack of consideration and compassion for others on your part. Replying to your family and friends with these lines is cruel, and I can guarantee that when you attack them to every post you make you are hurting someone on your newsfeed. Throwing these slogans and hashtags around shows a lack of empathy and insight. It shows arrogance and privilege.</p>
<p>If people taking care of themselves is selfish, then selfish is a positive thing.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I am a traveler.  It gives my life purpose.  I work to be able to travel.  That has been destroyed by lockdowns.  I had cancelled multiple trips and waited a while for things to change, but eventually just went on a road trip because I was going to kill myself if I didn't get out.  Zero regrets.</p>

        <p>I like this message. Reminds me of when you're on a plane and they say that in an emergency, always put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting others. This isn't selfish - the idea is that you can't help others unless your own needs have been met first.</p>
<p>People have various needs - things that they can't function without. There are absolute needs and relative needs. Absolute needs are things like food, drink, medication. If you don't have them, you will die. Then there are relative needs: you won't die without them but life will be very unpleasant. So unpleasant that if these needs aren't met, the person's only priority will be satisfying the need. This includes things like shelter. Then at a very slightly lower level, there are things like: having a job, education, socialisation, having a purpose in life, etc. You won't die without them but you're not going to focus on anything else until you get them.</p>
<p>At this point, many people are not getting their absolute needs met and pretty much everyone is not getting their relative needs met. And it's impossible to care about someone else until you've got your own needs sorted.</p>
