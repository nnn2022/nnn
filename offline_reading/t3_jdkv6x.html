    <strong>Just e-mailed a suicide prevention service</strong>
    <p><p>....tosay I’m in crisis and I can’t bear the world we live in.  Masks give me PTSD flare-ups - not just wearing them but seeing them on someone else.  The stress of this is killing me.</p>
<p>And I just got the parroted “well, coronavirus is difficult for everyone” line </p>
<p>I just......can’t.  I can’t bear the fucking lie any more.  It’s not coronavirus that’s difficult.  90% of us wouldn’t ever have heard of coronavirus (just like we didn’t hear about the 50,000 excess flu deaths in the UK in 2017-18) if it weren’t for the fucking media and governments going insane </p>
<p>I can’t fit into the BS new normal, and I can’t get away from it, and I’m constantly guilt-tripping myself for not doing better with it but deep down I think I can’t do better with it because I actually have some fucking integrity and I KNOW this is all wrong </p>
<p>What do I do?  Where do I go?  I don’t really want to die.  But the world feels like a fucking nightmare </p>
<p>AND NOT BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS</p>
<p>Because of mass insanity!</p></p>

        <p>I’m right there with you, I’m in the states but I feel the same. Including about masks. And suicide places have never been helpful, I’ve called them in the past when I was overcome with grief from death of a loved one.</p>
<p>I wish I had some wise words for you but all I have is, you’re not alone in feeling this way. I hope some others have some good suggestions. I’m almost ready to get on board with marijuana use, something I’ve never considered before and feeling worried that I’m considering it now.</p>

        <p>It is such a nightmare, you are not alone. I wonder if doing something to fight the "new normal," even something small, might help? You could write a letter, put together a website, start a petition...</p>
<p>I have done enough of this. I need to speak up more myself. I just think part of the horribleness of this whole thing is feeling helpless and silenced, and maybe it doesn't have to be that way.</p>

        <p>Agreed ^  part of the reason you may feel so terrible inside OP is because you might be being called to action. DO something about it! Even if it is just little things. This is a great opportunity to experiment and be brave and for fuck sake even have a little fun with it. I know that part can be hard (I struggle too sometimes) but fkn try it! If you are already feeling suicidal then what do you have to lose?</p>
<p>For example: one of my buddies will just straight up point at random people with masks on and say "I know you're smiling under there!" Haha. Just try to keep it fun and light hearted. Nobody likes this shit. Be the change you want to see in the world. These words are for me to, trust me. We can all work on it together :)</p>

        <p>Know that more and more people are waking up and questioning the narrative. And local groups across England are forming and starting to do a better job of supporting each other.</p>
<p>You may well find there is a group of people against lockdown near you who are meeting up, be it for protests or picnics. If you happen to be in Yorkshire then I can definitely help with that.</p>

        <p>I'm with you as well. I try to avoid going places that strictly enforce masks. I only shop at stores that don't enforce it. I have lost friends because I spoke out against this bullshit. I am about to cut off my sister and her dumb wife because the both of them are mask nazis and think that there should be jail time for people who don't wear masks. I don't even know my sister anymore. My dad buys into this bullshit but he's more laid back about it. But his girlfriend wears a mask everywhere and tries to sneak child sized masks in my stuff because she says I need to get my toddler used to wearing a mask (never will happen; her masks go directly in the trash). </p>
<p>I try to get away from it but it's everywhere. And I have two kids so I have to find a way to keep their lives as normal as possible. My toddler is okay but my 11 year old is regressing due to no school because we are stuck in a state with a democratic governor who refuses to reopen schools. I'm just sick of it. I keep hoping that eventually things will get better for my kids but I'm losing hope.</p>

        <p>I’m with you on the mask wearing. 100%. </p>
<p>You’re not wrong for feeling the way you do. You are not wrong. What’s going on is absolute insanity. Madness. If you can see that you’re doing better than all the faceless sheep. </p>
<p>I bet many people go through their days doing what they do to get by. No anxiety if you follow the rules, no worrying about confrontations, keep your head down and face masked and all will be good. It’s sad, but I get it. Life is so much easier that way. If you don’t think about it, you don’t have to THINK. </p>
<p>I’m an older middle aged woman, so my experience and solutions may not work for you, but you might find something useful in what I say.</p>
<p>I refuse to wear a mask. I’m prepared to say that I have a medical exemption. And at this point, my anxiety about putting on a mask makes it a serious issue. For me. If they don’t like it, I’ll leave. We have a few places we go to that don’t say anything. They get our money. </p>
<p>I’ve made the assumption this is going to last for the foreseeable future. I’m no longer looking for an out. I’m not scouring the news looking for an end date. With that in mind I’ve decided what’s important to me. </p>
<p>My husband and I are looking to buy a home. We want a couple dogs. That’s our focus. We talk a lot about dogs. Aha. My focus is on that. Moving. Dogs. It gives us a future to look forward to. </p>
<p>Find yourself something to look forward to. Not something that will happen after this is done, but something that could happen even amidst this bullshit. </p>
<p>You got this.</p>

        <p>"The most agonizing thing in this world, I suppose, is the agony of tedium. Nothing is so painful as a consciousness void of change. Nothing is so painful as an able body deprived of movement by unseen cords. Just as to live is to move, the suppression of movement renders the living lifeless. The pain of what one’s lost is a pain worse than death." Sōseki Natsume</p>
<p>I wish I had decent advice, but I'm becoming too depressed to speak lately, so here's a quote that makes me feel understood when I want to jump off the ledge. Hopefully, it helps you, too.</p>
<p>In addition to fiction, Sōseki wrote about how Japan modernized too rapidly in the Meiji era, which led to what he called a "national nervous breakdown" that culminated in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He died long before WWII, but he predicted it. I fear we're seeing something similar now: social media and technology have evolved faster than humanity can keep pace with, and we're paying the price.</p>
<p>"Cases" "Asymptomatic spread" "Droplets" "Surge" are blasted at people who are too stupid to question the sound bite from CNN, or the link they scrolled past on Twitter, and we're paying the price. Our lives are ruined because of media-induced mass hysteria.</p>

        <p>I wish I could give you a hug (if wanted). We are being tortured, so I think your reaction is completely normal. These are some steps I have taken to preserve my sanity. I know they might not work for everyone, but they have helped me immensely.</p>
<ol>
<li>I moved to a rural area where people don't wear masks or do social distancing. (a god send) I don't know anyone here, but I treasure the normality of interacting with strangers.</li>
<li>I bought a house that was on the verge of imploding, and I am fixing it up. It gives me many solvable problems to keep my mind and body focused on. I think any project that requires a lot of problem solving could work similarly, especially if it involves physical labor.</li>
<li>I cancelled Netflix and gave my TV away.</li>
<li>I started gardening. It may sound silly, but there is something incredibly soothing about working with plants and dirt and growing your own food. If I didn't have a spot here, I'd do it in buckets in front of windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't give up! We haven't lost yet. I want to stick around to see the win.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much.  I want to stick around to see it too.  I’m spending as much time as I can outdoors, and am dreaming about another life somewhere rural, maybe in the US or Canada (I’m in London UK).  Daydreaming a future life helps a lot</p>

        <p>Can relate, no matter where you go, this is always going to be shoved in your face. I stopped watching the news, just sometimes I check the comments under articles. I disappeared from social media. I do my grocery shopping at places that don't abide to the mask mandate, my number of friends unfortunately drastically reduced as well, I avoid going to the gym since there are masks required and work out outside or at home, I'm trying my best to not expose myself to this "new normal" - but you're constantly reminded of that BS somehow. </p>
<p>But please, don't harm yourself, there are many people in the world that feel exactly like you. I honestly think it can't go on like this forever. There are many people that think like us, that can't and won't fit into this "new normal". Panics don't last forever. And they can't control your thoughts. </p>
<p>I hope this subreddit will stick around for some time, browsing here also gave me strength and the believe that there are likeminded people all around the world.</p>

I know it sounds generic - but maybe, if it's possible get some off screen time as well... do you have a pet? a garden? or nature surrounding you where you live? taking walks in forests for example always really help me whenever I'm feeling anxious regarding this whole new normal bs...<br>

        <p>damn, i hope you’re doing well for yourself. i fucking hate all of it just as much as you do. whenever i’m alone i can’t get my mind off of suicide.</p>
<p>i’d suggest finding an outlet to rant/get angry at before you take it out on yourself. let out your frustrations to a friend, family member or get a punching bag like i did. i’m not going to say ‘we’re all in this together’ when we aren’t. the lockdowns made sure to prevent that.</p>
<p>i’ve thought about suicide everyday for the past 8 months, developed BPD and had multiple mental breakdowns, but i hope i can give better advice than a cookie cutter response from someone that’s only talking to you for a paycheck.</p>
<p>one side of me is optimistic for society to go back to normal without any masks, social distancing or guidelines. the other side of me wants to get it over with and kill myself because none of these weaseling keyboard warrior pro-lockdown doomers have had the balls to do it for me.</p>

        <p>Oh I got the same crap line from my GP at the start of the pandemic. “Oh everyone is anxious about this virus”</p>
<p>To which I (honest to god) stated “my fear is arbitrary and draconian policies that remove my agency - the agency that has allowed me to flourish and be protected. It’s catagorically not the virus”</p>
<p>I was abused in an institution, so handing over my agency to others - in the name of ‘my best interest’ - makes me exceptionally wary. And 7 months later I’ve sadly been proven correct with my fears. </p>
<p>Now that the mask mandates and mask shaming are everywhere I’m really really struggling (especially as a lot of my abuse involved being smothered).</p>
<p>I hate the term “triggering”, but I really don’t know how else to describe this. Everynight I have vivid terrors about the prior abuse. Everyday I feel like I’m walking on eggshells </p>
<p>Living a life that’s reminiscent of that abusive environment is no life for me. My only protection was my individual agency and prerogative. Now that’s gone, what do I have?</p>

        <p>Likewise, I genuinely wish you all the best. If you’re observant you’ll find numerous small businesses and even speakeasies that can allow you to have somewhat normal life. I’ve been doing a lot of travelling around the country for my job and I can say that most people I’ve met are in our boat here. </p>
<p>The most infuriating thing is that this institution was a boarding school - one that sends loads of people to high ranking positions in the civil service and parliament. So some of the people engaged in abuse at that school (it was rife there) are now helping to run the country.</p>

        <p>I have ptsd too and I get it. Not sure I have good advice, except that you can’t control other people’s thoughts or reaction to you, but you can control your own thoughts and actions. </p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, I divorced myself from the opinions of others. Wanna call me selfish? Fine. Wanna blather on about how no one likes wearing a mask but it’s just something small that will help? Go right ahead,  but I’m still not going to comply.

<p>My belief in God, is what keeps me going.  This might be the beginning of the end of days, maybe, but either way it helps to remember that these evilmongers, the Gateses and Faucis and Tedroses, are nothing in the end.

        <p>Sadly all of the sane people will have suicided and the Idiocracy will be left to inherit the hell hole they made. I think it is some sort of psychological weapon "they" have developed that endumbnifies people. Some are immune and find watching all the rampant moronic delusions as some sort of cruel and inhuman punishment. Maybe china developed the "weapon", or maybe Russia (they have done lots of psychic research). Whatever this new weapon is, it is massively different from anything we've previously seen. It is a pretty good tactic in that it leaves all the physical assets intact and the population in a dribbling moronic stupor curled up in the fetal position in the corners of the rooms.</p>

For me it's like I want to do something but I'm just one person and this is all crazy. At the moment more and more people are starting to grasp what is really happening and we can hopefully all come together to make some kind of difference in what is going on. Take care 🙂</p>

        <p>There are plenty of good reasons to commit suicide. Having a mental breakdown because you can't go out to have fun isn't one of them lol. This is from someone who has effectively lived in quarantine for years now, been hospitalized, etc. Pathetic.</p>

        <p>Hey - this is an unbelievably cruel comment.  Truly. I am sorry you are suffering so badly and that you live with illness - I live with mental illness (hence the mental breakdown lol!) so I have a sense of that suffering - but I will not tolerate being spoken to in this way.  You know nothing about me other than that I have PTSD and have considered suicide today, and yet still you chose to abuse me and call me pathetic.  Where in my post did I say that this was anything to do with not being able to go out and have fun? </p>
<p>Truly, I am sorry you have suffered and that you suffer still.  I wish you all the best.  And I beg you, don’t ever leave a comment like that on a suicidal post again.  I lost my brother to suicide, and it fucking sucks.  I posted here to try and save my own life.  It was a leap of faith.  It wasn’t cool of you to see that post, and respond like that.</p>
<p>Please know that I am sticking around and that you haven’t contributed to a death tonight - but if you do that again to someone in a slightly more vulnerable spot, the story might be different.</p>
<p>Sincere good wishes.  I hope you find a good life.</p>
