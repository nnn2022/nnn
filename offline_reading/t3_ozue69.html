    <strong>Thought exchange with the vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>The other day I went to my favourite focaccia (sort like a Italian oily bread also used to make sandwiches)</p>
<p>There are 2 brothers running this place, the place is really nice rustical. One of them is +60 the other is +50.</p>
<p>The +60 one is the one preparing the sandwich and the one that I normally have a small talk, the place is in a central place at unbeatable price, which is rare for Milan. </p>
<p>At some point before I was leaving I asked +60 if he would be requiring green pass for costumers and he said no, is only for restaurants etc. Then he asked me if I'm not vaccinated, and I said no, I said I rather wait a bit the least. He said to me that I should trust science that otherwise i shouldn't take an aspirin. I said I think is a bit different to take an aspirin than an experimental shot and I said I hope you don't mind I tell you what I honestly think(he said freedom of expression), I said that in the best case scenario is still experimental so no one really knows.</p>
<p>There was no beef between us, he asked me if he could be honest with me and I said yes ofcourse, he said: I think if you get sick with covid you shouldn't receive treatment, and I said that's pretty fair and I appreciate the honesty to tell this in my face. I didn't get angry, he was honest and this is what he thinks so I can't do anything about it. </p>
<p>We did exchange our views a bit more, I told him how they got away with the emergency use vaccine, and I asked him if he thinks that big pharma has the best interest in his health and that this is not about money, which he replied that ofcourse is about money, so I said we are actually not in such a different way of thinking. </p>
<p>I didn't want to get much into details cause I know is useless, this people get their info at the TV, it was already a lot that he accepted that there's business behind the curtain.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep it simple, I said about all the cases that I've heard from young women that got their periods wrecked, either having a period during 2 months non stop or not having it at all for a long time and feeling terrible, in which he answered: listen I took my second pfizer shot 2 months ago and since then I feel tired every day... He said if I need to get the 3th, 4th or 5th I will not doubt to get it. </p>
<p>Anyway I though it was interesting conversation...</p></p>

        <p>I hope that he was in excellent health for a 60 year old. We certainly wouldn't want him to selfishly hog the hospital beds because he was a glutton, would we?</p>
<p>On a serious note, I am not sure how someone can compare aspirin (which was naturally derived from herbs and willow bark as salicylic acid tinctures and teas from the Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia) can be compared to a pseudo-vaxx that was developed in a couple of hours over a weekend (Pfizer-BioNTech). It's absolutely asinine!!!</p>
<p>Did you explain that he can still transmit, contract, be sickened and die from C19 despite being fully vaxxed? You did your best, but it's now impossible to wake up people who are in a C19 propaganda-induced coma.</p>

        <p>I get your point and I'm in your side, I explained that aspirin is FDA approved, however I didnt want to get into details, I can't blame the guy, is probably on of those people that as soon as arrive home the TV need to be turned on, no matter what. So how can I blame him? Did you see what come out of the TV? </p>
<p>People who run business or have family or have born with the TV on, tend to not want to go to sleep thinking that the government dont have the best interest in their well being, but also that they want to make them disappear.</p>
<p>I didn't explain, he actually knew he could get it, but he said that if he get it he will have much less probability than being hospitalised than me. Which is what the TV say... I said: yes in "theory" . I said the best case scenario we don't know, cause is an experimental phase....</p>

        <p>I actually don't watch TV. I gave up on that a LONG time ago. Italy is notoriously anti-vaxx, so they won't transform your country into a biofascist health state that easily. The south of your country will be more resistant. </p>
<p>I'm surprised that people from the country that has had the highest number of PMs since 1900 - most resigning from scandals - would blindly trust the government. I must say that I was sickened when Mario "Whatever It Takes" Draghi became the PM. That was when I knew that the globalists had Italy in a death grip. </p>
<p>Are there any reasonable Italian channels that are sceptical of what's going on? It's sad to see how brainwashed he is.</p>

        <p>Is true that Italy has a high rate of anti Vax, but thats not new and is not only against the covid Vax is to Vax in general. Also Is worth mentioning that is the country with the highest standards for food when it comes to banned substances, I think is something about 5000 substances forbidden to put in food while USA I think something like 7 substances. </p>
<p>Reasonable channels in the TV? No noway and that's the problem, people aren't used to get their info from the web or YouTube let alone bitchute that they don't even know it and that's not only in Italy. </p>
<p>Funny fact, before this not only Italy but the whole world had lost faith in their governments and now it seems its been restored. </p>
<p>I really hope that there will be push back from the south, but what will they do what can they do?</p>
<p>Even my friends that they no way wanted to get the vaccine, now that have been informed that they will not be able to work some of them already started to vaccinate.</p>

<p>I can't get over this! The same governments that were responsible for genocides, corruption, drugs, money laundering, human trafficking, wars, etc are SUDDENLY good because there's a ViRuS. Fear REALLY does destroy the minds of people!!!</p>
<p>The people in the South are hardier and more resistant to bullies. Hopefully, they will stop this madness. Generally, city dwellers are laid back about this fiasco.</p>

        <p>So the vaccine made his life noticeably worse (tired every day), yet he would not only do it again he would welcome a 3rd, 4th, and 5th booster shot??  Amazing!</p>

        <p>Ask, if you get it and you suffer bad results, serious injury like going blind or blood clots in your dick, will he be responsible?</p>
<p>Because the vaccine companies are not responsible, the doctors are not responsible, the government doesn't give a shit, so will he pay you compensation?</p>
<p>Will he cover all your medical bills? </p>
<p>Suppose you get a stroke and paralyzed on your right side, and cos of that you fall and break your left arm - will he wipe your ass for you?</p>

        <p>Slightly off topic, but I live in Milan and have been working remotely in Greece. Could you provide some insight into how enforced the green pass is in Milan? Is it truly a necessity for a social lifestyle? Iâ€™m getting some doubts about returning to Milan being unvaccinated and not being able to participate in society</p>
