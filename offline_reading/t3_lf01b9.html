    <strong>What would you say to set the record straight and correct this individual spewing BS about the virus origin and WHO at this well known security blog?</strong>
    <p><p>Dear readers, </p>
<p>A long term and usually highly respected user of the well known security blog, Schneier on Security, posted a spectacularly wrong and false agglomeration of BS regarding the origin of the virus and WHO, which is completely ludicrous and just very bizarre. See for yourself: </p>

<p>Quote of the comment in question:</p>
<p>&rt;Clive Robinson • February 7, 2021 12:56 PM</p>
<p>&rt;@ JR,</p>
<p>&rt;The foxnews and more recent WasPo articles are clarian calls for a witch hunt and burning at the stake, and not a lot more.</p>
<p>&rt;Most of this Wuhan biolab nonsense was started by a single individual on Trumps national security advisory team.</p>
<p>&rt;The same people that convinced trump originally not to close the borders, not to stop aircraft flying or taking any sensible measures.</p>
<p>&rt;We know because of insider leaks that Thr WHO was repeatedly threatened by the US in various ways so ended up supporting the US “no pandemic line” when it got to the point The WHO was loosing credability in the rest of the world and had to act Trump in his usual borish and child in pram behavioirs cut funding to The WHO.</p>
<p>&rt;One of the reasons The WHO had not gone to China untill now was the Trump administration who wanted US scientists of dubious credability but strong loyalty to the Trump line in to tell the story the way Trump wanted it to be told, not as the truth takes it.</p>
<p>&rt;Even with a change of President as you note certain Silicon Valley and US neo-cons do not want the truth of what has been going on comming out… So they need an Orwellian style distant “Yellow Peril” for every one on the US to hate on…</p>
<p>&rt;Hence the attacks against those who are descended from the Far East with some seven or more generations in the US. Which is longer than quite a few European or Jewish descendants that are very close to controling the GOP.</p>
<p>&rt;People keep bringing up China lied over the outbreak and the sickness and mortality figures, but forget that most of the Western World lied in various ways and were caught out but just ignored it.</p>
<p>&rt;After China senior politicians realised what was going on they were actually quite honest about how the figures they were collecting were done and how they were reported. The fact it’s only retrospectively people are bringing up “China lied” for “political and economic reasons” that what is going on is clear.</p>
<p>&rt;Did China under report, yes they’ve been quite open about this and why, the same sort of things happened in Southern and Wesyern Europe, the US and other places. Take for instance the US, the tests the FDA approved were rubish and the CDC asked for changes the FDA refused. Then the CDC labs were found to be a disgusting mess totally inappropriatly being used thus the figures were effrctively false. Even now the US is so far behind the testing curve pwr head of population there are some second world countries with better testing.</p>
<p>&rt;But it’s not just the US look at France and a number of other European countries, their testing including the all important sequencing is lamentable.</p>
<p>&rt;When you’ve looked around enough you will realise that that Foxnews and WashPo stuff is purely political manovering. Amazon has clearly done better than anyone else and has become many times wealthier whilst most of the US has become not just poor but encumbered with debt for the next three to five generations to give Amazon and other US “exceprionalists” their massive profits over the last year.</p>
<p>&rt;They know what is going to happen when the US Public realise just how much they have been robbed and abused by these very few who believe they are exceptional. The “pay back” will not just be fiscal.</p>
<p>&rt;Thus they need the old “foxes and goats” to be mindlessly chased all over the place and some slaughtered to protect the “exceptional few”.</p>
<p>&rt;Those “exceptional few” believe or at least hope they can keep the US citizens confused and infighting or being gulled into believing in an Orwellian enemy of convenience.</p>
<p>&rt;From a purely scientific basis this little WHO trip to China is realy a waste of time and has been all along.</p>
<p>&rt;The nonsense about the Chinese lab is just the paranoia of a single individual in the US Government who keeps beating the drum for various reasons that have no real connection with reality, but are sure darn usefull to others to keep stiring up as it stops people looking to closely at them, who have well and truely bankrupted the US under the cover of this pandemic…</p>
<p>&rt;As the old saying has it,</p>
<p>&rt;“Follow the Money”.</p>
<p>Normally that regular commentator isn't that cognitively impaired, but this time around he got almost everything wrong in an, again, almost comically absurd way, which is an issue because after the host and owner of the blog, he is the most influential and trusted commentator there (almost as if he has an agenda of some sort).</p>
<p>What would this community write or say to such a know it all type of individual who usually displays a more than warranted and healthy amount of arrogance whenever he writes about communication technologies or IT security?</p>
<p>In case of someone being interested, posting a rebuttal there DOES NOT require an account of any type or logging into anything. Thank you very much for reading and have a nice day!!!</p></p>

        <p>Hmm I'll say that another associated tech site Slashdot shook me out of my corona haze in April but that a lot of the tech accounts Imo are shills for their Silicon Valley employers in general, or as a side gig.</p>

        <p>Lol. He says follow the money, but you can follow the money he got for this post straight to china. I guess our security bloggers/experts are funded by China? That’s comforting.</p>
