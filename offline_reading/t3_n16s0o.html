        <p>I think sunken cost fallacy is the best explanation for a lot of this.  People spent a whole year projecting on social media, and now they can't back out of it.  </p>
<p>Speaking from personal experience, there is nothing wrong with quietly changing your mind.  You don't have to make a public speech about it.</p>

        <p>&rt;People spent a whole year projecting on social media, and now they can't back out of it.</p>
<p>Or worse, people lost their job or have a failed business because they complied with lockdown(s) and other restrictive measures. Doing as they were told cost them a lot (or everything).</p>
<p>That's hard to accept reality when you've lost so much over so little. People should be angry, but too many are still parroting, "Well, it is a pandemic," and whatever else they need to believe in order to cope.</p>
<p>At some point, they'll have to stop faking it, and I think exhaustion is slowly setting in. I've been encouraged lately because I hear colleagues of mine emboldened to express their frustration and skepticism about why this country is still taking the same measures and stuck with the same mindset as from a year ago. I've been pleasantly surprised by a few that I wouldnt have necessarily expected it from. It's refreshing to have honest conversations about it.</p>

        <p>My kids are sometimes confused, because my household takes about 0 consideration toward COVID, so neighbors and family visit without masks, visit nd gather in large groups, greet each other with hugs and grandma/grandpa kiss the kids goodbye etc. Nothing has really changed in the way of ordinary life at home.</p>
<p>Then they go to school and have to mask, distance, basically bathe in hand sanitizer (to the point that my 6 y/o developed scabs that covered at least 60% of the backs of his hands and lasted 2 or 3 weeks from the dehydrated skin cracking), walk one way in hallways, split their classrooms into separate rooms (because class sizes can only accommodate so many based on 'guidelines') and probably several other bullshit measures that I currently can't remember, but all are done in the name of safety and guided by <em>science</em>.</p>
<p>When my kids ask about something I tell them the truth, even if the truth is, "We don't really know." I can only imagine how other homes/families are crippling their children with fear and anxiety over this. Children are highly perceptive, and they will emulate their parents' attitude and reactions. My home is chilled out, unfortunately not all homes are. This will negatively affect a lot of young kids, and it's a shame.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and if you sustained a significant loss, like a lost job or failed business, or worse, if you lost a loved one in a hospital that you weren't allowed to enter and be by their dying side. Any of that happening over anything less than the worst most deadly gonna-kill-us-all-virus is not something most will be able to accept, so they deny instead.</p>

        <p>Just saying "doomers" is painting with a very wide brush.  Just like saying "everyone at NNN thinks X".</p>
<p>I would say a few may feel that way.  I believe a number are so socially correct (kind of like politically correct) that they think:  It may not stop anything, but it has to do SOME good if only a little.  But even if it only does a little we need to do it.</p>

        <p>You know how QAnon fanatics keep coming up with rationalizations as to why Trump didn't arrest all the elites on the specified date? It's the same with doomers. For example, when Texas lifts its mask mandate, doomers flip out. "Just wait 2 weeks!!!1!". 2 weeks pass with no surge, and they say, "well just thank those businesses who took matters into their own hands and enforced mask-wearing."</p>

        <p>That's exactly what it is. They know how detrimental their support of these shitty mandates and policies are. They know they fucked up. But, as you said, they invested too much- physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. But they are dug in and their egos will not allow admitting they were wrong, no matter how much progress doing so would create.</p>
