    <strong>Getting Vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Looking for opinions on if I’ve made the right decision.</p>
<p>I have my vaccine tomorrow, after months of doing anything I can not to get it. But, being the only person out of my friends not being vaccinated means I won’t be able to do anything, including return to education as offline will be stopping etc. This has been a huge kick to the face and is going against everything I believe about this joke we’re living in.</p>
<p>I feel like I have been forced into this, where I live they are still letting unvaccinated shop etc but I wonder how long that will last. The media and population seem to get worse and worse everyday pointing the finger at the unvaccinated - this doesn’t bother my decision making it just irritates me because none of it makes any sense.</p>
<p>I decided to get the one shot Johnson as I see it as the “safest” option due to it not changing my genes. Would anyone agree or get a different one? </p>
<p>I’m annoyed at the situation and myself, feeling like I’ve betrayed myself. </p>
<p>Either way, gonna blend up whatever plants I find to detox myself</p></p>

        <p>take a long hard look in the mirror before you go to get it done and ask yourself if you will ever be able to respect yourself again if you go through with it. Theres always a choice. Most the people in here like myself would die before getting that vaccine, mainly for the reason mentioned before; Id never be able to take myself seriously again.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't do it. The J&amp;J vaccine might use a more traditional mechanism of action but it still isn't safe. Guillain-Barre syndrome, blood clots, full body rashes and hives... nasty side effects have been reported.</p>
<p>I won't allow any government to perform dangerous experiments on my body. My health is too important. You're taking this vaccine because you're worried about your quality of life. But what if you are damaged by the vaccine?</p>
<p>Besides. You're clearly not scared of COVID, you're scared of the government. Fine. But you can't comply your way out of tyranny. Already the federal government is pushing to get everyone to wear masks, vaccinated or no. And it will get worse. Compliance with a fascist government cannot ever bring you freedom.</p>

        <p>I would continue to avoid any of the shots if you can physically bare it. I know it's hard, I'm the only person out of my friends that's not vaxed and I constantly get grief for it. But we really don't know what these shots are going to do to people 1 or more years down the road, and personally I'm not okay with that. There is so much evidence to suggest that these vaccines are a little bit effective at best, useless at worst, and so many have had bad reactions to them. Why can't you go to school if you're unvaxed? Is it high school, college? Is there a way to get around this? </p>
<p>Anyways, best of luck to you regardless of what you decide, but I encourage you to continue to refuse the vaccine. This is what they want, submission.</p>

        <p>It’s college, it hasn’t officially been declared but following the pattern most definitely the unvaxed won’t be able to go to university. It doesn’t apply to children, but who knows how long before they make the vaccine mandatory for all children.</p>

<p>Hold out if you're able. I'm in the same spot right now, starting my freshman year in a few weeks. It's not mandated yet, just encouraged, and I worry that it will be mandated in the future. I think if it hasn't been required yet, hold on to hope that it never will be. Many of the schools that made it mandatory received backlash.</p>

        <p>Keep advocating for personal choice, no matter what you end up doing. We need more vaxxed people supporting our decision not to take the shot. </p>
<p>Fear of the jab will make it worse for you. Make your decision and go with the knowledge that you'll be ok. Do whatever you need to do to support your body detoxing whatever is in the shot. Know that you'll be ok!! And keep having our backs! </p>

        <p>I just got my AAS last semester, really lucky I was able to get out with that at least. I wasn’t very happy with my degree anyways, but a BS is a BS and it’s kinda necessary for a lot of jobs outside of trades. I’m hoping that some states like TX/FL won’t mandate vaccination for schools and I’ll be able to finish there but..... who knows. Not even sure if the world is gonna exist as we know it anymore.

<p>I honestly don’t think the world will be the same after, to be dead honest I hope to god this vaccination is related to an alien virus or something. An invasion at this rate would not surprise me at all and at least then some of this shit show will make sense. I don’t even believe in aliens.</p>

        <p>Can't say whether it was the right decision or not, because that depends on your personal risk factors and what's more important to you. I would have decided differently but our situations and health details are probably different too. Do whatever you think is best.</p>

        <p>You do what you feel is right for you. Personally though, I wouldn’t get it. They’re basically forcing you to get it....and anything that the government forces you to get injected with...especially an experimental vaccine that hasn’t gone through all the testing...is too suspicious for me. And once vaccinated, you can’t go back.</p>

        <p>That's how they get you. They don't threaten you personally. They attack you through your loved ones. Point a gun at someone's head and they may balls up and tell you no. Point a gun at their best friend's head, and they'll comply no matter what. </p>
<p>Just have to choose between going out with friends, or telling the sheeple shepherds to go fuck themselves.</p>

        <p>You are not alone. However, you should call them all up and tell them you are doing it for them and demand to be taken good care of ... Tell them you expect chicken soup and to be called daily for a week. Also, mention they need to take turns wiping your ass if it all goes awry. If you are going to do it at least be a total pain in the ass about it. You have made up your mind, so no point in torturing yourself. Keep us updated.</p>

        <p>If I were doing it, I would load up on vitamin D, and drink a ton of water and take a daily aspirin for the next 3-4 weeks.  Clotting seems to be the biggest preventable concern.</p>
