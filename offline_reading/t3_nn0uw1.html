    <strong>The “there’s still so much we don’t know!” narrative was utter bullshit.</strong>
    <p><p>Alright so covid was possibly (probably) released from the lab in Wuhan, which those of us here have basically known all along. But now it’s public knowledge. Great. We also know that Rand Paul proved Fauci (re: our tax dollars) was funding gain of function research on the coronavirus in the Wuhan lab. </p>
<p>So if they were literally studying this shit and how to make it more transmissible to humans, how the fuck did they “not know” right away how it was transmitted? I understand there are probably aspects to the virus that the best scientists still don’t know. But really, they had no fucking clue whether it was passed by bodily fluids or human contact or air? They sold us the droplet theory, which led to the forced masking. Then, once most of society had been conditioned to fear naked faces, they quietly backtracked and said, “oops lol our bad. It’s actually air-borne. But like, just keep masking anyway. You wouldn’t want random strangers to think you’re selfish, would you???” </p>
<p>Same thing with wiping down packages and every possible surface at a grocery store every 10 fucking minutes. You’re telling me they were studying this disease and they had no fucking clue at all where it could survive or how it could be transmitted??</p></p>

        <p>It's unbelievable to me how they flip back and forth between:</p>
<p>"It's a new virus, we don't know anything about it."</p>
<p>To:</p>

        <p>They lied. Pure &amp; simple. Look, I'm no Scientist, but I can read &amp; read the actual (pre-2020) recommendations &amp; that it was actually NOT recommended to over-sterilize &amp; that masks (actual masks, not cut up T shirts) were NOT recommended &amp; even that previous attempts of companies to advertise them as effective had been prohibited by other countries. </p>
<p>If I knew, they knew!!!!! Fauci even said in the beginning that they were useless, until MSM &amp; Facebook idiots kept badgering that they "might" provide "some protection" &amp; "couldn't hurt". </p>
<p>This was &amp; is 100% bullshit driven by mega-corporations that saw a fine opportunity to make billions &amp; crush small business. That was the goal &amp; they achieved it!</p>

        <p>Agree 100%. I also thought of the Fauci clip even just when writing this - his whole “it may block a droplet but it’s not providing the protection that people <em>think</em> that it is.” Well wtf was that?! It’s like he accidentally told the truth and then his overlords had a nice chat with him about what he’s supposed to do. </p>
<p>Money played a huge role. But I think control was also part of the endgame.</p>

        <p>IMO, they sent him a nice note written on $100 bills... The million he got from Isreal was just what they were willing to brag about.</p>
<p>Money is control, so the 'endgame' is the same thing. However, 'endgame' implies they ever intend to stop. This is the next 'forever war', it will never end.</p>

        <p>Exactly. How stupid do they think we are? All of this just convinces me that they did this on purpose, and they wanted it to spread, regardless of the cost.</p>
