        <p><strong>10 things I learned during the covid coup:</strong></p>
<p>People love collectivism worse than I thought. </p>
<p>"2 weeks" was probably secret society code talk for <em>two years</em>. </p>
<p>It's not just the feds, state or provincial politicians that are corrupt, it's these sleazy city councils and school boards as well. </p>
<p>The biggest benefiter of the covid coup is China. </p>
<p>The <em>majority</em> of my coworkers who got vaccinated report side effects some of them severe and lasting several days. </p>
<p>Churches have to remain closed but a busy Ikea is ok. Not suspicious at all, nope, no agenda here. </p>
<p>Lining up to enter the grocery store is a dry run for bread line ups. </p>
<p>One has to be mentally strong to ward off mental fatigue being caused by the politicians and media lies. </p>
<p>Half of the security guards tasked with making sure people are wearing masks won't enforce it. They're just wearing a costume.</p>
<p>People have completely forgotten there's a thing called an immune system.</p>
