    <strong>Why I think they give 'free stuff' to motivate vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>So I was finding this kind of odd situation that someone is being offered free stuff for getting vaccinated. Never in my life I received something for free from a government or an institution.</p>
<p>Why dont I get free stuff with other medical issues? Got asthma? if u buy this spray, heres  a free movie ticket!   tetanus, polio vaccine? 'insert item'. whatever</p>
<p>First target was 'back to life as quickly as possible,  I CANT MISS MY VACATION,  type of people'<br>
Second target: 'back to life for restaurants, clubs' so basically all short term minded</p>
<p>Third target: offer free things to motivate a vaccination<br>
<strong><em>if not enough people are vaccinated until that</em></strong><br>
Fourth target: offer 20-30$ for the vaccine, if that not works, offer 100$</p>
<p>So what do all these have in common? And what type of people are they targeting with?<br>
- Short term minded and greedy people</p>
<p>Short term minded and greedy people are the first in the society that dont give a damn about the environment. And they dont give a damn about anyone. They are mostly parasites or egoists.<br>
They are not the people who will make a change to climate change for example. As this is one of the hottest topics of the elites agenda. </p>
<p>The longer this drags out, the more 'rewards' will be given and the deadlier the shots will become.<br>
From one canadian document that was going around social media a year ago, stating that the first corona virus will have 10%  mortality rate. The second virus will have 30%. <br>
I assume that would be these vaccines. Or the weakened immunesystem that would cause the flu to look like a deadly corona virus. </p>
<p>So shortterm greedy people are thinking of the present and only themselves. Most of the society is like that. They dont care what their action today could cause in the long run. And this is especially a no go for the NWO Agenda.</p>
<p>This is the target that will be wiped out in the end. Im pretty confident in that. They will for sure blame the 'unvaccinated' and spread those lies, so the government and the elites can protect themselves.<br>
It is like a pyramid scheme. They take care of the above, and down there everyone else can destroy eachother. </p>
<p>And what I have learned in my whole life, that: <strong>Nothing is for free.</strong><br>
They may pay you a 100 bucks. If you are an endless credit overdrafter that doesnt pay bills, they will save money in the future with the new money system by not having you on board. If you are a type of person who has money, they will take it away from you if you dont have anyone who can inherit it.  </p>
<p>I believe, that everyone who reads, who is behaving like a 'decent' human being on this planet, wont have issues with the NWO guys. They need these kind of people, to drive innovations, to drive  the economy. The useless eaters, are just taking away and destroying and at the same time they redicule all the smart people. With such a society on major scale, a human population is able to destroy itself.  Just look at how they laugh and downvote us for showing them facts in the face. <br>
Not really pleasant. And they have done it with way smarter people aswell.   </p>
<p>As for me, Ill find ways to stay out of the mess and blend in when I need to. In a few years everything will be sorted out itself. This is where the lockdowns thaught us about the silent streets in advance.<br>
I believe that these 'lockdown' scenarios, we will witness in future without lockdowns. There wont be many people left. <br>
If 'swineflu' and masks ended 100 years ago. So will corona.</p></p>
