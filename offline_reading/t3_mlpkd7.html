    <strong>warefare</strong>
    <p><p>"My last live got removed for some reason so I’m having another go but in blog form. So I’m not here to argue about science or to get political, but what I will share are axioms based on warefare. In Sun Tzu’s text the Art of War(Lionel Giles translation) he shares that all warefare is based on deception. 
Now getting to the modern day and age of things. If I were someone in a position of power and wanted to take control of a group of people, I would have to do more than put out one source of data(type of dosage). Because if one source of data is the same data floating around...it would be too evident of what I am trying to do. I would have to have at least 3-4 sources of data. One that is lethal, another with adverse responses, a different one with no responses, and one with mild to no responses. That way the ones who received the less consequential data can then advocate and even champion the data giving others reassurance...especially to those who are not independent thinkers. Also too, I wouldn’t want the trajectory of my plan to happen over night...I still need bodies to run the machine. Think about it..."</p></p>
