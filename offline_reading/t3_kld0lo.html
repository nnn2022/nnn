    <strong>Does anyone else feel like the only sane one in their family??</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly just feel so alone. I’m 23F, living at home temporarily with my younger siblings and parents and they act like I’m the crazy one for wanting to go outside and because I actually miss being around people.</p>
<p>I was saying to my mom “if you were my age you would likely feel a bit different about these lockdowns”  since most young people I know irl don’t actually give af and are living their lives right now.</p>
<p>But of course my 22 year old brother cuts in and has to aside with my parents ( as he typically does) that he’s fine. Although he left the house for the first time since legit March only yesterday, and didn’t even get out of the car.</p>
<p>All he does is play games and sit inside of this dark house with the shades drawn all day, and speak to his friends online. Day after day after day for almost. YEAR. But they I’m the one who’s crazy for despising this kind of life???</p>
<p>I try to get outside at least every weekend to go for a walk at the park since it’s the only place that I can go and I would have legit shut down by now if I didn’t have that option. </p>
<p>But everyone else in my house doesn’t exercise, sits in front of the tv  playing games or watching the news 24 hours a day. No exaggeration at all, but It’s like I’m surrounded by zombies.</p></p>

        <p>I too am surrounded by zombies at the moment and I feel you.</p>
<p>Word of advice, never let them dictate if you can leave your own home or not. You're an adult and have the right to go where you want, when you want even still living with parents and don't have to justify your choices. I would be very firm and let them know that while you will be respectful, you are not going to live your life alone in perpetual fear.</p>
<p>I try to wake up my family but it is so hard when they are so tuned in to the MSM narrative and are always checking the cases.</p>

        <p>It’s already too late :( I made a post on this sub a couple days ago. They already do dictate where I go, since I’m under “their roof” technically, and I don’t have a car.</p>
<p>I have a remote job right now and am looking to save up while so I can move back out to where my job is next year, since they said the office will likely open back up in May. Just also buried under student loan debt which I’m trying to pay off as much as I can now since I don’t have rent payments at the moment. </p>
<p>I’m just so sad, and I want to see my friends as much as possible because my friend from college  just passed away from a car accident, and I never even got to meet up with her one last time because of this virus. Like it could be my last time seeing so many people and we’re just throwing that away for something that doesn’t even have a high death rate at all.</p>

        <p>You're not alone in this. I'm 26, live with my parents (59&amp;61) and my older brother (29) moved back this summer. All of them are brainwashed and can't seem to accept that they've been lied to and deceived about covid this entire year. I keep trying to tell them how the pandemic is a scamdemic and how masks are utterly pointless and don't work and are more detrimental than anything, but they don't wanna have any of it. As long as they continually believe it's for the "greater good" there's no convincing them, especially as they've bought fully into the Scientism peddled by the mainstream media and swallow the government propaganda hook line and sinker. It's hard to be the only one in the house that's awake to the lies and deception and knows it's BS while you're continually treated like you're the crazy one. </p>
<p>My dad, he's a hardcore Dem and religiously watches CNN/MSNBC every evening and morning. My mom, not as much but she still follows the propaganda. MY brother, well, even less so, and he's a bit more open minded, but still unfortunately falls victim to it.</p>

        <p>Yeah everyone in my family is a walking doomer Bingo card. Completely brainwashed and there's no bringing them back. We can't go one conversation without talking about the virus and how every death is Trump's fault. They talk a great game about how compassionate and caring they are for following all of the health guidelines, but they cheer when a Republican politician catches it. Lol it was incomprehensible to them that Trump and Chris Christie recovered because "they're old and overweight," forgetting that the survival rate for them was at least 98% to start. </p>
<p>My sister's friend is in college and is assigned a toilet, sink, and shower in her dorm bathroom, and she can only socialize with people on her floor. This was brought up at the dinner table once and they not only agreed with this lunacy, but they also said <em>I</em> was the crazy one for suggesting that there might be a problem with this level of micromanagement. This was the exact moment when I knew there was no way for me to bring back these hypochondriacs.</p>

        <p>Same boat here. All my friends who used to do all kinds of healthy "coming of age" sketchy teenage shit with me suddenly aged 35 years and became politically correct bootlicking hermits. </p>
<p>One literally hasn't left his house since this began.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone to do anything with because they are all so brainwashed.</p>
<p>Truly feels like a nightmare. Anytime I don't express complete submission to the government overlords they shut down on me like I'm an enemy.</p>

        <p>I’m so blessed that in the middle of CA, my entire family is woke to the work at hands by the elite and MSM. Neither my parents or siblings, friends or close family buy into the propaganda and bullshit that’s fed to the masses by the msm. </p>
<p>And let me tell you, my entire immediate family excluding myself had contracted covid 19, and has beaten it. My pregnant sister was even hospitalized for a few days for extra monitoring during her recovery. We are aware that covid 19 is real, but we refuse to let it dictate our freedoms and liberties that we have as Americans citizens.  </p>
<p>I pray the OP can help awaken her parents to the truth and they can start to relive their lives and enjoy it.</p>

        <p>No, my family has always been ultra wacked out but not in a bad way. Just never understood the going narrative, whatever it was at the time.  </p>
<p>However, I do have family members who's husbands / wives are totally buying this entire thing. It's weird not being able to speak to someone so close to you in fear of triggering their emotional meltdowns.</p>

        <p>I dared to talk to my software engineer well paid all day home stay brother about the whole scam and was scolded heavily. His only argument was to stop looking for conspiracies and do something to fix my life. I lost my job since February btw. and live alone. I felt total mess.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you're veryextroverted, and they're very introverted. And if nothing else, maybe they're really complacent? </p>
<p>I was the opposite of my parents too, if it's any consolation. I had to move out at 19 because I knew we were never going to see it all the same.</p>
<p>How are your job prospects right now? Maybe it's time to move you. You have your life, and they have theirs.</p>

        <p>I’m the only one in my family too. My teenage kids and middle aged husband all think the lockdown and masks are necessary. My son actually think nobody should die. He acted like I’m the angel of death to talk about the regular death rate. We raised our kids with scientific tv shows. They saw lots of predators take down prey. We are at the point where we can’t talk about it. They treat me like a conspiracy theorist when I say you can’t escape a virus. I also teach them about having a strong immune system.</p>

        <p>What also characterizes such people is that they follow the thoughts of the day.<br>
Today TV tells them masks save everyone. Early in march TV told them masks didnt save anything.<br>
They never had a critical thought of their own.<br>
They get angry at you for dissenting.<br>
I wore masks in march, I still do, but at this point, I take it off in open air, and I don't believe Im gonna catch a deadly virus from passersby on the sidewalk. Yet many people still act as if this is going to happen.<br>
When you forego watching TV or using FB / Twitter, it really does feel like one lives in a different world. It seems to me, what often characterizes the experience of foregoing TV and socmed, is feeling less depressed, and seeing the ones still locked into it as more emotional-driven.<br>
Even a minor disagreement regarding eg Trump or Brexit (regardless whether one is pro or contra) is met with hysteria from screen-people.</p>
