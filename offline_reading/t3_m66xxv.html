    <strong>Would you like to take part in my online research project?</strong>
    <p><p>Good Morning all Redditors of NNN. I am a social anthropology student from The University of Manchester conducting a research project/essay on this online community, this project will be entirely anonymous as I understand there is a concern regarding trust in certain users.</p>
<p>My aim is to understand more about this community and its members’ use of the community to share knowledge surrounding the topic of COVID-19. If you would like any more information (e.g. on ethics and anonymity), are somewhat regular in viewing/commenting on this page, or would be happy partaking in a short private zoom call in which we will discuss this community then please private message me letting me know. I will then give you my University email where we can organise a time to talk.</p>
<p>Thankyou very much, all and any comments are appreciated</p>

        <p>Although I would just like to say I am not planning on creating a monolith of this community so I am sorry if that is what came across and I will re-assess my question. All I'm looking to do is to gain an understanding in how this community is used by some of its members, specifics in why they are here are of less interest for my study. Thankyou for your feedback</p>

        <p>Part of the challenge for you is to determine which respondents truly represent this community and which potentially may be responding a particular way to foster a distorted view of it.</p>
<p>I'll give you one example:  Some may wish to have this sub characterized as a haven for virus deniers so they'll pose as a Redditor who's sympathetic and post a submission characterizing the Covid situation as a hoax to evoke a wave of agreement in discussion- the purpose being to instigate sanctions from Reddit for "misinformation".</p>
<p>Another ploy what has been tried is to play a hateful partisan political game, posing again as a like minded member, wishing death on people who take seriously the guidance handed down from the official sources and to create a false impression of hateful intolerance.  The purpose of this is ostensibly to provoke the removal of the sub.</p>
<p>If your objective is to understand the membership here, the first thing you need to do is carry a small measure of skepticism with each and every respondent and to bear in mind that the main topic involved deep suspicion conerning government policies and action that when taken as a whole do not make sense and as such it is unwise for society as a whole to allow politicians, whose actions reflect at best a poor understanding of the nature of Covid-19, to shape the future- with regard not only to business and the economy, but also how individuals conduct their personal lives.</p>
<p>Other members can add on, modify, correct and otherwise amend this as they see fit.</p>

        <p>Hi! So I have been asked to do a small research project towards my studies at university and this is to aid my chosen project. As an anthropology student I have an interest in all communities, online ones being my focus at the moment due to lockdown. I want this information as I see it as a way of gaining an understanding of how some people may or may not use online communities so as to understand truth and dis-trust, in a world such as Reddit so rich in different opinions and discourses. I understand that many may not wish to take part and that's all good but if you are interested then let me know, it will all be anonymous and I will be using pseudonyms.</p>

        <p>So I don't mean to be rude, but how are we supposed to trust that any of that is true and that you aren't just the hundredth shill here trying to dox people?</p>
<p>You do realize that there are at least two subreddits dedicated solely to getting this one banned, and doxing and harrassing everybody who posts here, right? In a given day, at least a dozen of them try the "hey, I'm just like you *wink wink nudge nudge* now let's do things that will get NNN banned" thing.  There was a trend for a few days for them to create sockpuppets with super racist usernames and then join this sub so they could pretend we supported racism. </p>
<p>You'll have to forgive me if I'm leery to give my real name and face to someone while that kind of horseshit is going on, based on nothing more than their word. Maybe that means the doomers win somewhat, since I've been successfully intimidated into not speaking up more, but that's how it is.</p>

        <p>This is a completely valid concern that I want to take very seriously. I was blindly unaware till now that this community is so actively targeted and people harassed so thankyou as I realise I'm going to need to reassess how to gain any sort of trust on here, and understandably so.</p>
<p>I am completely not here to claim that 'I'm just like you' or here to try and ban the community. I am just a student who wishes to better understand the use of online communities in a time of lockdown as ways of navigating social discussions online and expressing certain world views. This will be 100% anonymous and the interviews not recorded, I have completed a university ethics form confirming this. </p>
<p>However, I am very understanding that many may wish to not partake due to this issue amongst others I'm sure. Thankyou very much for your comment.</p>

        <p>De nada. There's a glaring issue that I don't know how you'll overcome. See, for you to get usable information, you'll need a way to weed out shills from legitimate posters. Easy enough to do face to face, harder over text. </p>
<p>However, asking one of us to go on cam requires a fair deal of trust. Because a shill could say 'I'm not recording' and be lying. I suppose you could also provide your ID, but a shill wouldn't have a problem with that, since if they got doxed in return, they don't have anything to fear because they adhere to the groupthink, so if they got exposed as a shill, they don't have anything to fear employment-wise the way we do. </p>
<p>I wish I had suggestions for you. Because I do get the gut feeling that you're on the level. But I won't gamble on it.</p>

        <p>Thankyou very much for this, I clearly have a lot to consider and I appreciate this as a potential risk for those considering.</p>
<p>For anyone reading, you could drop out at any time, these interviews could be purely audio if that is preference and I would not ask for your name, my specific assignment just happens to rely on completing a few interviews as it is anthropology I study so - human interaction. I could provide my university email as well confirming that part. Also, I am just a second year undergraduate at university so this will not be widely published, only submitted as an essay towards my degree.</p>
<p>I have a deep interest in communities and their functioning, this is all I want to pursue in this study, However, I would like to reiterate that I see now the threats people may feel in taking part and so no pressure. I understand and even this thread is deeply appreciated as I have a far better understanding of the problems I will face by carrying out this research project.</p>

        <p>The purpose is to gain an understanding of how members of this community use it as a space of understanding their own or others' truths about the world.</p>
<p>Every human does this, uses data be that scientific or social to understand the world around them e.g. the concern of certain government policies. The media doesn't so much cover these concerns but online communities are free spaces of discussion for topics such as these. So I want to gain a knowledge of how some members use it to gain any, if any, understanding of the world, be that political or scientific etc. in basic terms: how and why do people use this community?</p>
<p>But I may end up finding something completely different that I wasn't expecting as I'm trying not to assume any findings before I have got them. I hope this helps</p>

        <p>It is towards an anthropological study. I am not going in with a specific bias and not aiming to come out with one either. The only intention I have here is to make sure those I may talk to/interview gets across what their thoughts are - regarding the benefits and drawbacks individual members of this community may have towards online communities like this one. </p>
<p>If you want, search up social anthropology as this may give a deeper understanding of its purpose. It aims at asking the how questions rather than the why ones, making it a space without judgement or accusation and only looking at 'how' people create and apply meaning to the world around them</p>
<p>I understand the worry of propaganda, and completely understand reservations people may have in trusting me. So fair enough if you would not like to partake. Just to re-iterate, this will be 100% anonymous.</p>

        <p>This will not be published widely as I am just a 2nd year student at The University of Manchester, incredibly interested in this topic and hoping to further my understanding of online communities and knowledge.</p>
<p>I am trying to give an anonymous yet relevant voice to those from a dissenting group, some sort of understanding in a world full of judgement and misunderstanding. Fair enough if you don't want to participate if you see it as a personal risk, I completely understand that. I still wish you all the best</p>

        <p>To be honest, anthropology as a study often starts out very amorphous and I don't want to assume any findings until I have found some, especially on this topic. Of course I do have aims, to look at ways that language is used, how distrust is formed or reproduced and where danger is felt in the community (e.g. towards others trying to silence the community or danger of the government) and just the ways these are expressed. Its a study of understanding how rather than why, this is why I don't pose a threat. How do people immersed in these communities interact in them? not, why do they have the beliefs they do?</p>
<p>I personally think it is very important as nowadays I hear people dismissing very violently those who are raising entirely valid questions to do with the pandemic, I see this dismissal as incredibly reductive behaviour.</p>

        <p>Thankyou, please do.</p>
<p>I have found your input really interesting, I had no idea people used these communities to try and tear them down/ get them banned so actively. I realise I'm going to have to work out how to gain some sort of trust on here because of this, and understandably so. </p>
<p>Hopefully talk later if your around</p>

        <p>My name is Ren! To be honest I originally wasn't expecting this large of a response but as there is one I thought maybe I shouldn't put my name? So I changed it more for just privacy reasons (I'm still fairly new to Reddit) and then people who are interested in participating in some sort of private conversation away from reddit of course would be given my full name and university email and further identification if requested. But it seemed strange to put those details on here publically</p>
