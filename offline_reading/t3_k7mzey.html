    <p><p>I'm in the midwest and although pretty much everyone has given into the masks, everyone is still out doing whatever they want and spending time together. Just tonight I went to a packed hookah bar and then to get pizza with friends at the most popular pizza spot in town. The building was packed to capacity (at least 50 people) all smiling and laughing and having a good time.</p>
<p>But then I come on here and it seems like most of you live in horrible stuck up places filled with neurotic bootlickers...</p></p>

        <p>Of course it varies, half of what goes in here is venting - which apparently isnâ€™t <em>aLLoWEd</em>- hence the trolls and the shallow obsession with masks, and the defensiveness.</p>
