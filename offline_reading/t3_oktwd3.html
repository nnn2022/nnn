    <strong>Vaccine for Travel</strong>
    <p><p>I recently learned that an island I plan to travel to soon, which usually requires a negative test, is saying you can now provide proof of vaccine instead of a negative test. Since you can still get the coof with the vaccine, wouldn't it be selfish to not test? All the people saying we have to get the vaccine for the greater good will now opt to show they have the vaccine instead of proving they're negative, putting everyone on the island at risk just for a more convenient vacation. Yikes.</p></p>

        <p>I assume you’re speaking about Malta - they have announced just last week that from 14th of July you need to be fully vaccinated to enter or leave the country. no testing needed for them. the brainwashing here is incredible.. not only we have one of the highest percentages of vaccinated population in the world - but also the most brainwashed. many of them who took the jab already, say that people without the jab should be locked inside because we are supposedly super spreaders. it’s incredible</p>
