    <strong>Today is the NYC Democratic primary and I was forced to wear a mask to vote</strong>
    <p><p>I went to vote today with the thought process that I didn’t have to wear a mask. There was early voting all week and no one I knew wore a mask to early voting. Hell, in November at the last actual election on Election Day I didn’t wear a mask to the polling booth. At that time, the people there asked me to wear a mask and I politely declined, citing my mask exemption (which I actually do have). I was allowed to vote without a mask then because it would have been illegal for them to force me to wear one to vote.</p>
<p>Back then it was arguably “more dangerous” to vote without a mask (as if they do anything, but anyway), but now with NYC 70% vaccinated somehow I was prevented from voting in the primary without a mask?? Make it make sense.</p>
<p>The people there were all yelling at me to wear a mask. I refused because I have a legitimate medical issue. The lady there said, “then go home and don’t vote” — which is blatantly illegal and actual voter suppression. Even the bored officer there was like, “sorry you have to wear it. They said you have to do you have to.” As I left, I called the board of elections and told them exactly what happened and he said, “yeah they had no right to refuse you and to force you to wear a mask.” I filed a complaint and will be speaking to my local elected officials. I am so fucking angry right now.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly.  That’s why a mask was required.  If it was a general election I promise that would not be the case</p>

        <p>No, that’s not true. This wasn’t the case at every polling site. Hell, it wasn’t the case at any of the early voting sites! The freaking BOARD OF ELECTIONS said that what they did was absolutely wrong, which means that the petty tyrants that are the people who volunteer to man the voting booths are the problem.</p>

        <p>In New York, nyc especially, registering Democrat is extremely important since you get to influence who wins the democratic primary, which determines who gets to be the democratic candidate. Since democrats usually win the mayoral elections it’s extremely important that we insure that the Democratic Party puts forth normal candidates. It’s utterly asinine to reject an entire political party — you should vote for the candidate, which is what I’ve always done.</p>

        <p>No, at this point it's incredibly important to reject the entire Democratic Party.  Anyone with integrity or normalcy has left the party, that I can promise you.  Things changed after 2008 and there's no coming back I'm afraid</p>

        <p>I think a lot of times when some rando mask vigilante insists you wear a mask in a business or even voting place like this - they actually have no right to what-so-ever if you're exempt. That's a personal choice they're making because they think they're the hero of this situation as opposed to what they really are: insubordinate and not within their rights to do so at all.</p>
