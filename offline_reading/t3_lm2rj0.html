    <strong>Covid Discussion in the workplace</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone found a way to escape constant covid discussion/arguments at work? My boss is hardcore concerned about covid and brings it up multiple times per day. Since April or so, we have gotten into at least weekly heated arguments about covid. I have asked him several times to refrain from mentioning covid unless it relates directly to our work/operations but it has not been effective. We just got in a huge argument because I said it was ridiculous when he brought up that his daughter came over to their house and ate lunch in their unheated garage because she was not a member of the household and works in healthcare. If she was that concerned, she should not be there. I have started keeping a log of every time he brings covid up and what is said. I am afraid I will lose my job over this so I want to document everything for HR.</p></p>

        <p>If you're having 'heated' discussions with your boss over topics you both don't agree on, your days are limited there. You have already entered an area that few can return from. </p>
<p>If you like your job, keep your head down. </p>
<p>At my work, I'm a federal employee. Only egregious violations can affect my employment stats so I have no problem telling people what I think. But I have that privilege, you may not.</p>
<p>I agree with you, that's fucked up. Keeping a child basically outside due to covid is awful. What a dumb bitch. It shows you that she's incapable of rational thought when it comes to a child's wellbeing, what the fuck do you think she's going to do to you when it's time to renew your contract?</p>

        <p>Yeah if OP doesn’t wanna leave then they should just not engage these conversations with their boss. Get that paycheck and try to enjoy the hypocrisy from within. Maybe their boss has a high-risk family member in the household that plays up the severity. Or maybe they are high risk themselves. If not I still want to try not to judge people for decisions they make out of fear. And people can do whatever the hell they want anyways. If you don’t want to let your daughter into your house then that’s shitty for you but you made that choice. Just don’t get preachy about it.</p>

        <p>He sees it as totally normal and just an ordinary occurrence and that is what upsets me the most. The worst part is, 10 minutes later, he talks about how great my work is and that he hopes I stay another 4 years until he retires. I think it is upsetting me way more than him but I will get to the breaking point where I either walk out or say something way over the line and am asked to resign.</p>

        <p>That is why I had just asked him outright to stop bringing it up. I asked the same about politics but we usually tend to argue over that too. I know I have different views and said to him that while I respect his viewpoint, we are so apart that there cannot be a discussion about it. He doesn't want to hear it and keeps bringing up controversial topics. I'm going to keep my log and present it to HR if anything happens</p>

        <p>I feel you. I've snapped on quite a few people for just mentioning it once. Keep brainstorming ways to get out of listening to it without having to reply. I don't know your situation. My boss stays in his office and never mentions it. My closest coworkers are over it. The rest of them, same thing.</p>

        <p>We share an office so we are together 8 hours a day, 4-5 days per week. I get to listen to him ALL DAY LONG. He has also asked me not to go and socialize with other departments/coworkers because covid. So we sit together in isolation every day. It's absolutely miserable. If he isn't brining up covid, he's bringing up politics and we disagree even more on that.</p>
