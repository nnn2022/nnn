    <strong>Djokovic defends charity tournament in Serbia amid covid hoax</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/novak-djokovic-defends-charity-tournament-serbia-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-social-distancing-014028175.html">https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/novak-djokovic-defends-charity-tournament-serbia-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-social-distancing-014028175.html</a> </p>
<p>Novak Djokovic kicked off his charity tennis tour on Friday in Belgrade, Serbia, the first of several legs in Europe.  Yet, despite the covid plandemic still raging, fans seemed to attend the event normally. </p>
<p>Thousands of fans packed the makeshift stands for the event at his Belgrade tennis club, and very few were seen wearing masks.</p>
<p>Djokovic, however, defended the decision to proceed with the event.“ We have different circumstances and measures, so it’s very difficult to think of international standards,” he said, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/djokovic-defends-packed-stands-tennis-charity-tour-event-182015223--ten.html">via the Associated Press</a>. There were more than 7.5 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide as of Friday night, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">according to The New York Times</a>, and more than 424,000 deaths attributed to it. Serbia had more than 12,000 confirmed cases, though just 252 deaths. </p>
<p>The country has lifted most lockdown restrictions, per the report, and now only recommends that people stay 1 meter apart from each other. According to the Associated Press, 20,000 fans packed into a stadium for a soccer match on Wednesday in Belgrade, too. </p>
<p>Djokovic, who is currently ranked No. 1 in the world, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/novak-djokovic-impossible-to-play-in-us-open-if-extreme-covid-19-precautions-are-in-place-180906691.html">slammed the “extreme” safety measures that the U.S. Open is planning to implement</a> this fall in New York earlier this week, too.</p>
<p>“The rules that they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme,” he <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/novak-djokovic-impossible-to-play-in-us-open-if-extreme-covid-19-precautions-are-in-place-180906691.html">said, in part</a>.  “We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week. “Also, we could bring one person to the club, which is really impossible. I mean, you need your coach, then a fitness trainer, then a physiotherapist.”</p></p>

        <p>Looks like some influential people are starting to rebel against the greatest hoax in human history... It's starting to look better and better for the people by the day!</p>
<p>Is it me or have the propaganda networks started using twitter posts as some kind of co signing now? Most of these twitter accounts are straight bots and are being used as examples of the people who are " outraged " at anybody going against the global deep state agenda. I keep seeing twitter comments embedded in main stream propaganda articles as some form of co signing, which is non sense.</p>

        <p>The word “hoax” is a bit disingenuous. COVID-19 is real, but it’s commonly stated severity isn’t. Because it’s a novel virus the media can scare people with it more easily, and politicians have an easier time convincing people we need to give up our freedoms to “stop it”. In reality it is not much different than any of the newly mutated strands of existing viruses that come around every season.</p>
<p>COVID-19 isn’t “made up”, but most of the paranoia-inducing information spread about it is outright wrong.</p>
