    <strong>Untold BILLIONS will damn their own souls in 2021. Mark of the Beast is here</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccination is a smoke screen for the vaxx certification mark</p>
<p>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/</p>
<p>They want to tattoo humans with a qr code , a global citizen id, with an ink called Luciferase. It is a crypto wallet address stamped on your body</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/kkUkXytVoSU</p>
<p>They seek to have OWN your body by marking it like a beast. </p>
<p>You wont be able to buy or sell or get online or do anything without this mark. This is coming in 2021. </p>
<p>It is the mark of the beast. It is here</p>
<p>&rt;  It also forced all people, great and small,s rich and poor, free and slave, <strong>to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,</strong></p>
<p>&rt; 17 <strong>so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark</strong>,u which is the name of the beast or the number of its name</p>
<p>And untold BILLIONS are going to damn their own souls by taking it. </p>
<p>Do not be deceived!</p></p>

        <p>Yeah honestly it's hard to deny these bible verses at this point...It is probably that...well after all it wasn't really the devil who brought it but the people themselves. If the vast majority rebelled against the dictators who are probably satanists...good luck with having their goals achieved. Guess we might call it a test from God if the humanity have gone too astray or smth idk...everything is possible these days.<br>
I aint taking it, prefer to die than be a chipped cattle. And im getting more and more afraid I might have to make that decision at some point. Good think I've already made up my mind. God bless</p>

        <p>The symbolism again... the vaxx patent is 666 and the micro chip has Lucifer-ase as the name given to the special ink. Ink that contains nano particles that will change your DNA. In combination with your vaxx you will become mindless soulless meat bag slave with 0 rights. Hell we won’t even have dignity left if this goes ahead. </p>
<p>Their symbolism will be there undoing.</p>

<p>There is no known compound that does this.</p>
<p>However, I <em>am</em> concerned about setting a precedent where, by government mandate, you are obligated to accept foreign mRNA injected into your bloodstream.  Now or in the future this could be used to target the nervous system in subtle ways that <em>could</em> interfere with cognition.</p>

        <p>There’s actually lots of research available stating the nano technology present in the chips ink and the vaccine. The mRNA vaxx alters the genome of your DNA. They basically work hand in hand.</p>

        <p>As somebody who works in the field (computational biologist) and am close to a lot of emerging tech -- I have never heard of any mature technology that works this way.  Of course that doesn't mean it doesn't exist but I kinda doubt it.  I'd want to see citations.    I did a quick search, and while I did find some articles on nano delivery systems, I found nothing that looks like a mature technology for <em>altering ones DNA</em> via small or mid-sized molecules that are stable over long periods of time (e.g. that could be mixed with ink).  </p>
<p>Delivery of mRNA that has the potential to do this?  Yes, absolutely, which is why it worries me.  But mRNA is not very stable.  Which is why I believe certain forces want to be able to inject it directly, by government mandate.</p>

        <p>Well you’re the expert if you are a computer biologist. You can admit this is all possible but you don’t want to believe it’s happening. Bill Gates has given several, rather disturbing, interviews stating his intentions and involvement in this area. At the end of the day the patent for the vaxx is 666 and the chip is named Lucifer. Made and distributed by a man named Gates... That can’t be a coincidence, especially if you don’t believe in them.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt the intentions.  </p>
<p>I'm just trying to shore up the science behind it.  I'll go you one further and suggest that it is in the realm of possibility to target specific ethnicities or even specific bloodlines.  I actually don't think the technology is quite there yet but it may be in the foreseeable future (the computational infrastructure is all there -- the delivery mechanisms probably not yet).</p>
<p>I personally think that CV-19 is about ushering in the mandates.  My prediction is that the vax for CV-19 will be relatively harmless.  However it will establish a precedent -- your "mark of the beast" -- that allows later and much more sinister interference.  CV-19 is about softening up the public.</p>
<p>People behind this are extremely patient if nothing else.</p>

        <p>Precisely. A soft launch to the transhumanoid species. This vaccine with cause a lot of deaths through interferon response attacks while changing your body chemistry and genomes. Our technology is much more advanced then what science leads us to believe. Our universities work at keeping us ignorant. Unless you’re given a special invitation to advance you’re never going to understand the advancements. If you close the dogma off you see it. We can go to Mars but can’t get to the moon? We have produced a vaccine in record time for a fake plandemic but still refuse to cure cancer or address world hunger. We are on a slippery slope to technical tyranny and GMO’ed human slaves. If you are in the industry I hope that you speak your mind when something doesn’t add up. </p>
<p>And believe it or not but the US government has been working with cloning technology since the 30’s. I think they’ve got this figured out to a ‘T’ and know exactly what they’re doing. Hence the boldness of the names and lack of empathy towards anyone in disagreement.</p>

        <p>The ink has nano technology. It enters your blood stream. It will change your chemistry. So any kinda forethought will be erased from you. Any kinda free will you have will no longer exist. And if it gets this far... I imagine if you alter it in any way you will be charged with vandalism because it’s technically not your property... even though it’s embedded into you. And it only lasts a few years. So the next time you get called in for your chip they’ll just put it in your forehead. This is humiliating that it’s gotten this far. Humans cannot meld with AI. They can help each other but never become one. That’s why the bible warns us. Hell, even Elon Musk warned us about this. I really wish he’d speak louder. This can have terrible consequences for us.</p>

        <p>No. Gates made them. The vaxx and the chip belong to gates. Musk was on JRE show explaining this very thing a while ago. I don’t trust Musk either. He withholds a lot of info from the public. But he generally seemed to be concerned the direction AI was headed. I think he should speak up because his future is at stake too.</p>
<p>*I know musk has his own chips that he put in and tested on pigs. This Lucifer chip is not it.</p>
