        <p>I completely agree with your main point in that is astounding that a large portion of the population believes that these entities have our best interests at heart. I also agree that it can be very scary and depressing. I don’t necessarily agree, however, that they are going to win. I think it’s so important that we maintain at least a glimmer of hope, because having the attitude that all is lost is what will eventually lead to our defeat. We have to focus on opportunities, and use that as our inspiration to keep going. Have the uncomfortable conversations, keep the lines of communication open, approach every opportunity for discourse from a place of compassion and love. I think the point you made here - that these entities have a terrible track record when it comes to making true health a top priority - is often the strongest argument that we have. It’s becoming more and more irrefutable that viable treatments have been suppressed. If saving lives was really a top priority, all potential avenues for treatments would be explored to fullest extent, which they have not. That has been my focus when having conversations about the handling of COVID, and I think that has opened more eyes than anything else. Stay strong, stay hopeful, and don’t give up yet. All is not lost. We still have a chance.</p>
