    <strong>Facebook Propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t even know how to link the article, but posted Feb. 18 on Facebook, there is a piece of propaganda from St. Luke’s hospital (hand selected as Covid information) about an elderly couple Glenn and Arlene Olsen. They recently celebrated their 70th anniversary but for some unknown reason have been separated in their care facility. The article brags about their sweet reunion after unknowingly both being in line for vaccination and getting to spend precious moments together in the time afterwards (waiting for side effects). </p>
<p>Many things about Covid and Covid vaccines enrage me (I was never anti-vax), but this one may top it all. It’s beyond me how this article is promoting the vaccine. A couple this old should have never been separated. Why is there this mentality that people should live forever? I don’t get anything about the article or what it’s promoting. I may as well live on a different planet.</p></p>
