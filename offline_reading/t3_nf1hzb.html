    <strong>My spouses work is talking of firing those who oppose</strong>
    <p><p>My spouse has a history of anaphylactic shock and is allergic to many things. He thinks he still won’t be able to get out of it at his work. I’ve seen so many horror stories and have been begging him not to. He says he really really doesn’t want it but he doesn’t want to lose his job because it’s well paying and has good benefits. This really has the potential to ruin our lives because we were going to get married and start a family soon. If he loses the job then we won’t be insured through the pregnancy and we could also risk losing our home. But I also would rather have him with me alive and well.</p></p>

        <p>If they require him to get the shot, which based on how they are describing it they are, then he is eligible for the standard workers comp for a workplace injury.</p>
<p>You say spouse, pregnancy, and married like it is in the future. Are does this mean you are not yet married/pregnant? If you are already pregnant and not yet married, you may want to consider getting legally married now, starting a life event before he gets fired for not having the vaccine. Then you can be put onto his insurance, and they are legally required to give you a COBRA choice. It will be non-subsidized by the company at that point, but if you’re already pregnant now and looking at being uninsured otherwise, COBRA is probably still worth it. Just realized, I’m talking about in the USA, if you’re in another country, ignore everything I just said.</p>

        <p>I’ve told him that too but he loved this job. Hated the company but loved the job. He said if he got fired he’d feel like his life’s work would be for nothing even though he’s still young 28 he doesn’t want to start over. I gave him two other options for jobs with family that are less and different but he still doesn’t know what to do. He thinks most places will require it. He works as a foreman at a shipyard and says all the other sister shipyards will be pulling the same thing so he doesn’t know where to go without starting over.</p>

        <p>This is, unfortunately, the ploy that is going to push most people into getting vaccinated and towing the party line—threatening their job security and ability to stay afloat economically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I doubt there will be any sympathy for people like your boyfriend coming from society—the idea our evil overlords are pushing is that if the peasants have no bread, let them eat cake.</p>
<p>As for your baby, especially given your boyfriend’s allergies and particularly high potential for a bad reaction to the vaccine, I would not rely on his career to care for your child—it may be better for you to get married and find a place to live, then try to find a job after you give birth, and have your husband take care of the child. If that isn’t possible, in the kindest possible way, you may want to consider adoption, as children do much better with two parents (which wouldn’t be possible if your boyfriend dies from a bad reaction), and it is nearly impossible to provide adequate material and emotional support to a child as a single parent, even in the best circumstances (much less during these turbulent times!).</p>

        <p>I’m not a lawyer but I think you should be able to sue for wrongful termination if he were to be fired for not getting the shot. If it is not included in his contract and he is not being fired for any other reason then I believe that is grounds for a wrongful termination lawsuit. Especially since it’s not FDA approved yet. That’s what I think.</p>

        <p>Tell him to refuse no matter what. If they're really gonna sack him solely because he didn't have the jab then they'll just be adding fuel to the fire (pun not intended). Not only that, they'd be hurting themselves as a business and their reputation for getting rid of an otherwise decent hard-working employee (assuming your spouse is!)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just imagine the interviews with other jobs. "Why did you get fired from your last job?" "Because I didn't have the COVID jab. That's it." If they don't want to think like a business then that's on them.</p>
