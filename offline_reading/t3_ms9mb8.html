    <strong>Yeadon's Financial Interests?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, been trying to put some facts together and I've come to a bit of a brain twister here. I've been listening to Mike Yeadon's comments on the potential dangers of taking the COVID vaccines, particularly the mRNA vaccines, but I was wondering why someone who has been right at the top of medical research has suddenly gone totally against the status quo.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found out that Yeadon's R&amp;D team in the UK was basically being dropped by Pfizer, which was responsible for research in, get this - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2017/03/15/turning-pfizer-discards-into-novartis-gold-the-story-of-ziarco/?sh=2922e317572f">"Allergy &amp; Respiratory Diseases".</a></p>
<p>Yeadon's team then started their own company called Ziarco (internet history results seem bizarrely sparce for a leading biotech research company) which took on outsourced work working on behalf of Pfizer. Novartis then brought out Ziarco (carrying on outsourced R&amp;D for Pfizer) which as recently as 2019 <a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/more-news/novartis-rnai-cardiovascular-disease/">brought out another company working on the development of mRNA treatments.</a></p>
<p>Now the thing is, a quick look at links posted about Novartis recently shows they're working on drugs that reduce autoimmune responses and another that reduces MS symptoms, both of which are reputedly possible (long-term?) effects of the vaccinations themselves. The argument really is, is Yeadon having a sudden change of heart or is this a strategic manipulation for him and his friends who are looking to buy more shares back by damaging the reputation (and share prices) of a company that regardless of what anyone does, has already supplied a large number of vaccines to patients anyway (and any damage they may pose has already occured.)</p></p>

        <p>I think the man has made himself a pariah in the field by speaking out. His only redemption in the eyes of his peers and anyone that would hire him in the future will be if he if right on at least some of it.  So even if he does have a profit motive, it serves him to point out what he sees is the truth.</p>
<p>Quite honestly I think he will have a tough time getting back into his field in any case as he has been cancelled and has mentioned that he thinks that this whole thing is abut population reduction (an unthinkable conspiracy theory for many).  He's politically toxic and most companies won't want to touch him now.</p>

        <p>I honestly believe there is more chance of him simply doing what is right, but there is a niggle of doubt in there too, when there's multi-million dollar contracts to be won you can't trust anyone 100%.</p>
