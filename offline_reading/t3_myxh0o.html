    <strong>Fake “nurse” posts are becoming more and more common. Take notice, pick them apart, call them out. They are spreading lies.</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing this in multiple places but mostly on r/Trueoffmychest. These accounts that have either been around for a while or recently were created, make these posts about being a nurse during Covid, they all sound so similar you could probably guess they are made up/exaggerated. How do I know they are made up? Upon .5 seconds of scrolling through said profile that posted the story, you can very easily see they are not nurses, in fact most of them are in subreddits for entirely different professions, and have made posts that 100% prove they aren’t nurses. </p>
<p>Example: Yesterday a story about a nurse that was “devastated” because the amount of young people in the ward that “she” was in charge of dying of Covid, funny how she referenced and attacked anti mask people.... well I could smell the rotting fish and upon one click it brought me to someone who is not a woman, it’s a dude working from home as IT support...... blatant lie... post had 4.5k upvotes and tons of comments. It was deleted I believe by admins but regardless, you get the point. </p>
<p>If you see any of these posts just do basic research and you will be able to find the liars so easily.</p></p>

        <p>Saw one yesterday were a dude was claiming to be an x-ray tech and he was seeing all the lungs with no oxygen in 30 year old patients. Meanwhile, in his profile it said that he was a music producer who made dubstep and was taking commissions. I guess you can do both but nowhere else did it mention anything relating to any medical field. He posted it to trueoffmychest and was going on and on about how traumatized he was by all the patients with no air in their lungs.</p>

        <p>I’m in the medical field. Want to know something fucked up? The lab I work per diem at gets reimbursed like 100 bucks by the state or federal idk which one pays out, I think the state, for each test they do. The lab processes like 30 thousand tests a day. That’s just test. My buddy in billing told me that covid is making the lab so much money they will never stop it would wreck the system. You can look in my profile btw. I won’t say my main job title here. I work in NY</p>

        <p>I remember at the beginning people exposed a financial incentive for hospitals to put patient on respirators. Of course they ended up putting anyone on a ventilator because of the money (it also contributed to the ''people in reanimation'' numbers) and people died. It's been buried so deep I can't find articles about it. But I remember, many nurses were exposing this shit. People with negative PCR were put on ventilators because they had ''symptoms''</p>

        <p>&rt; and he was seeing all the lungs with no oxygen</p>
<p>That hurts to read, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kkVE1jD.mp4">because that's not how a CXR works.</a> Knowing even basic shit about clinical medicine is usually enough to notice when somebody is full of shit. For instance, chest x-rays:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/QdkI91H.jpg">This is what an unremarkable CXR looks like</a>. You've got nice clear view of the network of bronchioles, pleural space looks good, etc. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/oUwGMCP.jpg">This is a CXR on admission of a 64-year-old acute respiratory patient who tested positive for COVID.</a> Patient had a history of hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and sleep apnea. The image settings are a bit different to the first image, but generally you can see the larger brighter areas that indicate, in technical terms, that there's some junk in there. Looks bad, sure, but this patient's case report indicates he was in-patient for 7 days, was able to maintain O2 saturations in the 90's with a nasal cannula, and after a 5 day round of azithro and HCQ was able to maintain oxygen perfusion on room air. </p>
<p>And for comparison, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/57Cqhbf.jpg">this is an example of multilobar Pneumonia.</a> Again, image settings are slightly different, but you get the general picture.</p>
<p>No radiologist, much less a tech, would ever, ever describe their rads in terms of any sort of presence of oxygen, because that isn't a thing. </p>
<p>I feel like I've ranted enough, y'all get the picture.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's what i was thinking, 'lungs with no air' makes no sense, you can't see the air or lack of it and if there was no air, thy patient is dead and I don't think they do many xrays for dead peeps.</p>

They call people like us paranoid, crazy etc. But when you see things like this how can you just blindly accept information? It's a lot of work verifying what you hear or see.</p>

        <p>The "BuT oThEr PeOpLe!!!" Argument is flawed and awful and you know it.</p>
<p>I am perfectly healthy.nhow can I spread a sickness I don't have?</p>
<p>And how many elderly people are you all hanging out with for extended periods of time? Outside of passing them in a grocery store for a moment, the answer for me is none.</p>
<p>"BuT iF yOu SpReAd It To OnE PeRsOn ThEy CaN sPrEaD iT tO gRaNdMa!!!" Is an inane Butterfly Effect idea. 1) I don't have the virus so I can't anyway, but 2) neither you nor any other pearl-clutching concern troll ever gave a single shit before about accidentally spreading illness. This isn't the fucking plague, it's a rebranded flu. And the flu, any flu, is deadly to the old and sick. How many people have you hypothetically killed by your logic throughout your life?</p>
<p>3) It's an insane purity test that gaslights and frames your opponent as a monster. "if you don't do X, you're literally a murderer because you won't submit." I mean, that's a completely insane way to view anything. Hey, never drive a car again because you may get into an accident.and hurt or kill someone. Why would you do that, pre-judged MURDERER!!!</p>
<p>But I guess you just want to do nothing ever again and stay inside and completely give up on life because you may or may not one day accidentally get someone sick. Which is pathetic.</p>

        <p>This is how modern social control works.  Using shills, tags and algorithms they can create the illusion of support for something where no support actually exists.  That "primes the pump" so to speak and gets people legitimately supporting the the desired thing.</p>

        <p>Ive been telling everyone about those. Those videos coming out of China were the initial reason for the fear/lockdowns but no other video showing the same effects of people just falling over dead were ever recorded ANYWHERE else in the world. Thats when I knew it was fishy.</p>

        <p>During the time where people were touching monuments and other notably dirty surfaces, there was a girl who filmed herself licking an airline toilet seat &amp; posted it to social media. And they later said she got covid. As if there isn't a million other things you can get. But she SPECIFICALLY got covid.</p>
<p>There were many people basically trying to show that they wearn't afraid by doing these radical (and stupid) acts. That had to be combatted because they wanted people to be fearful. So they had to say all these people died afterwards.</p>

        <p>I do as well. At the only hospital for a county of 180,000 people. Yeah population isn't that high for a county but for a county that has a supposed high infection rate, I haven't seen a damn thing. Its business as usual, if anything its much much slower then before covid hit. </p>
<p>Our hospital was putting nurses and techs on furlough because the census was so low. Some pandemic aye?</p>

        <p>Having been in the hospital a couple weekends ago, I can tell you that most nurses (at least in that hospital) are aware of the bullshit that is covid. I even got a couple to take off their masks for the brief time that they were in my room. I never put a mask on and those the requested for me to do so, I simply said no.</p>
<p>People who fall for the fake stories and propaganda, in my opinion, deserve the shot and all of the consequences that follow. If you are not informed by now (been over a year) there literally is no hope for you. As for the rest of us, we just have to continue fighting this bullshit before it turns into full blown communism.</p>

        <p>Yes, correct. I am a nurse, I hate technology. You push the buttons, I push the meds. I’m married to an IT guy though. It’s funny: I’ve noticed there are two types of female nurses: the ones married to cops/construction workers/fire fighters, and the ones married to IT guys. Just about all female nurses fall into one of these two categories.</p>

        <p>Hey remember that one nurse who was blown up by CNN, saying that she lost count of how many healthy middle aged people were dying of covid and saying with their last breath “I thought it was all a hoax”? Well she was absolutely lying. You can look up the county she’s in, even lookup the hospital she works at given that she’s public staff, and see there were single digit covid deaths in her entire county due to covid and they were all above the age of 80. I looked this shit up myself, but then i started seeing several articles written about it - with the same conclusions. It was a lie, all of it.</p>

        <p>I saw another sub well over a year ago. It was a single bot, posting multiple different posts. Each one with hundreds of replies within it. Every single reply was from the same bot. If you didn't see the user name was the same, there's no way you would have known that this was one bot having dozens of simultaneous conversations with itself. All sounded like different people, differing opinions. Crazy stuff. </p>

        <p>Absolutely. You see this kind of obvious lie / propaganda constantly. </p>
<p>Never forget, the drug companies pushing these VERY expensive RNA gene therapies have an ENORMOUS advertising (propaganda) budget.</p>
<p>Reddit is well known for turning a blind eye to corporate interests running just such propaganda campaigns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, actual nurses and doctors are under threat of being fired if they tell the truth: empty Covid-19 wards. The "at capacity" some hospitals claim is NOT from lack of beds, it's because of anti-science lockdowns causing hospitals to furlough half their staff.</p>
<p>They don't have enough nurses &amp; doctors to cover the few patients they do have, NOT from any flood of patients.</p>

        <p>Saw somebody claim to be an ICU doctor yesterday. Claimed to have put people on ventilators. My first though was does he draw blood, wash bed pans and drive the ambulance too? Seems like a job for a resperatoy therapist, or else a nurse. Could be wrong though. He seemed to be from a different country.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting. Sadly there is so much misinformation and manipulation out there it's becoming new impossible to sort out what's truth vs fear based information. Some have threads of truth and reality, some are just blatant lies and manipulation. Trust is very quickly evaporating for everyone, and even faith is getting harder to hold onto.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this has been going on for a while. Lockdown shills going around making up stories of their friends or family dying of covid, then all these made up stories of young people dying or barely making it alive. How sick you have to be to even think of your dear ones dying and writing about it, making it up, just to make a point to strangers on the internet? It baffles me. </p>
<p>I never believed any of that and called it bull straight away. Both of your parents died two days ago and you still have the nerve to argue with a random guy on reddit? Something does not add up.</p>

        <p>I see these all the time.</p>
<p>I don't know if they aren't nurses or don't work in a hospital, but their comments don't make sense.</p>
<p>For instance a reddit post who said something similar to OP, except that it was tired of seeing people in their 20s dying to the disease.</p>
<p>But if you go to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">CDC website and look up deaths by age</a>. There are less than 2300, in the whole country.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1074/hospitals/">6090 hospitals in the whole country</a>. That's like 1 death per 3 hospitals for people in their 20s. How the fuck is she tired of seeing people in their 20s dying of COVID?</p>

        <p>You've opened the huge can of worms that anyone could lie about their identity on social media.  We have no way to verify anything about what a social media text post says--no, cross-referencing the account's other posts does not "verify" a damned thing.  We're better off assuming that social media are a filthy sewer of lies and using social media only for entertainment rather than information.</p>

        <p>Yep, have seen similar.  A while back, someone told me their mother died of covid so I should just fuck off.  I checked their post history and they were recently on a drug abuse sub reddit saying their mother died of a drug over dose.  People have no qualms about lying their butts off for attention or to 'win' against some stranger on the internet, it's a sad world.</p>

        <p>Online friend is a nurse in a major covid hotspot.</p>
<p>ICU's at least in America are designed to be full because that's how the hospitals in Burgerstan make money. All the news articles shrieking about hospitals being full means... the system is functioning as it should. </p>
<p>Mainstream media wrote articles panicking about hospitals functioning as they should. Just think about that.</p>

        <p>Well in my province of Onterrible the College Of Nurses of Onterrible made it that if any nurse were to speak out against the Covid vaccines or lockdown that they would be disciplined by the College. So unfortunately most nurses like myself have to keep silent because we risk putting our livelihoods in jeopardy. Support the group Canadian Frontline Nurses they are against the Covid vaccine and lockdowns.</p>

        <p>This is very typical reddit behavior. People lie and claim  to be whatever occupation or category of person gets the most attention and enjoys  the highest social credit at that particular time. The same people have lied about being in the military, lied about being male/female, lied about being LGBT, lied about being lawyers to get attention in legal threads,  lied about being restaurant  workers in threads about food service, etc etc. If you actually get caught, you just wipe your account and start over.  </p>
<p>Most of what you read in default subs on Reddit is complete fiction. r/AskReddit is fiction. All the OMC or AITA or endless other storytelling sub content is fiction. Reddit is a website of pathological liars competing for attention, validation, and fake internet points.</p>
