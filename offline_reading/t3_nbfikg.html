        <p>I wouldn't think anybody in any job would want to wear a mask all day.  Who wants to do that all day every day for the rest of their life?  I feel bad for these kids who have to wear them all day in school.</p>
<p>These maskers are ruining every single thing in life.  Work, restaurants, shopping, amusement parks.  It's like these people feel like they need to beat and strangle the joy out of everything just so they can feel smug and virtuous.</p>

        <p>The mask-wearing mob has certainly ruined my outlook on life, in general.  Before 2020, I'd never sit at home for an entire week.  Never going anyplace.  I would be at the gym, I'd like to visit a night spot every week or two weeks.  I'd go into a bike shop, I'd go to Target or Wal Mart to pick up a few things.  I'd go to a menswear store to look at suits or dress shirts.  </p>
<p>Now?  I rarely leave.  I get up from bed, go down for coffee and a smoke or three, go to my kitchen table, sit down at the computer, work till 4-5pm.  Get up, go back to the couch or to a place I can lie down.  Basically remain in a semi-trance state until 10pm, back to bed.  That's every day.</p>
<p>All because leaving home and seeing hordes of faces covered in masks, though I, myself, do not wear one anymore.  It's depressing.  It's angering, but to a point.  That anger quickly dissolves to just sadness, and a feeling of being "alone", even in a retail store with masked patrons all around.  And I live at my home with a wife, and a 12 year old daughter. I feel very, very alone.</p>

        <p>I have a two year old and when people started wearing face masks all the time her tantrums increased significantly. Kids learn how to react and learn emotions by the people around them. Toddlers can’t read eyes and it’s so important to see a persons mouth to understand their emotions, especially for a little one. It was sad to see her confusion all the time</p>

        <p>One of the worst things about the mask mandates, to be sure.  Slapping those damn diapers on their little faces.  My 12 year old has adjusted, but I've been "unprogramming" her for a while now.  </p>
<p>Like I've said here many times, as these people on this sub are the most like myself, I was "on board" through the end of May, 2020.  Once all the crap hit the fans in Minneapolis, Seattle, etc, etc, I saw the double standard around gatherings and causes, and the associated looting, burning of things, etc.  They lost me.  I spent summer 2020 growing more and more angry, locked up, at home.  I checked out when the mask was shown to me for what it is: about control of those who would allow themselves to be controlled.  I am not one of them.</p>

        <p>Yup. I wear it in public spaces mostly because I don’t have the energy as a tired mom to put up a fight at every store I enter with my toddler in tow, but the SECOND I’m out the door it’s off. The MOMENT I see other people no longer complying I am on that bandwagon. I don’t have the means at this time to lead any movements but you bet your ass I’ll be backing it</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right. </p>
<p>Not only is a mask detrimental to a child's interpersonal and societal adaptation (as you pointed out perfectly well) but this excessive Hygienic Theatre, where children are kept in an increasingly sanitized environment,  WILL NOT help them build up their immune system.</p>
<p>If we already have many kids allergic to peanuts, expect these types of allergies to worsen 50 or 60 fold in a few years.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you are ostracizing yourself just because other people are choosing to wear a cloth face covering for safety, and asking you to do the same non-intrusive task if you enter their business. My recommendation would be to stop making it an unnecessarily huge deal.</p>

        <p>As a bartender, I remember the first day all the restrictions started last spring. We were required to wear both a mask and face shield. But servers only needed to wear a mask, because evidently bartenders "can't socially distance". Yet servers can??</p>
<p>So for the first day, I was working with another bartender for 13 hours, and after a few hours of being required to wear both a mask and a face shield, per governmental orders, we both started taking them both off whenever we could get away with it. Every once in a while, the floor manager would come around and remind us to put em on, so they'd go back on again for a little while. But after like half the day, we refused to put the face shields back on, and wore the masks under our lips/chin. You couldn't hear, see, or communicate effectively with it on. In addition, our AC had broken down, so it was like 82 in the dining room and you couldn't friggin breathe. Fucking terrible. Management ended up not really caring, since good luck firing us and getting any other help, since I personally knew of so many people who stayed home and got paid big money by the government instead of going to work.</p>
<p>About a week later, management stopped caring as well, and literally everyone was wearing their mask below their chin and no one cared. Was finally so happy to be living in rural America, where no one really gives a shit, as opposed to right in the city. Almost all of our patrons dislike all of the restrictions, and I very rarely ever encountered anyone who wore a mask at the bar and/or made a comment about our masks. I felt bad for some of the waitresses though, cause many of them suffered from that bad mask acne.</p>
<p>I also remember talks of our Governor thinking about mandating that anyone wearing a face shield needing to wear it upside down, similar to a dog cone, so big scary Covid was sent upwards when you talk, as opposed to downwards. That was probably the peak of the stupidity.</p>
<p>I even had a bunch of job interviews last summer, neither party wearing a mask and nearly always shaking hands, and I'd notice that almost every place I went to had staff (intentially) not properly wearing masks. Which was great, because I refuse to work 50-60 hours a week for a place that required me to wear a mask for that entire duration. But again, no one gives a fuck aside from the doomers in their big cities. It's all just for show.</p>

        <p>I was a career bartender before this. Since last March, I bartended for about a month before I decided to look at other career paths. The masks take away everything for a bartender. No efficient communication, harder to show emotions. Imagine talking to your therapist while they’re wearing a mask and you’re not.
I feel uncomfortable going to a bar with masked bartenders. It seems robotic and no one is having fun behind that bar.</p>

        <p>Same. I took a new career path after the shutdown and then went back to bartending part time because I love it. I left recently because I couldn’t stand it anymore. It’s so different now. All the fun has been sucked out of it and I couldn’t stand it. Sucks.</p>

        <p>I resigned /retired from property maintenance because of the company rule to wear mask all day. Even alone, outside with no one around. I had a complaint I was 'killing granny' cleaning the (closed due to Covid) pool, inside the locked gates, alone, without a rag on my face... </p>

        <p>Every single job around me requires you to wear a mask all day. Unless you work for a private business that allows you to choose, you’re going to be wearing a mask the entire day. There’s no getting around it. My last job was a bit more relaxed about it, but we were only allowed to take off our masks when customers were gone. So basically we had an hour break. 7 hours with a mask, 1 hour without one. It’s not even worth it. I seriously don’t blame some people for not wanting to work right now. But god, I hate people who live off the government. They don’t realize that it affects other people who work all day. They don’t understand how taxes and the economy works</p>
<p>Many people on CERB are getting more money per month then they were making from their job per month. Would you rather work 8 hours a day, forced to wear a mask for almost min wage, or sit at home and do whatever you want for more money? I think most people would choose the latter</p>

        <p>I am applying to a local Coffee shop because mask wearing is optional for patrons and the staff. I would work in a warehouse since I can drive a forklift but every where here in the area requires mask. </p>
<p>I'm pretty much a shoe in because I used to live across the street and became acquainted with the owner a while back and applied there for a second job but things improved at my first job so I never accepted a position. She's always wanted me to work there.</p>

        <p>I work in a lab that, amongst other things, does the Corona tests (PCR), so I have to wear one of the FFP2 masks all day. It's really annoying at first, especially if it's been raining, but tbh you kinda forget about it after the first hour.
The worst bit is it gives me acne all around my mouth area because of the constant hot air.</p>
