        <p>Should we take into consideration the pre-existing mental health issues of the people who committed suicide? Should we take into consideration the pre-existing financial state of those people now facing financial ruin because of a few months of being inside?</p>
<p>It’s important to take care of your physical health yourself and not expect the world to go out of its way to help you, but expecting the world to protect your mental health and financial health when you put yourself in bad positions is equally selfish</p>

        <p>Alright I can’t believe I have to do this but here it goes</p>
<p>Your first article contains absolutely no academic sources and only references articles published by the <em>same</em> site which doesn’t constitute accuracy or legitimacy. It wasn’t hard to notice that the countries highlighted were struggling prior to covid as well. The issue isn’t solely Covid it’s the lack of national support of these struggling nations as well as the widespread corruption in many of these countries. The intent of the article flew right over head. It’s purpose is to spur people to support the UN. Nowhere does it fight against vaccines or covid mandates. </p>
<p>Your second article is academic research exploring the effects of the virus on small business operations and you are using to justify what? The relaxation of covid guidelines. Once again the solution is to support government funding of small business over big business (remember the ones mentioned in the first article). It is possible to maintain a cycle of lockdowns while supporting small businesses. </p>
<p>People treat covid as a joke something to live with but what they fail to understand is lockdowns and mask is damage prevention and mitigation. Without these procedures the deaths and economic turmoil would be exponentially hire. Take a look at the Spanish flu or hell even the bubonic plague. Sure the characteristics of the virus were different in several ways the point remains. Refusing to treat airborne viruses seriously leads to disastrous consequences. </p>
<p>Stop discounting science (literal fact) over 10 minutes of research and over zealous self confidence. Quite literally there are thousands upon thousands of bodies and hundreds of articles to prove your “analysis of the facts” confirmation bias and ignorance.</p>

        <p>I swear these people, don't see the clear problems in our society I can link them all I want they just in 1 er out the other.... So fucking tired of this shit man every fucking day is the same Like I make a comment be ause someone brings up that everyone is an autist that goes against the lockdown and then I get my quick ass response torn apart and force-fed the conclusion that I am simply ignorant and we can keep lockdowns going and keep subsidizing small business and nothing bad will happen... I walk around my smalltown see shops closing on my province's subreddit people are making jokes about closing their stores but Walmart staying open.....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But yeah Just do 10 minutes of research right /u/TwerkTeamA just find whatever articles that says lockdowns are good for everyone and preach it ignore the people with small businesses being suffocated in your own town of 10k people that have only had 6 deaths in the whole township and none in the town since this whole thing started but yeah we need the lockdowns province-wide totally... I'm just ignorant and succumbing to the confirmation bias that the reason I think they re unjust it's totally not because of what I see in my daily life maybe you don't go outside and see the things I see Twerk maybe you are a shut-in</p>

<p>I could continue but I think you get the point... </p>
<p>also it's not just me who does not agree with what's happening in my province and country look at these ex opp officers that made this</p>
<p>policeongaurdforthee</p>
<p>"Citizens of Ontario, Ontario’s Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, Premier of Ontario, Ministry of the Attorney General, Ministry of the Solicitor General, Municipal Politicians, Public Health Officials</p>
<p>21st December 2020</p>
<p>I am a Police Officer and know many other officers that support the following message.</p>
<p>After the unfortunate events in Calgary, the time for action is now. I have serious concerns over Premier Ford’s decision to expand further restrictions that put law enforcement officers in an untenable situation that must be avoided.</p>
<p>For 10 months public officials and bureaucrats have been operating with arbitrary emergency powers that often violate the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Everyday Premier Ford, Mayor Tory, and politically appointed bureaucrats are on television, radio, and in the newspapers, calling on Ontarians to slowly allow all civil liberties to be taken away.</p>
<p>What I have seldom seen is any comment by those in positions of Law Enforcement and the Judicial System addressing the lawfulness of these measures, or on the grave consequences, they create.</p>
<p>I am calling on the following stakeholders to immediately meet independently from Politicians and Bureaucrats: The Ontario Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, members of the Ministry of the Attorney General including Crown Attorneys, Judges, Justices of the Peace, and Constitutional lawyers.</p>
<p>Please collaborate and deliver clear and concise direction to the men and women in Law Enforcement. Until this happens, a moratorium needs to be declared on the enforcement of public health orders by peace officers. 10 months has been far too long for this not to have happened.</p>
<p>Are police officers supposed to uphold the Charter which they have taken an oath to protect? Or do Municipal By-Laws now supersede the Constitution?</p>
<p>At a time when the public trust in police has nearly eroded beyond repair, this is of paramount importance. The citizens of Ontario deserve transparency from the officials they have elected, as well as from the police that is sworn to serve and protect. This is not an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>What happened in Calgary cannot happen again. Never in my life did I think I would see police officers threatening to taser and arrest kids playing pond hockey.</p>
<p>Signed Police on Guard for Thee Will you stand?"</p>
