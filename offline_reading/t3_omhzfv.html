    <strong>Why aren't there any Traditional COVID-19 vaccines in the US?</strong>
    <p><p>We all know the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) are by-and-large experimental in that they have never had authorization or approval for human use. The same is somewhat true for the Viral Vector (J&amp;J, Astra) vaccines, as they have only limited human use for Ebola.</p>
<p>This begs the question: Why aren't there any traditional vaccines in the US or the UK? (By traditional I mean inactivated or attenuated virus vaccines) China has developed one, India is developing one, but for some reason the US went for experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>Saying traditional ones are ineffective is either ignorance or gaslighting. Countries that have used it had the same case spikes we are seeing now. Although mRNA is both easier to design and manufacture, Viral Vector ones have the same manufacturing issues as traditional ones.</p>
<p>Would we be sitting here talking about the true experimental nature of the vaccines (yes, they are experimental) if they had released traditional vaccines? My guess is not, many of us would have trusted the "science" because we knew the vaccines weren't brand new technology.</p>
<p>So this brings me to my concluding question: Is the vaccine rollout more about compliance than science? It's hard to rule that out when we see the massive propaganda techniques being deployed, but just thinking about their use of experimental technology instead of ones with long-term use seems more like a ploy to test and enforce compliance rather than truly help people feel safe.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it's really bugging me that we can't have a simple traditional vaccine. Instead they'll gaslight us about how "J&amp;J is old school tech" even though it had limited use during Ebola.</p>

        <p>pretty sure the CDC admitted in mid/late-2020 that they had never sequenced the virus, The whole thing is made up, they just run enough cycles on the pcr test that the false positives can carry the numbers they want to push</p>

        <p>I've heard both that they've isolated it (usually from media sources that don't have evidence) and that they haven't isolated it. What I do know for sure is that all the vaccine companies didn't isolate it themselves, they simply got the virus sequence from China and based their shot off that.</p>

        <p>The short answer is that utilizing mRNA technology has made it VERY easy to target a problem and fix it. </p>
<p>The problem is (and why none of these therapies have ever been approved so far) that the strings used to “fix” the problem are also tied to numerous other health issues. </p>
<p>It’s really the best analogy for “careful what you wish for”. Like ya, YAYYYY NO COVID....death by heart attack.</p>

        <p>Ya the fact that it is so "easy" to target is troubling in itself, as the human body isn't simple at all. Hearing the stories that it was made on a computer in like three hours is scary stuff considering vaccines take decades to get through the first phases.</p>

        <p>Well that’s exactly my point. </p>
<p>Targeting the issue to “fix” it is easy. Understanding all the strings that’s connected to it is not. </p>
<p>So in terms of simple timing, OF COURSE these “therapies” will edge out the others. They were able to do it instantly. And once they get in the market, FDA has no interest in facilitating, yano, competition.</p>

        <p>If these get approved, it doesn’t give total approvals for the others. </p>
<p>Even if it DOES get approved, the most telling of mRNA efficacy is how many additional actually get approved.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t give them automatic approval, but it’s hard to imagine a company like Moderna, who has never had a product approved or authorized, won’t rush to get their other experimental mRNA products on the market.</p>

        <p>There is no rush granted unless there is reason for the emergency authorization.</p>
<p>To my point, it’d be extremely telling if even 5 years from now the COVID shot is the ONLY mRNA therapy approved for use. It’s telling <em>now</em> for sure. But if it’s such a “safe and efficacious” technology, why not more?</p>

        <p>I think its a good question!</p>
<p>I think that there would have been a "sales pitch" and the mRNA product offered some attractive benefits to certain parties ( - not necessarily beneficial for the general public )</p>
<p>1 - they are fast and easy to produce = quick rollout.</p>
<p>2 - easy to update - good for the manufacturer, and good for the governments - if you are anticipating "mutations". </p>
<p>Vaccines containing only 1 antigen target will produce a selective pressure for mutation in this target protein. Using a "leaky vaccine" can also encourage the emergence of more virulent / dangerous strains to emerge (research leaky vaccines + Marek's virus in poultry)</p>
<p>3 - If governments are planning / see an opportunity to implement vaccine passports - and want to prioritise this over public health, you want an speedy, less effective vaccine requiring updates.</p>
<p>Perhaps its bias - but I think this is all about vaccine passport technology.</p>

        <p>Great points. I definitely agree with the first two points 100%. </p>
<p>The only thing I’m skeptical about is that there was this grand plan for vaccine passports, at least in the US. </p>
<p>There was no guarantee the left was going to win the election (even with the widespread fraud) and Trump would’ve never support led passports. </p>
<p>Second, we know the government is super incompetent. Even the elites are divided, despite the fact that people think they are some unified body. </p>
<p>A plan this long term would’ve required a concrete plan, and there are too many variables they would’ve needed to be controlled by an incompetent govt body.</p>

        <p>I think they’re united on the overarching issues but there’s so many details that go awry that they end up failing. </p>
<p>I even think they failed on c19 and everything they are doing now is a quick jerk reaction to fix their failures. That’s why it’s so sloppy.</p>

        <p>Here in Switzerland they're also vaxxing with only mRNA vaccines. We have Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna. No other ones are 'allowed' here and if you're vaxxed with something else, say AstraZeneca you're covid certificate is basically worthless lol. Also our government prayses this and says that we 'only have the best vaccines Switzerland'</p>

        <p>Novovax has a tested vaccine  that contains 5mcg of spike protien with an adjuvant ( a substance to increase the immunogenicity of the spike protien).</p>
<p>Adjuvants are an established technique.
This vaccine does not use any active mRNA or DNA. The trial data shows its as good as the other vaccines. Still too early to be sure about safety, but conceptually if pushed I would prefer the novovax over the  gene editing vaccines.i would never recommend the mRNA/ DNA vaccines due to safety data being absent.</p>
<p>My current advice to people is lose weight, get fit and don't get PCR tested unless you're ill enough to need hospitalisation.
I am considering ivermectin but need more data before I can recommend prophylactic use. For early symptoms in people at higher risk of hospitalisation it seems a sensible recommendation as ivermectin is safe and cheap, however going down this route means you enter the early PCR test zone with all the risks of false positives. Get a good doctor to help you manage is vital but difficult as most doctors have been academically lazy with covid.</p>

        <p>On the other hand I'm wondering why the Eastern world didn't use the new technology in their vaccines. China, Russia, etc. It's not that is new knowledge, I think it was developed in the 80's.</p>
<p>There are so many unanswered but obvious problems in this plandemic, starting with the lab leak and PCR test scams.</p>

        <p>As owner of the patents, CDC controls who gets access to the virus. Given that Sequoia, a precursor company to Moderna, filed the patent to detect and treat coronavirus 3 days after CDC filed for the virus itself, which should not be patented in the first place, it seems that they'd like to keep their little racket to themselves.</p>

        <p>Well we know that flu shots are unable to eliminate the flu. The stated goal is to eliminate the virus, which is impossible with traditiinal means due to the speed of mutation. They might be trying to do this using some other means. Likely the ones doing traditional vaccine also know it, but they know this disease is not that serious to really need it eradicated. Which I think is way smarter, the traditional vaccines will be only useful to protect the vulnerable from the first variant and as virus mutates to new, less lethal ones, one can just return to living with it.</p>
<p>Obviously this is an explanation based on the assumption that their goals and motives are benign. Which seems to be heavily contradicted by the facts.</p>

        <p>If the FDA wasn't in on it, they wouldn't have granted emergency use authorization. They should have said "if this is such an emergency, go with what you know and has a long track record".</p>
<p>I actually thought Covid had some kind of characteristic that made a regular vaccine impossible. Then I hear about China using a traditional vaccine. I was absolutely shocked.</p>

        <p>The FDA was in a tough position for the EUA. If there were vaccines available and they didn't give them emergency approval (which requires no safety testing and very little efficacy testing), they would have been hammered by both sides.</p>
<p>At least by giving them approval, they threw a bone to the people begging for the vaccine. The problem is places started requiring it. If they pass full FDA approval (not age-specific or failure), they they deserve to be burnt to the ground.</p>

        <p>It has all been about propaganda from the very beginning. What science? Name one mainstream narrative or action that is actually scientific. The only thing that made any sense was flattening the curve so as to not overwhelm hospital capacities. Obviously, that lie only lasted like a week.</p>

        <p>This question has bothered me for a long time, because the uncertainty from any new tech is bound to cause hesitancy, and the countries with 'billions' of people to vaccinate seem to have chosen the traditional 'inactivated' route.</p>
<p>The way I read the situation is that the pandemic hit at the perfect timing for the biotech sector.
The government needed to get big pharma interested in developing a vaccine and big pharma in exchange said "I'll do it, but it will be in this new platform that you'd otherwise take a decade to approve."</p>
<p>Sort of a compromise from the government to get something done that would otherwise not happen at all.</p>
<p>And to add another angle to the discussion. I really hope that the platforms prove themselves safe and effective even if these particular vaccines are a blunder. With CRISPR and gene therapy in general, we have a real chance of actually curing diseases as opposed to endless treatments, and having a proven delivery platform either LNP or adenovirus would go a long way.</p>
<p>That's not to say what is being done is right, but at least there's a chance to have a really good outcome for the future generations out of it.</p>

        <p>That's a nice "glass half full" angle on this, really hope that's the case here. I just have my doubts that companies that profit off continued treatments have any interest in eliminating the things they are treating.</p>

        <p>mRNA has traditionally been used for more serious terminal illnesses, especially cancer. Not for widespread, relatively harmless viruses like C19. Why would they push something experimental for a virus like like this if they are trying to push mRNA for more smaller scale (in terms of shots delivered) rollout for more serious diseases?</p>

        <p>You're right about their failures, but they have tried a bunch of different types of vaccines and found the result to be the same: ADE. But if the result was going to be the same, why couldn't they at least make a trustworthy vaccine to at least slow the spread for a bit?</p>
