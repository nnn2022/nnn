        <p>Absolutely brilliant. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Unfortunately we live in an age where the majority of young people have been raised to accept everything the MSM tells them, they believe the older generation (me) are rabid gammons or tinfoil hat wearing loonies. 
Yes there is a virus but it’s not as bad as they’re saying. Yes we should have locked down last year. But we should have closed the bloody borders our greatest defence has always been our island status. It’s absolutely hilarious how bad we have been failed.</p>

<p>I  fear it's even worse. Young people are raised by the MSM as a third parent. Plonked in front of BBC1 all your life, or getting your news from your smartphone every hour of the day. Telling them that the BBC is biased is emotionally like insulting their parent.</p>

        <p>I'm in Scotland and I thought we already <em>were</em> in lockdown until January 18th. It's stupid. I have highers this year and at this rate if we can't go back to school soon we'll have no big opportunities to gather evidence. At this point I don't even care, caring about going back to school just makes me annoyed. The only one that matters to me is art, so I'll just hand in my portfolio work and be done with it.</p>

        <p>I was in school until December but now I'm not and I have no idea how they're going to gather evidence for our qualifications. I can understand why they've become so despondent, I honestly feel the same. People care more about fear than friends, and we've been robbed of our lives. We're at no risk from the virus, yet we're constantly spinning and changing direction with our qualifications, knowing that the confusion will cost us not just now but in the future. It's really stressful, to the point where you just stop trying to absorb it, stop trying to care about it, but that affects how much you care about everything. You're trying to prepare for a future, but that future looks bleak. For me, it's like someone sucked all of the joy out of my life, things I used to love just make me feel sad now. It's empty and hopeless. I'm not sure if your kids feel like that, but I thought I'd share anyhow.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. You’ve done a great job of explaining exactly how my son feels. When the announcement came tonight he told me he felt absolutely terrified of what his future holds, it’s heartbreaking as a parent to see him missing his friends and him not being able to go to social places as they are all closed. 
I’ve not stopped him from visiting his two closest friends but it’s been really hard for him as he’s usually a social butterfly. I hope you manage to find a little bit of hope that things WILL get better.</p>

        <p>Same here, I’m in S6 and I’m not convinced I’ll get to say my goodbyes at this rate and have a proper means of closing the “school” chapter of my life. I assume you’re in S5? I feel especially sorry for you as your first exams, assuming they go ahead, will be advanced highers/crash highers, and although I don’t agree with the education system and exams, teaching you information in order to pass an end of year exam and subsequently telling you, with short notice, that the exams are cancelled is awful.</p>

        <p>I am S5. I don't really like exams but I can't stand the confusion of what we're doing. We prepared as if exams were coming and now it's just a mess. My prelims were supposed to go ahead after Christmas, as long as I proved myself then I'd be just fine. But now I have no idea what to do. Last year I was really involved in music, and I can at least hope that next year I'll get to do all of it again and have a good year of school, but people I know in S6 will never get to do that. I think not being able to say goodbye would feel worse for me! Good luck!</p>

        <p>I totally get you, same here with prelims which are now final assessments which are now... to be honest I don’t know what. I’ve sorta mentally given up with school, I don’t want to stress myself out over uncertainty. Luckily I scored very well the last couple of years with regards to national 5s and highers so getting into university will be no problem. The question is: is it worth it? I mean I personally feel so numb to pretty much everything at the moment and I feel like others feel the same way, as if there’s nothing to strive towards in a world gone mad. Outcome seems pointless now, I’m somewhere between nihilism and apathy, and it’s not nice. I just can’t genuinely enjoy anything anymore without that activity being laced with COVID. Best of luck you you too, and I truly hope for your sake that you can gain a memorable, for all the right reasons, 6th year.</p>

        <p>I'm feeling the same, like all the joy has been sucked out of everything. I did good at N5 but my highers are important so I can't help but worry. I'm interested in art though so I just need to get that down and I can continue with art related subjects next year and then leave. I just don't know what kind of a future in preparing for. If it's one like this, count me out, everything is a reminder of covid. You can't just do anything without being told about it.</p>

        <p>Just focus on your art and I’m sure, assuming it’s something you love, you’ll find purpose through it, and hopefully it is something which distracts you, even slightly, from the constant COVID fear-mongering. If it makes you feel better, I performed, in my opinion, sub-par in 2 or 3 of last year’s prelims and, for my final grades, got 5 As. And this is my issue, what kind of world are we progressing towards and is it truly worth contributing to it?</p>

        <p>Thank you! I did well in prelims last year but I'm worried since we can't do them as planned. Art has kept me going through all of this, and really the only good that has come of this is that I realised it's what I want to do and have improved at it a lot. The grades feel especially meaningless since they're basically just a guess. I hope you find something that can help you in that way too!</p>
