    <strong>The real goal of mass vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>I was reading a few posts on this sub, and how the media was out to get the J&amp;J Vaccine, and that's probably the one you would want if you were to get a vaccine.</p>
<p>No, the reason they pulled the whole "Oh God J &amp; J causes blood clots, we are pausing this NOW!" was to gain a small amount of trust back. If countries all over the world are 'skeptical' and 'watching the data' during the vaccination race, scared sheeple will assume that governments are STILL looking out for their best interests.</p>
<p>Don't believe ANYTHING on the news. If it's on the news, its garbage, through and through.</p>
<p>They want everyone vaccinated so that they do not pass the filter when we officially merge into the new age. Those that have manipulated their DNA by taking a mRNA vaccine (the rulers of this reality made it VERY clear that these vaccines were different) are not going to pass. They are not human anymore. These people have agreed to become a different species. Their DNA will be different than those that have not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The vaccines are patented, and those patented mRNA vaccines will merge with your DNA and you will officially be a corporate entity. Watch the movie Gattaca if you want to understand where we are headed. They will be able to tell if you legitimately received the vaccine by pricking your blood, because you will have a different makeup than a real human. They are starting this testing in California: https://www.calscope.org/#faq-sec</p></p>

        <p>You're right, there is something else going on with the world that the 'rulers' are trying to stop, or change it's direction. That's why this came about at the turn of a new age, I believe they are losing a battle and control over humanity. As we see the world get's crazier, the veil is lifted from more people</p>

        <p>tbh i would consider a "one world order" or whatever to control the world if its done by the right people and reasons, but the groups thats trying to do that right now is doing a really shitty job trying to trick and lie there way to the top. i think they would be better off just coming forward and flat out admitting what they want and seeing if the world is receptive lol</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and if they cant even handle the shitshow that they are doing now, LOL @ thinking they could actually handle the job of fully controlling all</p>

        <p>So you think modified DNA is an enhancement? Serious question. What benefit would that provide to the individual?</p>

        <p>The DNA enhancement is for the benefit of the controllers and ultimately the system we are part of, not to benefit individuals. That would be crazy. The "upgrades" or enhancements are to allow human subjects to more efficiently serve the system they are currently bound to.</p>
<p>THEY benefit when people die. THEY also benefit when people live, esp with the next iteration of genetics/DNA they desire for the next cycle of humanity, because in their next iteration they want to make subjects live more or less trapped in their 3D system forever, meanwhile physical and repairs and upgrades can be performed on their human body/cells/organs, even remotely which is the whole idea behind transhumanism--a real fountain of youth. Their system benefits from LIVING and DYING human beings all the same, but even more so from the living when they are blind, controllable, and unaware. They want the vaccinated to be the only ones remaining at the end of it all, probably a few hundred million or something, while the rest perish in the most horrible ways imaginable. I just hope we can stop it.</p>

        <p>Yeah Gattaca was an incredible movie. Both incredibly revealing, and incredibly depressing. We are literally on our way to having daily injections. I mean 3 injections coming in under 9 months for some people, what's to say next year they do monthly injections?</p>
