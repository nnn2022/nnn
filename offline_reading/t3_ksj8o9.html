    <strong>Fuck the UK Government. Fuck the UK media. Fuck Online School. I'm 18 and my education and prospects have been utterly fucking destroyed.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear UK government, </p>
<p>FUCK YOU! You have utterly destroyed my life. I came into College on a set of pretty much straight 8's (A equivalents), and I was looking forward to studying my favourite field of Ecology, and become an ecologist. I had visions of me hiking through places I've always wanted to visit in the little UK wilderness there is left, taking surveys and studying birds etc. Its as much fun I'll ever get in this technological hellhole of a society.</p>
<p>Things were going well, and then BOOM, this lockdown shit took place. College was shut. At first I was like fuck yeah, two weeks extra holiday to myself playing my favourite video games and going on long walks round the woods! However, 5 months in, I quickly became depressed. I didn't have particularly high self-esteem or life-satisfaction before then, but I my motivation and self image utterly plummeted. I began flunking tests and not understanding anything being taught to me, as everything was so impersonal (being online) and I became more and more bored and apathetic to everything. I lost interest in life, I started hating the internet, video games, and I spent most of my time moping around the woods feeling utterly worthless. </p>
<p>I still bought the narrative, until I started finding out the truth of this being massively overblown to restrict freedom and transfer wealth to politicians and mega-business. I still wore masks and social distanced, but I felt humiliated and and a loser. I then grew a pair and stopped with this insanity. Aside from a few tame confrontations, I was generally left alone. Just keep my head down and avoid eye contact is the trick. However, they staggered my college timetable. We were divided into groups and I was only allowed into College half of the time. At this point, although I think school is objectively pointless, and we should be living by ourselves in nature, I was beginning to miss the structure and routine. </p>
<p>I sunk into a deeper and depressive spell, until I found r/CoronavirusCirclejerk to keep my spirits up. And when I'm in College, we're literally treated as cattle. I just feel like such a loser obediently standing on laid out circles and being coerced into treating people like biohazards and wiping fucking textbooks down! The only reason I complied at College, is because I knew I would be ostracized, laughed at and gas lighted by my peers, and I would probably be sent home, so I just hunkered down and complied feeling rather bitter and humiliated. </p>
<p>However, towards the end of winter term, I felt like I was having a little normality back. The restrictions weren't being enforced as much and some teachers had stopped giving a flying fuck, so I was given a brief reprieve, and I was looking forward to my sister returning from her education abroad year to study maths at Uni. I haven't seen her for months at this point.</p>
<p>My family have also suffered quite a lot, so we were pretty hyped to have her return. We aren't Christmas-y, but we put in loads of effort into cleaning the house, making mince pies, rearranging the furniture and putting up Christmas trees around the house. Then that fucking c*nt Boris Johnson moved the fucking goalposts at the last minute and made it impossible for my sister to travel across the channel. I cried for the first time 5 years, like balling my eyes out in the woods. I was inconsolable. My sister also became thoroughly depressed, and those laggy Zoom calls suck even more than not seeing her, because its just a bitter reminder of how utterly shit the situation is.  </p>
<p>Now my exams have been cancelled, and now I'm relying on moderated assessment, and we already know what a clusterfuck that's going to be. I now have no motivation to even pick up a pen nowadays, and the lack of clarity, consistency and security has made it impossible to plan my future. Universities are grim places, I'm actually for the first time failing College and my life is utterly fucked. So yeah. And fuck LBC too.</p></p>

        <p>Except they don't actually have empathy for 85 year-olds at all. They are just either sanctimonious, virtue-signaling pieces of shit or so disgustingly stupid that they believe this virus is aerosolized ebola and therefore dangerous and deadly for their own 25 year-old ass. Don't fall for the "saving grandma" bullshit. I'd sure hate to be an 85 year- old and have to live through something like this...a bunch of sanctimonious imbeciles destroying society and forcing elderly people to spend the last months and years of their lives withering away in loneliness and isolation.</p>

<p>My parents are in their 80's and are having a blast. They are active and healthy and have a strong social circle. They are completely ignoring most restrictions and doing the same things they used to.</p>
<p>The only downside is they can't go to their clubs, which they dislike intently. </p>
<p>They actively make fun of other "oldies" who spent all their time inside or are paranoid. They had to deal with the tail end of WW2. This is a walk in the park to them. They know they don't have much time left so they are doing as much as they can while they can.</p>
<p>My Dad is on a "at risk person" register. He was told off for going to the shops himself. He gave them hell. :)</p>

        <p>It's still Murdoch owned. Don't get me wrong I'm glad it exists but I'm suspicious. Feels like controlled opposition. </p>
<p>I'm not saying the presenters themselves are aware of this and I love Julia too. It just feels like they half get it but too often blame ignorance rather than understanding this is all part of a global plan to change the way we live. Things like talk radio help to pacify people into doing nothing because people are already speaking out right? But they aren't really. They will just tell you to vote for the next crook who comes along claiming he's different.</p>
<p>The solution to this is not political, it is social. It is going to take all of us to actually physyically unite and do something.</p>

<p>There aren't any. The few that tried get violently shut down and massively fined and most people his age are completely brainwashed. Are you unaware that we are in a literal police state? </p>
<p>I don't think "things could be worse" is the right attitude, things can always be worse. We need to be fighting for better. Now is the time to be angry and do something.</p>

        <p>It's the Conservative party that did it here in England, across the EU it varies - Sweden's government is closer to Dems than Republicans. It's not possible to neatly compare parties across very different political systems and contexts, though.</p>

        <p>At this point? Well I'll tell you what - our Founding Fathers coined a phrase, "Give me  Liberty or give me Death!" I'm sure you've heard of it. If people are unwilling to take action that's beyond huddling around a street corner then no, this tight-knit network of international bankers won't give up their power. </p>
<p>But they'll utilize the press and run a nice melodramatic headline about it so your "protest" will gain attention in the virtual psychodrama that your fellow citizens will watch on their couch - scoffing at the audacity of you to even suggest defiance as a course of action. </p>

        <p>Disobey the illegal lockdowns. All of us, all at once. We could open up tomorrow if we wanted to. Stop paying taxes too. We could do whatever we want if we realized who we are.</p>
<p>Problem is there's no we, just good and bad, black and white, right and left, red and blue.... they've got us shattered into a million pieces, right where they want us.</p>
<p>Problem is they know what they're doing, we don't. </p>
<p>Information is key to unite the left and the right, to join the fragments into the <em>we.</em> That's why they censor and shill so hard. </p>
<p>Keep educating yourself to the point that you can explain the fraud concisely to anyone and everyone who will listen... <em>build the case for freedom.</em></p>
<p>The key is that what they are doing are Human Rights violations, and are illegal. The way out of this is through the court system, by forcing "them" (health officials, politicians, police etc) to show the evidence supporting their insane 'health measures', in a court room, to a judge, under oath, which of course is a battle "they" cannot win if undertaken at length against a knowledgeable adversary because their case is non-existent and verifiably fraudulent to anyone in the know.</p>
<p>Therefore aside from straight up lawsuits, a great avenue to fight the bullshit is in fact using these "health acts" fines themselves. Health Act, Quarantine Act, whatever they may call it in your country, it is an "emergency" set of laws that can be instituted temporarily in times of crisis. These laws are the only reason they can fine you for having your friends over, or not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>If there is no crisis, there can be no "health act", nor any health act fines.</p>
<p>This is the way...</p>
<p>Take every one of those fines for gathering or not wearing masks, plead not guilty, set it to trial, and force them to justify their measures using evidence and science.</p>
<p>I bet there's many of us in here who could win that argument ten out of ten times, no law degree required.</p>
<p>But the key to winning that argument is knowledge and data. </p>
<p>If <em>we all</em> knew the truth, they couldn't keep any of this up a day longer.</p>
<p>This is the way.</p>

<p>Honestly we need to do something serious to end this. More people need to take action and gather in huuuuuuge numbers. There's too many people sitting around waiting for other people to do it.</p>
<p>When it gets warmer - Mayday, let's do this. It's time to get serious, and I'm aware this post is almost comical but IDAF anymore.</p>
<p>If there was twice as many  people at November protests we would have been disarming police. They could hardly cope.</p>
<p>This will not end through polite discussion. We're coming up to a year and they are openly admitting there's no end in sight. This year is the time for all of us to actually get out there and do something.</p>
<p>It does wonders for your mental health being around other free thinkers too.</p>

        <p>This challenging time will pass and things will eventually get better. My son is the same age as you. He decided to not go to school for the time being and is focused on working. He got a decent job and works 60 hours a week so he is very busy, and he has learned a lot of new skills. He can go to school later when things open up. </p>
<p>Focus on what you can do in this moment. You may have to change your plans but you can always return to them.</p>

        <p>I'm in the exact same situation, my experience of college will be ruined. Back when colleges were open I was scared to go in, not because of covid, because I refuse to wear a mask and the constant pestering and glances in my direction. I haven't seen one of my friends since march, and another I haven't seen his face because of the mask he wears anytime he's outside of his house. They think harsher lockdowns and a vaccine will help, and I'm hoping I'm wrong, but I don't think it'll do much. 
I'm pleased about the exams being cancelled simply because I'm predicted well in all my subjects and no pressure in the summer term. But I can see how it'll affect some worse than others, let's finish strong together.</p>

<p>That's the thing it wont. We've already been told that we'll lockdown in Winter and the vaccine won't change the circumstances entirely. Its fucking depressing, but I'm glad you'll probably do well. Hopefully Boris, Matt HanCOCK and that Gavin Williamson don't screw up the algorithm again.</p>

        <p>This, I wish I understood this before I got a massive student loan and a shit job.</p>
<p>Now I make money sitting on my ass at home when I decide to and student loans haven't caught up with me because I'm "unemployed". What a cushty do huh? But I'm still against lockdowns and mandates because you'd have to be completely brainwashed to not see that it's morally worng. </p>
<p>Incidentally, it's interesting to go to protests and find that many other people there have figured out how to live like this too and stopped working for anyone. I met about three other people who just make money from gambling and trading and I've never met anyone in real life who does that before.   </p>
<p>I'm sure taxman will catch up with me eventually.</p>

        <p>You have just described my exact situation.</p>
<p>I'm a few years further ahead in the whole education thing (3rd year uni, 21 y/o) but I feel like we have the same problems.</p>
<p>I could repeat everything you have said but everything you have said, I am experiencing too. The herding of cattle when I sit exams, the awful remote learning sessioins (made even worse by the fact they are hosted by a lecturer who is awful at the best of times), the complete destruction of the industry I have dreamed of working in since I was a kid, the loss of friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>The zealots all say "it's just a mask", "it's just for 3 months", "it's just physical distancing"... but it is not <strong>just</strong> anything, it is absolute control over individuals... everything is controlled; where you may stand, where you may sit, when you may enter public places, when you may see those you are closest to, when you may enter a friend's house, and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>I really don't see a future any more and I am so angry at the Government for making this mess. I continue to hope (yes, I know that's cliche) but I am losing reasons to hope by the day. I see Chris Whitty saying things like we're going to have restricyions next year and it really gives me no reason to hope for anything good.</p>
<p>What a great time to be young, eh. A virus which poses absolutely no threat to &rt;99% of the population, especially us, yet we are the ones who have been alienated and blamed the most ("it's because of all those young people going to raves" and the like), and we will be the ones to burden the costs for the arseholes who just want to sit at home now and get paid for doing nothing. How fucking fantastic!</p>

        <p>yeah, my main concern isn't just my education anymore, its seriously this growing police state that the majority of the public seem to support. I've studied Nazi Germany twice and Russia under the USSR, so I know the tactics. </p>
<p>But lets just say for a moment that its gross incompetence, rather than something a bit more malicious. When this is over there's going to be a HUGE recession. We're talking 1929 Black Thursday style depression. This means that you and I are going to struggle to find even the most menial jobs, and higher education will have all been for nothing. The country will be more divided than ever. So either way, I've completely lost all hope.</p>

        <p>See if you can go to trade school (loads of these are online). It's much less complicated than college and it will give you a leg up when college re-opens. Ecology is very vague. Is there a particular vocation related to it that interests you? For example, I want a job in forestry one day, so I got heavy machinery training (through the military but you don't have to do that) and license. Whatever you can find to keep yourself busy and motivated, do that. When all is said and done it shows you have grit and employers like that.</p>

        <p>Hey. As a fellow ecologist/environmental scientist I can tell you straight away theres more than one way to skin a cat. Your grades do not define you. don't let the bastards grind you down. </p>
<p>Where are you based in the UK? And secondly, can you drive? The driving this is REALLY important for ecology work. Do you know what type of ecology work you want to do? Bear in mind much ecology requires you to be awake at unsociable hours. </p>
<p>I tried doing ecological consultancy in the uk. The summer was awful. I barely had any sleep from doing bat surveys and then had to be in the office 9-5. Ecology firms need you to do a lot of volunteering usually before you can get your licences. So look at using your extra time to see if you can help out with an ecology firm in the uk. To see if you like it and get some experience. </p>
<p>If you want to go abroad that's a different story but there are more ways to do it than you think. I wanted to do ecology but the unsociable hours worsened my depression and anxiety. I knew I didn't want to be in an office all day though. </p>
<p>Feel free to DM me to talk more. But I got to where I am career wise by taking 'the long route' and many people have to take this. </p>
<p>Give yourself some credit. Times are stressful right now and I couldn't imagine doing a levels with this going on. But if you want some career advice from a 23 year old whose already done it feel free to DM me and I can offer what I can from my experience as career advise 5 years ago was awful for me. </p>
<p>Keep your chin up. Work experience is becoming more valuable. See what there is about as people are still working in the pandemic and it will put you ahead. If you can't do that, then start familiarising yourself with uk based species in your spare time. With ecology, you have to have very good location specific knowledge and even knowing what plants you need to look for on a survey will put you ahead of others your age. </p>
<p>I feel for your generation and if you need you need to talk or help with college work DM. I didn't do biology but I did do environmental science at A level and degree level as well as geology and archaeology. There's a lot of overlap too with geography if your doing that too.  I'll help you with what I can. </p>
<p>But remember. Your grades do not define you. You are your own person and you can carve your own way through despite having mental health issues too. You can do this.</p>

        <p>I'm based in the South-East currently. I study Geology, Environmental Science and Biology. I've done plenty of work experience with the local Parish council, but seeing as that's all gone now, and its funding is going to be cut to the bone even after all this due to the inevitable recession. No, I cannot drive. And a car seems like a nightmare economically. The insurance will cost more than the car, and there about 15 different taxes you have to pay on top of maintenance, and I've only managed to save around £1000 from previous work. My parents are finding it hard economically due to the lockdown either. We paid our mortgage off a while ago and we have enough money for essentials and the internet, but its still looking bleak.</p>
<p>But thanks for the advice. I'll start looking for experience opps again :D Anyway I'm more interested in birds than plants. I love drawing them and learning their calls etc. I know all my trees too, but I've never found flora particularly interesting personally. But I do have a wild flowers book at home, so I can go to the heathland and see if I can find anything interesting. It would probably boost my self-esteem too. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for this. :-) Keep your chin up as well.</p>

        <p>Hey I'm not from the UK but I've been around the environmental field for work. A lot of guys who are successful in this kind of work actually have a trades background. Trades are pretty safe right now and they're still hiring where I am from so I think if you can go that route it can lead to many great opportunities. </p>
<p>Have you looked into becoming a certified Arborist? That's a really good trade to go into if you want to work in forestry. You can do so much with that kind of work. In the environmental field having a skilled trades background could open up many doors in the field.</p>

        <p>Which is cheaper?</p>
<p>Homeschooling and Online Classes?</p>
<p>Or public and private schools?</p>
<p>Here’s some other questions</p>
<p>Can those parents even stand to be near their children for so long and have the patience to teach them?</p>
<p>Are those kids the types who need someone by their side to guide them step by step in person because simple text or a video aren’t enough?</p>
<p>Lastly, will they have the same amount of prestige as graduating from this high class private school or college?</p>

        <p>Honestly, aside from finances, I wouldn’t exactly trust my kids with strangers for so long</p>
<p>Sure we know all about and joke about pedophile priests(even found out about pedophile nuns in Germany)but how many people know about Pedophile Teachers?</p>

        <p>This is a little soggy country that runs mostly on quiet resistance to the aristos -the political class included-, it always has. They mostly did not especially mean well, they never have. We didn't truly invent industrialism, it was really happening across Europe as an inevitability of technological progress, here's plenty of Enlightenment interest in improving production efficiency, and there were factories before the Victorian ones people tend to picture, as well as business practices that aren't so far off attempts at such production: eg. huge books of fabric samples for clients to flip through and choose a pattern to have embroidered on their curtains.</p>
<p>We have had louder resistance, too - out of industrialisation was born the trade unions and Labour party. It's often irritating here, but it's not especially cold in atmosphere, apart from literally. If we existed to work then I'd expect more people would actually do their jobs, because all the work-dodging, with GPs being the worst, is making lockdown much worse than it has to be.</p>

        <p>I don't know what OP is studying, but for my A-levels, I did Biology, learnt about viruses and how they mutate, Psychology, learnt about conformity and mob behaviour, and English, in which we read Measure for Measure and learnt a tad about authoritarianism and why not to apply rules that people aren't going to follow. All much more useful to me than to the government this year, that's for sure. UK education still tends to get good at college level I believe, it's not just indoctrination.</p>
<p>What are your subjects, OP? I know just how badly this situation trashes concentration, mine was a mess for most of last year, but whether your curriculum is fine or not, hopefully you don't need school to learn it.</p>
