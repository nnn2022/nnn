    <strong>Another doctor you never voted for gives his irrelevant opinion</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/08/vaccine-masks-michigan-safety/%3foutputType=amp</p>
<p>Thanks for your congratulations for the vaccine I didn’t and won’t take. Don’t think I don’t see your wordplay, starting the conversation under the presupposition that I have or will have the shot. </p>
<p>I don’t “need to” do anything you tell me to do, and just so you’re aware I took my mask off 9 months ago. Thank you Florida! And stop thinking the more assertive you are in your language the more people you’re going to sway. You’re pissing us off more. </p>
<p>I don’t care about your credentials or how virtuous you are, despite you really wanting me to know about it.</p>
<p>”Because I know we’re a long way from being safe, I want to communicate a shared commitment to everyone’s safety by wearing a mask, by signaling to everyone that regardless of whether I’ve been vaccinated or not, I’m taking the basic action of protecting myself and others around me. “
- A direct quote from the article. You’re a real hero doc. Will your next article be bragging about charity work?</p>
<p>Your healthcare is not my responsibility. My story is unique in that I was poisoned and disabled by a pharmaceutical (Cipro), so my distrust for the makers of this vaccine is not even quantifiable. Many in my community of floxies (those poisoned by a floroquinoline) are flaring years after they recovered. If there was ever a medical exemption, I have one. But I don’t need it. My exemption is called freedom.</p>
<p>I will take a 9mm before this shot. But the key point here is nobody came to save me when I got sick. I was left to die on the side of the road by your colleagues, doc. So your emotional appeals about a community and saving the world mean nothing to me. The world didn’t help when I became a statistic of yours, you pill pushing son of a bitch.</p></p>
