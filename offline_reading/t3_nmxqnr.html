        <p>&rt;The hospitals in the United States were not prepared for this pandemic. PPE was severely lacking and the average American was hoarding masks while self-quarantining.</p>
<p>That's not at all what the cause was. The CCP placed MASSIVE orders of gowns and N95s from 3m and others on a first come first serve basis in Jan-Mar of 2020 and then <em>kept ordering</em> while also sending out agents to literally buy pallets of them off the shipping line.</p>
<p>&rt;Doctors and nurses were forced to re-use PPE, putting themselves in danger and risking a collapse of the hospital system.</p>
<p>You're conflating two issues. My hospital never ran out of PPE, we rationed it because all there was to order was cheap Chinese shit they were selling at a huge markup. My first COVID exposure was a Chinese "KN95" that literally fell apart after 2 hours in a hot zone. </p>
<p>&rt;Given this scenario, the public messaging from politicians had to be designed to slow the public demand for masks so hospitals wouldn't face a crisis. </p>
<p>So, you admit then that the government lied for a month during the early pandemic almost certainly leading to thousands of infections and deaths that could have been prevented ? But it was for the "greater good" so it's okay? I'm sure the victims of the Tuskegee Experiment felt just as good about that.</p>

        <p>As many have said at year ago, professional medical supply and everyday supply are two different things. Hospitals have a different source of masks and equipment that people buying masks would not have disrupted. That’s generally a myth to think that the general populace would disrupt professional medical supplies.</p>

        <p>Do you have anything to back that up? I find that unlikely, there was a minimal public market for masks prior to Covid, I cant imagine it would be large enough to support being a separate company that also doesn't supply medical masks.</p>

        <p>Not separate companies. There are only like three major companies that provide most medical supplies en masse. They almost always have two distributions. One for professional usage and one for non-pro use. That’s why you can buy things like bandages and gauze at the pharmacy. That’s the stuff for non-pro use. It’s nowhere near Pro Grade. The medical community would never run to the pharmacy to resupply. That’s like the army going to the local gun store to re-up their ammo supply. The two exist in different chains of commerce.</p>

        <p>Right. I think we mostly understand the same things.</p>
<p>I think what I'm getting at is that its still the same maximum threshold of supply either way. Its the same companies, and more importantly the same machines producing the public, and professional supplies. </p>
<p>A well run company has no more machines running than they expect to need to meet demand (plus a margin of error), as having extra machines running would be a loss. So... of course they would need time to step up production to meet a massive surge in demand? Planning a public response that builds in time for the production to be increased to ensure the quality (or quantity) supplied to the medical supply seems logical?</p>

<p>Misinformation isn't how you stop bulk buying. By claiming masks aren't worthwhile and then do a 180 once masks are abundant.</p>
<p>For starters medical masks have a strict supply chain and aren't purchasable by the common markets, like toilet paper. Secondly, a lot of published studies were used and the usual "follow the science" used to show masks did nothing.</p>
<p>Once mask shortages were gone, new studies suddenly showed they were effective.</p>
<p>The methods used throughout were loaded.</p>
<p>A pandemic hit where there was no liable vaccine, no drug to help,no medical intervention and nearly everyone was looking at Daddy government with expectant eyes.</p>
<p>Masks were used for psychological safety. Government then used people's adherence to masks as a launchpad for greater adherence mentalities for accepting a medical surveillance state.</p>
<p>I don't care if I am walking by a vaccinated or unvaccinated person. Nobody should care.</p>
<p>If this had a 15% deathrate at all ages and a million children were dead I would shoot any fucker in front to get to an experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>The reality is I now know three people who have had clots from the vaccine. I know zero people hospitalised or dead from the virus.</p>
<p>I know 2 people who have tested positive and it was fairly average flu for them.</p>

        <p>I think (in my totally untested, unscientific opinion) that it's a form of progressive virtue signaling because metropolitan whites are fascinated by hearing it as a black colloquialism. I've also read a few tracts that explain that because it's not gendered, it should be a preferred term to "you guys."</p>
<p>Here's an example of some horseshit from Vox (but I repeat myself) from a few years ago that includes this concept.</p>

<p>listen to the video and not read the USA Today headline. Fauci said the risk is low at the moment but could change. There were no masks in the stores, CDC/WHO down played mask requirement.</p>

        <p>I wonder why the OP only included a picture of the top    of the article and not a link to the article itself.   Oh wait, that’s because the article doesn't quite say what OP would like it to say.  Here’s a link to the actual article: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/17/nih-disease-official-anthony-fauci-risk-of-coronavirus-in-u-s-is-minuscule-skip-mask-and-wash-hands/4787209002/</p>
<p>Fauci and the NIH were speaking at that moment that the risk to the US was minuscule, and it was because we had only had a few contained cases at that point with no outbreaks.  The article even states that Fauci said if the virus slips into the country in places the government doesn’t know about then “we have a problem.”   He then said short of that don’t wear a mask (I.e. If we aren't having an outbreak) unless you are contagious.  He also said that your typical mask from the drug store would not protect you much and he was right. Most of the masks then weren't even pm 2.5 grade and even the pm 2.5 masks don’t protect the wearer that much. They help protect other people from you (That whole “your mask protects me and my mask protects you” business).  Unless you have an outbreak than making the general populace wear masks is pointless.  </p>
<p>Try to also remember that this was Feb. 17th before any Western country had reported large outbreaks. Italy hadn’t blown up yet and that was the first signal that covid was going to break wide in the Western world.  There was definitely some hubris in the West at this point, but the bigger problem was the hysteria and xenophobia that was kicking in.  In my opinion, Fauci and others were trying to keep things calm as alluded to the article.</p>

        <p>If you are <em>infected</em> with COVID-19 and wear a mask you're less likely to pass it on to others via your breath, speaking or sneezing.  Here's the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask">research</a>. </p>
<p>If you are <em>uninfected</em> you are less likely to breath in the virus suspended in the air and get sick. </p>
