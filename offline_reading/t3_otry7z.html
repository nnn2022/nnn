        <p>In case any of you were wondering where to find studies showing the opposite of what this BS study claims, here's 33 studies for why masks don't work: https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o28j4o/scientific_proof_masks_dont_work_and_cause_harm/</p>
<p>btw disregard the long comment of "summaries" that the shill u / mimimi- put. They aren't "summaries" but rather they are twisting the articles' words to appear like they're pro-mask. That user is also most likely the culprit of many of the organized shill attacks on NNN.</p>
<p>edit: Jesus Christ the shills keep talking about how the second article was retracted and using that as a strawman to say ALL of the articles are wrong so f*ck that I'm just removing that article and now you sheep have nothing to b*tch about :)</p>

        <p>Didn't check all of em but this is another good one showing masks have no effect on post-operative wound infections when worn by surgeons.</p>
<p>&rt;It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections. On the contrary, a 50% decrease has been reported after omitting face masks. The present study was designed to reveal any 30% or greater difference in general surgery wound infection rates by using face masks or not. During 115 weeks, a total of 3,088 patients were included in the study. Weeks were denoted as "masked" or "unmasked" according to a random list. After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact tha the numerical difference was a statistically "missed" difference. These results indicated that the use of face masks might be reconsidered. Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a healthy operating team.</p>

        <p>It says right there though that there was no statistically significant difference. Meaning they did not find evidence that the use of masks affects wound infections. Which is expected, because wound infections aren't caused by people breathing on them...</p>

        <p>That was believed to be a source which is why mask wearing was adopted as part of the anti-septic operating technique. Why would they run this trial otherwise?</p>

        <p>I guess it's something they wanted to explore? I can't speak to their motivations.</p>
<p>Masks worn in operating rooms are the surgical type, meant for droplet precautions (not respiratory). They can protect the patient from droplets, like coughs, sneezes, or spit from the medical staff, though I don't think this is their main purpose. They mainly protect medical staff from getting blood and other fluids splattered into their mouths and noses - this is the main reason they are worn from my understanding. That's why you don't have to wear a mask as part of sterile technique if there's no risk of droplets from the patient. This is a very different purpose than masking to prevent the transmission of a respiratory disease.</p>
<p>Wound infections are usually caused by bacteria on the patient's skin getting into the their wound.</p>

        <p>No, they said they might as that is not what they were trying to find out in this study. All the ones that have tried to evaluate airborne disease transmission have found no significant effect either.</p>

        <p>Masks affect breathing. I know nothing about VO2, and I don't need some irrelevant scientist in a lab telling me what my personal experience is or should be.</p>
<p>Masks affect breathing because they restrict airflow. It happens that way because you are putting something over your mouth and over your nose. </p>
<p>I just don't see how anyone can argue with this.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, powerlifting - the ultimate test of cardiovascular and respiratory system strain.</p>
<p>When covid first hit my gym required masks. Every Monday I have a scheduled session with my personal trainer, and when I first had to start doing it with a mask I realized I couldn't because things I could do without one just about made me pass out while wearing it.</p>
<p>Thankfully he didn't care if I took it off, but listening to people actually argue it doesn't affect breathing is <em>hilarious</em>.</p>

        <p>&rt;This paper just got too much visibility and big pharma shut it down by retracting it.</p>
<p>The journal retracted the paper, not 'big pharma'.</p>
<p>&rt;Notice how all the "reasons" for the retraction are ad hominem attacks.</p>
<p>What part of this are ad hominem attacks?</p>
<p>"The Editorial Committee concluded that the author’s hypothesis is misleading on the following basis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A broader review of existing scientific evidence clearly shows that approved masks with correct certification, and worn in compliance with guidelines, are an effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The manuscript misquotes and selectively cites published papers. References #16, 17, 25 and 26 are all misquoted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table 1. Physiological and Psychological Effects of Wearing Facemask and Their Potential Health Consequences, generated by the author. All data in the table is unverified, and there are several speculative statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author submitted that he is currently affiliated to Stanford University, and VA Palo Alto Health Care System. However, both institutions have confirmed that Dr Vainshelboim ended his connection with them in 2016.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A subsequent internal investigation by the Editor-in-Chief and the Publisher have determined that this article was externally peer reviewed but not with our customary standards of rigor prior to publication. The journal has re-designed its editorial and review workflow to ensure that this will not happen again in future."</p>

        <p>The first point… “approved masks”… that no one bothers to enforce… so yeah… most people just want to see a face covering they really couldn’t care less if it’s a an approved, N95, or whatever… 90 percent of the time its theatre… ballyhoo… and that’s all we care about now eh is “peer reviewed” like that’s the only thing that matters anymore… </p>

        <p>Let's take a look at no. 1. So if a review doesn't fit some other narrative, it should be retracted?</p>
<p>No. 2. How about you show me the misquotes. I can guarantee you they just picked random references and claimed that they were misquoted.</p>
<p>No. 3. Of course there's gonna be speculative statements in a review. It's a review, after all.</p>
<p>No. 4. So what if the Doctor ended his connection in 2016? That is just an affiliation. The institutions are just fraudulent money-suckers.</p>

        <p>For number 4., you aren't actually looking at the science, are you?</p>
<p>In the video, the doctor claims that the smoke particles are bigger than COVID particles. This is actually true! However, since COVID isn't airborne, it needs to cling on to something so that it can travel. This thing that it clings on is your water droplets in your mouth (As whenever you talk, cough sneeze, laugh, scream, etc., you release water droplets). These particles are bigger than the smoke particles, so essentially the whole experiment is pointless. Another thing: He didn't test the vape whenever he didn't have any mask on, so we can't compare how effective they are without masks.</p>
<p>TO SUM IT UP: COVID travels on larger particles than the smoke, not smaller. The doctor also didn't compare masks/without masks, so there was no point to see how effective they were against each other</p>

        <p>The demonstration in the video in article 4 where the doctor has an expired license since 2016, claims that smoke particles are smaller than the particles that escape from the mask, which give people COVID (As I have explained in the first comment I wrote). However, the droplets are larger, so they don't escape from the mask easily than smoke particles. How can I explain this to you any easier?

        <p>No. 1: if a paper is published that is clearly not up to academic standards because of points 2, 3 and 4, and it claims something that doesn’t seem to be correct based on all other evidence we have, then yes it makes sense for it to be retracted.</p>
<p>No. 2: The retracted paper states that “It fact, the current standard of care practice for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is breathing 100% oxygen [16–18].”</p>
<p>Paper 16 states that “More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen”. Nowhere does is say that they are given 100% oxygen, and nowhere does it say that treating patients with oxygen is standard.</p>
<p>Paper 17 nowhere mentions treating patients with oxygen. It is a paper about isolating the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>No. 3: these are not speculative statements. This is them providing a table which contains information that has no source, no evidence to back it up, and no justification of its accuracy. There is no reason to believe that this information has not been entirely made up.</p>
<p>No. 4: if someone claims to be part of an organisation that they are not part of, and does this in an attempt to increase their credibility, then that clearly undermines their statements.</p>
<p>None of these inherently mean that the information is incorrect. What they do mean is that this paper is not by any means rigorous and so it’s findings cannot be taken with any amount of confidence. There is no reason to believe that the information contained within it is factual.</p>

        <p>The retraction specifically mentions misquoting citations 16, 17, 25 and 26. That was the first citation I checked, and clearly showed that they are guilty of misquoting. I didn’t feel the need to check sources 25 and 26, because misquoting sources 16 and 17 is bad enough.</p>

        <p>Then the paper should just have cited paper 18. That’s how citations work. The fact they said papers 16, 17 and 18 backed their point means that they have misquoted both paper 16 and 17. Whether or not paper 18 is an accurate quotation is irrelevant.</p>

        <p>You can combine references, but only when they all agree with the statement you are combining them for. If I say a statement and then cite 3 sources for that statement, then I am saying that those 3 sources all independently back up that statement.</p>
<p>Sources 16 and 17 do not back up the statement that they are cited for. That is exactly what misquoting a reference is.</p>

        <p>That’s fantastic, thanks for doing that. I really do genuinely appreciate it. I know you probably think I’ve just been whining about it all for no reason, but I believe that it’s important to get the facts right, especially when it’s a scientific discussion using scientific papers.</p>
<p>If the evidence does point towards masks not working or being harmful then that should be made clear from the studies provided. I think that including retracted or flawed studies only detracts from the power of your argument.</p>
<p>I do have some other comments about some of the other studies in the list, if you would like to hear. But if you don’t want to hear another word from me then that’s fine too, just let me know and I’ll drop it. I am aware that I’ve bugged you enough already.</p>

        <p>Yeah, thought so. The moist part is the worse I reckon, small viral loads can turn into large viral loads if given a warm and moist environment to grow, which means wearing a dirty mask all day can actually <em>increase</em> the wearers chance of a severe infection (since the immune system's ability to fight COVID is based on the viral load).</p>

        <p>Grow is still an acceptable term: it does grow in size, or in viral load. But perhaps a bit misleading since it implies it grows on it's own. A better term would be accumilate or amass.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is. Without it, the virus cannot live and grow.</p>
<p>There are two factors at play I can see, the environment for the virus to habitat (the mask kept warm and moist by the wearer's breath), and the method in which the virus is placed there (the exhalation of the wearer into the mask).</p>
<p>Number two is already given and a well-known consequence considering it is a mask placed in front of the wearer's face. So number one is the relevant factor to consider when addressing the harmfulness of mask-wearing.</p>

        <p>Your pettiness is impressive. All of this over a simple misunderstanding over what the word "grow" means?</p>
<hr>
<p>Your article mentions nothing of humidity, which is the important part of the equation. When you exhale, the Sars-CoV-2 virus is suspended in liquid droplets, which then grow or evaporate depending on the excess water vapour in the air.</p>
<p>&rt;Lower ambient temperature and higher atmospheric water vapor content tend to promote droplet growth, while higher temperature and lower water vapor content promote droplet evaporation. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307487">[1]</a></p>
<p>So it appears there is an inverse relationship between the two variables. The viral decay of Sars-CoV-2 exhibits a parabola-like relationship over humidity, where the decay is noticeably slower at both lower humidity and higher humidity than medium humidity. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.341883v1.full#F5">[2]</a></p>
<p>&rt;Minimal virus decay occurred during the evaporation phase [...], when excess water was present.</p>
<p>&rt;Across temperatures, virus decay exhibited a U-shaped dependence on RH: roughly two to five times faster at 65 % RH than at 40 % and 100 % RH.</p>
<p>If you look at the graph, you can see the interesting curve across humidity <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/10/16/2020.10.16.341883/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1">[3]</a>. It appears as if the decay rate of Sars-CoV-2 is <em>slower</em> at high temperature and high humidity (the environment of a mask) compared to that of a low temperature and average ambient humidity.</p>
<p>The paper hypothesises that the interesting relationship with humidity could be a result of electrolyte solutes, which would be present in exhaled droplets.</p>
<p>&rt;In electrolyte solutions like bodily fluids or cell culture media, efflorescence is also important. Below a threshold ambient humidity—the efflorescence relative humidity (ERH)—electrolytes effloresce out of solution, forming a crystal. For NaCl solutions at standard temperature and pressure, the ERH is around 45 %. Below the ERH, inactivation may proceed differently, since the reaction no longer occurs in solution. The notable U-shape of virus inactivation as a function of relative humidity, observed in our data and elsewhere in the literature, including for coronaviruses, could be explained by this regime shift around the ERH. </p>
<p>So if you take a humid environment like the inside of the mask, which has a half-life of several hours at high levels of humidity, and constantly breath into the mask to amass liquid droplets over time, yes, the viral load <strong>does grow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Are you done being arrogantly combative now over such a petty semantic misunderstanding now? I even said at the very start that humidity is the important factor at play here:</p>
<p>&rt;The moist part is the worse I reckon <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/otry7z/nuclear_bombshell_cdcs_revised_mask_guidance_is/h6y7zip/">[4]</a></p>

        <p>This is why I use a merino wool neck gaiter that I just wash. Merino wool has antibacterial properties. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it is better than the surgical masks for the everyman. Plus it is super easy to pull up when I go in places and pull down when I'm actively working or not around anyone.</p>

        <p>3 reasons, two big and related and one smaller one:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>They culture microbes. You sit there breathing warm, moist air on them all day. Its like having a petri dish strapped to your face. The reason that they work so well in health care settings is that healthcare workers wear disposable masks, usually in short bursts, and always dispose of them. Its a world apart from wearing a reusable cotton mask on your face for 8 hours.</li>
<li>Synergizing with one, studies show that people touch them constantly. Again, in health care settings its always been fine because health care workers wear gloves, and its ingrained in them to never touch their face. Just watch the next normal person you see with a mask on for any length of time. You'll see them touch it with their bare hands probably multiple times per minute.</li>
<li>Smaller one, but still important, it is measurably harder to breathe in them. Not by much, but the long term effects of this simply isn't known. People will point out that in some fields they were masks and respirators a lot...yes, the labels on those mask boxes they wear in those fields clearly instruct users to not wear the masks for long durations and to take regular breaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we are going to do mask mandates, we should have done them right. </p>
<ul>
<li>Require businesses to provide disposable masks at the door and hand santizer. You sanitize, put the mask on, then enter. Upon leaving, you dispose of the mask in the biohazard bin, then sanitize again. </li>
<li>We train people over and over to not touch their face. Call out others when they do and tell them to sanitize. </li>
<li>At places of employment, provide disposable masks to all employees. Require them to change their mask every 3hrs at the longest. </li>
<li>Provide additional outdoor breaks where people can relax without a mask. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is how you do it. Anything else is just a dangerous exercise in compliance and has nothing to do with stopping viruses.</p>

        <p>That’s how you WOULD do it properly if you were an authoritarian government, but the idea of forcing mandates on people to begin with is bullshit IMO. Aside from that it’s also BS to pass that cost onto the businesses.</p>
<p>Agreed on all your initial bulletpoints however.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am against mask mandates in general. But I would be less suspect of government mandates if they were well-thought out and effective. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Like say the government passed a law that said they were sending inspectors into every home to test fire alarms. I'd be against that, but lets say they did it. If the inspectors came, checked my fire alarms, documented a deficiency they found, such as one having no batteries, and then left, I'd be like "that was annoying, but ok". If the inspectors showed up, checked my internet browsing history, shot my dog, and inspected a single fire alarm by shining a flash light on it...I'd be incredibly suspecious. Its like that fire alarm inspection seemed to have nothing to do with fire alarms and didn't even work to find my broken fire alarm, so what the fuck are they really up to?</p>

        <p>If you had read the papers you might have seen the bright red RETRACTED words printed over the second one. At that point you would have removed that study from the list.</p>
<p>The fact you haven’t removed it means that either you haven’t read the studies, or you’re deliberately arguing in bad faith. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming that you haven’t read them, because the other option is that you’re deliberately spreading misinformation to push your agenda. I think that we can both agree that accidentally sharing that study is much better than lying to and manipulating the people in this sub.</p>

        <p>Saying you have 33 papers that back your opinion is a lie. You have at most 32. There is a huge difference between saying “I found these 33 papers on this topic, make your own decision from them” and “here’s 33 studies for why masks don’t work”. That’s a direct quote from you. That quote is a lie.</p>
<p>If you want this to be a scientific discourse then including that paper is arguing in bad faith. If you don’t want this to be a scientific discourse then why are you posting studies in the first place?</p>

        <p>You’re still sharing a post that you yourself admitted contains a  study that was retracted for legitimate reasons. Why have you not removed it from the post? After seeing this I decided to dig further into the other studies you sent and this is what I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preprint - not peer reviewed. Suggests that state-wide mask mandates did not slow spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retracted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link to links - haven’t looked at these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggests you get out of breath faster when walking with a mask on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommends social distancing over face masks when exercising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is a study on patients with end-stage renal disease, not applicable to the wider population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggests that there could be issues that need to be weighed up when using masks, although found no changes to oxygen saturation or lactate levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finds that viral contamination of masks is much higher for masks used for more than 6 hours at a time. Recommends having guidelines for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommends that cloth face masks shouldn’t be used for high risk medical workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggests that wearing masks may slightly <em>reduce</em> the odds of developing respiratory symptoms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is a Cochrane review that includes trials that “had poor design, reporting and sparse events”. Finds insufficient evidence for use of face masks, but recommends the use of face masks combined with other measures based on other studies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I got bored, but am happy to pick it up later and go through the rest if you want me to. From these first 11, 10 are links to actual papers. Of these 10 papers, 1 is retracted, 1 is not applicable to the general population, 3 suggest that masks make you more out of breath and recommend not wearing them when exercising, 1 says medical workers shouldn’t use cloth masks, 1 says you should change your mask after 6 hours continuous use. This leaves 3 reviews that apply to the wider population. 1 of these suggests statewide mask mandates have no effect (and is not peer reviewed), and 2 actually do recommend wearing face masks.</p>
<p>As long as you don’t exercise while wearing a face mask, and wash/dispose of worn mask (which are both, at least in my country, already recommended [<strong>edit: it has been brought to my attention that exercising with a face mask may be recommended in some places - in this case these studies do provide valid criticism</strong>]), then you have more studies for masks than against them.</p>
<p>Edit: For all the people downvoting me - anyone care to actually explain what I got wrong?</p>

        <p>You clearly do have an opinion on HCQ because you would have given it as an alternative to mask mandates that have failed dismally around the entire world to stop C19. I am in Europe and mask mandates were followed RELIGIOUSLY. Where are we now? In the nth wave. </p>
<p>It is relevant because you are claiming that a retracted paper shouldn't affect policy and yet you are silent on how the retracted, fraudulent Lancet study alone was used to guide C19 treatment/prophylaxis responses.</p>
<p>You're being DVed because you're obtuse and act as if people weren't told to exercise with masks on, that people change masks every 6 hours, or that effective masks (which are good at preventing a DeAdLy PaNdEmIc) are being disposed off by biohazard disposal experts because, you know, DeAdLy ViRuS and stuff.</p>

        <p>You want my opinion on HCQ? Here it is: I have not done enough research on it to make a statement about it that I can back up with any real evidence, either for it or against it. Basing it on your statement that it was a now-retracted review that guided policy for using/not using it: <em>I think that retracted studies should not be used for making policies</em>. I find it unusual that you think I would be in favour of doing that when clearly the only thing I said in my comment was that I don’t think retracted studies are ones that we should base our opinions. Please stop attributing opinions to me unless I have explicitly stated them myself.</p>
<p>I have not been told to exercise in a mask - if people have been told that then I agree that that is a bad thing. Apologies that I made assumptions about the world based on my limited viewpoint, that is my mistake. I am genuinely glad you have brought that to my attention and will edit my original comment accordingly. However, this doesn’t change the fact that there are a significant number of misinterpreted or flawed studies in that list.</p>

        <p>You are literally copying u / mimimi-'s "summaries." They aren't "summaries" but rather they are twisting the articles' words to appear like they're pro-mask. That user is also most likely the culprit of many of the organized shill attacks on NNN. Enough said.</p>

        <p>They are literally what is taken from the results and conclusion parts of the studies.</p>
<p>If you cannot even interpret a study as much as reading the conclusion, how can you expect to convince anyone by using these studies?</p>
<p>I went through each study myself when I wrote my comment. If me and the previous comment both came to the same conclusion, then don’t you think it’s pretty damning that two people can independently go through the studies and came up with the same conclusions about them? A conclusion that is almost polar opposite to what you think they are saying?</p>
<p>If I am wrong about any of the studies I would love to know. Please point me to which bits I was wrong about in any specific studies. I eagerly await your response.</p>

        <p>How much of that is based on psychology? Medical workers shouldn't wear cloth masks because they don't work, but if the little person feels better wearing it when out shopping then it is recommended despite the risk of bacterial pneumonia.</p>

        <p>The one with medical workers not being advised to wear cloth masks - I agree that it certainly doesn’t argue in favour of the general public wearing them. I don’t think it says that it is a negative to wear them in place of nothing at all though, as the control group in the study involved them following their usual practices, which does include wearing masks.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure which bit you mean is based on psychology. Would you mind clarifying that bit please?</p>

        <p>You didn't get anything wrong. You're just swimming up stream.</p>
<p>Your view doesn't fit this sub's agenda.</p>
<p>I did something similar, started actually reading the studies on a post last night, if it wasn't this thread one very similar to it.</p>
<p>Most people don't actually read things and just grab the headlines they like to help their confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I'm anti spike protein jabs, pro masks. The death rate is not reflective of the impositions and upcoming mandates.</p>
<p>What frustrates me is when people say the viral particles are smaller than the pores on an n95 mask. Those particles aren't walking around on their own, they're carried within saliva, which the mask catches.</p>
<p>None of this makes sense, so many things are 'off' and it's not helped by staunch advocates on both sides.</p>
<p>All I care about is data.</p>

<p>I don't know who this is and you didn't provide a relevant source or a claim of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&rt;Exhibit B: Palantir</p>
<p>&rt;CNBC, reporting on Azar’s comments, noted that Tiberius, a software program developed and managed by Palantir, “will help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccines each state will receive,” and local officials will use Tiberius to “decide where every allocated dose will go—from local doctors’ offices to large medical centers.” According to that report and others, Tiberius would collect data from US government agencies, as well as from local and state governments, pharmaceutical firms, vaccine manufacturers, and companies like McKesson that have been contracted for the coming vaccine distribution.</p>
<p>Is this a bad thing? The CDC has to use some type of software management system to help inform the vaccine rollout, since they aren't software manufacturers themselves. The CDC contracting with a next-generation data management company seems reasonable.</p>
<p>How do you propose the CDC manage all the data collected? PLTR is a small company and isn't "BigTech" like the original comment suggested, either. For example, how would you feel if the CDC contracted Facebook or Twitter instead to manage "vaccine profiles" of people?</p>

        <p>Exactly. I wear my masks to protect myself because people really are disgusting. To be honest I couldn't care less about all the arguments between the crowds of those who do follow that Covid is a legitimate public health issue and those who are vehemently against believing that Covid or the Covid vaccine are real. I'm too busy doing well in life right now with kicking ass at a great paying job to start my career, doing my masters, etc, to care about the complaining about the pandemic. I just care about protecting my own health to continue to do what I actually care about in life. </p>
<p>Because again, people are disgusting creatures well before any pandemic, so I have simply enjoyed how people have actually had to cover up their ugly faces (especially those gross beak-noses that they always want to stick out of their masks like idiots) and maintain distance away from me. And yes I've gladly said something about it when some try to lean in, take their mask off, and invade my personal space.</p>

<p>&rt;We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility (Figure 2). <strong>However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.</strong></p>

<p>Abstract:  </p>
<p>&rt;The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India, displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages. Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across three centres in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (p=0.02). In vitro, the Delta variant shows 8 fold approximately reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were significantly lower in participants vaccinated with ChadOx-1 as compared to BNT162b2 (GMT 3372 versus 654, p&lt;0001). These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity. Whilst severe disease in fully vaccinated HCW was rare, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need continue in the post-vaccination era.</p>

<p>Do you know what the kicker is? The entire study is based on AstraZeneca's CoviSheild (AZD7442) vaxx which IS neither approved in the EU nor the US!!!!</p>
<p>Why is this paper being used to guide US-specific policy? </p>

        <p>Great find, as always. But i could not help to think if that paper was rejected because of these findings below:</p>
<p>&rt; In vitro, the Delta variant shows 8 fold approximately reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to wild type Wuhan-1</p>

        <p>That's the gist of what I saw in the announcements.  It seemed to be the usual carrot-and-stick to sell the next round of booster shots.  "Aw dang it doesn't work against 'delta' but just you wear those masks until the boosters are released!"</p>
<p>All these CDC announcements are exact templates from the Sales 101 playbook on how to artificially create demand for a product.  In this case, mRNA.</p>

        <p>Not without good sanitation, clean water and nutrition. If you look at any disease for which people are vaxxed, most of the heavy lifting is down BEFORE vaxxes make it to the scene. My favourite examples are measles, polio, TB, etc.</p>
<p>This is why, despite ultra anti-vaxx countries like Japan not having a childhood vaxx schedule, their infant mortality is a fraction of the US - which has the world's most insane childhood vaxx schedule.</p>

        <p>That would mean I would have to willfully ignore your other comments in the thread where you almost make the claim that the polio vaccine doesn't work. When I see someone's say "Vaxes always fail" in one comment and then almost claim (I say almost because you don't directly say "polio Vax doesn't work" but you argue against the Vax) that polio doesn't work, I have to take that into account.</p>

        <p>How do you know the CDC's new mask guidelines are based on THIS research?</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking in indoor public settings, particularly for large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
&rt;
&rt; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm</p>
<p>They rolled it back because shit got worse when people began unmasking and going to public gatherings. I'm unable to find any data that suggests the CDC used your article to make any decisions.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is a minor inconvenience, at most, during a global pandemic. I think some folks are a little too used to a certain lifestyle and react poorly to anything that threatens that.</p>

        <p>Remember when you people flipped shit and threw tantrums when the CDC said you can take off the mask if you’re vaccinated? Right, because it was never about following what the CDC has to say for science reasons.</p>

        <p>This is par for the course when it comes to CDC recommendations. Their statistics are useful, but their advice is very much not. The studies they pick to back their claims are often circumstantial, feature weak methodology, and sometimes don't apply to the subject matter at all. This happens often enough that they've been sued for it.</p>
<p>Mask studies are a particularly sticky situation because there are so many variables to consider. While there are studies that show masks can have some protective value against the original SARS virus, it depends on factors like the type of mask, frequency or circumstances of their use, illness severity of the patient to which the study participant was exposed, and much more. These studies also show that it is possible to use masks in such a way that you actually increase your risk, which is one reason why Flip-Flop Fauci himself originally advised against the general public wearing them.</p>
<p>Worse still is the fact that a great deal of studies (especially post-COVID) are based on mathematical modeling and/or some kind of mechanical simulation device; for example, a machine that expels air to simulate a cough. They'll measure things like particle counts, water droplet sizes, distance traveled, etc. and from this data they draw abstract conclusions on the hypothetical utility of masks.</p>
<p>Missing from this type of study is any real evidence that the mask actually prevents anyone from becoming sick, but now the waters have been successfully muddied and the damage is done: feelings on masks are so strong that some people refuse to stop using them no matter what, and you simply cannot convince them otherwise.</p>

        <p>I've skimmed a lot of these studies.  I also read the October article in Nature that summarized the current data.</p>
<p>At best, the studies show that there is a .5 to 2% decrease in the rate of spread in communities with mask mandates.  </p>
<p>Okay, that's something, but it's not much.  We're talking about a rule that you must follow in order to earn a living, obtain most goods &amp; services, and participate in social life.  It's a burden placed on multiple millions of people for an <em>extremely</em> small marginal benefit, and that benefit hasn't been concretely proven through randomized control trials.  Yet, mask mandates are characterized as obviously necessary and extremely protective.</p>

        <p>Right, and that's another great point: theory is all well and good, but we know from the statistics that masks have had little to no effect on the spread. It's shocking to me that mandates are coming back in places where they were already over and done</p>

        <p>Yep, that seems to be the case. They can reduce your chance of infection, sometimes, in certain situations, but there are too many moving parts for the average person to successfully juggle, and the "official" guidelines haven't touched on most of them. When you don't do it just right, studies show that effectiveness drops dramatically, sometimes all the way to zero. And that's where we find ourselves</p>

        <p>Which was obvious from day 1.  We all said from the beginning the masks stopped water droplet transfer.   Somehow that transpired into 'if you dont wear a mask you are a murderer'.   Americans seriously forgot what this country is about.   Yes, this is about muh freedumbs.   They matter.  People have died in the past to protect these freedoms, that justifies people dying now and every time in the future.  Especially when nearly all deaths had other grave illness or weak immune system.  Yes it is horrible that 600k people have died.  But as life goes, there are another 350 million that dont know those people and have no real reason to care about them.  So we have the people that make the rules (the wealthy), who are directly targeted by nearly every poor person.   Thats why we still have a pandemic.</p>

        <p>&rt;  based on mathematical modeling</p>
<p>So much "science" is, these days.</p>
<p>Modeling is an important tool for the <em>investigation</em> phase of your hypothesis.  Scientists have used models always; but the models were inside their heads.  Creating models on computers allows one to model vastly greater amounts of data and test alternate scenarios quickly.  So far so good. But models suffer from the same flaw as any other human creation:  they're entirely limited by what is put into them, what is left out of them, whether the fundamental hypothesis, and the skill and intelligence of the creator.  </p>
<p>I don't know how many times I've been told "But that was proven! with computer modeling!"  Simply: No. Models are <strong>not</strong> proof. Models are tools to assist in the creation of a theory.  So many climate models have gotten the temperature predictions wrong; some can't even reproduce our current global temperature when started with existing weather records from previous decades.  But the top contender for the "Worst Model" award was the abomination used by Ferguson and the Imperial College team.  Somehow it always greatly exaggerates the number of sick and dead by orders of magnitude. That's not "proof" - it's not even "science"!  Their failures didn't even start with cov19, they were wrong repeatedly on several previous epidemics-which-never-happened.  When their model was put up for code review, it was widely derided by experience programmers. When it wasn't crashing, it couldn't even get the same output twice from the same inputs.  Yet these are the incompetents who Trump and Johnson listened to for their lockdown decisions!  Fail your way to the top!</p>

        <p>I agree. Models can be a productive starting point but are not proof of anything, and that really cannot be overstated. I've been seeing studies for years where models were used to fabricate wild predictions of calamitous outbreaks that were totally implausible. My favorite was one that claimed that a mere three percent drop in measles vaccination rates would result in a widespread deadly resurgence of the disease... Despite the fact that rates were in fact 3% lower just a couple decades prior, and lower still the further back you go. So you know with certainty that the hypothesis was dead wrong, yet I saw article after article all over the internet issuing somber warnings about the anti-vaxx menace, and how we're teetering on the brink of a measles apocalypse, based on these models. Really wacky stuff.</p>

        <p>So it’s one of at least 96 citations? Isn’t it a bit (or a lot) of a stretch to say that their guidance is based off this study when there are at least 96 other studies that went into its formation?</p>

        <p>Question: If you will ignore that once sketchy paper, then you should be OK to now recommend HCQ as a treatment since we know that the ultra sketchy and fraudulent paper from The Lancet that was retracted last year... but not before it was used by the world's health regulators to ban/remove HCQ from C19 treatment, right? </p>
<p>I mean if we want to apply the process fairly, then we should be back to using HCQ and you should be supporting it as well.</p>

        <p>I don’t know anything about HCQ or what papers were used to discredit it. Sure maybe if we applied the process fairly then we should use HCQ, but we all know how inconsistent and deceitful the government and its agencies are.</p>

        <p>Well no, I didn’t answer myself. My question is, as someone who hasn’t reviewed the cdc guidance and all its cited materials, is it not a stretch to claim that it’s bunk because of one bad paper being cited out of 96, or that the guidances was “based on” this paper? Yes I’m well aware of the wrongdoings and lies of the government, but I can’t simply assume that every other citation is bad just because one is</p>

        <p>I don't think that it's a stretch because t shows that the CDC isn't really doing their research, but is simply goal-seeking and hoping that people don't have the time to go through their guidance because we are to blindly Believe the Science^(TM) sans an iota of critical thinking.</p>

<h1>1 - as a healthy individual, I refuse to take responsibility for the obese and unhealthy.  I never force-fed them ice cream and donuts.</h1>
<p>Maybe the mask posse should blame fast food and poor diet choices on their increased risk.</p>
<h1>2 - everything the CDC asked people to do, such as; staying indoors, wearing masks, and limiting social contact, ALL increase one’s risk of getting seriously ill, when infected. Notice I said “when”, not if.</h1>
<h1>3 - Attempting to eradicate a Corona virus is about as feasible as stopping plate tectonics, the earth’s tilting axis, sun cycles and bio degrading plant matter.  Rushing everyone to vax might actually create deadlier strains instead allowing the virus to follow the more natural pattern of Corona viruses which is to become more contagious and less deadly over time.</h1>
<h1>4 - Everything about the misinformation and fear tactics, including pitting Vaxxed against unvaxxed, makes my common senses tingle like Spider-Man.</h1>
<p>You do you.  But I value my children’s life enough for at least 1 phase 4 study before jumping in with the guinea pigs.</p>

        <p>All shots are detrimental as symptoms are actually how the body regulates homeostasis via the lymphatic system - this can not be passed on to another organsism--this includes cold and flu.</p>
<p>You can not inject health.</p>
<p>It is our internal environment which creates all dis-ease--we call these symptoms; in actuality, the only thing our body can do is remove morbid matter. Cough, sneeze, sweat, urination, feces, skin eruptions--the body can do no more than this.</p>
<p>All cells must detox as we recycle millions of cells daily, or else the organism would die. There is no catching an illness other than one's own habits.</p>
<p>The immune system does not stop any invader--this idea is to make us think there is always a war going on. When in fact, our immune system's job is to remove trash from our body; when this can not happen--cancer and other conditions arise.</p>
<p>To have the idea of contagion, you must first ask where the first of each infectious organism came from.</p>
<p>You then realize you do not catch sickness--it is from what you eat (nutritional deficiency, toxicity), toxins (emf, injections, modern medicine), drink, think, and feel.</p>
<p>Germs are our clean up crew--they feed on our morbid matter in attempts to heal us.</p>

        <p>Japan is strongly anti-vaxx, doesn't even have a vaxx schedule for children and yet it has the oldest population in the world. On the other hand, the US has the highest number of childhood vaxxes and it has the HIGHEST infant mortality rate in the developed world. France, Italy and Eastern Europe are all highly anti-vaxx and yet their infant mortalities are lower than those in the US. Clearly human health comes from a needle.</p>

        <p>You can either a) check my posting history or b) do you OWN research and look at the records of diseases against which vaccines are given such as TB, whooping cough, diphtheria, etc. (Hint: the most complete data is from the UK and covers England, Wales and Scotland over 300+ years). Simply compare the trends BEFORE vaccine and after vaccine. After doing that, compare these trends with improvements in sanitation, access to clean water, reduction in environmental degradation and better nutrition. </p>
<p>If you can't find anything because you can't use Google Scholar, etc give me a shout so that I can show you how to do independent research that you can use in the future.</p>

        <p>Surgical masks aren’t air-tight, though they are generally more occlusive than the masks most consumers wore during the past year. N-95’s are only used when there’s a surgical patient with diseases such as tuberculosis and Covid-19. Those work, but only if fitted properly.  Cheap exam masks worn in an enclosed space like a bus, for example, would not keep you from contracting or transmitting diseases like TB or COVID-19.</p>

<p>Not unless the wearer observes strict protocol for donning/doffing and not touching the mask, and even then it doesn't matter because the viral particles are small enough to pass right through.  Mask with an N95 is useless against a viral pathogen.  That's why the military wear masks that seal to the face, and if the seal is even momentarily broken the wearer is considered contaminated and must undergo isolation after doffing the protective gear and being decontaminated.</p>
<p>Does anyone wearing an N95 have to undergo decontamination after being near infected patients?  If not why the fuck not?  None of this shit makes any sense if you know the facts of how protective gear is supposed to work.</p>
<p>Much like the fact that the CDC has admitted the PCR test doesn't work to diagnose Wuflu and is recalling/ending it's use late this year after admitting it can't distinguish between Wuflu and normal flu, much of this has been a sham.  We have no idea how many of the 630k deaths were from Wuflu and how many were from other causes, and the hospitals who took extra money for Wuflu cases committed massive fraud enabled by the CDC.  A huge lie, one of many created during this pandemic to wield illegitimate power.</p>

        <p>I’m an operating room nurse.  I know more about PPE and disease transmission than the average bear.  I probably know less about those things than a military virologist, but I doubt you’re one of those.  N-95 masks are impervious to disease particles transmitted via droplets when worn properly.  It’s not perfect, but it’s very effective.  Surgical masks aren’t effective in this regard.  My original comment was simple clarification because your sarcastic comment sounded a bit ignorant, and I believe that I should do my part as a healthcare professional to educate the public.  </p>
<p>Covid-19 is real and distinct in how it presents. I panicked the first time I had a covid patient because her sp02 was in the high 70’s- a vital sign that would otherwise require immediate intubation and possibly medical treatment for acidosis. The vaccine works remarkably well at preventing illness and death from Covid-19.  I’ve had it, and so far, my mind hasn’t been controlled by Bill Gates or George Soros.  If my DNA suddenly falls apart like the big white alien at the beginning of “Prometheus,” I’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Edit: All that being said, I respect the right of the individual to have self determination.  If you’re well informed, and your personal risk assessment steers you into the “don’t get the jab” lane, all the more power to you. I think overpopulation is a bigger problem than the aged and infirm checking out a little early.</p>

<p>Back this up with science of RCT's proving this to be true.  The RCT's I have reviewed on masking going back several decades show the exact opposite.  </p>

<p>So you can't or won't backup your claims.  That makes you a non critical thinker who just accepts what you're told without question.  I have studies, but you made the claim, it's your job to prove your position is scientifically sound and accurate, not me.</p>
<p>&rt;Overpopulation is a problem.</p>
<p>Only for the delusional.</p>
<p>&rt;We’re destroying our environment</p>
<p>The environment in the US is far cleaner than it was 50 years ago when rivers were on fire.</p>
<p>&rt;we’re short on potable water</p>
<p>The California reservoir system was over 100% capacity in summer 2019.  This after 2017's record rainfall in the state, more rain than the states seen since it began keeping records.  At 100% capacity the state has a 5 year water supply, so we were in the 6~7 year range.  Today the reservoirs  across the state are dangerously low as it appears our state officials have flushed millions of gallons of water into the ocean while lamenting a drought.  Bipolar political bullshit, not water shortage.</p>
<p>&rt;Your military experience means jack shit to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for not virtue signally with a fake 'Thank you for your service'.  That shit gets old and everyone know the libs hate the military.</p>
<p>FWIW your nursing experience means jack shit to me.</p>
<p>&rt;Don’t you think that if the military was running things, they’d inject every man, woman, and child with the vaccine and court marshal the dissenters?</p>
<p>Yes and no.  See I left the military in the late 90's when they were insisting all military take the Anthrax vaxx.  One of my close friends stayed and today he is permanently disabled due to injury from the Anthrax shot.  After that happened the military stopped giving the Anthrax shot.  Will they make a similar mistake with Wuflu?  Yes, under the apparatchiks of the Biden admin they most certainly will.</p>
<p>&rt;The cognitive dissonance is painful.</p>
<p>Projection.  Most libs do it now without even realizing they are doing it.  It's been engrained in them via brainwashing and most are oblivious to the mental conditioning.  Kind of like the unscientific masking bullshit now, it's about mental conditioning to give up your rights and comply when the totalitarian state we live under gives an order.</p>
<p>Strangest thing I learned from the pandemic is that about half the world want's to be mothered by big government, and they will go so far as to try to become what I call 'teacher pet' by ratting out neighbors and friends who don't comply with the tyrannical dictates.</p>

        <p>See that's another difference between us, I'd gladly discuss the issues of the day, I just won't waste time on false narratives like global warming or failed ideologies like socialism when the reality is that the former is intended to usher in the latter. People like you hold ideas so fragile that you run from conversations that might cause severe cognitive dissonance and questioning of some bad ideas and so the idea that we can all agree on what the major issues of the day really are based on facts and then join together to help solve those problems and improve the human condition around the globe.  The part that I struggle with is what you were taught that lead you to this point in life where you run from the slightest of challenges in order to protect your feeble ideologies. Who broke you like that and why?  What evil would want to create a society where people can't agree on basic truths in order to progress as a society?</p>

        <p>I don’t agree with your assumption, but am very interested in following your thinking.  Who are the monsters?  Government officials?  And who is benefitting and how from the lockdowns and vaccines?  I do understand the concerns but have not yet found anyone to put the pieces together into a coherent end game.  Just hoping for your thoughts.  Thanks.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing the link to rense.com.  This provides a segue to what I think is a really important issue related to the “different realities” that groups are living in today (related to many issues, but especially the pandemic).  Clearly these different realities/perspectives have their own trusted sources, and there is immediate doubt when one side provides one of their sources to the other to back up a claim.  So how can we know what’s true, or at least what is unlikely to be?</p>
<p>Well let me tell you who I trust and why.  First, I’m under no illusion that the government, mainstream media, the pharmaceutical industry, Big Tech, and the healthcare / health research industries have multiple agendas, and some run counter to the goals of creating knowledge, speaking truth and contributing to the public good.  Power, profit and fame are all corrupting motivations.  But I also don’t believe in a zero sum game where anything short of purity means everything you’re told from any of these sources must be false.  We live in a world of gray, not black and white.</p>
<p>There are sources of information that are not substantially biased politically and live somewhere near the center line.  Many have long track records of verified accuracy and not a chain of controversies and conspiratorializing.  This includes some media sources, government bureaucracies that are not overtly political (such as the NIH), peer reviewed scientific journals, noted experts, etc.  And serendipitously, I work alongside many medical experts who themselves know researchers and others on the front line of Covid knowledge development (virus and vaccine).  So putting this all together, I have many sources of reliable information (to me) that provide a narrative pretty much in line with conventional wisdom (dangers of Covid, reported deaths, efficacy of masks, safety of vaccine, etc.).</p>
<p>That brings me to rense.com, which I read about and explored directly.  Wikipedia (which is a reasonable starting point but one that requires verification) has this as part of its description:</p>
<p>“Rense's radio program and website propagate conspiracy theories, including those of 9/11 conspiracists, ufologists and advocates of the paranormal, the creation of diseases, chemtrails, evidence of advanced ancient technology, emergent energy technologies, and alternative medicine.  Rense's writings and website have been deemed pro-Nazi and antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to take Wikipedia at its word, I looked through the site itself and did searches across its many articles.  And I found numerous examples to support these accusations, articles that were clearly accusatory towards Jews, promoting of 9/11 conspiracies, talk of UFO invasions, proof that the moon landing was faked, etc.  So it should come as no surprise that I put little credibility in this site and its authors’ truth claims regarding the pandemic and vaccine.  Is it possible that despite a site full of falsifiable claims and conspiracies, there are kernels of truth about Covid?  The chance is non-zero I suppose, but it’s incredibly unlikely.</p>
<p>Now if you come into this with an unflinching belief that anything that the government, media, experts and industry say must be false by default, then the only way you would believe that a true pandemic exists is if all of these entities were covering it up.  That creates quite a Catch-22 and exercise in reverse psychology.  In this case, there would truly be nothing that I could tell you that would make you question whether your worldview is based on reality.</p>
<p>Am I just as unflinching in my own views?  I hope not.  I try to apply the scientific method and healthy skepticism.  If I see evidence that contradicts my understanding, and it comes from a reliable source, is based on information provided by someone with firsthand access, and is verified by other unrelated and reliable sources, I’m not wedded to any particular idea.</p>
<p>If six months after being vaccinated, people start dropping like flies, every immunologist in the world will be studying what’s happening and reporting on their findings.  And at that point I would really question the wisdom of my decision to get vaccinated.  But as that is not happening yet, and the ones claiming danger are like the writers on rense.com while healthcare experts are championing its safety, my powers of reasoning make the choice clear as to who should be believed.  But everyone has to make their own choice in this matter.  All people like you and me can do is have conversations and try to better understand one another.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking time to converse and for reading this long response.</p>

        <p>I'm just shocked that the CDC would make recommendations based on such weak data (I guess I shouldn't be at this point). What do you mean by "submission statement"?</p>

        <p>dude, the CDC has been committing out-right scientific fraud this entire time.</p>
<p>The released articles with titles stating anything along the lines of 'physical isolation of a novel virus', of which there is at least one on the CDC website, is a fraud. Within the article, buried in scientific jargon that the average joe won't read, it states clearly that they actually could not satisfy the scientific standard of the day, so they threw it out entirely.</p>
<p>The genetic sequence for the novel SARS-CoV2 virus is <em>over 99% in silica model.</em></p>
<p>In silica means theoretical model. Out of over 30,000 genetic markers within the virus, only a handful, we're talking less than 20, were physically verified. The rest generated in a computer program.</p>
<p>This is the data they designed the vaccines around, too.</p>
<p>It is a mind-bogglingly colossal fucking scam. They have never proven the existence of a novel corona virus, at all! That might be hard to believe, but its 100% true. The virus is all just theory, scientifically speaking.   </p>
<p>This means its entirely possible the virus was made in a lab, and physical verification would lead to the origin, so it is hidden, <em>or</em>, there is no new virus, and this is a serious mind fuck example of the nocebo effect in action, world-wide, as the common cold was rebranded into some deadly pandemic that never really existed.</p>

<li>This is a preprint article still in peer review; a version of the manuscript has been rejected for further peer review, and the entire paper has not been retracted.</li>
<li>This is where this paper is quoted in the CDC recent guideline updates:</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;For two-dose COVID-19 vaccines, multiple studies have shown greater neutralization against variants after the second dose (i.e. among fully vaccinated people) compared with the first dose (partially vaccinated)(59, 71, 72, 77, 78, 86, 99, 103, 105-107, 119, 129)</p>
<p>Even if this is not accepted into the journal, 12 other studies were used as references to make that case.

        <p>I know you don’t want to hear this but most studies are rejected the first time. It was later accepted after revisions. Although it’s not a solid study to base a US policy off of, don’t just repeat shit. It makes us look dumb.</p>

        <p>Don't be an obtuse Big Pharma shill. I linked everything that you need to know in the SS. All you need to do is to be OBJECTIVE enough to read the CDC recommendation for yourself, and all the parts of the recommendation that were related to the retracted study. </p>

        <p>You linked a screenshot with a summary of the peer review process for the preprint of the research article. Nothing in your screenshot mentions the CDC or how the CDC is referencing this paper for the new mask mandate.</p>

        <p>This is a preprint of the paper that is available online with the peer review process happens. From the link that you posted in a comment:</p>
<p>Posted 22 Jun, 2021</p>
<p>Under Review</p>
<p>What that means is that THAT VERSION of the manuscript has been rejected. Rejection at this stage is not the same as a research article being retracted. Basically what happens is that you submit a manuscript -&rt; peer review happens -&rt; revisions happen -&rt; is this fit to publish? approved/rejected -&rt; if approved, published; if rejected, another round of peer review</p>
<p>Every single research article I've ever seen at this stage gets rejected. I have never seen a research article go straight to publication after a single round of peer review.</p>

        <p>Buddy, the screen shot literally shows the timeline of the paper. I put it there so that I could show how it was tracked by the journal. I am quite aware of the publishing process because I have gone through it thrice.</p>
<p>You now have to explain which time machine the CDC used to issue guidance on 27 July 2020 on an Indian paper (remember, India is 9.5 hrs ahead of NYC) on a paper that got it's 3rd review the day before.</p>
<p>As per CDC:</p>
<p>&rt;Data were added from studies published since the last update that demonstrate currently authorized mRNA vaccines provide protection against variants of concern, including the Delta strain that is now predominant in the United States. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization and death is high for all current SARS-CoV-2 variants; emerging data suggest lower effectiveness against confirmed infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the ancestral strain and the Alpha variant.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca's CoviSheild (AZD7442) is NOT authorised in the US and yet a paper discussing its use is part of the CDC's literature.</p>

<p>You didn't link what the CDC said, but based off that quote, they didn't mention the AstraZeneca vaccine. Maybe there are other studies they are referencing? I agree that the CDC should not be making recommendations based off of non-peer-reviewed preprint articles. Maybe there is a broader scope of literature that they're referencing? Maybe they included it in the source you didn't link?</p>

        <p>Okay so I went through your comments and you linked it in a top comment for this post, so thank you for that. Here is the sentence where they referenced the paper you linked in the OP (you were previously only quoting from the summary, which has no direct references):</p>
<p>&rt;For two-dose COVID-19 vaccines, multiple studies have shown greater neutralization against variants after the second dose (i.e. among fully vaccinated people) compared with the first dose (partially vaccinated)(59, 71, 72, 77, 78, 86, 99, 103, 105-107, 119, 129)</p>
<p>So they referenced 13 different studies but you picked 1 out of the 13, and that invalidated all the rest? What are your thoughts on the other 12 that they referenced to make that point?</p>
<p>And I just want to reiterate that your title is still incorrect, since this mask guidance is, on your own reference and CDC source, based on a large body of research and not on this single piece of literature. Should the CDC not be using preprints as a reference? Yes, but this single paper is not all they used.</p>

        <p>I think my opinion is unpopular here about masks.  But stopping droplets from exiting your mouth is very effective.  Just look at the historic lows for Flu and Cold- we have actually cured a real pandemic- yet no one cares.</p>
<p>Im for masks. 1) I dont like talking to strangers 2) for a city dweller- i don't like people breathing on me and getting close 3) I dont want to hear and see the shit in people's disgusting mouths. </p>
<p>Imo, masks are the best thing ever + no state surveillance and facial recognition</p>

        <p>Masks are somewhat effective for keeping covid positive people from spreading it. However, mask rules were centered around PCR test results as well as asymptomatic spread both of which are highly questionable at this point. </p>
<p>Your other points are selfish in nature and you shouldn’t want mask mandates imposed on others simply because you are socially awkward. You could always wear a hazmat suit and wear a sign that says “covid positive”. That would solve all your issues without imposing on others.</p>

        <p>The problem is that there are so many bots and paid shills; one's immediate reaction is to think it's another shill trying to waste one's time.</p>
<p>I agree we should be civil.  Not to shills - but we can at least try to discern the poster's intent before judging them to be one.</p>

        <p>But your points are all about how masks benefit you when others wear them. If you’re points were how you like masks because when you wear them you feel better, sure go ahead and wear them. But you’re saying you like them because if covers others peoples faces. </p>
<p>What about my post was disparaging? Saying your reasons were selfish? They are. Saying you’re socially awkward? You basically admitted as much. </p>
<p>Sorry if I offended, but it offends me that you want others to wear masks because you get satisfaction from it.</p>

<li>I live in a country where masks are mandatory,  its not my imposition, it is reality here</li>

<p>I think my point to you is this: your comments are indistinguishable in nature compared to the other groups in contrast to you. If you cannot handle an opinion contrary to yours then you should expect the same treatment from others.</p>

        <p>You said “I’m for masks” and then listed reasons for being for masks that all centered around how other people wearing them makes you feel better. That’s a personal opinion not a statement based on a government mandate. </p>
<p>My point about the hazmat suit is that you could get all the privacy and space you want in public by taking personal steps instead of others having to wear something over their face. It was a snarky remark, but the point is I find it irritating when people want others to do things to make them feel better instead of taking action themselves. In this case, you enjoy others being mandated to wear a mask because it makes you feel better around others when out in public. Seems a bit selfish.</p>

        <p>Its government mandated here. We all wear masks.  And again,  I said IMO. </p>
<p>Everyone here wears masks in the commons.</p>
<p>1 more time. Im in a different country,  we wear masks </p>
