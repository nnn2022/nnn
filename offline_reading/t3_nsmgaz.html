        <p>Single best info since day zero.  The only drawback with watching Chris is that my forehead is bruised from the infinite face palm of watching everyone else through this plague act in abject stupidity and ignorance, when we already <strong><em>OBVIOUSLY</em></strong> fucking should have known better.  He's been a full month ahead, and ten times deeper than everybody else combined.  And when you realize that's only because he read the bloody science, and is smart enough to add two and two, you realize how sinister and murderous the real agenda is.  And that would be the only fault I would give him: he's been too quiet, you have to read too deep between the lines of what he refuses to say, when it's clear that deep down he fully understands the evil at play here.  It deserves to be named very loudly, more loudly than he has.  I understand why he avoids saying it, but not saying it is not something I can give him positive credit for.</p>

        <p>I think he’s pretty introverted, and is doing the best he can. Also, having some people fly under the radar is good- we can’t be having everyone shot down or we’d get <em>no</em> info at all. Just putting your face out there is taking your life in your hands, so him doing any info-sharing is worth it’s weight in gold, IMO. I’m not saying this in the least little way to be snarky, but are you putting videos out? Have you put your face out there? Have you risked your life and your family’s life, your career, reputation, to get info out to the masses? I haven’t. Not yet, anyway. It’s easy to sit here and say “they should be doing more!” Maybe you do have a site or channel and this is an incognito account, idk, but I personally give him serious props for the risk he’s taking.</p>
<p>I’ve always appreciated his ability to stay neutral- you reach more people that way. Maybe at some point he’ll crank up the heat.</p>

        <p>I get it, I realize that Chris has already been treading a very fine line, and did so with extreme caution while still making sure he said just enough and <strong><em>didn't say</em></strong> just the right things, to communicate the real message to anyone with three brain cells to rub together, and the will to understand the reality.  For example, myself: I would not have known what he knows but has not said, if he had not actually managed to communicate exactly that very knowledge to me, even though it was a process of studiously reading between the lines he set up so masterfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Tn_b4NRTB6k">Bret used a great analogy in his latest must-watch video</a>, of how you can detect there is a planet you can't see, by looking at how its gravity is affecting all the bodies you CAN see.  Chris has done his work because he meticulously set up the moving constellations, accurately and in detail, so there was no way that anybody paying attention could not infer that invisible planet, even though he had to avoid naming it to protect himself.</p>
<p>What I have been doing is protecting my friends and family, and making sure they knew what was actually going on.  I also got very early word to the boss of my small town's old folks home (the wife of a close personal friend), to make sure the residents got high vitamin D, which I knew about because of Chris.  That was probably April last year, and there has been no outbreak in that facility.  Meanwhile, I stocked up on ivermectin as soon as the data started to become clear, enough to treat anybody within reach of my friends and family.  So far my small town has been very lucky, we haven't had any significant waves of infection or sickness.</p>
<p>That being said, the local nurses are all pretty convinced that it rolled through town late Dec 2019 / Jan 2020, before anybody knew what was happening.  I was an example, at 50, right after new year 2020, for the first time in my life I went to ER because I couldn't breathe, thinking I had pneumonia.  Tested negative for influenza, no lung fluid in the X-rays, they sent me home without antibiotics, and a "good luck", because nobody knew yet.  I was fucked for a month, and the only honest guess is I already had COVID.  I was one of hundreds, this is why the nurses are pretty sure they now know what they witnessed.  We have a large population of Chinese students in town, and we know it was spreading in North America and Europe as early as November 2019, so it would be no surprise if we already had it.</p>

        <p>I fully believe we reached herd immunity last summer. I know two people that had it- severely- in Jan ‘20, and we also have a large Chinese student base. First case was traced back to Wuhan in Oct ‘19, though that’s probably impossible to find now.</p>
<p>Side note, that planet is being picked up on Lasco. You probably already have good sources, but I like Suspicious Observers and World News Report Today, as well as MrMBB333 on YT.</p>
<p>I did the same, warned everyone that would listen. I didn’t get many “thanks”, mostly treated like I was crazy, but I got a few very profuse ones after the fact, so I don’t feel like my efforts were wasted.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the cool chat :)  One of the data points we have is studies done on blood donations from Nov/Dec 2019, that found the coof in blood samples from a bunch of cities all over the USA, obviously months before anyone knew any shit was going down at all.  More science nobody in the MSM would ever dare talk about.  But really helps put this shit in perspective.  So I'm sticking to my best logic: the only honest guess as to what my Dec'19-to-Jan'20 severe sickness / symptoms were is the coof, a solid month before we all had even the first hint that it existed.  No, I have no proof.  Anyone want to doubt my best honest interpretation, can give me a T-cell test and <strong><em>disprove</em></strong> my best honest interpretation.  Until then, anyone who wants to say I'm a risk for refusing the jab can suck a fat one, I'm already immune by any honest interpretation.  Now I only wish that gave me an exemption from wearing a fucking diaper on my face in public indoor spaces.</p>

        <p>In an open and honest and good world, they’d be testing for antibodies before even recommending the vax, because you know, <em>science</em>; based strictly on that fact, you’d have to be an imbecile to not see that there’s a nefarious agenda afoot. But in this world, which is none of those things, how could you even trust such a test? Fun times we’re in.</p>
