    <strong>Should I create an activism account on Twitter?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I'm considering creating an account on Twitter to try and warn people of the vaccine etc. But I'm worried that if I do I might get harassed or doxxed. Is this a concern?</p>
<p>Also, what would be the best way of getting followers on such an account?</p></p>

        <p>Why bother? it's over. Vaccines are rolled out, people don't die supposedly, non-vaccinated are ok with taking risks among extremely dangerous things like driving a car even. There are no reasons not to go back to normal now.</p>

        <p>maybe youll get banned, maybe you wont. the point is if you want to make action, do it. But before saying anything, back it up. there is some alternative account that still are up and running (like the one of robert malone). The important thing I think for us, those who have at hart the preservation of our civic right and the respect of science, is to understand that many of the people who are pro massive injection campaing of mrna are naive. Naive in the sense that they believe that the people in position of power are like them, doing their job for the best interest of their constituents. Amd most of them are going to the process of being vaccinated in part because they dont whant to be infected by a nasty shit and secondo, which I think it is the most important thing... and also they does it to protect others, which is noble. </p>
<p>The red pillers often have an approach making them feel stupid or considering them like they don't have critical thinking. The rabbit hole is deep and before making sense of all the information about the eleeches and their sinister possible plan, it take time and effort to undo the conditioning. But we should understand that in there point of view and with respect from what they see and hear, the expert are expert and the gov representative should know their shit. if my P.M. ask me to stay inside it is probably for a good reason. They don't have the respect in their exchange because they listen to the autorithy and try to be good citizen, which is, again, noble.</p>
<p>If I would do those kind of thing, which the goal is to make them start undertanding the big picture, I would take an approach where I would do all my possible to start where they are and understand where they stand and why. Maybe make a fictionnal "sheep", starting his dive in the hole, step by step, maybe one or two or three post max a day to make them see, progressivly, that the curtain in front of them is set and behind it, something that it is simple and, sadly, a little bit evil.</p>
<p>I would always back my post by serious documentation and keep any religious reference because, first it divide us and second, tto my opinion should never be part of a civic* discution.</p>
<p>I would give myself some guidelines like : 
1-always back your factual affirmation
2-never shame any point of view
3-know what my goal is (open their eyes, inform, convince, sensibilize)
4-understand where people come from
5-be ready to take nothing personnal</p>
<p>*civic in a sense of citizen talkin between them about how society should work, not in the sense of politness even if respect  is always a must in a discussion.</p>
<p>&amp;I would also put somewhere else on the web a neatly classified documentaion and link to help those who are curious to go in the rabbit hole at their rythim because when the red pill start to make effect, it is a thraumatic experience.</p>
<p>We must take action, today, more than any other day before, to open the mind of those that their citizenship have been abused by those who use the system. If your move is to start a tweet or a blog or whatever, than so beit. I praise your courage and let me know if you star that. ill read your post but not follow you bcs i don-t have or neither will have a twitter account.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>You will be banned. Undoubtedly. </p>
<p>I started a Twitter account so I could read people’s comments and have easier access to the “news” as it broke in real time. </p>
<p>I never tweeted a controversial thought. Yet, I was consistently banned and burned through 4 fake accounts before I just said fuck it.</p>
