    <strong>The only way to live normally without jab is to be independent from gov, from shops from being employed.</strong>
    <p><p>For some might be impossible to achieve this level of independence but seriously if you not typical consumer, if you can survive without daily shop visits, if you can earn without being employed and can source food or produce some yourself. You will be shocked how life can be normal. </p>
<p>Ok health care might be an issue but this is like small speed bump. </p>
<p>Good thumbs up to all who can still think for themselves.</p>
<p>Globalists loosing and this only will accelerate.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly.  If you cut TV, radio, constant advertising of plandemic. If you minding own business  and not getting in to any argument about this crap life is normal.</p>

        <p>For some? I feel your world view might be skewed… especially when it comes to health care, many would die within days or weeks without healthcare they get for chronic conditions. Also, the financial aspect of simply being your own boss isn’t feasible for many. Sure, if you have a lucrative hobby, you have a slim chance of making it, and the internet exposure helps that, but the market is over saturated. Im not trying to be a doomer, I want exactly what you do, I just don’t see it as even a hint of achievable for the majority of the populace.</p>
<p>Edit to add it also capitulates to them. Instead of running off into the woods, albeit peaceful, shouldn’t we fight for our basic right to be humans in society if we so choose and fight against  this new reign of bioterrorism?</p>

        <p>I started be independent by sourcing local foods from my locals. This turned out to be great way of building trust but also sourcing healthy food. Thanks to that step I have one less headache when reading about places considering block unvaccinated entry to supermarket. Next step was to try and not being typical consumer. And this also seems to have me boost in confidence that it can be done. By not being typical consumer I could save money. It's surprising how much I've can spend on crap. Daily!
And by saving money we moving in to that being own boss type of thing. If you haven't got high monthly spending you can start slow with low earning to cover bills etc. Eventually you will evolve. Your business or work will pay more. 
Lastly health care. I agree that if you have long term Illness this type of life would never gonna work for you. But is it really hard for healthy young , sane person to at least try it?</p>
<p>Not saying : do it overnight ! I'm saying it's a process. And it's working.</p>
