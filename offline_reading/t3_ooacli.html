        <p>Fauci radically redefines what "gain of function" research is in order to pretend that he wasn't funded gain of function research. Under Fauci's definition of "gain of function" research, almost nothing qualifies as "gain of function" research. Unfortunately, I don't think Rand Paul's line of questioning was very good. Let's face it- people consider Fauci to be a bigger virus "expert" than Rand Paul, so Rand Paul is not going to be able to win a fight with Fauci about the definition of gain of function research.</p>
<p>Rand Paul should have just asked Fauci if he funded the Wuhan lab. I don't know how Fauci would have been able to get around that question, at least without outright lying. That would have been a factual, point blank question that Fauci wouldn't have been able to weasel his way out of.</p>
<p>If Fauci admitted to funding the Wuhan lab but said he didn't fund gain of function research at the lab, Paul should have then asked what type of research Fauci did fund at the lab. Fauci would have come off as a buffoon.</p>
