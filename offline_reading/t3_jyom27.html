<title>Hospitals Overwhelmed by Flu Patients Are Treating Them in Tents (2017-2018). Over capacity hospitals aren’t that uncommon. Why no curfew and lockdown in previous years hospitals were beyond 100% capacity?</title>

        <p>Where I live, people are losing their minds because supposedly the hospitals are at or near capacity, and we're told that staff will be making decisions about who lives or dies, and who gets treatment or not, for ALL medical problems. Our health task force doctor has apparently been on the verge of tears at news conferences. We have the option of setting up field hospitals, so shouldn't we do it if it's already this bad? Nope, the task force doctor is just "considering that option". We have no tents, nothing. It doesn't make sense.</p>

        <p>You know what hospitals call excess capacity? Good. It means you aren't sitting around with a half empty building.</p>

        <p>I've even seen a hospital get overrun with diabetics. People sat on floors and patients were seen in the hallway bc no rooms. There was no panic to ban sweets or anything. We knew one of the diabetics who went in there all the time and she actually laughed that the taxpayers paid to treat her diabetes, and paid for her food (food stamps), and she was still eating and drinking pure sugar until sores formed on her legs. And dope heads always clog ERs. When I suggested cutting of their government insurance for self induced emergencies or made up ones, they say it's against their rights. I suggest a sugar tax or taking sweets off the food stamp program and again they bitch about freedom. But lockdowns and mask mandates are fine? And don't get me wrong I feel bad for elderly who have more risk of death even for regular flu. I feel like no one cared about them until CDC announced obese people and diabetics were also more likely to die. I've wanted to help fix the obesity epidemic which would have helped hospital capacity, helped people survive illness bc their bodies would be stronger, and my views on this are somehow controversial. Instead of getting to say I told you so I lost a year of my life for people who never cared about their health to begin with.</p>

        <p>Every state has had 9 months to plan for this exact scenario. Yet their only solution is another lockdown. </p>
<p>I have a solution: 1) don’t get tested. 2) don’t got to the hospital unless you have severe symptoms </p>
<p>Cities everywhere never even used the pop up hospitals back in March. This is all propaganda - all to drive up hysteria and fear so people will accept lockdowns as a solution.</p>

<p>you mean covid has been fraudulently LISTED as the c.o.d, due to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">a change in a 17 year old rule</a> that only applies to covid, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qjLOD4v.jpg">right</a>?</p>
<p>'covid' has not killed 3x as many as that ful did, so gtfo</p>
<p>this is the wrong sub to spread covid propaganda</p>
<p>we ain't buying any of it.</p>
<p>if the rona was anywhere near as contagious or deady as YOU believe, no one would need to be DICTATED to wear masks or locked down.</p>
<p>now kindly fuck off</p>
