    <strong>Canada: 50K tested per day x 365 days, means they ought to have tested 18.250 mil. of the pop. by now, with reported 24K dead, 1.17 mil. active cases and 1.07 mil. recovered as of Apr. 24/21</strong>
    <p><p>Can any Canadian on here, help me out?  There's approx. 37 million of you.  From what I gather, your government is testing 50K people per day and this started since at least April of last year.</p>
<p>That means that by now, about half of all Canadians should have been tested.  Which would mean that the death rate from covid-19 in Canada is 0.13% or 24K dead out of 18.250 million people. If we double that to account for the whole population, your stats are 0.26% death rate, or a 99.74% survival rate.</p>
<p>Is my math wrong?  Am I missing something?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT to add:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks  for all your input.  A couple of things.  One, I'm not sure why this is  being downvoted.  Two, if they are re-testing the same people over and  over again, how is that an accurate representation of your country's  state?  Isn't that borderline fraudulent?</p>
<p>I  mean, by that logic, can you not then arbitrarily increase/decrease the  number of daily cases, simply by shifting where you sample from?   Has  this not occurred to anyone?</p></p>

        <p>a couple things:</p>
<p>its gotta be more than 50K/day being tested - I'm in Ontario and we are between 40K and 60K per day just here.</p>
<p>some of the tests are testing and retesting the same people.  I work in an institution where there was an outbreak last April.  about 100 out of 120 residents tested positive (most asymptomatic - some had symptoms)...these residents were then retested every couple days for the next MONTH in an effort to get them to test negative. finally those in charge just stopped testing them because they were not testing negative no matter how long they waited.  so some of these positives coming back are the same people again and again and again - not actual people.  that was really eye opening when I realized that (but of course media doesn't report that part).</p>

        <p>That percentage would not double. You may see a fluctuation in that 13% by a few points.
Why did you double it?</p>
<p>If 50% of the population has been tested and the death rate is at 13% tested the other 50% would not double that death rate.</p>
<p>I'd argue that due to untested people who have recovered fully your number would most likely drop a few points.
Mostly all deaths I'd assume are accounted for, unless there is a bunch of Undiscovered or undisclosed dead people. </p>
<p>But whatever the case doubling the amount of testing would not double the death rate.</p>

        <p>There’s people bragging on local subs (cough r/Halifax ) that they’ve been “aSyMpToMaTiCaLLy tested” a handful of times.</p>
<p>There’s also occupations that test their employees weekly and stuff, film sets being an example.</p>

        <p>Same people are being tested, since it is known the PCR test is sometimes unreliable it is done several times. If it's 1% of false positive then done twice it's only 0.01% and thrice just 0.0001%. Quick maths.</p>
