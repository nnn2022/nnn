    <strong>Under 25’s. How has this influenced your politics? Do you blame the virus, or your governor, for lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>Just curious how this is going politically.  My teenager thinks it is a load of shit. We are Trump supporters so she is towing the line so far.  How about all of you?  </p>
<p>I have reached the point where I can’t even talk to Biden supporters, Cuomo fans, or doomers.  </p>
<p>I’m curious about student athletes losing their season, or college kids locked in dorm rooms.  Are they able to see past their liberal loving CNN watching ways?</p></p>

        <p>I’m an early 20s conservative (a more libertarian conservatism), but basically all of my friends are liberals, and some are Marxists. A few of them are extreme doomers, but most of them will agree that some part of the COVID hysteria is bullshit. Yet, not a single one of them will blame the government for it. I don’t know what mental gymnastics they do, but it ends with blaming “Americans”. Even after I point out that this is a global issue, not an American one, it’s still “orange man bad” for them. </p>
<p>I’ve also noticed that they have because huge rule followers all of a sudden. I have several friends who only wear masks if it’s the “rule”, but won’t if it’s not legally mandated somewhere. But they’re not the malicious complaint type. For some reason young adults nowadays think the government knows all, and are unable to think for themselves.</p>

        <p>Right.... all the young people claiming this virus is still dangerous and this is not propaganda was all "fuck the government" last year. Now they trust them will all information? 
I'm 25 and have never hated people especially peoole my age more then i do right now. 
I'd consider myself kind of a "hippy" honestly or at least thats what my parents say. I go to multiple music festivals every year smoke weed frequently and don't shave my legs. I used to agree with alot of things my peers have said. I want people to be free. To have the option to choose how they want to live their life as long as it dosnt not financially or physically hurt anybody else. 
I thought most people my age wanted the same thing but I realized this year the democrats are just fucked as the Republicans but they make themselves look like the good child of America when they're really the bullies behind the playground. 
Over the past few months iv had to think real hard about what I want/need out of this country and Iv decided I'm voting for trump this year. 
It sucks im going to have to keep this a secret from all of my peers out of fear of being ostracized but I will not vote for the party that wants to keep us prisoners in our own country.</p>

<p>This smacked me in the face when I was 20. I was a hippy kid who was generally liberal and favored the Democrats. It sure didn't turn me into a conservative Republican!  Just disillusioned me on the whole thing. Bill Hicks summed it up pretty well  </p>
<p>My awakening was back in the 1970s, things have gotten far worse since then.</p>

<p>How does covid not qualify? Do you have older relatives or friends? You realize you can catch covid, get a mild disease, but infect someone older and potentially kill them?</p>
<p>Year one of covid will likely see 350,000 American deaths, even with limiting public transportation, sporting/music events and many other public gatherings. Without these limits deaths could be in the millions. Is that what you want?</p>

        <p>Im not sure if you check out international covid stats, but the USA is alone since early June in its inability to contain covid among modern nations. </p>
<p>If you believe a liberal state like NY is putting safety ahead of liberty you are severely mistaken. Cuomo has opened up public schools with zero community testing within the school, so we will not know of infections until the virus has infected and spread within a particular school. Already, one region (LI) with a significant population of college kids traveling for college, has seen its infection rate double, and it’s not even Labor Day.</p>

        <p>I've been a conservative since I could understand politics. However, I have been very openly anti Trump since 2016. Before Covid hit i was for Biden, I wanted some change. However, it's apparent now that its Democratic officials that support all these lockdowns, masks, arbitrary rules (can't drink a beer without food), etc. That I cant help but be in the Republican camp. It rubs me the wrong way that I'm supporting Trump but...it is what it is</p>

        <p>I just turned 26 last month lol but I’ll say I wasn’t too involved in politics before all this started, but I was definitely more of a leftist/dem. I would have voted for Bernie but never even considered voting for Biden. around march/april I went through sort of an “awakening” and now I consider myself more of a conservative. The “left” increasingly started to support things that i just couldn’t, and it all came to a head for me when people I know supported the BLM protests but not the reopening protests. Democrat governors showed me that they didn’t give a shit about people’s freedoms and their livelihoods, they just want votes from people who would otherwise like to see this country burn.</p>

        <p>I'm a left-winged anarchist who interacts mostly with leftists. I don't and won't ever support any government - which I, of course, blame for all the badly planned restrictions we are having now and that aren't having any results. I'm also disappointed that a lot of leftists believe everything the media tells and are hypocrites with their actions now (not supporting small businesses, using only single-used products...). That's why I'm surrounded with people living with fear of the Corona (I only have fear of being fined) and I'm usually trying to avoid arguing with my communities and my close people.</p>

        <p>I will consider Libertarians, but I cannot vote for any Republican that does not support bodily autonomy for women.  I will not vote for any Democrat responsible for the lockdowns or future Democrats who do not firmly state that it was a disastrous policy.  In races where there are no acceptable candidates, I will be abstaining.   Honestly, I think the current team sport nature of politics is destroying the country.   Too many people are for or against things just because they think their team is for or against it.  Almost no one is thinking about issues on their own merit. I don’t care what Trump or Pelosi say  about anything.  A policy is good or bad on its own merits.  The politicization and censorship around treatments and responses to coronavirus have been disgusting.   Facebook and google need to be broken up.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns are anti-choice with extra steps, IMO. It’s not like there’s much of an environment for fostering sexual relationships, plus all the doctors are trying to do everything over telemedicine which will be a deterrent to birth control and abortion, etc.</p>

        <p>It's weird to be understood more now with people that is not political-alike, but thank you. It's like they don't know how to talk about any other topics. In my country (Spain) the TV is all day repeting docens of times the same unimportant news to "buy" support: "new cases again (1 person living in a lost village in the middle of nowhere that no one cares)". That bothers me A LOT because if you look at pages like https://www.worldometers.info/ you can realise that no one's talking about the main causes of death like hungry or HIV.</p>
<p>So I'm just like, f*** it, I'll be interested in one or two years again in politics and activism when this obsession ends and people care again about things.</p>

        <p>I have always been conservative but this has made me go a bit more to the right imo. I'm willing to put up with less and less shit before I speak up. The biggest difference though is wanting to participate in state politics. I used to not care that much ( my vote hardly matters in my state) but I am more active now and actively seeking to participate in conversation regarding my state government.</p>

        <p>I just turned 25 recently. I graduated from college over a year ago now and am a teacher. I think all of this is bullshit. Unfortunately, I only have one other friend who feels the same way as I do. A lot of the shit the rest of my friends say about all of this is mindblowingly stupid (yes I know that’s not a word but that’s how I feel). I used to be pretty left leaning on a lot of things but watching Democrat governors and mayors (including my own) run their states and cities into the ground has definitely made me much more right leaning at this point. Plus as a teacher, I think it’s a great disservice we’re doing our children not allowing them back into the classroom, especially special needs kiddos.</p>

The left has been losing me for a long time, even ever since the tail end of high school I was starting to smell the rot. I still hated the Republicans though. They were the party of religious authoritarianism and corporate tyranny in my eyes. In college, I supported Bernie, hated Hillary and Trump.</p>
<p>Both parties have changed significantly since then. I've started to feel more pushed into a corner lately. I never would have called myself a conservative, but these days I'm feeling more and more like I'm on the right. The lockdowns have, in my opinion, truly revealed the hypocrisy of the modern left. Democratic governors and mayors nationwide have blatantly violated constitutional rights. I can't, in good conscience support the Democratic Party anymore until they reform significantly, which sucks because I want to be able to feel comfortable voting for them again. I want to feel that the Democrats will fight to protect my constitutional rights. But that's not happening right now. Until I see a drastic change, I will be voting Republican. </p>
<p>I don't actually blame my governor entirely. He's certainly not blameless but he could be worse. I live in Massachusetts, a deep blue, hyper-liberal state headed by a Republican governor, Charlie Baker. He's made a lot of mistakes, but I think the real culprit here in MA is just......the general culture. There's a reason I call this place Masshysteriachusetts. People here have a tendency to overreact and get hysterical. Why do you think everyone calls us Massholes? So largely I think Charlie has his hands tied. I don't think he's a wannabe dictator like Andy Cuomo or Phil Murphy, or my least favorite, Gretchen Whitmer. But much of his response to the virus seems to be directly related to the state of hysterical psychosis MA residents are in. People here don't value freedom, they value security at all costs. Part of it might be the fact that we're a rich state, so a lot of people live very cushy lives and can afford to stay locked down for as long as possible. And another reason is that this state is jam-packed full of universities, which have been, in recent years, a breeding ground for radical ideologies. There are a lot of factors that play into how MA has behaved, but no, I don't entirely blame the governor. </p>
<p>TL;DR  This whole thing has made me more conservative. But I'm not like....a true conservative. If that makes sense.</p>
