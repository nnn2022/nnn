    <strong>Vaccine and Fertility Issues</strong>
    <p><p>If you type in "vaccine infertility" into Google, you get endless articles about how the vaccine doesn't cause infertility, usually in the form of a rebuttal, like "No, the infertiltiy vaccine rumours arent true" and "Vaccine infertility myth debunked". But the weird thing is, other than a few women here and there saying it messed up their period, I'm not hearing much from the skeptical side about infertility being a potential issue with the vaccines. Issue of not working? Sure. Issue of unforeseen long-term consequence? Also true. But nary a word about infertility. I have to go looking for it. </p>
<p>So it brings me to wonder..where are they getting this from? If you read the articles, they rarely reference anything substantial as to what they are referring to. So its kinda like a weird rebuttal.... That nobody asked for. Thoughts? I appreciate skepticism, facts and data from both sides on this, as I am genuinely just curious.</p>
<p>EDITED for grammar.</p></p>

        <p>I see what you see. What cases and evidence are they arguing against? It seems preemptive. But also, millennials are apparently have way less kids than normal and they received the latest round of contemporary vaccines. Ultimately, any report concluding that the COVID-19 vaccines do not affect fertility is FULL OF SHIT. We don't have the data yet. It will take years before we understand the real effects of these experimental medical devices.</p>

        <p>I can vouch for viral shedding.  My sister got the vaccine, and she started getting really wack periods lasting for entire months.  I was around her only for a few hours, and (my periods normally last 3-5 days) I had a period that lasted for 2 weeks immediately after.  It hit early too.  </p>
<p>I heard a virologist say that women know their bodies way better than men do.  Women are the ones getting the most concerned about this, because they're recognizing that the way their bodies are behaving isn't normal.  </p>
<p>Its frustrating, but if there's one thing I know I can trust, it's that whatever the mainstream media is shouting at us is a lie, and we should believe the exact opposite.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience. Have been living at home and both my parents are vaccinated. Within a few days of my mom getting hers I‚Äôve had pelvic pain that‚Äôs really dull and insidious. Comes and goes. My period was late and painful. Since that point on I‚Äôve had periodic pelvic pain. Also side note I‚Äôm 33, healthy, fit eat well etc. </p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt put a lot of stock into the viral shedding component until I started reflecting on my own experience. </p>
<p>And I typically stay mid-point in all of this- just let people live their lives and make their own decisions.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna throw my 2 cents in here, My partner  has always had  abnormally heavy periods due to thyroid problems but they was always on time each month as they should be. Within 3 or 4 days of my mum having that shit in her arm my partner started bleeding excessively on and off, her actual time of the month is now hit and miss and she passes huge fucking clots. Its got to the point that she now has to take huge iron tablets to counter anaemia. She actually pointed this out to me herself before I showed her anything about shedding.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs interesting, sorry to hear that. I‚Äôve studied nutrition and a really good source of iron (and zinc) are pumpkin seeds. Also dark leafy greens and greens in general, if you‚Äôre having a salad (preferably spinach) pour some lemon juice on there to maximize the iron absorption, and even toss some pumpkin seeds in there too if you want. Men should stay away from excessive iron or iron supplements, we get even in a regular diet and we have no way of getting rid of extra iron. Personally, I have high iron, but that‚Äôs also from having so many blood transfusions in the past. I hope it gets better for her.</p>

        <p>Yes thanks man, it was so low doctors actually said she needed these, but yes I've already been giving her pumpkin seeds and spinach funnily enough didn't actually realise it had iron in was just trying to get her to consume more nutritious food.</p>

        <p>No, not synchronizing with the vaccinated. That‚Äôs a misleading statement. Problems. Women can get synchronized cycles while being around other women for a while but not while around men. So how do you explain that?</p>

        <p>Wild right. All the articles that pop up are ‚ÄúWhy you shouldn‚Äôt believe the vaccine misinformation‚Äù, ‚ÄúVaccine conspiracies debunked‚Äù.  They did studies in mice and they were unable to produce placenta, the life line for pregnant women‚Äôs babies.  They are sterilizing us, we are overpopulated and consuming too many resources for sustainability.  I get their reasoning</p>

        <p>but our population growth rate is rapidly declining, world is barely over 1.0 now. By 2100 (or before) it will peak, and then go down. I dont know why they think this</p>

        <p>A lot of first world countries are approaching below replacement level of population.  You don't even need to sterilize people for it, but if our 'betters" are going to keep us like pets, I could see them wanting to fix us like we do our pets, too.  </p>
<p>They don't seem to be willing to be patient and let societal trends bring population down naturally.</p>

        <p>Too early to know about fertility effects.  But if you search for extended periods or miscarriages you‚Äôll find plenty of results.  And all of those results admit anecdotal evidence while saying scientists are just starting to study the issues.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve heard of the vaccine potentially causing fertility issues in men. I‚Äôm not informed on the science of it, but the basic idea is that the vacidne changes one‚Äôs DNA, and this is something to do with it.</p>

        <p>&rt; but the basic idea is that the vacidne changes one‚Äôs DNA </p>
<p>Wow. This still? You don't understand the science, but you can't be bothered to simply look up a few topics in Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Quick version: The vaccine doesn't make changes to DNA. The mRNA vaccines are quite literally unable to do that, as your body doesn't perform reverse transcription (RNA to DNA) and the gene sequence for the vaccine is well known and contains no reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, this is actually leveraging a very similar mechanism that viruses use to create proteins. </p>
<p>mRNA has been studied for decades. Delivering mRNA to mammalian cells has been used in labs for decades. These fears that people describe have never been seen, despite scientists looking for them. </p>
<p>In the vaccine trials, fertility was checked. There were no impacts. In previous vaccine trials (SARS, MERS) there was also no impact on fertility.</p>
<p>All the rest of these fears are Arguments from Ignorance: "Since no one has proved that it doesn't happen, then we should assume it does."</p>
<p>That's horrible logic, and the hallmark of an unscientific, illogical mind.</p>
