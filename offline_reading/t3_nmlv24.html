    <strong>Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche PHD, DVM</strong>
    <p><p>I would like to encourage you all to visit  Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche's website. He is a renowned vaccine developer and researcher from Belgium. He has worked for the German Center for Infection Research, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, GSK, among others and was important in the development of the Ebola vaccine. He has risked his reputation and probably career to voice his concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines that we are currently dealing with.</p>

        <p>My problem with him is he‚Äôs promoting the idea that something similar to marek‚Äôs disease is likely to occur in humans.   If you are familiar with his argument and what mareks disease is, then you know what he is saying is the people most in danger are the unvaccinated.  He cites concerns, with no basis, of runaway variants that will continue to gain in strength because of our vaccination efforts in the middle of a so-called pandemic.  According to Mark Yeadon, former research VP of Pfizer, the variant that is most different from the original strain is actually only 0.3% different which is not enough to overcome someone‚Äôs immune response who has acquired either natural immunity to this virus or cross-immunity from prior corona viruses ( ie colds).  Bosch argues that the vaccination effort needs to be stopped.  This obviously will not happen as half of the USA has already got the vaccine.  He knows this, so he very cleverly leads one to believe that the only other option is to get vaccinated.  Listen to what he says and tell me if you come away with any other conclusion.  He is a shill, albeit a very a clever one.  Mark Yeadon has expressed his doubts about Bosch‚Äôs authenticity as well.  And for very good reason.  People on this sub will never trust people like Bill Gates , Fauci, etc.  But they might trust someone who appears to be working against the current narrative.  But as I explained above, his argument leads to ‚Äúeverybody should get vaccinated ‚Äú so he actually is fighting for the current narrative.   Bravo Bosche üëèüëè.  You almost had me.</p>

        <p>Does he not state that the mantra of vaccination, that more people vaccinated, the less the viral replication and hence, the fewer variants, does not apply as it does not take into account the most fundamental mechanism of evolutionary biology: Natural selection. The latter promotes survival and propagation of highly infectious variants which indirectly cause enhanced morbidity and mortality in previously protected subjects.   </p>
<p>Doesn't this argument go against vaccinating the masses?</p>

        <p>It does.  But assume a massive vaccination campaign is already underway and the point is moot. What conclusions do you draw from his argument under that assumption?</p>

<p>Do you by any chance remember - where? I just found out about Bossche's ideas. They're interesting, however, his mid-March predictions about a soon spike in morbidity/mortality in the UK aren't supported by the current data. He is still updating his article about stopping vaccination etc., however, isn't analysing any current infection/mortality/morbidity data to support his claims. I find this behaviour odd and not trustworthy.</p>
