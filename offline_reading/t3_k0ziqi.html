    <strong>The newest goalpost: a negative COVID test is meaningless and you should still assume you’re positive</strong>
    <p><p>An increasingly popular take being spread by governments and media alike is essentially that testing negative for COVID means nothing; you could still very well be infectious and kill grandma if you see her on Thanksgiving. But what I’m wondering about this new take is that isn’t this an admission that testing is meaningless? That is, either the tests themselves are bad or testing as a concept is useless given the nature of the course of the illness. Early in the pandemic, the talking point was “we need more tests to control this pandemic, if we test a billion people a day we can go back to normal”. Yet now that testing is higher than ever, the narrative is that “The tests don’t mean anything”? I’m just so frustrated and fully expect the take of “just because you’re vaccinated doesn’t mean you’re not covid positive” to become more popular next month (it’s already beginning to make the rounds). This is only going to end when the majority of citizens stand up to this nonsense and go back to their lives</p></p>

        <p>If a negative test is meaningless, than a positive test should be also! But if telling people they are negative, are they really not negative and they are positive also? If so, why are they not being added to the "case" count</p>

        <p>This is, for all intents and purposes, a true statement. Getting tested for covid when you aren’t very sick is completely pointless. </p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> sick, you should stay home, regardless of what a test shows. </p>
<p>People who are <em>really</em> sick should obviously go to the hospital.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it has been shown that people with minor symptoms that they push off as 'just another cold' or 'just my allergies' can spread CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Those are the people that make me tear my hair out and have been tearing my hair out for 20 years now about those people because in any flu season, they are the damned problem driving infection rates and the fatality rate.</p>

        <p>That is an important problem and people need to understand that very mild symptoms similar to a cold could be COVID-19. The vast majority of people will actually have mild or no symptoms. The problem is the media acts like COVID-19 is some kind of death sentence that will invariably put you on a ventilator. The messaging has been very disingenuous, to say the least. </p>
<p>Asking everyone (with or without symptoms) to stay home for more than a year is beyond ludicrous. </p>
<p>The messaging from the start should have been stay home for a week if you have a cold- it could be Covid. That was doable.</p>

        <p>In an alternate future that's what we did, and we are doing it again now in the winter and there's positive articles being written on how low the flu season is thanks to companies not pressuring staff to work when sick.<br>
Can you imagine it? Phone lines to report businesses forcing the sick to work rather than report your neighbors going outside? Better employment laws around sick leave and maybe even government funding to help smaller businesses cope with those of sick. If only we'd reacted that way...</p>

        <p>That isn't how it works. False negatives are infinitely more common when the PCR tests are being run at the proper cycle rate (&lt;=30) than false positives.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that some labs are running at 31+ cycles but from what I have seen, labs are starting to wake up after the published studies pointing out that at 31+ cycles, the PCR tests become 97%+ inaccurate to the point of way too many false positives.</p>

        <p>You shouldn't be down voted. This is 100% correct about lowering the CT value (though from my experience I disagree about more false negatives with PCR). 
 All this covid bullshit could've been avoided of we just used the appropriate CT value from the start. My state would have a 90% reduction in "positive" tests if we used ct of 30 instead of 40 (this was plainly stated in the New York Times months ago).</p>
