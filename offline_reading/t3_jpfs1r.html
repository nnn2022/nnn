    <strong>Is the government trying to make you intentionally sick?</strong>
    <p><p>So what I’m talking about is vitamin D, so many people are deficient in it. It’s very important for immune health among many other things. It’s really good for fighting virus and particularly respiratory virus like what covid-19 is. But the <em>recommended</em> daily amount is around 600-1000 IUs. You can safely take up to 10,000 IUs a day but I take only 2,000 for now. Those sources say that excess vitamin D can cause terrible side affects but the only thing it can cause is hypercalcemia (above normal calcium found in blood). Most notably this can cause kidney stones if calcium builds up there. But a simple fix to this is drinking a lot of water (about 2 litres per day if taking a lot of vitamin D) to not allow that. On average, you would need to consume 100,000 IUs daily for months to get an excess amount.</p>
<p>So why are they lying? Most people don’t know how vitamin D works and don’t look into it. They see recommendations from health organizations and believe every word. We were already in a pandemic before, a population deficiency in vitamin D. Instead of fabric masks that are doing nothing, we should be recommending a vitamin D supplements.</p>
<p>It can also vasty improve mood and energy. So a lot of the time depressed patients are just too low in vitamin D. You can’t get a sufficient amount from the sun unless you’re in shorts and a t shirt or less. You can’t get enough from your diet either. That’s why it’s so important to supplement it.</p></p>

        <p>It definitely feels suspect that for the few months at the beginning, you were crucified for even wanting to go for a walk or go to the beach. I remember I started taking long walks in April and prepared to be yelled at by people in my neighborhood only to find that many others were walking as well. But I remember reading about how vitamin D deficiency was being found in the deceased in China. I started taking vitamin D and finding all possible ways to stay in the sun. Now I take 5000 UI each day on top of regular sun exposure and exercise. It feels like an act of rebellion trying to be healthy and get my body ready to fight should I get covid. It feels sinister that they wouldn’t encourage people to get healthier through all this.</p>

        <p>I believe you can gather a lot about the nature of TPTB by what makes you feel abnormal. I used to feel gross about eating fast food, being overweight etc but it’s switched. I feel arrogant for wanting to stay in shape, and prissy for so much as reading a food label. </p>
<p>Where did all the health nuts go? It’s like the entire mantra of be active eat well just went the way a sugar lobbyist or obese unhappy person would want it to go. </p>

<p>I believe so. When you see lockdowns, mandates etc that's intentional and beyond any doubt. </p>
<p>As of vit D3 and supplementation in general the gov does not advocate. Quite the opposite they have wage a war on supplements with people's resources. And if you did not notice they shutdown everything that has to do with health. </p>
<p>They advocate drugs and mandate drugging. I have taken 500k IUs in one dose of D3 for a week and nothing bad happened. So these so studies you read in the news are basically done on hospitalized patients with inferior products, then they blame supplementation for the failed medical system</p>

        <p>Vitamin D toxicity builds up over time as it's fat soluble - it's rare for people to take so much for long enough to cause problems. Though they may get nausea and vomiting from taking too much immediately. A week at extremely high doses wouldn't be long enough for an impact. It's more chronic, where as overdose on iron and cause acute iron toxicity and even death. The effects are immediate if a high enough dose is taken. Where as with vitamin D it's excessive longterm intake that causes issues.</p>

<p>If you use what you take, then no. There is zero buildup. Of course anything that accumulates in your body will cause damage, that's certain. So everything depends in the given context with what you do. This iron supplementation reference makes me wonder what's the significance, only mainstream conventional doctors would ever recommend iron supplementation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The effects are immediate if a high enough dose is taken. </p>
<p>Can you start being specific? What is the "high enough dose"? Do you supplement at all? If so what's the vit.D3 limit you've tried?</p>
<p>Because it seems to me you are reading stuff out of a medical textbook.</p>

        <p>If you take excessive amounts, that's how hypervitaminosis D occurs. There is no reason to take huge amounts of vitamin D. No benefit. Why would I push the limits? I dont need to experiment on myself. Whether I "supplement" at all is irrelevant. I take vitamin D when I am deficient in vitamin D, I am tested twice a year because I have risk factors to be deficient. Same as I take B12 when deficient and am tested since my diet puts me at risk. There is no evidence that taking vit D supplements benefits healthy people who don't have a deficiency. </p>
<p>I have no reason to take huge amounts of vitamin D3 and push the limits because there is zero reason to... no benefit. 200--800UI is the daily recommended dose and depends upon age. Higher to correct deficiencies sometimes or with some medical conditions. Over 4000UI a day for prolonged periods is currently the limit that is a risk for hypervitaminosis D and there's truly no reason to take such high doses.</p>
<p>Taking massive doses isn't going to fight of this virus lol.</p>
<p>You can't control how much vitamin D your body uses, so why would you take more than you need? It's not like you can decide to use more of it.</p>

<p>And what are these limits? Because hypervitaminosis = latin pharma BS. It is meaningless except pushing a mainstream drugs narrative. </p>
<p>There are no limits that I know of. If people had enough nutrients for the environmental stress they go through, they wouldn't age, they wouldn't get sick, they wouldn't die. It's very simple. So before starting these limit claims and deficiencies, keep that in mind. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; You can't control how much vitamin D your body uses </p>
<p>How do you know anything about me? How do you know how much I need for the stress I go through? How do you know if there is no benefit? You never tried anything like that. Try them. Don't follow the same path of conventional medical doctors who think they know something about health. the moment all they do is to prescribe drugs. </p>
<p>Remember people still get sick, age and die. So they don't have what they need that's certain.</p>

        <p>No, vitamin D toxicity is a documented outcome of long-term high excess vitamin D intake. It's not a conspiracy pushed by pharma or in order to push a drugs narrative LOL. Some of ideas from people in this sub are hilarious. There is ZERO reason to take excessive amounts of vitamin D. Your body only requires so much naturally, of any vitamin or mineral including D. </p>
<p>You don't need more vitamin D the more stressed you are. Your body doesn't <strong><em>use</em></strong> more Vitamin D when you're stressed... that's not how it works. There's some evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be linked with low mood, depression, anxiety though not conclusive and still being expanded and explored. But that's a deficiency being present and while that means a supplement should be taken to increase levels, it doesn't mean the more stressed you are the more excess a dose you need. It doesn't mean taking excessive doses each day is beneficial.</p>
<p>See, the supplement industry is just as big, influential and powerful as the pharmaceutical industry. It's reaching for the stars and less regulated which benefits them. Uses great tactics to push unnecessary supplements on people, making them think they "need" it daily because guess what? It sells and that means profit. Odd how your trust the supplement industry who stand to gain financially so much considering it's similarities to the pharmaceutical industry you distrust. You've clearly fallen for the narrative that you NEED to be taking extraordinarily high levels of vitamin D regardless of a deficiency and that it benefits you without evidence beyond your own placebo effect.</p>
<p>I love that you assume I only follow and have experience with conventional doctors  - which supplements as needed are encouraged by. I grew up with a mum who avoided medications rarely ever giving us panadol. Or that I havent ever in my life fallen victim to the lucrative vitamin industry so often pushed by non conventional doctors and alt practitioners and just the supplement industry in general. Yeah, my parents have spent at least a couple of hundreds thousands (a big deal in a country where healthcare is free btw) on alternative practitioners, alternative medicine, and actual holistic / integrative doctors, and you guessed it - excessive amounts of vitamins in excessive doses pushed by them as well. At one point I was taking too many vitamin pills / powders / drops / sprays a day, multiple times a day to bother to count. I became so good at downing excessive numbers of pills - actual handfuls - in one go that it greatly aided my suicide attempt some years back lol. Some dark humour there but I had to take <em>that</em> many supplements at points that it became a skill.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, at one point I was put on excessive amounts of vitamin D beyond what any person needs daily on the promise is would greatly improve my health. I had at that time as shown by blood tests vitamin D levels at the higher end to begin with. Oh just take this many (too many) 1000UI D3 tablets and you'll feel great. Absolutely ridiculous. Oh and daily B12 injections that turned my pee a bright red from memory even though I surprisingly as a vegan had normal levels and didn't need it. On top of all the other supplements that particular integrative doctor convinced us were the answer. </p>
<p>See in my country these integrative and holistic doctors make big bucks. More so than my GP. It was conventional doctors who were honest about the fact there was no treatment for me, there isn't, and they didn't once push needless medications on me. Even for my severe chronic pain I had from injuries when hit by a car as a kid, and then also the chronic illness I later developed, conventional doctors sent me to the pain clinic here which pushed not drugs but physical therapy, psychology, desensitization and learning to cope. </p>
<p>It was non conventional doctors and alternative "practitioners" who manipulated, gave false hope, and even guilted my mum into spending appalling amounts of money we didn't have on such things. Plus guilted me when I said it was too much to take, or it all made me feel sick, or it was overwhelming, that if i really wanted to get better i would take it. Who pushed all these supplements and made false claims. My mum wanted her child to get better or at least improve to the point she was desperate to believe anything. My mum may be into the natural side of things but she's also intelligent and balanced when it comes to both, but her pain watching her child suffer made her gullible and the perfect victim for the as I've said lucrative industry.</p>
<p>So yeah, been there done that. Taken large amounts of every supplement under the god damn sun. Been taken advantage of by that industry. Know better these days and yep my mum regrets the money spent and pills/drinks/sprays/drops I felt I had no choice but to take.</p>
<p>It is called having evidence of benefit, especially that which eliminates the placebo effect. Placebo effect is powerful  - you may think that taking excessive vitamin D whether or not you have a deficiency makes you feel better, that it gives you more energy, but there's no evidence this is the case and if you were to take a placebo vitamin D in a blind RCT study... </p>
<p><strong>Unless you are deficient, there's no benefit taking the supplement in the first place. There is no benefit in taking excess vitaminD</strong></p>

        <p>I said it above. If people were not "deficient" they wouldn't get sick, or age or die. It's plain and simple. I don't know what is missing yet, but from my personal experience there is a huge difference between supplementing and not supplementing. Certainly I am not missing the MD or the GP advice. That's certain.</p>
<p>In terms of marketing <strong>the big difference between the nutrition supplements industry and the pharma, is the former has products, while the later pushes drugs to the public via a pharma-gov cartel</strong>. That's the main difference.  Therefore any time you have a doubt about a product you put it down to the test. The research published with supplements is a joke. Because the gov and big institutions are pushing drugs instead. The second difference, is the medicare/medicaid or whatever medical service you want to call it, it is enforced/mandated. And all it offers is drugs and more drugs which results in chronic sickness. You can claim whatever you want but the fact is the drug market is monopolized and closed since 1906. That's the fact. And people like me don't want to pay for that monopoly. Because as it is, it is nothing more than a scam, certainly has no solutions.</p>
<p>In terms of placebo, my physical performance can be clearly measured with supplementing and not supplementing. Consistent physical performance difference are anything but placebo. You can't do that with drugs. It's not that drugs don't have an effect, but as I said because the market is closed. Of course vitD is just one of the myriad of supplement I use.</p>
<p>From your comment I got the impression that you don't supplement at all, you just repeat the usual mainstream narrative. I say this because of the terms you used, people who are or were supplementing they don't use those terms. "natural", "hollistic", "alternative" etc. Terms used to marginalize potential solutions for health issues and push the public into drugging. "natural" has nothing to do with supplementation, Nutrient potency has to do with supplementation. "hollistic" is another bull, it is "wholistic" because a wholistic approach targets the whole body. There is nothing holy about it and just shows how the propaganda goes on from that pharma-gov cartel. And there is no "alternative" medicine. That's like saying english is the only language and every other language is an alternative. There is naturopathy, homeopathy, allopathy, osteopathy, ayurveda,  acupuncture, herbal medicine  etc. There are many segments under one big medical umbrella each with a different approach trying to solve different problems. </p>
<p>Finally supplementation does not bind to some industry as you claimed above. That's like saying agriculture is exclusive to some industry. There is no monopoly or exclusive rights there unlike pharmaceuticals, you can make, trade, test etc. You can plant your own seeds, create extracts from plants or foods or grow herbs and make tinctures etc. Do you know what happens if you try to do something similar with drugs?</p>

        <p>LOL people age because that's life, part of being an organism. People get sick because that's life. People die because that's life.</p>
<p>And you blame it all on having vitamin deficiencies as if every person who ages, get sick and dies does so for that reason. You're so hoodwinked by the supplement industry, enjoy your placebo. Guess you're not gonna age and you'll live forever 🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>
<p>I've taken as I said more supplements than most in their life. My mum is in a worse place financially years later thanks to the appalling amount she spent on these integrative/holistic doctors, alternative practitioners and the rubbish they pushed while promising the impossible. But now I only take them when I have a deficiency as there's no reason to take them if your body is getting what it needs naturally.</p>

        <p>Dying is as normal a part of life as being born. Ageing is normal.. death is normal.</p>
<p>NHS handbook? Uh the NHS is in the UK. </p>
<p>When something doesn't fit your narrative formed without evidence, such as the fact that yes I've taken endless supplements thanks to my chronic illness and desperation of myself and my mum.... you disregard it. Well that's your problem. </p>
<p>I trust myself with my health. I investigate and research for myself and don't blindly accept anything. Maybe you should think as critically about the supplement industry and alternative med field and many of the baseless claims made, just as you do pharmaceuticals and doctors. It's a religion to you, supplementing, more than anything. This is clear. Alone with an inability to accept ageing and death as a natural part of life. A bit of denial there, trying to hold off the inevitable.</p>

        <p>If you think dying is normal then there is something wrong with your basic instincts. Perhaps you are suicidal and that's your problem.</p>
<p>People who take supplements they don't follow the mainstream narrative and using these "alternative" terms you posted.</p>
<p>Yea you trust yourself with your health so much that you believe ageing and dying is normal. Well that's healthy thinking.</p>
<p>I said above several things about supplements I guess you don't want to read them...</p>
<p><strong>the big difference between the nutrition supplements industry and the pharma, is the former has products, while the later pushes drugs to the public via a pharma-gov cartel</strong>.  </p>
<p><em>...supplementation does not bind to some industry as you claimed above. That's like saying agriculture is exclusive to some industry. There is no monopoly or exclusive rights there unlike pharmaceuticals, you can make, trade, test etc. You can plant your own seeds, create extracts from plants or foods or grow herbs and make tinctures etc. Do you know what happens if you try to do something similar with drugs?</em></p>

        <p><strong>If you think death is natural you have a suicide syndrome</strong></p>
<p>And I can prove it anytime to anyone that death is abnormal. That's why you resist it and you do anything possible to survive. See <strong>survive definition</strong>:</p>
<p><em>continue to live or exist, especially in spite of danger or hardship.</em> </p>
<p>I don't know if it clicked for you, but without it, you wouldn't be. Without your basic instinct that keeps you alive you wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>Death is completely abnormal. Ageing which leads to death is abnormal. It means damage. There are various organisms that are biologically immortal. They have the means to rejuvenate. Maybe you don't know that. In fact  some of those organisms are part of you. But how would you know right? I mean look around you, lockdowns, sickness and fear of  various invented latin weird terms, dominate the masses. It's due to lack of common sense, lack of knowledge driven by misinformation from conventional medical doctors. </p>
<p>It's not random that the number one cause of death is <em>MD directive treatments</em> (I guess you didn't know that either) and not some "hypervitaminosis" or pharma-BS claimed. People don't die in health centers. They die drugged and crippled in hospitals under the supervision of medical doctors after chronic suffering.</p>

        <p>Everything points in that direction because everything that has been ordered has been in the exact opposite direction of health for anyone. The masks also give me sinus problems and I get a pretty funky feeling in my mouth after having one on for hours when I have no choice at work. These things could also be toxic in themselves and every time you wear it you are breathing it and its fibers in. </p>
<p>I take 5000 IU D3 every other day, methyl-B12 every day, a tablet of Shilajit, and 2 tsp of food grade sodium bentonite clay every other day. I never get sick because nothing has a chance to make me sick before I push what could cause it out. It also helps especially when it gets colder to be on a diet that minimizes excess mucus output. The fact that the cold  and season changes in general breed more viruses is a complete lie, what does happen is that your nose runs more in the cold and what toxins are in there that then enter into your body after you ingest the mucus cause illness. I'm starting to believe it's almost all a lie in the first place and what we're calling cold and flu season is just detox season and when there is too many various toxins accumulated throughout the year that all leak out in excess at once then you get sick and why others seem to get sick around the same time too.</p>

        <p>That is true. Plus the way the world has been going, a lot of dangerous things are becoming a part of regular life. Like all the chemicals they put in food, I don’t just mean the pesticides they spray. But the more accessible cheaper junk foods that so many more people will have to eat considering all the money lost during this lockdown. When I was a kid, I played soccer in an open field right next to an AC tower (the huge steel power line tower). I got leukemia a couple years later and I’m convinced it was because of that. I ended up looking into it and AC towers are specifically known to potentially cause childhood leukemia. There were no signs around the tower or anything. Plus like you said, exercise is basically prohibited. Being overweight increases your risk for cancers as well as a wide variety of other health problems.</p>

        <p>Vitamin D doesn't fight viruses. It is important for immune system function and balance, but it doesn't fight viruses in itself. Your immune system does that and it's not as simple as taking vitamin d. </p>
<p>Taking excess vitamin D won't do anything, nor will taking vitamin D if you're not deficient in it. Unless you're deficient, there's no benefit in taking it. It won't harm you, but won't benefit you.</p>
<p>If you don't know your levels, you may as well take it to ensure you're getting your daily dose. Also go outdoors around midday and expose your skin even when it's cloudy. </p>
<p>It's important not just for immune function, but your bones; muscles, heart! </p>
<p><strong>But don't take it in excess, hypervitaminosis D happens. It's a waste of money, and it can cause fatigue, headaches, weakness, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth... hypercalcemia which isn't fun. It's fat soluble so the body doesn't have efficient ways of getting rid of it. Again, taking excess amounts won't protect you</strong></p>

        <p>My mood HAS been somewhat better since I started taking it months ago. I wasn't depressed before, but I have fewer bad days now and my baseline seems improved. I only take 1000 IUs because that's what the cheap brand was and I do get some sunlight. I never wear sunscreen unless I'm going to the beach all day.</p>
<p>I don't think they're trying to make anyone sick on purpose, there's just this mentality in modern medicine that vitamins are alternative medicine voodoo and unless someone is really, really deficient, enough to cause obvious physical problems, vitamins don't do anything. The health system in the USA is really good at stuff like physical trauma care and treating rare illnesses and terrible when it comes to natural prevention and using good old common sense.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure that if the government wanted people to get sick, they’d do it in a more efficient way than relying on people to not go outside for 10-30 minutes every day. They’d probably block the sale of vitamin d supplements if they were to do what you think they’re doing.</p>

        <p>But then why recommend the lowest possible dose needed to survive. Plus, 10-30 minutes will not get you enough vitamin D from the sun, unless it’s summer and you’re wearing shorts and a t shirt.</p>

        <p>Well mostly because the foods we eat like eggs and milk have vitamin D in them. Many manufactured food like cereal and juice are also enriched to prevent deficiencies. This allows people to survive without needing to be in the sun every day.</p>

        <p>Only some milk is artificially fortified with vitamin D. So not all milk. The amount in eggs is pretty insignificant, unless you eat a bunch but the health risks of too many eggs out way that benefit. Plus eggs can cause high cholesterol which makes the body use more vitamin D than usual, so it could be argued eggs give you no vitamin D. The fortified cereals and juices don’t offer enough. Maybe if you had a lot of the cereal or juice but the average person is having a bowl of cereal or a glass of juice. The sun isn’t the only other source, and definitely not the safest either. Vitamin D3 supplements come in many varieties and are easy to get. It’s not difficult to chew or swallow a tablet once a day when it can potentially save your life.</p>

        <p>Posts like this just prove you fucking dipshits can't read or think beyond Fox News and Facebook memes. The UK government just recommend that Vitamin D be added to tons of household foodstaples to prevent deficiency and Dr. Fauci has been on television MULTIPLE TIMES saying to take Vitamin D even if you don't feel sick. You're just posting whatever dipshit nonsense you think of without even googling it.</p>

        <p>I don’t watch any news. I didn’t hear that because I don’t live in the UK and I don’t sit watching CNN all day being spoon fed a narrative. The last thing I heard from the UK was they made it illegal to have any sexual relations during the lockdown. Unless it’s someone living with you. So I don’t particularly like listening to fascists. Nice name by the way, I can tell what kind of person you are. You enjoy the authoritarianism and the fascism, it comes with the forced socialism.</p>
