    <strong>Lockdowns create poverty for the illusion of safety</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdowns drove more than 32 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1079162">according to the UN.</a></p>
<p>At the same time, lockdowns do <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484">nothing to reduce coronavirus deaths.</a></p>
<p>So remember when people try to call you selfish, anti-social, uncaring: those who support lockdowns are saying the illusion of safety is worth more than the lives and quality of life of tens of millions of people. Their selfishness is beyond comprehension.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty much everyone I know is either unemployed or under employed now. I don't know a single person who has died. I know a few people who tested positive but had no symptoms. WTF are we doing?</p>

        <p>Exactly, in the UK over 95% of deaths are for over 75s. But the complete restriction on travel and business is doing real damage.</p>
<p>The craziest thing is that if you question the restrictions they call you a Trump supporter, etc. and in some countries will arrest you for some sort of incitement.</p>
<p>I'm a socialist and these restrictions are the biggest act of class warfare we've ever seen. Hypocritical millionaire politicians telling us to lose our jobs and lock ourselves up, whilst they jet off to Hawaii. Even those that do follow their restrictions have their own mansions with private gyms, offices and gardens, etc. whilst we're stuck in single rooms of shared apartments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I know a lot of people who are unemployed but they enjoy their check from the government. I guess they're lazy and being paid for doing nothing is kinda fun. I'm quite sure that we will have a few crisis such as the 2008 Greece bankruptcy in the next few years.</p>

        <p>I am generally quite good at understanding where other people are coming from. </p>
<p>I believe strongly in gay marriage (and am gay myself), but I completely understand why other people don't agree with me. I also believe strongly that assisted death should be legal, but I get the arguments on the other side. I even understand the arguments for neoliberalism, communism, and feudalism, despite thinking that none of those 3 economic systems should be implemented. I'm not personally religious, but I see the value in religion and I understand why other people are religious. </p>
<p>Even other pandemic responses, like mask mandates, I can see the rational argument, despite vehemently disagreeing. </p>
<p>Lockdowns are a policy that I just DO NOT understand whatsoever. They violate human rights, most people aren't even listening to the rules at this point, they are an unpopular strategy with at least a significant minority of the public (if not a majority), and they CLEARLY aren't even effective at reducing cases, let alone saving lives. They are literally the worst idea that has been implemented in the 21st century. The effect of lockdowns is universally negative in every aspect other than the virus, where they seem to have no effect whatsoever (according to actual science). </p>
<p>Lockdowns are possibly the most inhumane idea ever implemented, when you consider the total number of human rights violations. While other policies throughout history have of course violated human rights terribly, they have almost always done so to a minority group. Lockdowns literally violate every single person's rights at the same time. Imagine if we singled out one particular identifiable group, and made them stay at home. That would be inhumane. If it's wrong to do it to a minority, it's wrong to do it to anyone. </p>
<p>How anyone supports lockdowns, I do not understand. I don't think I ever will. Lockdowns are right up there with the Salem Witch Trials in terms of how utterly idiotic they are, except for I also understand the people of Salem who killed witches more than I understand lockdown supporters.</p>

        <p>A) it's not people voluntarily staying home, it's forcing people to stay home. There's a HUGE difference</p>
<p>B) lockdowns are literally killing millions of people through starvation, delayed vaccinations, suicide, drug overdose, and many other causes</p>
<p>C) both women and men died in Salem (Minor point)</p>
<p>D) the actual science is clear, lockdowns haven't actually shown any benefit in reducing transmission, other than tiny island nations that now have no natural immunity </p>
<p>E) lockdowns actually harm elderly and immune compromised people more than a more targeted approach - if we spent all the money we spent crashing the economy on a better pandemic response, we could have paid for groceries and other essentials to be delivered to those who needed it, made "covid safe" hospitals and care homes using staff with naturally acquired immunity that at risk people could choose to go to, and made huge scientific progress towards curing the underlying conditions that people who died of covid had. And still had LOTS of money leftover. $11 trillion buys A LOT. </p>
<p>F) about 20 people died in Salem. The UN estimates 150 million people are starving because of lockdowns. </p>
<p>G) we could prevent the virus from spreading by locking everyone in their homes for a month. We would all die of starvation, but the virus would be gone. Obviously this is a dumb trade off, but it's exactly what lockdowns have done on an international scale to MANY people. </p>
<p>H) for the first time, the UN is helping feed hungry children in the UK, so it's not JUST developing nations who now have a serious food crisis.</p>

        <p>Statistician William Briggs insists that "there's no evidence the lockdown made a difference,” noting that the virus waned even in some nations — Taiwan, for example — that did not go into lockdown.</p>
<p>To begin with, Briggs relies on a terrible statistical argument, citing the lack of a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 deaths in a nation and its imposition of a lockdown policy. The United Kingdom imposed a lockdown yet has still had the second-highest death rate per capita of any nation. No-lockdown Taiwan, in contrast, had very few deaths. On a graph of lockdown or no lockdown versus epidemic outcome, there's no clear pattern, so Briggs thinks: "What can we conclude? Only one thing: We cannot conclude that lockdowns worked.”</p>
<p>Yes — if we only consider this kind of misguided statistical comparison. We shouldn't expect any clear correlation, because we know that lots of other factors matter besides lockdown or no lockdown, including the timing of the lockdown and the presence (or absence) of an effective public health service to carry out testing, contact tracing and quarantining of the infected.
Take timing. Of countries taking similar measures, those that acted earlier were more successful in containing the epidemic. New Zealand, instituting lockdown when it had only 102 cases, has had 22 deaths. On March 16, the U.K. had 3,000 confirmed cases yet delayed lockdown for another week. This one-week delay, a recent study in pre-print estimates, caused roughly 11,000 further, avoidable deaths. Not really surprising, as the number of infected was doubling every three to four days at the time.</p>
<p>If lockdown didn't make any difference, then why, in all the nations imposing lockdowns, did the growth rate of the epidemic soon show marked reductions? Take China, the U.S., the U.K., Spain, France, Italy — each shows the same pattern of sharp change in growth rate soon after lockdown. Is this just a weird coincidence

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Here's why: because that article that you copy and pasted is from June and so tells about 2 months of a year-long story. </p>
<p>The entire point of lockdowns, according to "the experts" was always to flatten the curve, meaning the same number of cases (and deaths), but spread out over a longer period. The reasoning behind this policy is to avoid second order effects of hospitals being "overwhelmed", (despite the fact that hospitals become "overwhelmed" every year with flu cases - apparently coronavirus overwhelm was predicted to be worse). </p>
<p>Let me be clear: the logic of lockdowns is NOT to reduce fatalities from the virus itself, but instead to mitigate second order effects. Once it became clear that the second order effects of lockdowns were worse than the second order effects of the virus, that is, in April or May of 2020, we should have discarded lockdowns as ineffective. </p>
<p>If lockdowns are effective, then why do the states in the Midwest US all show nearly identical curves, when some of them locked down and others didn't? Why is California, with a strict lockdown, now getting more cases per capita than Florida, with no lockdown AND with a MUCH older population? Why is there a POSITIVE correlation between number of days in lockdown and number of coronavirus cases? If lockdowns are so effective, we would expect this correlation to be negative. </p>
<p>Lockdowns are a drastic step. We should see a drastic improvement due to lockdowns. We don't. </p>
<p>Additionally, in June, when that article was written, compliance was still quite high. Now, 10 months into this, it is not. And that is to be expected. You can't make public policy around 100% compliance, especially when the policy involves inhumane practices like not allowing people to socialize with eachother. In fact, before lockdowns, people were already taking voluntary measures on their own, without any government interference. </p>
<p>Public health has already discarded abstinence-only sex education and "just-say-no" drug policy as ineffective. Why? Because these policies do not work at all. It is much better to inform people of the risks and allow them to make their own decisions. Harm reduction is always the best strategy, and for whatever reason we decided to not use that here. </p>
<p>One last item: that article is comparing lockdowns to doing absolutely nothing. It is NOT comparing lockdowns to voluntary focussed protection, which would have saved more lives from the virus, and avoided nearly all of the second order effects of lockdowns.</p>

        <p>There is a 30% mortality rate associated with poverty which means of that 30 million in poverty 9 million will die as a direct result.</p>
<p>That number alone crushes the covid figures.</p>

        <p>Crushes even hypothetical covid figures. Even if we take the number of (vastly overcounted) deaths at face value at 2 million, then say that the pandemic would have been 4 times as bad without lockdowns (which is again a huge stretch) it still results in 8 million total deaths. Less than 9 million as you say. </p>
<p>And, aside from ignoring that deaths are being overcounted and overestimating the impacts of lockdowns, this analysis ALSO uses a VERY low-end estimate for amount of people pushed into poverty (other estimates I've seen have been 200 million), AND ignores that the yet unborn children of these people will ALSO grow up in poverty and have lower lifespans as a result, AND ignores the (somewhat) subjective suffering that those pushed into poverty will endure in their shortened lives due to a decreased standard of living. </p>
<p>In other words, this analysis is the most favourable possible TOWARDS lockdowns, and STILL results in an objectively worse outcome. </p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, lockdowns are a dumb idea.</p>

        <p>No, the crisis of overproduction creates poverty, unemployment etc. Under the pretext of the global "pandemic" the following goals are achieved by the largest capital (all of them are aimed at overcoming a massive economic crisis, at the heart of which lies the crisis of overproduction, in other words, what we are witnessing is Great Depression 2.0 covered up with a "deadly virus"):</p>
<p>- closing down plants, factories and even whole industries (i.e. slowing down the production process in order to let old products gradually dissolve and stop the production of new ones; dealing with not only oversupply of products, resulting from incorrect distribution, but also services)</p>
<p>- downsizing workforce (because many workers are simply not needed when there is an overproduction of goods)</p>
<p>- killing off small and medium businesses in order to replace them on the market (this always happens during an economic crisis, a small capitalist gets eaten by a big one; for example, the so-called "swine flu" helps to effectively bankrupt smaller businesses, magically avoiding huge corporations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J</a> p.s. no, China is not a socialist country)</p>
<p>- cutting expenses on healthcare and education (millions of operations have been cancelled, medical staff has been getting laid off; schools and universities are switching to remote learning with plans to replace teachers with video lectures)</p>
<p>- fighting and slowing down the inevitable revolutionary uprise (protests and strikes resulting from downsizing, loss of small and medium businesses, loss of democratic rights etc) by banning social gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces and demoralizing them</p>
<p>- intensifying economic exploitation (cancelling bonuses and freezing salaries; making people work overtime under the pretext of "difficult times for us all"; not paying wages for several months etc)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- maximizing profits, making billions of dollars out of thin air by forcing millions of people to buy a product they don't need (surgical masks against a respiratory virus, sanitizers, gloves, electronic thermometers etc. The daily profit from masks alone is so gigantic that they are for sure to remain with us forever now, until people abolish them)</p>

        <p>The sad thing is our politicians fucked this up every which way with half measures.</p>
<p>You want to lockdown but you have a half ass criteria on who gets locked down, you also failed in making whoever is forced to lockdown while financially.</p>
<p>So if you’re a bar you’re forced into poverty but if you’re Applebee’s nothings changed and while you’re sitting at home the government isn’t supporting you so you’re forced to go fill out applications to Applebee’s.</p>
