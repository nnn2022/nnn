    <p><p>This isn’t the time to hate or mock people that have fallen victim to the massive amounts of noise being broadcast to them 24/7 on everything from their TV to their workplace break room wall to trucks loaded up with loudspeakers passing through their communities. These are people trying their best to protect their kids and their elderly. These are people who have had their livelihoods ruined, their businesses lost, their relationships broken and their best years of school spent in a bedroom at their parents’ home; all while being told all of it is YOUR FAULT through every outlet they engage with.</p>
<p>Of course they’re going to blame you, they’re only human and you’ve been made the perfect outlet.</p>
<p>So stop hating them back and mocking them for doing something they think will repair the hurt in their life and confirming every bit of bullshit they’ve been trained to think about you all while conveniently allowing them to direct all of their anger at you instead of at the people who lied to them.</p>
<p>Don’t you think it’s odd how Covid, a virus that requires you to go inside, not group together, and cover your face in public while staying away from each other, sprang up like it did <em>right</em> after a period of time in which the world united in solidarity like never before to protest issues around the globe? A period when more and more citizens grew tired of humans being oppressed and got vocal about it in the streets? And how after this initial break out died down and life started to go back to normal, and the world’s focus started to turn once again to the way people were being held down throughout it, we got the second wave and Delta - and a return of around-the-clock fear-mongering? How every step of this virus has been overblown, politicized, and filled with confusing and intentionally conflicting mandates? How EVERY conflicting bit of research is swept aside; how they operate with a religious fever and zeal to keep the headlines churning?</p>
<p>They don’t want you standing with your countrymen. They want you to fight about this or that while they keep you acting like crabs in a bucket skirmishing over which of their boots you get to get crushed by.</p>
<p>So if someone lashes out at you, let them. They’re acting on what they believe is valid information. Hit them with facts, studies, and numbers. Explain why you think like you do, let them see you’re just a human being making a choice regarding your own body just like them. Show them you’re not a bizarre nut job like the media tries so hard to paint you to be, you’re just an informed individual looking at the hard facts and choosing to distance yourself from something you don’t believe to be beneficial to you. And if none of that works, oh well. And if you can’t be bothered to put that sort of effort in to help your peers, just ignore them.</p>
<p>But stop allowing yourself to be used by the world governments in a game of class warfare and social control because someone disagreed with you and exercised their right to make a personal choice for themselves; the same right you are campaigning for. You’re doing nothing but strengthening the average person’s dependence on them through the destruction of the middle class and helping them silence outcry against oppression across the globe.</p>
<p>Both sides of the debate know the response to Covid has been a monetized farce at worst and a massive failure at best. It’s time the anger is directed at who actually deserves it.</p></p>

        <p>I really hate the term NPC, its a stupid idea to begin with but its only purpose is to dehumanize, aka divide people.</p>
<p>People are a product of their society and environment, so is it any surprise so many people are so messed up. And it's easier for them to live in their oblivious little bubble of reality being fed endorphins from their fast food, media, and tinder than it is for them to take a peek outside of their own reality to see what the rest of us are going through.</p>
<p>And btw, the entire idea of a NPC is fundamentally flawed because it assumes that we are living in a simulation filled with people who dont serve any real purpose. I dont believe we are living in a simulation, the holographic universe (aka everything is made up of energy), is just a consequence of how this plane of reality works. If the laws of physics did not exist, we could not exist as we are. But even if it did, it doesnt matter because anything that can think or reason, is literally the universe itself seeking awareness. Carl Sagan put it best, "The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.”</p>
<p>To understand more of what I am saying, check out something called panpsychism.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Concept<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Panpsychism holds that mind or a mind-like aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality.[1] It is also described as a theory in which "the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe".[2] Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies.[7] This notion has taken on a wide variety of forms. Some historical and non-Western panpsychists ascribe attributes such as life or spirits to all entities.[8] Contemporary academic proponents, however, hold that sentience or subjective experience is ubiquitous, while distinguishing these qualities from more complex human mental attributes.[8] They therefore ascribe a primitive form of mentality to entities at the fundamental level of physics but do not ascribe mentality to most aggregate things, such as rocks or buildings.[1][9][10]</p>
<p>Now this may sound like some fanciful bullcrap, but we see it in things like the double slit experiment. Where the fundamental act of observing something on the quantum level is enough to alter the outcome of what happens. We also see it when dna has the ability to communicate over short distances with no chemical or otherwise physical ability to do so.</p>
<p>We have been lied to about what this reality really is. It is something very special and many people take it for granted.</p>

        <p>It's an insult targeted at a certain type of person. The English language is rife with such constructs. I fail to see how labeling people as NPCs is far worse than labeling people as stupid. We can certainly agree that stupid people exist. There are people who do little to no thinking, and people who <a href="https://www.livescience.com/does-everyone-have-inner-monologue.html">literally lack inner monologues</a>. "NPC" is a term targeting those people.</p>
<p>&rt; to dehumanize, aka divide people.</p>
<p>Certainly if you label everyone who disagrees with your politics an "NPC" it's divisive, but at that point you could substitute any insult for "NPC" and it wouldn't make a difference. </p>
<p>I, however, chose that term specifically in my original comment to describe a particular group of people. My experience with this group of people are friends and acquaintances who over the years have shown complete shifts in moral and political belief almost 100% in lockstep with the popular narrative. People who when you question them or point out inconsistencies/contradictions in their logic, <em>immediately</em> turn hostile (but still have no actual rebuttal). People who can only think in preset-terms (e.g. they'll call you "alt-right" because you don't think endless lockdowns benefit society). People who talk about "The Science" as if it were a deity, without understanding what the scientific method is, etc.</p>

        <p>This is a really important distinction. Not everyone who wears a mask or gets the vaccine is in favor of forcing them on everyone. A lot of people still think it should be a personal choice so don't assume that they are against you.</p>
<p>I got the vaccine because my girlfriend lives in another country with a strict lockdown that at one point was considering letting vaccinated foreign tourists enter their borders for the first time in over a year. I'm desperate to find a way to see her so getting the vaccine will be worth the risk if it brings us together sooner.</p>
<p>That was my choice. I think that you should have the freedom to choose whether or not to get it too and will respect whatever you decide. Above all else, I'm extremely concerned with the US government deciding what is "misinformation" and working with all the biggest communication platforms to silence and punish people for saying things that they don't like. That is the aspect of the "new normal" that scares me the most.</p>

        <p>What are the actual death rates of those unvaccinated in hospitals? I’m having a hard time finding any actual numbers and whether or not it’s much higher than previously.</p>
<p>Also, I’d get a rabies shot. Cause the chances of surviving rabies without medical intervention is 0%. </p>
<p>The chances of dying from COVID for someone my age with no pre existing conditions is 0.1% and hospitalization risk is 1.9% according to this handy dandy risk calculator.</p>
<p>https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator</p>
<p>Can’t exactly compare that to rabies now can you?</p>

        <p>Hey, I was one of them until some point in 2020. I never tried to coerce or shun anyone, but I didn't like the complaining because I optimistically thought if we just followed the mandates "like other countries," it would be over for good. Then it became clear how wrong that was and how much more harm those measures did.</p>

        <p>Oh ok. I didn’t specify previously but my rage was directed towards the more nazi minded individuals who’d like to force this upon the unvaccinated and or make them suffer. But basically yes that’s what I was previously suggesting. I talked to a couple folks on here who helped set me straight and gave me some better understanding about not directing my hate towards my common man and also ways we could all possibly unify. So I apologize for my previous comments. That was wrong of me.</p>

        <p>It took me until 2021 to figure it out, to my shame. I'm stunned it took me that long when I look back now. </p>
<p>But I'm way more surprised that most people have got to 17 months deep into the scamdemic and not realised, or don't care about, what is happening.</p>
<p>I'd accept anyone who wakes up and sees the truth now, but I really struggle to ever understand those who agree with vaxxed only events and vax passports. That is something I might be able to forgive, maybe, but will never be forgotten. </p>
<p>Even when I was convinced I was being good citizen by wearing a mask in 2020, I still didn't give a fuck if someone wasn't wearing one. People, in general, need to just mind their own business and forget about everyone else. The world is so judgemental now.</p>

        <p>This was a great exchange.</p>
<p>As for how to bring people together, I recommend continuing to argue against them in an intelligent fashion, or if you can't, getting others who are more articulate to do so, with the understanding that curing indoctrination takes years or even decades. The real problem here is that they are smugly convinced of their superiority, and lack the life experience and the intelligence to see the flaws in their own ability to reason, which makes them overconfident. Confidence will degrade over the years if actually good arguments are thrown against them all the time, which is why I recommend arguing about the underlying philosophy of the ideas rather than the current science claims.</p>

        <p>I think that failure extend an olive branch is what lead to the Nazis in the first place. Everyone one else in Europe was ready to shit all over Germany after WW1, and it directly lead to WW2. Hate breeds hate. If people here are right and those getting the vaccines have a bumpy road ahead with ADE and other adverse reactions, laughing at them or taking pleasure in their suffering is only going to make them hate you all the more, and eventually it only ends in violence. At some point someone has to say enough is enough and break the cycle of hatred. I will fight these vaccine mandates till the end, but I am not going to my let the system inject me with hatred for neighbor any more than I will let them inject him with me experimental drugs. I can oppose someone without hating them. Just like a soldier could see the necessity of war, but not hate the enemy combatant.</p>

        <p>When trying to empathize with them, I'd recommend starting from the position that government isn't a threat, or if it is other parts of government can stop the "bad" part of government. That's the only way you can reach the conclusion these folks are reaching.</p>
<p>Well, you are correct. If you cannot put yourself in their shoes, that means you can't empathize. I hope one day you can, for your own sake. That kind of view is poison to the soul.</p>

        <p>How can one put oneself into those "shoes" though?  </p>
<p>Anyone who has reached adulthood without realizing that government is ALL bad is incredibly foolish. I can no more empathize with them than I could someone about to jump off a cliff thinking that they'll be able to fly.</p>

        <p>Question: Can you empathize with a person that has schizophrenia? That hears voices and sees things that aren't there?</p>
<p>I assert that you can. Or, well, maybe YOU can't, but that plenty of people can. But you still stop them from jumping off the cliff.</p>

        <p>No. I can have sympathy for them for having that malady, but I cannot understand what it feels like (empathy) to be a schizophrenic. And my sympathy imparts no mercy if their personal issue causes them to infringe upon my freedom.</p>

        <p>Hindsight is 20/20. Do you genuinely think if those people realized they were the baddies, they'd keep supporting the party? Hitler became more tyrannical with time, he didn't come right out with that message. </p>

        <p>Probably not but by the time they’d even realize it’d be to late. The deeds of evil will have already been done and their hands will be soiled with that darkness.</p>
<p>Well it’s a good thing I’m just speaking my mind online rather than physically dealing with this. Realistically I would prefer to segregate myself from them so I wouldn’t have to show my hostility or contempt. Currently I’m not mentally mature enough to get over this shit. Maybe in time I can.

        <p>I've been there too, It's okay to take a break for awhile. I'm certainly not perfect either, I've had my fair share of emotionally charged tiffs with people online. It really grinds my gears to be called a Republican or an antivaxxer, mainly because it's that annoying tribalist mentality. "You don't think exactly like I do, so you must be one of THEM!"</p>
<p>I can tell you though, if you look far enough back through my comment history you will see where I have countered opposing views in a level headed manner. I dont know if I fully changed their minds but I definitely did plant the seed by countering with facts instead of emotionally charged hostility. I always try to provide links so they can read the same thing I did and decide for themselves. I'm just saying, fighting fire with fire doesn't work, try water instead.</p>

        <p>&rt;I've been there too, It's okay to take a break for awhile.</p>
<p>Three days of backpacking in the High Chisos, with no data signal, just the amazing South Rim and canyon views, turned out to be a pretty good mental reset for me last month, and stopping on the way back in Ozona TX and not seeing a single mask worn anywhere, antisocial floor markers almost completely worn away and not replaced, plexiglass shields removed, etc. helped to see that things really were still pretty darn normal in some places.</p>
<p>Once you pass the Basin Loop trail turnoff, nobody's hiking masked.  It's a 12 mile loop from the Basin at 5,000 feet to the South Rim at 7,400 feet, so even though I met at least a dozen people up there on one of the hottest days of the year, the only masks I saw were one couple who had them looped onto their pack straps just in case.</p>

So basically if history has you as the good guys then be proud? Our society believes in nothing anymore and it’s super depressing. Have some standards and basic operating procedure for how you treat people at all times and in all situations, goodness.</p>

        <p>No, I just mean in the instance of Nazis. I’m sure all of them would’ve chosen the other side if they knew they would lose but forget that. Wouldn’t make them any better. If you ever think there is a good reason to march people to camps, dehumanize, starve, take their means of self defense and providing for themselves and their family then you don’t have my sympathy when you realize you’re wrong. Unless that person is actually physically trying to kill you, you have no right to do such things.</p>
<p>I still believe there is room for forgiveness and hating people isn’t good regardless (that’s what leads to the heinous acts in the first place). I’m just saying there is no sympathy to be had from me for your thought process when you chose to be a part of that. Only forgiving and moving forward at that point</p>

        <p>It's fine to feel that way. In a way I kind of relate this to religion. Religious people are so sure their way of thinking is the correct way and everyone else is wrong. They are absolutely sure their god is the only god, but how can they KNOW? The truth is, everybody here thinks we are on the right side of history right now, but what if in a hundred years humanity knows we were wrong? </p>
<p>I'm not saying the Nazi party deserves forgiveness, I'm saying it was made up of individuals. I'm sure there were bad apples, truly vile degenerates like Hitler himself, and Josef Mengele. I think if I had been alive during that time in Germany, I'd have felt like I didn't have any other choice. People were forced into the army, people were forced to support the party. It's easy for us to sit here now and think "that never would have been me", but there's no real way of knowing that. If you have a wife and 5 kids to feed, are you joining Hitler's army or are you gonna let them kill you? What happens to your family if you die?</p>
<p>Do you feel where I'm coming from? Thankfully this isn't WWII Germany and the government isn't threatening to kill us if we don't comply. A more fair comparison would be the propaganda they had back then vs now. I don't know if you're from the US like I am, but it took me until I was almost 30 to realize we are the baddies, and I didn't realize it until I made international friends who painted a portrait of the county from an outsider's perspective. In other words, for most of my life I fell victim to the nationalist propaganda, just as so many are falling victim to the pro-lockdown/pro-vaccine propaganda. Are they bad people, or are they victims of a bad government? </p>
<p>I'm really interested to hear your (and anyone else's) thoughts.</p>

        <p>I think we completely misunderstand each other lol. I think faith is a good thing. I think Nazis are deserving of forgiveness but not my sympathy for their reasoning in marching millions to their deaths. That’s basically what I’m saying. I think our society at large believes in nothing which means as soon as there is a perceived threat, they are quick to shun people for non compliance. They have no standards or rules to live by. Whatever they think is good in the moment is what goes. Even if that’s stripping freedoms from otherwise peaceful people.</p>

        <p>I think the misunderstanding is that I'm differentiating between the Nazi party and the individual participants. What the party did was reprehensible but people are largely powerless. </p>
<p>I dont know if it's that our society believes in nothing, I think that the sacrifices previous generations made have made our lives super easy. We largely dont have to worry about war anymore, or food scarcity, or shelter. People back then didn't have time to worry about gender identity or pronouns and shit when they didn't know how they were gonna feed their kids or if they'd make it out of war alive to even see their kids. I think a lot of the problem today is our lack of problems. Similar to how plants need the wind to make them grow strong, we as a society aren't facing enough adversity and it shows.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on a lot there. And I was by no means saying all Germans were nazis and I’m sure some acted out of fear for their families.</p>
<p>We have gotten way too comfortable. But I also think people just don’t believe in anything by and large. People are so unsure and confused. Open mindedness can be good but I think if you are completely “open minded” then you really have never decided on anything, you don’t know what you believe</p>

        <p>Yeah I feel you. It's ironic that we live in the information age, yet it's so difficult to know what to believe. Something I personally struggle with is I want to hear and read everything that big tech censors. I think I'm on the right side of history, I think they're the bad actors here. But what if the scientists and doctors they're censoring truly are heretics? Whatever happened to unbiased journalism and the scientific process? In this day and age, none of this should be up for debate. It should be cut and dry, if you propose a hypothesis and you're proven wrong then we carry on with life. We should be rapidly advancing in science and medicine, as interconnected as we are globally, yet we can't even get a relatively safe contagion under control.</p>

        <p>I agree that government has too much power, but the reason they have too much power is because fools keep voting for people who will expand it because rather than take personal responsibility for their own lives they insist that someone "help" those in need. By the way, this issue affects both sides. People need to stop supporting ANY new legislation. Just stop. Enough with government "help" already. Does that mean some people won't make it? Sure does. However, with government help many still won't make it and those who do will have the added detraction of government overreach to fight against.</p>

        <p>Oh for sure. We need term limits for everyone and they shouldn't be able to run a deficit. I personally feel taxes are theft and the government should have to crowd fund for projects. Would stop a lot of the corruption. They'd be forced to clean up all the social welfare programs and be far more selective. I agree, if most of the people out there had to make it on their own, they'd find a way. Some still wouldn't, but we have charities.</p>

        <p>True, but there's enough people out there that would regularly put money in to fund social programs. It should definitely be a choice. I wouldn't have a problem with that, if they're choosing to freely give their money to the government who then gives it to those in need. That's really none of my business as long as they're not taking my money for it.</p>

        <p>&rt;Then for the rest of your life, you are going to live in a country where you hate 50% of the population. You only get one life, do you want to live it like that?</p>
<p>Do the math. Those supporting these authoritarian, discriminatory measures are clearly happy to, and it’s not like those opposed can have their own country somewhere away from them, so basically there’s no choice in the matter. Wherever you are, vaxxed or not, you will either live in a country where half the people hate you, or die.</p>
<p>Another choice’s that’s a breeze.</p>
<p>The world has been polarised over this issue and the only fixing this split is to end the hate campaign against the unvaccinated, as <strong>there’s no hate campaign against the vaccinated and  has never been.</strong> The unvaccinated aren’t the ones that need to put down arms.</p>

        <p>True but if you take the wrong approach, any attempt to change their minds will be met with them double downing. If you truly want to make a difference, you have to understand the psychology behind what makes a person brainwashed and act accordingly to reverse it's effects. Though I will admit that for most people, especially when talking to strangers on the internet, that might seem like an impossible task.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to "change minds" any longer. That takes too long, and we're running out of time. If it's a war they want, I say let it start TODAY! When the smoke clears and they capitulate to unconditional surrender, then and only then can we begin a conversation again.</p>

        <p>I've shown people how most of the deaths are people 90+ on government graphs, I've pointed out no other vaccine requires others to be vaccinated, that we don't know long term effects, etc etc.</p>
<p>But the people who have reached this stage <em>still</em> thinking we're in a deadly pandemic, are too far gone to get back. They ignore your facts. Literally don't even consider them for a second and what they mean.</p>
<p>I have convinced a handful of irl people and I'm proud of that. But I make no attempt anymore. I think because most people now, in my country, have had the vax, they don't want to even consider they made a hasty and awful decision. Much easier to ignore the truth. Meh.</p>

        <p>I have no interest in being friends with anyone who is dumb enough to be tricked into Leftist/Socialist/Communist ideals. We would have nothing in common. There are indeed higher ideals than what is available in this world. However, we aren't talking about Heaven here. We're talking about this world, here and now. The best way to defeat your enemy here is to use any means possible to destroy them. If during the course of the battel they realize they were wrong and earnestly seek reconciliation and mercy they shall have it. If not then it's unlikely we'll be going to the same place after we die anyway.</p>

        <p>I’ll remember this when they randomly assault people they don’t agree with, murder old people in the middle of the street, burn entire neighborhoods down, and take bike locks to our heads because they’ve been made to think we’re the evil that needs to be defeated. We cannot be friends with people who want us dead because they’re being told we’re evil. Until we can push propaganda from our side as well as their side can, we don’t have a chance at changing their minds about us, and that won’t stop the government or the courts from shitting on us. We can’t hug our way out of this.</p>
<p>The moral: STOP SYMPATHIZING WITH PEOPLE WHO THINK YOU ARE EVIL AND WANT TO KILL YOU. DON’T GIVE THEM MONEY. DON’T GIVE THEM YOUR SYMPATHY. THEY WILL EXPLOIT IT AND USE IT TO KILL YOU.</p>

        <p>So how do you suppose we change their minds? Is <strong>your</strong> mind changed when they try to bully and mock <strong>you</strong>? So why do you think more division and contempt from our end will make people come around? You're only feeding your own sense of righteousness by lashing out, just like their vitriol is feeding theirs.</p>
<p>Us responding with more hostility will only make things worse, you'll only add fuel to their contempt and to the divide as a whole.</p>
<p>This mindset of hostility being justified is either that of someone vengeful, or someone who's <strong>deliberately</strong> is trying to sow division.</p>

        <p>It's too late for that, and it's been too late for at least several years now. Society is dividing along political lines and you aren't going to do anything to stop it, not without dismantling entire industries and technologies even that promote division. </p>

<p>Never. You'll see in the coming weeks/months that the anti-unvaccinated narrative will ramp up from the media. Dont feed into that by sounding like an extremist. You'll hand them the division on a platter.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear what you think the road to a sensible solution to all this looks like that includes us acting like the extremists they try to portray us as.</p>

        <p>The solution *would* be a blanket ban on social media for all people and editorialized/opinionated content by major media outlets. That's not going to happen though. </p>
<p>We'll continue to spiral further into mass hysteria b/c people aren't meant to interact with others in the way that we do now through technology and especially the kind of narcissistic platforms provided by facebook and twitter. It inevitably produces division and that division is taken advantage of by a governing class that picks and chooses sides depending on what benefits them. Barring the recognition of social media as a public health crisis there is nothing we can do. Laying down and playing dead will not work b/c people on social media aren't reacting to you or me, they're reacting to a strawman created by other users and by the media.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, and that's all well and good, but once social media is banned, and you start to interact with neighbors, friends, and co-workers in person. Do you belittle and bully them, or do you show them compassion and try to win them over?</p>

<p>I'm on the opposite side of this debate as you, and I have been trying to convince my side of the same thing, with not much success. Peoples' beliefs about covid (and reality in general) are going to shape how they see the other side.</p>
<p>If you believe the experts and think that the only thing keeping us from getting back to normal are the dipshits that won't get vaccinated, it's really hard not to lash out at those people. On the other hand, if you think covid is just an overblown flu and authorities are using it as a means of control, it is understandable why you don't want to kowtow to their demands, and see the other side as bullies.</p>

        <p>This sounds great, it really does. In a perfect world, this would be the game plan.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as soon as the unvax'd started getting blamed, as soon as the media called for social ostracization, and as soon as the media decided unvax'd shouldn't use public stores and concert venues, a stance was taken. </p>
<p>I agree not to stoop to their level, but I also believe in boundaries. I am no outlet for the outrage of foolish sheep. I will maintain the truth and speak that truth with respect. </p>

        <p>No seriously, you think this is about masks and anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p>In reality it's about the government and the ultra rich and powerful's attempt to gain mass control. They're testing the waters and they're finding them very nice. Why do you think masks are to be reimposed on the fully vaccinated?</p>
<p>It's always been about control. It's a shame that you can't see that. Ask yourself, who became richer during this? Who did it benefit?</p>

        <p>I definitely agree with you.  I don't advocate violence but I certainly advocate standing up for oneself and self-defense.  It's pretty clear what will happen to us if online posts are any indication, and even mainstream media calls for harsh punishments for us. High stakes indeed.</p>

        <p>No.  I have no compassion or sympathy.  Here's a blackpill for you.  You know that school board that just voted to mandate masks for another 3 years in your kid's district?  Your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members voted for those people.  How about that governor that just arbitrarily decided to close small businesses because a few fat old people might get the sniffles?  Your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members voted for him.  That president that just issued an Executive Order asking social media companies to spy on "extremists" who spread "misinformation"?  Your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members voted for him.</p>
<p>Your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members ARE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBEM.  They aren't just a bunch of dumb rubes Mr. Magooing their way through life, accidentally voting for egomaniacs and psychopaths an criminals again and again and again.  They do these things ON PURPOSE and REPEATEDLY.  They know what they're doing and they know who they're voting for.</p>
<p>It's the same with COVID.  They CHEER as the area's small businesses are destroyed.  They applaud as children are scarred for life by THEIR OWN fearmongering.  They cream themselves over the prospect of another lockdown.  Get this through your head.  Your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members ARE THE PROBLEM.  All the bad school boards, tyrannical governors, all the psychotic bureaucrats who rule by fiat, they don't happen in a vacuum.  They happen because your friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family members voted for those people, or for the people who appoint them.</p>

        <p>Fucking hell this is such a concise and brilliant explanation that had never crossed my mind before! I tip my hat to you. Even though I’ve never wanted to admit this and tried so hard to give people the benefit of the doubt you’re absolutely right. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether they’ve been brainwashed by propaganda or not, they choose to proceed with their actions and decisions entirely of their own volition. Many of them elect to ignore their instinct telling them otherwise. It’s detestable and is what makes this a complex barrier we’re facing. </p>

        <p>They either know it, or if they don't they've been recklessly irresponsible by voting while being willingly blind.  </p>
<p>Yes there has been an incredible effort to deceive lie to and coerce people into their frankly insane worldview. I genuinely do not understand how someone who is informed could have voted for the likes of Biden.  So if they have been tuning in, I can only understand they are either willfully self deceived or knowingly complicit in all of the things Biden has done, both before and after he won the presidency.   And if they've not been tuning in they're guilty of voting without knowing what their voting for.  </p>
<p>That said I still think kindness and reasonable respect is more effective at convincing the convincible, and that stooping to the worst leftists level of name calling verbal abuse etc. Is no help at all. But that said, as someone who has long shared the op's opinion, I am at the point where anyone who's not willing to engage in a reasonable discussion... I understand the absolute ire.  The s*** that they are allowing to go on is deadly. In no uncertain terms. And at this point I refuse to be treated like I am not a rational being with reasonable objections and concerns.  Like they have the right to coerce me at gunpoint through government.  In fact to treat me I am less than human. </p>
<p>And I am genuinely feeling like I should be done being polite about it.</p>

        <p>Let me ask you this.  In your opinion at what point are people responsible for their decisions?</p>
<p>I'll put it this way.  Let's say there's a company that is looking for a worker.  The HR department interviews a candidate and hires them.  The new employee steals from the company, lies to customers, and is terrible at their job.  HR not only doesn't fire them but promotes them.  HR then hires another employee that also steals from the company, lies to customers, and is terrible at their job.  Again, HR doesn't fire the employee, and instead promotes them.  </p>
<p>In your opinion, at what point is HR the problem?  Up to a point, HR can sometimes make a mistake and hire a bad employee.  No big deal.  Learn from it, correct the error, by firing the bad employee, and hire a better one.  But HR keeps making the same mistake again and again.  They keep hiring the same kinds of employees that steal from the company, lie to customers, and are terrible at their jobs.  Time and again they not only don't learn from their mistakes, but keep making them.  The only conclusion that you can reasonably draw, then, is that HR hiring terrible employees is a feature of HR, and not a bug.  HR, then, is the problem, not the bad employees.  Yes, the bad employees are bad employees.  But the real root of the problem is HR, right?</p>

        <p>Yes, HR would be the problem in that case. However, this is not applicable to the voting scenario due to the dissimilarities between employment and voting. Specifically, voting is decentralized power, while Human Resources is centralized power.</p>
<p>The equivalent comparison would be if every employee in the company was HR in addition to their other jobs, with no extra pay, and they also could abstain from HR decisions, and whether or not they rule in favor or against or not at all is not recorded, and there is no way to fire them for making bad HR decisions so they can just hire and promote thieves without direct consequences to them.</p>

<p>There are those who vaccinate but hate it. There are those who do it because of their deepest conviction but they <em>never ever</em> would force another human being to do it, because they know that they in turn don't want something else.  </p>

        <p>&rt; I agree but they are not one giant block.</p>
<p>I'm not interested in the people who do what they want and leave everyone else alone.  I'm interested in the people actively hoping and praying that I am permanently segregated out of society because I won't ever get a Fauci Ouchi.  I don't really care if they're brainwashed, or just scared for grandma, or if they are actively looking to use this as an opportunity to marginalize groups they hate.  The effect is the same.  They're all lined up shoulder to shoulder against me.  They are the problem, every one of them.  Their rationale for being a problem is not relevant.  </p>
<p>Let me put it this way.  Say you are out on a hike in a local park.  A bear appears on the trail and threatens you.  Does it really matter why the bear is threatening you?  Does it matter if it's scavenging for food and is hungry?  Does it matter if there are cubs nearby?  Does it matter if it's just an aggressive bear?  No, it doesn't matter because the result is the same.  You pull your bear spray and blast it in the eyes.  If that doesn't' stop it you pull out your .45 and blow the bear away.  It doesn't matter <em>why</em> the ear is trying to kill you, all that matters is that <em>it is trying to kill you</em>.  </p>
<p>So again, I really don't care what excuse you can come up with as to why these people won't leave me alone.  I don't care at all.  All I know is that these people want me to inject myself with an untested experimental drug post haste or else become a second-class citizen in my own country, all because of a fucking cold.  These people, either by accident or on purpose, are a real an present danger to my rights and the rights of everyone like me.  It's really that simple.</p>

        <p>It DOES matter, actually, but not in the way people seem to think. You still blast the bear with the bear spray, but you DON'T consider it to be a monster for being hungry. You can defend yourself AND still recognize that bears will be bears.</p>
<p>The point also is not to excuse the bear for its actions. Understanding =/= Approval. You can understand and also hate at the same time, just as you can understand and love at the same time. It's the difference between macing the bear until it is down, and macing the bear until it's down and then shooting it even though it's down.</p>
<p>Defend yourself first, but don't become a monster while doing it. These are tragically uninformed humans with a great deal of hubris. Think of them like tyrannical toddlers with too much power.</p>

        <p>That they voted for things is just evidence of ignorance, not malice. Ask the same people why they voted for this person or that, and listen to the answer. I strongly doubt it will be malice in most cases. This is the problem with democracy more than anything else.</p>
<p>Also, I'm skeptical that the votes have been being administrated properly, too. That's why I support the audit movement. Reliable data from the best pollster in the business, Richard Baris, shows that Americans are more in alignment than not on most major issues, between 62% and 85% agreement between voters on "kitchen table" issues.</p>
<p>I think the narratives are manufactured fearmongering designed to reduce the level that the people are united so the politicians don't have to work and can keep robbing the taxpayer.</p>

        <p>Guess I must be too stupid, then. I do not see how you can refuse to tolerate people and also still be around them and also not change them to make the intolerable behavior go away. The only way any of that gels is if by "refuse to tolerate" you mean "argue and push back against", but that isn't what refusing to tolerate means. Tolerating means refusing to prohibit or interfere with something, so linguistically...I'm not seeing any other interpretations.</p>

<p>As for your response, you've actually illustrated my point quite well. "leave me the fuck alone" IS an example of being tolerant. When you go past "leave me the fuck alone" and instead go to "you must change" or "you can't be near me", THAT is when you are not tolerant. By definition.</p>

        <p>The fact that you still think "hitting them with facts" will do anything other then get death wished upon you, shows how much undo credit you're giving them. It's been a year and a half. They are literally screaming for passports and for us to be put into camps. I don't like to give up on people but if we have to move forward without them then so be it. Honestly, if you would spew the level of hate that many of them have then you were never actually a good person. I don't care how much shit you went through. I have been through more hard times, seen horrific shit, and have enough ptsd for 10 lifetimes, but I can proudly say that I never let myself become like that. I never wished death upon people for just existing. So are they really the poor victims of media brainwashing abuse, or are they just shitty people? Im inclined to think the latter.</p>

        <p>It's both. They are trained to support the popular narrative and to do so with high energy. But they also have been brainwashed into it. The problem is that people are expecting to undo decades of brainwashing with days of talking. That ain't gonna happen.

        <p>No, it’s not a choice. They just haven’t been privy or exposed to the info we have. Why play into the corporati agenda and focus your enmity on your neighbors, friends, family, coworkers who have been duped, conned, brainwashed and programmed to believe what they believe. They’re more victim than not. Anyway, you’re just furthering the corporati agenda by blaming and attacking and hating on them. Time to focus on how to stand together, work together, to end this.</p>

        <p>People aren't logical. We tend to pick a narrative, some outlets for information, and stick to them. Everybody does this, and believing something that is radically different, or the opposite, of what you believe isn't something that happens very often. To a certain extent, you have to have faith in your information outlets, and faith isn't dependent upon logic. </p>
<p>And with the mRNA vaccine, the only way to remove any aspect of faith or trust is if you get your hands on the tools required to make mRNA yourself and had the resources to run tests on mRNA in human cells-- a difficult proposition for most people. </p>
<p>The point is,  people have to choose what they believe based on guesses, and there seems to be a trend of people split 50-50 when we have to guess on something (about half the population is vaccinated, half vote republican/democrat, etc).</p>

        <p>You push back with facts, standing your ground, and an educated reply that firmly states you will not be a part of what is going on. You don’t comply but you give your reasons why.</p>
<p>Straight up hateful speech where you wish ill on them for thinking diffident or believing in something else or just insulting them isn’t pushing back. It’s further alienating yourself from them and just using all of this as an excuse to be spiteful against humans around you.</p>

        <p>What you say is true. We are not dealing with logical decision making, but a fearful reaction. 
If we want to win people over to the truth, they must understand that we don't hate them. And we do care about them.</p>

        <p>I have really struggled with this lately, I know it’s wrong. I used to be so compassionate just a year ago, I prided myself on my ability to sympathize with people’s differences, to understand that we all see the world differently because of such different experiences and lives, and that’s a beautiful thing. However, over the last few months I am really finding it more and more difficult to find compassion for these “lost souls”. At the beginning of the pandemic, sure, no one really knew what was true and if this was a real threat. But at this point in time, with SO much evidence available in plain sight, one just needs to exercise BASIC BARE MINIMUM common sense in order to see what is happening. And if you STILL buy into this bullshit, I’m sorry but my level of respect towards your intelligence has completely dropped. I’m happy to discuss rational facts and help awaken those around me, but when they completely refuse and say things like “you and your numbers and science” and just simply refuse to think about the truth because it “gives them anxiety”, I can no longer sympathize. Wouldn’t you WANT to know more? Aren’t you curious about what you’re putting in your body? Don’t you want to stay informed? In my mind, with everything going on, everyone needs to MAKE it their job to be informed of what’s really going on. And if you simply refuse because it’s too much effort for you, then that’s a level of stupidity I cannot take, nor can I let it take me down with it.</p>

        <p>One thing that helps is to accept that the person you are talking to is probably beyond being saved. You're not talking to them calmly for them. You're talking to them so that the people who come through and read the comments see a conversation between a bully and a calm person, and they're more likely to want to side with the calm person.</p>

        <p>I meant more so people in real life I come across, not online. Like people that I have to work with, or people that used to be my friends, people I care about. And new people that I meet - I hate bringing up covid when I’m meeting a new person, because I know that as soon as I find out they pray to the vaccine gods, I know I won’t be able to maintain a proper relationship with them. THAT’s been particularly tough to swallow.</p>

        <p>Honest question, but have you ever given a second thought to the fact that everyone you know/trust/love/work with is concerned about your POV?

        <p>Hmm that’s a fair question. In my experience it’s not so much me that pulls away, it’s usually as soon as the other side hears my opinion, they kind of shut down and then cut off contact with me. I think anyone that truly cares about you should be able to calmly and rationally discuss both sides, and should not force their medical views onto you and your body. But I’ve only met a rare few people that are willing to actually have calm discussions and debates about both sides. So to me it’s not “care” if you hear that as of this time I’m choosing not to get the shot because I’ve rationally done a risk-benefit assessment for myself, and because of that you call me an idiot and then never speak to me again… I have a rare handful of friends that have gotten the shot, that also 100% respect my personal decision not to at this time, and that’s great. That’s compassion and care. Honestly to me the big fight is not about the shot. It’s about having the freedom of choice, which is quickly being taken away and dividing people like never before :( 
Hope that makes sense and thank you for asking.</p>

        <p>I am nice and polite to the one or two people I know who share your mindset, but I’m still concerned about them because I care about their wellbeing. There’s also an important difference between “I’m waiting for full FDA authorization” (which I can understand) and folks who get sucked some very bizarre rabbit hole</p>

        <p>Sorry, I'm out of patience with the true believers out there. No point in being polite to the people who seriously accuse me of murderous intent. </p>
<p>To the few who are genuinely on the fence and want to have a real discussion, I'll never be anything but courteous and respectful. But at this point, if you've "fallen victim" to manipulation, it's your own doggone fault.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this. Compassion over this is tough, forgiveness is tough, but we have to be the example. We can't afford to become hateful otherwise we'll become just as authoritarian. We can't hate our way to success. Yes, we must defend ourselves, but we must see the common humanity. Most people are inherently good, just easy to manipulate, and in fact it's their goodness that has been manipulated.</p>

        <p>People are not mostly inherently good. It seems roughly a fifth to a quarter of people are default good, roughly the same number are default evil, and the rest of society are somewhere in between. Each individual person basically has a "starting point" on the scale between good and evil and has a distance they can be influence to go toward the side of good or evil. People that are plodding and difficult to change move less on this scale, people that are reactive and mutable can change more, and life experience molds you by a lot too. Life experience also molds you in each direction, so it is important to teach good morals to people growing up. Some few people will wind up good no matter how evil the society, and some few people will wind up evil no matter how good the society, but the MAJORITY will largely reflect the society.</p>

<p>Also, you've misunderstood the point of the post. The OP isn't advocating for standing down, they are advocating for not dehumanizing others. You can simultaneously see your opponents as humans and also directly oppose the evil things they might do.</p>

        <p>Again, it's the tactic that historically have been proven to be ineffective. You can't compete with psyops taping into primal side of humanity - disgust, sadism, struggle for status, desire to be tribal etc. It's not like you can debate your way out of someone thinking you're evil - not when they're simultaneously getting off on their self perceived moral superiority, and especially not when they'd already formed a mob. Feelings don't care about facts, so what is needed to be done is to take advantage of same sociosychological hacks the opposite side is employing in their actions to sway the public. Mock, ostracize, poke fun at, expose doublethink, talk shit, object and abject - do everything you can except being physically violent. If people were rational beings we wouldn't have phenomena like sunk cost fallacy.</p>

        <p>People that use your methods alienate a lot of people that would otherwise be on their side. The problem with this is of course that argumentation does use emotion, and it also uses authority. The essential components of argumentation are ethos, pathos, and logos. The actual truth is that persuasion uses all three elements, and they are most effective when mixed, and that persuasion also consists of giving people what they actually want, which includes having respect for them. You won't get anywhere unless you employ all four. The methods you propose include only two, maybe three.</p>
<p>You might be able to convince sleepers and sheep with your methods. But you won't convince the most important people that you need on your side: Those with functioning brains and individual, skeptical natures. The kind of people that carry a movement. And the very people you risk alienating with your de-emphasis on respect.</p>
<p>I would advise you to use everything you've just stated, PLUS well-reasoned arguments, PLUS respectfulness and understanding, and vary approaches with individuals between all of these methods. You will have a lot more success at that than you would at attempting a psyop of your own.</p>

        <p>No. These are the people who gave those in power the ability to fuck everything up. If the past 20 years have taught us anything, it's that trying to sit down at the table, reason with and solve things with words alone has gotten us nowhere. They want to see you and your family dead in the gutter and they think it's funny. Show them no compassion.</p>

        <p>We see &amp; expose the other side’s ideology of hate &amp; intolerance every day, &amp; nobody bats an eye.  Meanwhile I’m called every name under the sun, with no evidence, &amp; it’s taken at face value &amp; never questioned. If they want to paint me as a monster, I’m not going to fight it any longer. Self-fulfilling prophecies &amp; all that…  I just don’t care anymore. They have dehumanized me so much that I don’t care how they see me.  Once you reach that point, where society has ostracized you completely, you don’t have much to lose.</p>

        <p>This, right here, is precisely why I want to take the better path. Because imagine the roles reversing on some other issue, later, and I am beating down someone on the other side, and the other side starts to feel marginalized in the same way, and imagine all social pressures mounting against them, and I've hammered away at them day after day until they feel as you do. What happens to that person?</p>
<p>I'm sad that you have suffered this way. I truly hope they can stop demonizing people, and will do everything I can to stop the tide of tyranny.</p>

<p>My dude. There are between 30K and 3M people that are truly radical at MOST (depending on what definition you use), and it is DECREASING over time. You are being misled by their propaganda.</p>

        <p>You are right, your anecdotes and my statistics have no relation, and its a totally separate conversation.</p>
<p>My response to your particular situation is: If someone is directly acting upon you and yours and threatening your life and livelihood, shoot them. That's what self defense is for. When things become violent, use violence, and otherwise use reason.</p>

        <p>"bAcK tHe BlUe" and other platitudes.</p>
<p>Should we support cops not caring someone broke into your house if it's "only" a couple thousand dollars' worth they stole, or the cop arresting you for "hate speech" online, or the one that arrests a pastor for holding service during lockdown, or the one beating up grandpa for not wearing a mask at a supermarket?</p>
<p>You get it. Most don't.</p>
<p>American conservatism, and, frankly, the whole of Western civilization has been plagued with Marxism, neoliberalism, nihilism, etc. People are weak, amoral at best if not downright immoral. They'd let the worst obscenities go unimpeded as long as it's "in the privacy of your own home".</p>
<p>Protip: the reason why it went from homosexuality being taboo like 3 decades ago to a majority of Republican voters being cool with gay marriage as of this year is because most are sorry excuses that don't want to rustle any feathers and would rather let the world burn than take a stance. What's more, they're delusional enough to think their apathy and cowardice is actually a moral stance (aka "I'll die for your right to disagree with me" and all that libertarian BS).</p>

        <p>Exactly. The SS consisted of people that once were innocent children and were tricked by the nazi regime into their shitty ideology. They still loaded jews on trains to mercilessly butcher them later. If anyone is stupid enough to believe that his family, friends and neighbours would not happily load him on a train after being conditioned to hate him for some more time, he is an idiot. Not saying ALL of them are going to do this. But once shit gets real it only takes one. Dont think your beer-buddy wont gas you smiling, when he believes you are a lethal danger to his dear old granny.</p>

<p>You're doing it for the people who are reading through the comments. They're seeing some jerk hurling insults while ignoring evidence and reason. You're making sure the other person they see is not being a jerk and is providing evidence and reason.</p>

        <p>Whilst I can certainly appreciate your sentiments, I think the time for this might have passed? My life has been severely impacted by all this, my company that I have helped build up over more than a decade is in danger right now  so to be frank, it's hard for me to have much sympathy for these people . Their compliance is driving this clusterfuck, isn't it??Of course dividing people has always been a way to cause problems, since the dawn of time, and whilst I can feel a little sympathy for folks who genuinely are terrified about all this, it's only an iota of sympathy at this point in the game . In the beginning, when no one, well, almost no one knew what was going on, I could possibly understand them more... but not now, nearly a year and a half later. No.  I can't . Being nice and understanding clearly isn't working??</p>

        <p>The OP isn't advocating for being nice and understanding by itself. You can both be understanding of others and still vehemently oppose the evil acts of others. Just because I understand why a bully is punching me in the face, because they had a shitty home life and were beaten by their dad, doesn't mean I don't break the bully's arm to get them off me and make them stop. It also doesn't mean I don't then call them an ambulance and make sure they will be OK. It is a common misconception that empathetic understanding and stern discipline are incompatible, but they actually aren't. In fact, I'd argue that the essence of masculinity that people have been trying so hard to destroy is exactly that: The compassionate use of force when needed, and the compassionate use of reason when needed, and so on.</p>

        <p>No, this is no longer an option. You cannot reason with people who want to destroy the other side. You are like France and Britain trying to reason with Nazi Germany by giving them concessions and naïvely thinking they will stop after you give them what they want. We are at <strong>war!</strong> There is only one way to go now when the other side are worthless, mindless robots who have made so many mistakes in life they can be swayed by bad propaganda. You can have peace right now, if you surrender. Otherwise we must stand up and fight for what is ours and what is right. That is how getting what is right for people has always been done and must be done again for the freedom of the entire human race.</p>

        <p>This is fallacious. You don't have to stop fighting the enemy just because the enemy can be understood. When soldiers are at war, they don't actually HATE the soldiers of the other side. Some might, but it is just as fallacious for them to do it too. Common humanity is not erased by the fact that our differences are so strong we will use force to achieve the goals we hold dear.</p>

        <p>Eh. Sounds a little too much like toxic positivity to me. I wont engage in fights with them,but I won't be bullied. And I don't feel bad for them, they made choices. As long as they have access to the internet, they have access to the same information I do, so no, they are not doing the best they could. They made the decision to follow the talking heads and not to dig deeper. They ignore and mock us, wish us death, wish our kids death, actively campaign to close our businesses and make us lose our jobs. I agree with you the people running this show want us divided, but these folks are not all innocent and well-intentioned.</p>

        <p>That's incredibly ironic. I had an abusive stepdad growing up, and I came within a hairsbreadth of murdering him when I was 11 because of what he was putting me and my mother through. He left not long after, put in jail for a drug offense, which frankly saved his life.</p>
<p>I've long since come to terms with what he was and with what I nearly did, and I absolutely do not think he will ever change. I'd never give him another chance, nor would my mother. Yet I can still empathize with him, because I know how he became what he became. I still consider him a human being. I still want him to have rights. Well, I would if he were still alive, he overdosed some years later.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't know shit about me and my views on abuse. I daresay I have an extremely clear understanding of how difficult it is for an abuser to change.</p>
<p>Anyway. It's the same thing, here. They are abusing us from the top, trying to warp our view of each other, make us dehumanize each other, make us abuse one another and then hate each other for the abuse. The real abuser is the government.</p>

        <p>They are also the ones that will or will not stand by when you are being dragged to the gulag.
Most Germans in the 20s and 30s didn't hate jews, by the late 30s though most didn't care or cheered when their neighbors were dragged off or segregated. This shit doesn't happen overnight.</p>

        <p>Sorry but I have agree with the sentiment that if people want to get the vax and go along with the pandemic because they are scared then I would never disrespect them for that but if anyone starts pushing the shit on me or talks down to me because they think I'm a plague rat then they are going to get the same treatment back. I don't meet people on the street that act like covid nazi's and I don't even go to subs where I can find them to argue with but when they come in here throwing their moral superiority around then it's on.</p>

        <p>Nope, not even then. Those things are constructed using private resources that you can accumulate on your own. Unless the current overlords ruling the country with an iron fist crack down much, much harder than they currently are, it is still quite possible to walk out the door with nothing but the clothes on your back, locate an employer that will take you (probably out in the boonies somewhere, because cities have been fucked over by other political idiots), work and save up until you create what you need, and then do so. The idea that this is not possible is a long-perpetuated myth. Not having banks and employers is only a problem if you also can't just make your own. But you can.</p>
<p>Hell, at this point you can still live entirely off the grid and tax free if you go to the right places, and grow what you need from the land without interacting with the rest of society. Plenty of people still do. </p>
<p>What it wouldn't be is easy. And it especially, and I cannot overstate this enough, it would ESPECIALLY not be just for this to occur. No one should be able to deny you the ability to spend your money as you wish, and that means banks should not be able to deplatform people for political reasons with no recourse. We absolutely should fight this every step of the way. Just don't be doomerpilled into thinking its the end if that happens. It isn't. They do not have as much power as they think.</p>

        <p>I'm really glad you wrote this. I'm struggling and I need this reminder. I can't believe I'm even back to arguing with people on the internet at all, this is taking such a toll on me. It's so easy to hate, and sometimes in my heart I really do feel hate to the people trying to take everything away from me, but I have to be better than to give in to that kind of anger. I don't like this feeling of alienation from my community, I just want it to stop.</p>

        <p>For all you know, what we currently consider to be stupidity will in future be revealed to be an uncommon skill at a way of thinking that is useful then and non-useful now. Your position can only come from an inherent elitism and the belief that you know better than other people do, which quite ironically is a position most often held by "stoopid" people. You are implying the way reality works is simple rather than complex.</p>

        <p>To be above average at anything just requires a little bit of effort, because most people do the bare minimum if that.</p>
<p>To be above average fitness, you just have to not overeat. That's it. That's the golden yardstick!</p>
<p>To be above average at math, you just need to know how to perform division and do some very basic algebra, in my sad experience.</p>
<p>To be above average at a game... well, play any multiplayer ranked game and you'll see how easy it is.</p>
<p>I don't think the average person is capable of much rational or logical thought.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that <strong>polarization</strong> is the real enemy; the other side wants to see us as stupid, as selfish, as caricatures so we're easier to hate.</p>
<p>I agree with you that <strong>they are victims, too</strong>, propagandized to fear us, avoid conversations with us, ban/censor us, etc.</p>
<p>I do <strong>not</strong> agree that that "facts, studies, and numbers" will ever have any effect on them.  They are in the throes of a year-and-a-half-long trauma, now they're suffering from PTSD, and they are unable to think rationally.</p>
<p>I don't know the solution (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder#Counselling">perhaps some clues are here...</a>) but I do try to be respectful, sincere and make sure they remember I'm a human being, too.  I would not say its been successful.</p>

<p>You are absolutely right. Many of the people participating in the conversation on the other side are beyond hope. </p>
<p>They are the person we are speaking to, but they are not our audience. The facts we present are not for them. Our audience is the people observing, but not participating, in the conversation. That's who we want.</p>

        <p>Something you guys need to understand. These people will not be a issue if things get that bad in this country where a revolution happens. You guys got to understand they don’t have no power outside in the real world. You think these cowards will come out and fight with us when they see us revolting against the government. It might seem like it on the internet, but I have been around these people. They are brainwashed cowards that haven’t lived like we have. I would say ignore them and focus this problem
Towards the government. remember you guys might feel like we’re alone. But it’s the true Americans , vets , retired vets, 2nd amendmenters that will
Be on our side if things go really bad. These people
Have no power outside the internet.</p>

<p>I agree. </p>
<p>And no. You're misunderstanding OP's message. Instead of hating the pro lockdowners, pity them. Accept them with welcoming arms, and similar to how MLK achieved several civil rights milestones, we must be aware that the pro lockdowners believe we are all savages, illiterate and emotionally driven. Thus, they do not listen to us, no matter how many stats and numbers we present and how rational our arguments may be.</p>
<p>If we treat them with hate and prejudice, we will be alienating the very people we are trying to wake up.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, do you want hot conflict? Or do you want to increase our numbers to increase by using calm, rational, empirically based rhetoric, and avoid hot conflict altogether?</p>
<p>If you prefer the first.... yikes.</p>

<p>I will be accepting and tolerant of people willing to have a conversation and be open to discussion but if they are for vaccine passports or mandatory vaccines they are a nazi and I will treat them as such.

<p>No, we're in a war now whether you like it or not. Unless the government overplays their hand and majority suddenly come to our side things are going to get hot. You can go and try to hug the people who want you dead but don't come crying to me when they fuck you up.</p>

        <p>Thats the long way around the block to cite the Nuremberg Defense OP. Its irrelevant if they were influenced by propaganda, following orders, or just going with the flow. They are still a threat to human rights and dignity and should be treated like the neomalthusian protofacist garbage that they quite clearly have become.</p>

        <p>That's hilarious. You've just used the logic of the fascists that led them to try to destroy other people's in an attempt to debunk the defense the fascists used to excuse themselves.</p>
<p>It is simultaneously true that those violating human rights should be stopped AND they are still human beings that we should try to understand and to reform. If you don't believe that, then you have actually discarded the underlying ideas that led to the acceptance of human rights in the FIRST place. That is to say, just because we have to use force to stop someone, that doesn't mean they are now garbage. You must not dehumanize others that you must use force on just because you are uncomfortable with the idea that you are using force on someone, and its emotionally easier to pretend they aren't REALLY human so you can avoid that guilt. Face it. You will, and SHOULD, use force when someone else is using force unjustly, and this doesn't change what they are when you do.</p>

        <p>Keep being a voice of reason. Fear is destroying people in every sphere of life, but we don't have to let it do so.</p>
<p>The best approach in my opinion is to drill down to the essential philosophy first, and discard arguments that are predicated on bad philosophy. Well over half of the arguments we are collectively having are completely irrelevant because they presuppose that if the pandemic were worse the government WOULD have the right to oppress the people.</p>
<p>They don't. The death rate could be 70%, still wouldn't be government's purview. The people regulate themselves when a natural disaster occurs. Or should we now expect for government to confine people in secure bunkers if it looks like an earthquake is coming? If our lives are on the line, people respond by protecting their lives.

        <p>Very well said and very important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>It's very tempting to respond to their terrible behavior in kind, but that's not the right thing to do. We want them to realize they are wrong, and you can't help someone realize they are wrong by hurling insults or bullying them. That just pushes them further away.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we have to understand the audience. The crazy guy screaming insults at you on the internet isn't the guy you're trying to convince when you present your case in a calm and mature manner. He cannot be saved. The handful of strangers reading the comments but not commenting themselves are who you are talking to. They're the ones that you can help. If they're choosing between a bully and a kind person, they're going to side with the kind person. If they're choosing between a bully and a bully, they're going to side with the TV.</p>
<p>The loud people are an extreme minority that is over represented online. The quiet observers are the majority.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this! I resonate with this post completely, thank you for the love you put into it :)</p>

<p>Human history becomes simultaneously relatable and terrifying once you realize that every person, from the nomadic Mongol hordes to the Catholic French monarchy, were all doing the best they could with what they had.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've certainly been in situations where I had to make shitty decisions, and upon reflection, I'd realize that I was the very idiot that put myself into those situations. These people are no different, they're stuck in a situation that they either don't recognize or don't want to recognize. Drawing your own boundaries and maintaining love for your fellow man and the nature where we grew up in seems to be the right balance</p>

        <p>I'm all for gentleness and compassion in the right situation and context, but it must be balanced with the realistic view that not everyone in every situation should be dealt with like that. Sometimes we have to be a lot more confrontational and less gentle. We are in a war after all: and flight, humor (even sarcastic humor at times) and hard words are all part of warfare. I'm thankful for my faith. I would not want to be going through these times without it.</p>

        <p>I fully agree and think this is so important. Tried to talk with my family and share that there’s a whole world of people that think exactly opposite of them, and we are well researched (better IMO) and looking at the science instead of the tv news. Tried to keep it loving. Didn’t work but oh well. Still sticking with love and trying to not let this divide us up!</p>

        <p>May I also add here that sometimes laughter is much stronger than yelling, if we can find a kind of humor in their ignorance, and not take their accusations personally, we’ll have a much better time getting along, who cares what they SAY they can’t MAKE you do anything, it’s words, you can laugh those off and educate people, we can’t be so sensitive and give away our power and peace of mind so easily. We have to be stronger than that. Power is in our minds, we can’t give that away so freely. A chuckle and simple reasoning will get you further than yelling most of the time. for the times it doesn’t, who cares? They can’t make you do anything, you don’t know them, and if you do then c’est la vie. Love is all we have left, we can’t give that away.</p>

        <p>For me, I'm pro-choice and that is my stance. When talking online, it's rarely possible to have a diplomatic conversation unfortunately. It's basically my way or the highway.</p>
<p>BUT, where the magic happens is when you can talk to someone directly one-on-one, or in a small group. People suddenly become disarmed, and you can have a very diplomatic conversation. There still may not be an agreement, but now they have a better idea where I am coming from, and vice versa. </p>
<p>A big issue is social media unfortunately, people just do complete knee jerk reactions and get pissed off about this random online person. It's a very easy trap to fall into and requires a lot of willpower to not want to reply to every negative remark. IMO, if you can talk to people in person, you're going to have much better results than talking to them online.</p>

        <p>While I agree to a certain extent, I will say this...I refuse to extend courtesy or kind words to people who actively wish death upon me, or attempt to force unwanted medical procedures onto me. Nor will I extend kind words to those who actively cheer the removal of my freedoms.</p>
<p>Come to think of it...fuck them all. I can have empathy for people who suffer from unwanted side effects of the vaccine and I am capable of forgiveness. But if you wish death upon me, then there shall be no cordiality from me.</p>

        <p>I’m assuming by getting together and protesting for humans getting oppressed, you are referencing the BLM protests. Look, I don’t want to start controversy but that was a play by the deep state too. It just didn’t work as well as they wanted.</p>

        <p>Just copied and pasted from the other person who only assumed BLM, </p>
<p>Please research how many protests happened around the globe in 2018-2019 before posting things like this. Hong Kong, the yellow vests in France, the protests in Chile just to name a few to start you off on the myriad not on American soil. </p>
<p>And while you might not agree with every protest that happened, they still represent a failing in the governments above them and unified outcry from groups of civilizations who have had enough and don’t feel represented anymore.</p>

        <p>Good post OP. A lot of people here are angry and rightly so. But a VERY important point you made is that our rage towards them is all part of the plan. They are turning us against each other so we don't look at who is really the cause of all this and ALL other oppression. Yes, all of it. If you still dont think there is a deepstate and that they are behind everything, wake up. I know its infuriating when a stranger comes at you with aggression and crosses every social line, but they are being brainwashed to do exactly that. </p>
<p>Trust me, if we don't start directing our energy at those who are behind it all, we will continue as pawns in their game. At some point we start to fight each other and kill each other and they will be laughing cause it's all going to plan.</p>

        <p>I understand your point of view, however you also have to understand that these people had a choice. Brainwashing requires a willing participant, and they have proven to be more than cooperative. They are psychologically dependent on the narrative to give them purpose, and without it, their minds will literally collapse. You can kind and empathetic to these people, however in reality all you are doing is enabling their delusions, it is the absolute worst thing you can do for people in this state of mind. You must realize that although on one hand we are too might be feeding the narrative to further the divide, on the other it's been over a year an a half, not a couple months, and there is absolutely no changing their minds or waking them up. If we do not demonstrate a resistance, they will no longer feel any fear to actively condemn those who are quietly resisting to death, no joke. Your neighbor that you smile and say hello everyday, whom you think respects your point of view, will have you sentenced to whatever consequence they deem fit for the dissidents the moment you turn your back. This war will not be won by idly standing by believing somehow in some passive manner the truth will prevail. If anything fits the narrative, it's people's lack of conviction and willingness to take a stand.</p>
<p>I mean no offense or am being condescending when i say this, but to truly understand the gravity of the current situation, one must truly understand how the psychology of these people <a href="https://work.You">work</a>. You have to strip them of their power, similar to a bully, and you do that by showing them you will fight back, becasue if you don't they will not hesitate to inflict harm upon you. </p>

        <p>Mostly yes, but it is worth noting that bullying a bully does come from a place of understanding. They aren't mutually exclusive. The propaganda of The Machine has long attempted to conflate toxicity with negative behaviors rather than negative attitudes, and it has worked for a lot of people, but it isn't true. A father can punish you out of love, for your own good, and it may just be that we have to do that now for these people. I don't think they all need that approach, though. The pool of believers is diverse, and they have various levels of commitment to these bad ideas.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally I agree with everything you said, however lets not overlook the fact that the propaganda of the Machine has also used tolerance, passiveness and complacency as aa weapon to subdue the people so as not to retaliate. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if your familiar with the launch of the anti bullying campaign and how that played out. I spent a lot of time observing the results of this movement, in schools, workplaces and general society, which turned out to be not preventing bullying but in promoting it by administering far heftier consequences to those who retaliated against it. For example, I witnessed kids tormenting another child in a classroom with a teacher present who could see and hear everything, and when the child finally had enough they screamed at the tormenters. Who got punished, the child who screamed. This is just one example of many that I have encountered, so again although I agree with you in principle, the reality is something entirely different because the machine has learned to weaponize those positive emotions like empathy and use them against us.</p>
<p>Anyways, I know what your driving at and can fully appreciate it, I just see it from a different angle.</p>
<p>Take care!</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've seen this myself. I grew up inside it. The anti bullying movement has always been less about actual bullying and more about "unseemly behavior". This is also why there was such a strong reaction to Trump, too. From the perspective of those raised on the "anti-bullying" message, simply being loud and brash constitutes bullying. My mother is like this, even. She seems to genuinely believe that if you are not prim, proper, and upright at all times, that makes you a bully.</p>
<p>I'll never understand it. But I can identify it, and concur with your assessment thereby.</p>

        <p>I don’t agree with you at all.  These people were largely like this before the virus.  Same attitude for over 10 years.  Since Bush Jr.  If you have viewpoints they don’t agree with, it’s because you’re stupid, uneducated; they’ll verbally bully anyone that doesn’t agree with them.  They are on the high horse and refuse to get down; if you want play candy /&amp;/&amp; with them, hoping it works, be my guest.  I don’t think so, anyone talks to me like that in person, better prepare to have it fired back at them.  If you think they will listen to facts, you are lost as well.  The only people they listen are dummy politicians and people with multiple abbreviations in their name.</p>

        <p>While I would have agreed with your earlier I just don't think being kind is going to win this war for us in the end. The reason they've been able to push so many restrictions on us is because we have a live and let live mentality, we need to cut that shit out and start fighting back. </p>
<p>You don't have to be an asshole and you definitely shouldn't start shit but the way I see it if someone starts shit and attacks you and your freedoms you fucking end it. It's not time to play games anymore, we let the kids have their candy and now they're just demanding more, time for daddy to step in and remind them who's boss.</p>

        <p>I hear you buddy, you're not alone in this thinking.</p>
<p>It's the only way forward. The only way to truly change someone's mind is to present them with bulletproof data that contradicts what they believe. It will at least get them to start questioning things for themselves.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about this the past couple of days.. I see so much division and honestly I think we can all agree no matter what our stance is on ANYTHING, can we please be Anti-Lockdown. 
We need to stop letting the government divide and we need to let them know we just want to remain open. Free to live, free to be.</p>

        <p>OP, I kind of agree with you but I don't at the same time. I think most of our energy is directed at the high powers i.e. the government but some of these people are looking to stand in our way. I've seen the comments, they want our rights stripped, put in camps and even be killed. They laugh at people who've apparently died of coronavirus because they rejected the vaccine. So the media says. People over at r/syndey have reported their NEIGHBOURS and FRIENDS. That is fucking insane.</p>
<p>How can these people be reasoned with? As much as I'd like to, I think it's too late for that. They need to hold some kind of responsibility for the shit that we're in. Those who wake up will do so on their own, we can only guide them.</p>
<p>If Sikhs stood idly by as the mughal empire slaughtered, raped and tried to convert our people then I'd most likely be sitting here as a muslim with cut hair. But we stood up to defy the brutality and intolerance of Islam.</p>
<p>The BBC themselves have censored Sikhs and wanted to censor the teachings of Guru Tegh Bahadur, who gave his life standing up for freedom of religious belief in the face of tyranny. They censored us, "because it might offend muslims".</p>
<p>Fuck off with all that. Fuck censorship, fuck the media, fuck the tyrannical government and the people that stand with them. If good people do nothing then evil will triumph. So we could sit here with our little fact book on the internet or we could stand together and fight for future generations and human rights.</p>
<p>This is just my opinion, downvote me I don't give a shit, but I think my heart is in the right place and it's a hill I'm ready to die on. Lmao I'm heated now I'm going sit with the mrs for a bit.</p>

<p>They lectured me all my life because I am against immigration that this is kinda nazi-like. I am against it because of brain drain and that those immigrated become (just like us here) resources hogs.  </p>
<p>Now they <em>just follow orders</em> and are behaving exactly like back then. Not to speak that reports amass that the 3rd world desperately needs vaccines, supplies and support for this crisis, but <em>they</em> (neighbors e.g.) shortsightedly don't mind the literal Billions in these countries but <em>me</em> who thinks well maybe I just don't take this mrna thing but wait for the other kinds of vaccines. <em>I am not even against it</em> - but this is already kinda ready to witch hunt, you see.  </p>
<p>They do it first. Propaganda hin oder her!</p>

        <p>I disagree.  The bigotry and mocking has become a tool of the left and people who pick up that tool should feel the full force of the consequences.  You should not be able to mock others with impunity.  You get what you give.</p>
<p>That said, strictly observe a no-first-strike policy.</p>

<p>&rt;Hit them with facts, studies and numbers</p>
<p>They cannot be reasoned with. Their sources outweigh anyone else’s and any amount of common sense reasoning as far as they’re concerned, and the fact that you think the opinions of their mainstream sources to be arguable or not be credible is the proof of your ‘stupidity’. </p>

        <p>I’ll have to disagree. A line has been drawn in the sand. They’re calling for segregation and in some instances our deaths. They’ve shown they are not who I want to associate with in any capacity. We have split. They can join logic and reason whenever it suits them but next time they’ll be the first to claim my existence is a threat to them.</p>

        <p>I agree. But the greatest threat besides the cabal are those who've fallen victim. The cabal are recruiting every day idiots to fight in their army, and they have no idea about it. </p>
<p>We all know how false flags happen... to invade a country, you need the approval of the people. Right now the healthy are made out to be the enemy. The approval of the people to persecute us is coming and it will come to be, just to what degree is anyone's guess. There is a fight on our hands either way. And enough is enough.</p>

        <p>My ire has always been directed at the media and the government. Every time someone says that the pandemic is to blame for all the economic fallout, I point out that it was the government’s response that is to blame.

        <p>I think the reason for the mocking is because we have to hear all these insults thrown our way from some of them and some of these sick twisted people seem to get satisfaction if someone unvaccinated dies so those same feelings end up getting pushed back on them. </p>
<p>I understand your point, the best thing would hopefully be some of those that did get the vaccine wake up and refuse to participate in this system when they keep trying to roll out the 3/4/5 vaccine of the year.</p>

        <p>There's no such thing as solidarity among mankind. Never has been and never will be. It's not in our nature. There are always sides. Always tribes. Government and the wealthy simply take advantage of it. They're shit bags of humanity but there are always shit bags. There's no justice in the world other than what you make for yourself. Part of growing up is recognizing this is the way the world is. Things will get worse, better, worse. Existence. Hate ir or love it. It just is.</p>

        <p>It's actually surprising how subdued those who are the victims of this propaganda have been. Most ppl questioning the status quo have done so respectfully and peacefully and in good humour.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the diehard fans of the status quo are the ones who have engaged in hate speech, incited violence or even instigated violent acts.</p>
<p>An interesting thought experiment; those that are against the govt propaganda have been mostly peaceful. Those who are pro govt status quo have become more and more extreme and hateful. Do you think this reflects the behaviour of the govt towards its ppl? That is, one of violent action and oppression? </p>
<p>I think we are seeing an interesting example of how govt and bureaucracy actually incites and incentivizes violent force in society.</p>

        <p>A large portion of people do not take full responsibility for their lives. The onus is on all of us to stand up. I'm supposed to stand up and im supposed to encourage others to stand up as well. Theres a myriad of tactful ways to get this message across. It's not simple to do at all! It seems the first step is to convince people that such evil does exist. Along the same lines, convincing people that our government not only does like us, but they hate us and in fact want to enslave us. We're in the middle of the battlefield and half the people don't want to acknowledge that we're at war. And why would you want to believe this? We are the crazy ones for admitting such tyranny when the comfiness is all around us.</p>

        <p>My neighbors are tweakers and alcoholics who've broken into the house multiple times for anything from money to a hiding spot. My co-workers have fucked me out of hundreds of dollars and probably would've fucked me too if I didn't get away before they got too drunk. My friends have been mostly bullies and snitches who've falsified evidence implicating me in terrorist activity because I like different cartoons. All long before COVID. So if the people who mock us and seek to oppress us are my neighbors, co-workers, and friends, then I suppose that explains why I seen this bullshit coming from a mile away. Sorry, but hundreds of thousands of years have given us no good reason to trust or respect anyone except our friends - actual friends, not the "friends" you speak of - and family members. The schism that "pLaYs iNtO ThEiR hAnDs" would happen anyway and the majority of socioeconomic problems result from trying to pretend otherwise.</p>

        <p>The crazies in this thread are likely bad actors. As a scientist i find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with your post. This subreddit is a target for misinformation bombs and astroturfing. It’s pretty clear trolls and intelligence post to make us look like nutters as opposed to citizens asking for healthcare as a right, or asking for better science and less fear mongering. Keep the posts like this coming.</p>

        <p>Since I keep getting this reply in people only thinking protests happen in America, I guess it’s working as intended. </p>
<p>Please research how many protests happened around the globe in 2018-2019 before posting things like this. Hong Kong, the yellow vests in France, the protests in Chile just to name a few to start you off on the myriad not on American soil. </p>
<p>And while you might not agree with every protest that happened, they still represent a failing in the governments above them and unified outcry from groups of civilizations who have had enough and don’t feel represented anymore.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly the point though. Had the focus not shifted, all of those ones you recalled after I listed them would have continued to gain steam and stayed in the focus of the world. Covid shut that type of thinking down and diffused it by changing the focus of the world and dividing citizens again.</p>

        <p>I hope you don’t consider ANY major news station in the US to be unbiased or useful in making decisions.</p>
<p>This post is coming from someone who is pro-vaccine development, anti-forced healthcare, and anti-social control through nonlinear warfare strategies.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that you feel so many of your peers are below you, but just be aware that they’re entitled to the same freedoms you are and may not agree with all of your viewpoints after doing their own research and being lied to for so long by the people making decisions in their countries. </p>
