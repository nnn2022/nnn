    <strong>Anyone from Vermont / New Hampshire here?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from Cucknada and thinking more and more about moving to the US before we go full communism.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful the U.S. won't fall into that trap, as they've rejected the vaccine passport so far, and states are all slowly opening up.</p>
<p>VT and NH sound to me like nice places to consider and only a few hours drive away from where I stand now.</p>
<p>I'd be interested in having insight from fellow Americans on here.</p>
<p>What is life like out there?</p>
<p>Would I have trouble finding work as a software developer?</p></p>

        <p>In NH, as a software developer, you'd most likely end up commuting to Boston for work.  New Hampshire does have some software development jobs but not anything like Boston.  A LOT of people in NH commute to Massachusetts for work, and not just tech jobs.  The commute from southern NH to Boston is 1.5 - 2 hours one way if it's not raining or snowing (which it does a lot of in the northeast).  Because so many people in NH commute to Mass for the higher pay, southern NH has a high cost of living but low average wages.</p>
<p>EDIT:. This is just for southern NH.  Your experience would be vastly different in the northern parts of the state I would imagine.</p>

        <p>And working in MA will probably be terrible, though still better than Canada.</p>
