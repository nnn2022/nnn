        <p>People are going to hate hearing this, but this is precisely why we need to massively DEFUND, not fix, so many god damn government departments. I didn’t that of PBS but now I’m not sure. The corruption is invisible, strong, and it’s corrosive to human freedom.</p>

        <p>This article is a classic... Excellent stuff!</p>
<p>For example, in 2015 Gates gave $383,000 to the Poynter Institute, a widely cited authority on  journalism ethics (and an occasional partner of CJR’s), earmarking the funds “to improve the accuracy in worldwide media of claims related to global health and development.”</p>
<p>Poynter senior vice president Kelly McBride said Gates’s money was passed on to media fact-checking sites, including Africa Check, and noted that she is “absolutely confident” that no bias or blind spots emerged from the work, though she acknowledged that she has not reviewed it herself.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, McBride added NPR public editor to her list of duties, as part of a contract between NPR and Poynter. Since 2000, the Gates Foundation has given NPR $17.5 million through ten charitable grants—all of them earmarked for coverage of global health and education, specific issues on which Gates works. </p>
<p>NPR covers the Gates Foundation extensively. By the end of 2019, a spokesperson said, NPR had mentioned the foundation more than 560 times in its reporting, including 95 times on <em>Goats and Soda</em>, the outlet’s “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/12/31/792409369/reporters-pick-their-favorite-global-stories-of-the-decade">global health and development blog</a>,”  which Gates helps fund. “Funding from corporate sponsors and philanthropic donors is separate from the editorial decision-making  process in NPR’s newsroom,” the spokesperson noted.</p>

        <p>Very well put. Below I’ve attached a video that pretty much goes into how these so-called “independent” fact-checkers are funded and how they operate in “debunking” articles that go against the intended narrative. </p>
