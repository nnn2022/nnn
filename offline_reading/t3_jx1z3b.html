        <p>Wrong, tard. Results:</p>
<p>&rt;  A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>

        <p>There seems to be quite a bit of confusion regarding confidence intervals, p-values and statistics going around. There are a lot of things we need to do as mathematicians to make our results meaningful. For example, if you only ran the study on 2 people - one guy with a mask, one guy without a mask - then you wouldn't be able to draw any meaningful conclusions because you don't have enough information. There is too much variability between the two people's lifestyles to assume that mask-wearing caused any significant differences. This is why we need to use a sufficiently large sample size (thousands of people, as in the study). We also need to account for a certain amount of variability in our results, which is why people are saying that there is no statistically significant difference. Just because one group got more cases than the other does not mean that masks caused that difference. For example, suppose that you had two groups of runners training together who apparently had about the same average speed. On any particular day, if you timed the race, there would be some differences between their times. Some people would run faster than average, some would run slower, they aren't all going to run at exactly the group average speed. If you looked at the results for one day, you might think, "oh, actually the second group is faster than the first" because that's what happened in that particular event, but on the very next day you might get the opposite results. Same with this mask study - if you repeated the study many times, in some of them the mask group would get more cases, in some of them the non-mask group would get more cases, in a very small number the groups would get an equal number of cases. If this particular study had a very large difference between the number of cases in the mask and non-mask groups, then it would make sense for the researcher to conclude that masks have some effect. If, as in this situation, the difference in the number of cases is small, then it makes more sense to conclude that it was caused by random variability rather than the masks themselves.</p>

        <p>The paper clearly states that the the difference is statistically insignificant and gives p-values and confidence intervals to show just how statistically insignificant it is. In other words, they are essentially the same number.</p>

        <p>I see, there's a little bias going on here. The numbers show a reduction with masks. But what I should say is that results cannot be confidently said to be attributable to the treatments and are no better than random chance.</p>

        <p>You said that "stats aren't required here. It is a simple "less than" or "greater than" relationship." which is incorrect. What matters is whether that 0.3% difference is statistically significant (actually meaningful) which it is not. From this study, you cannot come to the conclusion that wearing a mask is any more or less effective than not wearing a mask. Anytime you are doing any kind of empirical study you have to show whether your results are statistically significant and it is extremely irresponsible to make conclusions based off raw numbers with no meaningful context.</p>
