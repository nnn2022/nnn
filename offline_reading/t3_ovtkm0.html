        <p>Uh huh. It's either these "I'm a Dr./Nurse at a *undisclosed* hospital and theres 100s of unvaccinated people dying. The ICU is overflowing! And as they gasp for breath, tears pouring down, they beg for the vaccine but it's too late."</p>
<p>Or "Local father of 5 who refused vaccine tearfully says goodbye to his loved ones through Zoom and begs them to take the vaccine so they don't end up like him." </p>
<p>Both types are disgusting propaganda pieces. And at this point, I honestly have these 'journalists' that whip up this crap on the same level as pedophiles and domestic abusers. They all belong behind bars. At the very least.</p>

        <p>I know. They tap into the universe of "the unvaxxed moment of clarity " right before their death. They can't breathe but "I should have gotten the vaccine " which sounds a lot like " I should have had a v8" is their last words? Reminds me of RGBs last words "I want the next president to nominate my replacement" How dumb do they think we are?</p>

        <p>I know icu doctors and none of them say this is happening. At least in my area. Im frequently at hospitals and see no evidence of any of this. Not to mention where are all the pop up field hospitals, the nfl stadiums, the naval hospital ships that we saw last year at the start of all this? Is this leg of the pandemic not worthy of the kind of response we got from the trump administration ? Fair question I think.</p>

        <p>They can and im sure they are but the powers that be have long tentacles.
I am in a unique job that puts me in contact with an enormous amount of people. I'm not exaggerating when I say I speak to hundreds of people a day in the course of my job. Most have had covid and most had little to no symptoms. Not gonna lie 4 close friends had pretty bad symptoms all 4 said it sucked but no worse than any flu they'd ever had. I had a mild cold. The overwhelming majority had no symptoms. And I'm talking over 4500 cases. Some of my colleagues took the vaccine most have not and not one of us has a problem with the other. Its viewed as a personal choice. Although most who have taken it said they will absolutely not take a booster if it's recommended. I feel it's time to turn off the TV, internet the smart phones all of it. Time to get back to living. Cheers!</p>

        <p>&rt; I cannot understand the simultaneous decision to not get vaccinated and the demand to end the restrictions imposed by a pandemic.</p>
<p>Let's start with the fact that the government and media has been lying to see us. For example, counting hospice patients, or people dying from gun shot wounds[1][2] or a car crash [3] as dying from COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt; We witnessed lonely deaths and held up iPads for families to say their heartbreaking goodbyes. </p>
<p>Secondly, you did not have to do that, and listen to what you just said. You know what is worse then having this alleged virus? Being ill, and being in a hospital all alone. You willingly, and knowingly made their condition much worse by not allowing family, or friends to physically visit them. You knew what this does, and how it affects people to not have family with them.</p>
<p>&rt; Then, effective vaccines became widely available in the U.S. — I briefly saw light at the end of the tunnel. The number of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs across the country plummeted. It looked like our sacrifices and commitment as health care workers had paid off. We believed herd immunity could become a reality and we could return to some sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>Effective vaccines?! Wait, what? This moron "doctor" is being disingenuous and lying by omission! How do we know this? What the doctor is not telling are the amount alleged cases of people have been given the experimental vaccine and who are being reported to have being infected with COVID-19[4].</p>
<p>&rt; We took care of the infected and the critically ill when no one else would. </p>
<p>Uh, yeah, you're a doctor, that's your job, you took an oath to do that. That is what you get paid to do. This is akin to a civilian police officer complaining he has to catch criminals.</p>
<p>&rt; I cannot understand the simultaneous decision to not get vaccinated and the demand to end the restrictions imposed by a pandemic. </p>
<p>Clearly you have drank the Kool-Aid that the government never lies, the MSM always tells the truth, and are not up to speed with the Tuskegee Experiments, and Puerto Rican Birth Control Experiments. And you want people to simply forget these past events? Clearly you want us to forget what the NAZI doctors[5] did to people they wanted to get rid of. There's a reason for the Nuremberg Code, it is obvious you are ignoring history.</p>
<p>Third, you want people to disregard the fact that if they get injured from taking the experimental vaccines, they can not hold liable[6] the manufacturer because the government passed a law in the 80's that prohibits vaccine recipients from liable in a court of law vaccine makers.</p>
<p>Color me paranoid, crazy or delusional here, but this "doctor" is full of shit.</p>
