    <strong>We aren't being warned about Covid, we are being sold.</strong>
    <p><p>A truly dangerous virus doesn't require a marketing campaign.  It doesn't require virtue signaling imbeciles on social media.  If something like Ebola with a 50% fatality rate got loose and was spreading across the world, people would naturally stay home and wear hazmat suits if necessary to keep from dying.  No one would need to be convinced this is a good idea.</p></p>

        <p>If something like Ebola got loose, we would probably do what we needed to do, but also, it wouldn't spread very far either way.  In fact, when we did have an outbreak in the US, it didn't get very far before it was stopped, and we didn't shut down the fucking world over it.</p>
<p>That's the biggest fallacy of COVID logic.  It's supposed to be both super contagious and super deadly, but super deadly viruses (like Ebola) tend to kill off hosts too quickly to spread effectively.</p>

        <p>I've never understood how scientists could claim that and also say there's no proof that covid is man made.  Like either this should work like all other viruses their have been studied for decades or... It has to be engineered to work the way they were claiming.</p>

        <p>Nah, this is a bad strain. It's entirely possible it's natural, given it's not really that lethal. IFR of 0.3 or less, probably 0.2ish. Flu is 0.1 for reference.</p>
<p>That being said, I still believe it was being played with in a lab and got loose. This would be far from the first time China let something out that same way.</p>

        <p>I think it would literally be the best bioweapon ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just deadly enough to rack up a large sounding number for the death toll</li>
<li>Could easily be spread around on purpose using infected people as the vector</li>
<li>Seems to be really contagious, so lots of cases</li>
<li>Novel in humans, so no known treatments for a while</li>
<li>Can produce a bunch of "long term" health effects</li>
<li>Easy to terrify people with  </li>
<li>Has a mildly scary sounding name</li>
<li>Origins can be explained fairly easily so people don't become too suspicious</li>
</ul>
<p>The gameplan would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a few people who are infected with it to other countries to start it circulating at a low level</li>
<li>Release a few cases on your own people</li>
<li>Announce that a few cases of a novel virus have been discovered, while downplaying its severity</li>
<li>Maintain that these are no cases of community transmission and the outbreak is under control</li>
<li>Shortly after, release a report of the first human-to-human transmission but assure all stakeholders that the cases are quarantined</li>
<li>Gradually increase the numbers in your own country until it gets past the containment levels</li>
<li>Lock down </li>
<li>Ramp up large scale propaganda and disinformation campaigns</li>
</ul>
<p>By this time, officials from other countries are on high alert. It's been in our news cycle for a while. But everything seems fine and the news is saying it's a mild flu like illness and no cases have been observed in the US so people aren't worrying.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, shit hits the fan. Someone tests positive in our country for the novel coronavirus. And then another and another and suddenly we have 20 or so cases. Then it gets in a nursing home and suddenly a dozen or so people have died. And then a case pops up across the country. People are starting to get nervous.</p>
<p>Then Italy happens and NYC and the media script flips overnight. Italy and Spain locked down. We need to take action now or the hospitals will become overwhelmed and we'll be the next Italy. Millions of people will die if we don't and we need to lock down for a few weeks to slow the spread and flatten the curve. The rest is history of course. </p>
<p>That's why I think it would be a really good bioweapon. In this case, the virus isn't even the real threat. It's the narrative that is weaponized. The virus is just a tool to drive it.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. They wouldn't release bioweapon that they couldn't control with high precision. It's not so much a weaponized virus as it is a weaponized propaganda campaign</p>

        <p>Considering there is <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/pandemics-propaganda-how-chinese-state-media-creates-and-propagates-ccp-coronavirus-narratives/">actually proof of it,</a> being done to shift to narrative about China's response, I don't think it's too farfetched to take it a step further considering China owns large stakes in much of our media and social media, including Reddit.</p>
<p>Our economy is in shambles, everything is in chaos and people are turning on each other. Seems a little too neat to be an accident.</p>

        <p>It's not though.   </p>
<p>The issue with COVID (at least from what they say) isn't that it is 'super deadly'.  SARS had a CFR of 10%.  MERS is 30%.  Ebola is close to 50%.   Viruses with high death rates generally burn out because they kill the host before they can spread broadly.  The issue with COVID is that it exists in a 'goldilocks' zone, much like the flu--but without therapies/vaccinations.  Keep in mind that the flu STILL kills about 60-80k people PER SEASON with a vaccine AND therapeutics.</p>

        <p>Ebola's method of contagion severely limited its ability to do so. Any country with halfway decent sanitation would easily get it under control. This comparison is not valid at all.</p>

        <p>The officials in charge and the media know this virus isn't the black death they proclaim it to be.  They have access to the same data we do (and more).  </p>
<p>That's why the media has shifted away from reporting on deaths and hospitalizations.  Those have been going down and that doesn't support the narrative.  Now, they focus on just case count numbers, which mean nothing by themselves, but are big, scary numbers that continue to sell the narrative that "We're all going to die!"</p>

        <p>I keep wondering how they test for corona on surfaces and in the air. Do they have actual samples of corona? It's so small they have to use a special kind of microscope so how the heck do they test for it in the air?</p>

        <p>I am curious about this as well. Like what? Grab something a person sneezed on and smear it on something? Like how much of a viral load do u need to get infected? It is still absurd to me that people who are completely healthy have to wear masks around each other. How does the virus suddenly come into play? I been tested 3 times due to being exposed to being around people that had it. Once without a mask (right next to me too) and twice with a mask (both of us). Dodged all three and sadly negative on antibodies too. If this shit was so infectious, I would have gotten it from these people. We share close proximity at work. We have no heavy duty cleaning done except super basic janitorial staff stuff. There is no consistency. It is like "mask it or casket." Down my throat.</p>

        <p>They actually have never isolated the virus itself. Very telling in my opinion. Then there's the fact that the PCR test that is used should not be used to diagnose illness of any kind. The inventor Kary Mullis explicitly stated that. (shrug) And yet here we are.....</p>

        <p>I have to admit I never really thought about this before. But you have a great point. First, it was all the "We're all in this together" ads (which I never bought as true) and the incessant "Why are young people ignoring the warnings?!" outrage. Then all the ads about how Zoom dance parties and dinner parties are the happiest, most fun thing ever and look at how we're all staying connected in these times! It made it sound like we were all supposed to have this family and friend bonding time and bake a cake with rainbows (last part TM Mean Girls). So OK, the virus is SO scary but even nurses have times to film dance videos and everyone is showing off their sourdough bread and laughing when the country is supposedly going to end up with bodies in the streets? The peer pressure to accept the stay home orders, the cancellation of life and mask orders (and alienate people who don't share your opinion, which happened pre-COVID but it seems even worse now) is really unlike anything I'd seen in my 35 years; even after 9/11, no one would call you unpatriotic if you didn't fly the American flag outside your house for months on end.</p>
<p>And the masks! All of a sudden everybody and their grandma (yeah I went there) is making "fashionable!" "cute!" "stylish!" masks and making bank. "The Asians ALWAYS wear masks and they stopped COVID!" Well, prior to this hysteria, the photos and videos I saw of Asians wearing them they had surgical masks, not some piece of pink cloth with cupcakes on it. If we REALLY needed masks, we'd do what those perfect Asians did and just get the surgical ones ASAP rather than waiting days and weeks for our OMG SO CUTE masks. (And I say this as someone who buys the patterned ones to attempt to make this nonsense more tolerable.)  When you need something that bad, you don't care what it looks like as long as it's practical, right?</p>
<p>Now we have every reopening business saying the same thing "We care about your health and safety!" "Look at what we're doing to keep you safe!" My ice rink is even installing those thermal imaging cameras. Like we're going through a TSA line instead of figure skating or playing D-League Hockey. Come on now. For me, I just take note of the "safety measures" in each store and refuse to patronize the most absurd ones. I mean, how does me trying on clothes spread COVID? I never jammed 10 people in a fitting room with me and passed the clothes around...</p>

        <p>Great comment. I wanted to add about Asians wearing masks. Even that isn’t a fully true statement. If a person is sick, then they wear a mask as a public courtesy if they can’t stay at home. Places where there are ubiquitous masks are areas with really low air quality and the mask is a safety device being used when there is a measurable danger to ones health. Both these instances IMO are logical reasons to wear one. It’s honestly nice and something I wouldn’t mind seeing here if it weren’t for the current mask shaming going on. But with the current Maskurade is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>The major difference with Ebola and how it spreads is that people aren't able to spread until they show symptoms.  The real reason COVID has been a thing is because people supposedly spread it asymptomatically, however, there is some research that brings this into question.</p>
