    <strong>Pro-Vax Logic Destroyed</strong>
    <p><p>https://uk.news.yahoo.com/significant-problems-sinovac-vaccine-other-countries-moh-official-105357031.html</p>
<p>One of the most maddening things about the spell the general pop seems to be under is that of the word, "vaccine".  Just hearing the word has turned a lot of people into parrots and regurgitators of the following. Perhaps, you've heard this...</p>
<p>'Vaccines have stamped out countless diseases and saved millions of lives! Vaccines=GOOD!' </p>
<p>So, when you try having a conversation with a pro-this-vaxxer, they so quickly conflate the current COVID vaccines with vaccines of the past like polio or smallpox. These are NOTHING like those. These "vaccines" are non-sterilizing vaccines unlike the smallpox vaccine. The current vaccines are "leaky vaccines".  Be sure to mention this to your pro-this-vax friends.</p>
<p>What I love about the Yahoo! link isn't that the Sinopharm "vaccine" is failing, it's that this just exposed the ill-informed, misquided logic of the pro-this-vaxxers. </p>
<p>Isn't Sinopharm a vaccine?  Yes, it is. But, you would say... that's Sinopharm. That's not the one I received.  Mine's better! Oh, really?  So, you're saying that not all things called  a "vaccine" work exactly the same?  Perhaps, you should apply what you've learned about Sinopharm and it's leakiness to whatever vaccine you took and understand this is not your father's vaccine. Your father's vaccine actually stamped out viruses, not allowed them to replicate and spawn worsening variants and allow sickness, hospitalization and death.</p>
<p>This is so critical to understanding the time we're in. The word "vaccine" can't be conflated with the smallpox vaccine. This is NOT the smallpox vaccine. This is a first-timer vaccine, no long-term safety data, unproven (always failed miserably before this pandemic) tech when we're speaking about mRNA.</p>
<p>TLDR: The current mRNA "vaccines" are not to be conflated with vaccines of the past. As different as someone who took mRNA and bragged about it would say their vaccine is vs. Sinopharm, is as different as their mRNA vaccine is from the smallpox vaccine...even farther.</p>
<p>The link below just shows the inadequacy of ALL current COVID vaccines. I doubt they can come up with this mythical non-leaky vaccine in 5 years. Google "leaky vaccine" and realize that the media and the "experts" aren't telling you the current vaccines are "leaky". When you have a billion dollar marketing budget, there's no room to speak to these vaccines as anything but being like a smallpox vaccine...but they're far from it. </p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/whitty-5-years-before-vaccine-can-hold-line-against-covid-variants.html</p>
<p>EDIT:  If you're going to say...Yeah, but Sinopharm is a Chinese vax then I'll proffer Johnson and Johnson (A good ol' American company)...the vaccine that was paused and jumped the shark a long time ago. Anyone who took mRNA think they received the superior vaccine. No, you took the vaccine with the bigger marketing push behind it. NIH jointly owns the patent on Moderna, (citation: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/25/moderna-vaccine-patent-nih/)and they have big, big plans for mRNA. That golden goose has only begun to lay its golden eggs. Gotta keep the name of mRNA clean to rake in all the future billions that will surely come when it's framed that mRNA "solved" COVID.</p></p>

        <p>Yup, it’s been a scam since the start. 
Criminal Pharma have set the limits of debate and shifted the narrative to separate their crooked $cience and “vaccines” from all of their other crimes, SV40, opioid crisis, Vioxx etc. If you mistrust their injectable poisons you’re labeled “anti-vaxx” or “anti-science”, which is just Pharma propaganda bullshit.</p>
<p>&rt;”Before Edward Jenner introduced his smallpox vaccine around 1800, smallpox deaths in England had fallen from 500 to 200 per 100,000 population over the preceding two centuries. By the time compulsory vaccination was introduced in 1852, the mortality had fallen to 40 per 100,000 population. It is significant to note that between 1867 and 1880, the period when compulsory vaccination was strictly enforced, the death rate leapt from 28 to 45 per 100,000 population. ^1</p>
<p>&rt;A report appearing in Medical History, 1983 concluded that vaccination could not have been solely responsible for the decline of smallpox in Britain:</p>
<p>&rt;"The history of smallpox in the later years of the 19th century does not support the contention that vaccination was fully or finally responsible for the eventual disappearance of the disease in Britain."</p>
<p>&rt;Leon Chaitow, in his book Vaccination and Immunization points out: </p>
<p>&rt;“The credit for the decline in the incidence of smallpox could not be given to vaccination. The fact is that its incidence declined in all parts of Europe, whether or not vaccination was employed."</p>
<p>&rt;”Australian doctor, Dr Glen Dettman states in Health Consciousness, October 1986:</p>
<p>&rt;"It is pathetic and ludicrous to say we vanquished smallpox with vaccines, when only 10 per cent of the population were ever vaccinated".</p>
<p>&rt;”Even the much-heralded success story of smallpox vaccination was not what it seemed. The enforcement of the compulsory smallpox vaccination law in 1867, when the death rate was already falling, was accompanied by an increase in the deaths from 100 to 400 deaths per million.” ^2 </p>
<p>&rt;”The number of inconsistencies that arise from the theory of death-bringing viruses is illustrated by the smallpox epidemic, which even today people like to draw upon to stir up epidemic panic. But was smallpox really a viral epidemic that was successfully overpowered by vaccines? “Medical historians doubt this,” writes journalist Neil Miller in his book Vaccines: Are They Really Safe &amp; Effective ? “Not only were there no vaccines for scarlet fever or the Black Plague, and these diseases disappeared all the same.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;For example, in England, prior to the introduction of mandatory vaccinations in 1953, there were two smallpox deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year. But at the beginning of the 1870s, nearly 20 years after the introduction of mandatory vaccinations, which had led to a 98% vaccination rate, 88 England suffered 10 smallpox deaths per 10,000 inhabitants annually; five times as many as before. “The smallpox epidemic reached its peak after vaccinations had been introduced,” summarizes William Farr, who was responsible for compiling statistics in London. </p>
<p>&rt;From an orthodox view, the picture on the Philippines was no less contradictory: the islands experienced their worst smallpox epidemic at the beginning of the 20 th century, even though the vaccination rate was at almost 100%. 90 And in 1928, a paper was finally published in the British Medical Journal that disclosed that the risk of dying from smallpox was five times higher for those who had been vaccinated than for those who had not.”</p>
<p>&rt;“With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.”</strong> ^5:110</p>
<p>&rt;”<strong>William Howard Hay, M.D</strong>.,who needs no introduction to the medical or drugless professions: ^6</p>
<p>&rt;”The true figures on vaccination for smallpox have never got before the public, though they can be seen in the files of the various departments of the army as well as the government, if one cares to ask for them. <strong>If the record of vaccination in the Philippines alone were ever to become matter of general knowledge it would finish vaccination in the whole country,</strong> at least among those who are able to read and think for themselves.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”After three years of the most rigid vaccination,</strong> when almost every Philipino had been vaccinated from one to six times, <strong>there occurred the severest epidemic of smallpox that the islands had ever seen, with a death rate running in places to almost seventy per cent, and in all well over sixty thousand deaths. Did you ever know this before? Assuredly not.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”Yet it is found in the government records in just this form. Manila and the surrounding province were vaccinated most thoroughly, also they showed the highest case record and death record of the whole archipelago, while some of the outlying country was not so thoroughly vaccinated and escaped with proportionately less disease."</p>

        <p>What are you talking about smallpox vaccine made as much money as any other, do you think the pharma companies back then paid the bill out of their pockets? </p>
<p>It's legit the same way they make everything legit, through paid news and narrative. Take a look at the historical incidence charts and see for yourself.</p>

        <p>Thank you for comprising such an insightful post!! The only thing is, when I click on the first link you shared, it says that Yahoo/Verizon wants me to accept their access into my device and its data. May I suggest maybe sharing another article, wherein  their hosting site may not be so envasive?</p>

        <p>If this disease was anything like smallpox - 300 to 500 million deaths, 30% fatality rate, disfigurement, affecting adults and children alike and the vaccine was sterilizing like smallpox vaccine with a great safety profile, I would rollup my sleeves to take it in a minute.</p>
