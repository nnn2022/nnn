    <strong>Crowd Sourcing</strong>
    <p><p>I might be reaching here. My grandma was 76, diabetes and a bit chunky. She was “high risk for covid” she was convinced she had covid November 2019. I digress, she never got the jab, and she never confirmed she caught covid. So as far as I know she didn’t. She died unexpectedly of “heart failure” she couldn’t breath before she passed. 4 of my family members that she was in contact with the day before she passed got the jab. </p>
<p>My question is has anyone else had someone die, unexpectedly, after they were in contact with someone who had JUST gotten the jab? </p>
<p>Maybe I’m reaching but I’m going out on a limb to see if anyone else has experienced this.</p></p>

        <p>People have gotten sick from shedding 100%. If your gran was already kinda infirm, it's hardly a stretch. I'm really sorry to hear that. /CovidVaccinated has a ton of horror stories and I'm sure you could find at least one story similar to yours.</p>

        <p>Thank you I’ll cross post it there as well. It’s definitely a reach but I have a hunch after hearing vaccinated people are spreading covid and getting it again themselves.</p>

        <p>Shedding… what, exactly? Are you under the impression that the mRNA contains active virus? Or that the body produces the virus as a response to mRNA? I don’t get what you mean.</p>

        <p>Person is injected, DNA uses mRNA fragments inside the shot to signal to the bodies cells to manufacture spike protein, body does this, immune response is triggered, antibodies are formed, this is the theory. However the practicality and real world data has shown it to cause serious ailments in certain individuals and ineffectiveness at protecting against contraction and spread of coronavirus. It is theorized that the spike proteins manufactured by the cells can be shed via exhaling, bodily fluids etc and spread to other people, making them sick. Don’t ask me for a source because they’re all censored and I don’t feel like searching for an hour. Someone else can locate you a source; or you can find it yourself</p>

        <p>What you said was true, up until the part about spike proteins shedding. See, this is the problem right here, burden of proof. You made a claim that goes against all prevailing publicly available medical research, and refuse to provide even one source to back it up. Sorry, but I’m not going to discard all the evidence I can find online that disproves your claim, in favor of believing an anonymous reddit user with no data.</p>

        <p>I didn’t expect you to, hence my last point. Do your own research. Nor did I proclaim shedding as fact. It’s a theory. Even so, me not presenting a source that is of the narrative that is objectively censored on the internet proves that shedding isn’t real? I wouldn’t be so naive. It very well may be a myth, should it really be treated as such? Left for interpretation, for now. In the 50s when cigarettes were advertised to expectant mothers because there was no data to show the true harm of cigarettes and tobacco, that meant that during that period of lack of evidence it would have been wise to dismiss the idea that maybe they’re filled with poison? An even better example would be before there was concrete evidence that second hand smoke causes damage. Be around cigarette smoke because there is no evidence to suggest it was harmful? Inference &amp; common sense has been properly eradicated from mainstream narrative in recent years. How about azt, what would have been the worlds most expensive drug and a wonder treatment for aids, to be pulled from pharmacies because of the adverse reactions that recipients experienced. If you perceive my response as argument rather than speculation of prospect, take your attention elsewhere as I would just be playing devils advocate arguing with you. As I myself don’t have a firm belief on the topic of shedding.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, you make some good points. To be honest, I thought you were the one who wrote the parent comment “People have gotten sick from shedding 100%” but just realized that wasn’t you, so my fault.</p>
