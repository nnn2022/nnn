    <strong>Can we talk about those who were "believers" but, because of people's extremism and unreasonable measures, are now here, questioning everything?</strong>
    <p><p>I guess I mostly wanted to know if I'm the only one. For a lot of time I believed and followed protective measures. For a lot of time I didn't doubt what authorities were telling us all. For a lot of time, I was that annoying person, disinfecting every fucking surface within my sights. </p>
<p>But I've grown tired. I'm tired of people pretending to care, virtue signaling all day and acting like morally superior beings because they stay home (as if that fucking helped!) I'm tired of people shitting on anyone who feels hopeful because HOW DARE THEY? OLD PEOPLE ARE DYING! I'm just so exhausted. I'm tired of this sadism disguised as care and worry. </p>
<p>I guess the worst was being attacked by friends and family for wanting the smallest things. To be hopeful again, to go out and have a walk, to feel frustrated because what we were doing to "save the world" wasn't working. </p>
<p>I'm not here to tell my whole tale, but once I found out about this place.. it was like a cold shower in the middle of summer, so refreshing! Life certainly became more bearable once I could, even for just a few minutes, leave that hive mind that so many circles have become. </p>
<p>I may sometimes disagree with things I read here, but I'll defend your right to say it to the very end. So, is there anyone else like me around?</p></p>

        <p>I was simply hesitant at first. But the bullying tactics really made me plant my heels. I've always been stubborn and strong-willed; the kind of person that will break before he bends.</p>
<p>Seeing people that I used to count among my friends, and even members of my own family, literally celebrate the deaths of unvaccinated people, helped me realize that the good guys are not on that side of this issue.</p>

        <p>I'm sure there are lots out there. some are afraid to speak up...some are just as tired of the bs. it's sad and unfortunate that some are still blind and cannot see through the totalitarian government that is to come. we need to stick together and keep spreading like the virus that they say is killing the world and help heal the world.</p>

        <p>I wore a N95 mask in the grocery store in February 2020. I was the only one and people looked at me like I was the dumbest person on the planet. I did not know what the hell was going on. I sure wasn't going to believe china. I didn't know if this was bacteria, fungicide, or viral. I try to prepare for stuff. I live where you can get hit by hurricanes. So I try to stay on my toes when it comes to natural disasters. Plus I read a crap ton of fiction novels on apocalyptic events. Once I found out it was a respiratory corona virus. I knew mask would be pretty much useless. After I came to that conclusion I noticed everyone else wearing mask. I thought the lock downs and social distancing was a good try to stop this virus if they caught it at the right time. But they didn't. They kept extending the lockdowns and getting crazier. They started to count everything as a covid death. They actually thought they could create a vaccine for a corona or flu like virus. Too many red flags. It kept going into clown world and I just gave up trying to make excuses for the world's incompetence. This is intentional. There is a end game. I just can't figure out the complete picture</p>

        <p>I was a fence sitter in the beginning, and out of caution choose to follow mandates. Now, I'm firmly planted on the side of "this is bullshit". I will no longer be following mandates.</p>

        <p>I've been questioning everything since they refused to look into a certain lab last year. But i never forced my views on anyone else. I simply ask questions and the reactions are enough for me to continue trusting my gut. I've been called the "crazy conspiracy theorist" by friends and family, which definitely hurts. But a few have started asking me genuine questions and that gives me hope.</p>
<p>So anyway, welcome! We might not always be right, but we believe it's your right to disagree haha</p>

        <p>I called my brother a conspiracy theorist for awhile. We are in our 40s and have been best friends all our lives. I thought he was losing his mind and we would fight over it. I simply could not believe what he was proposing, but now i see he has been right about nearly all of it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was quite afraid of covid when it first appeared. I took pretty extreme precaution in the beginning, when we didn’t know anything about it. However, after a year and half, we know which demographics are most likely to die and we know more about treating it, so I’m much less afraid. I’m introverted and not super into going out to begin with so I don’t mind things closing down as much (in my country we don’t have true lockdowns, people can’t be punished for leaving the house or anything but sometimes during states of emergencies stores and other places close). My only issue with masks is that they can be uncomfortable but since they don’t cause harm as long as you’re hygenic with them I don’t mind wearing them. I became skeptical when the vaccine came out and they started pushing it on everyone in many countries (luckily mine isn’t very aggressive about this, we don’t have vaccine passports, and public unis like mine can’t require them). I’m seriously concerned about their safety and about how people are losing the ability to make medical decisions for themselves. I don’t think covid justifies forcing medical procedures on people and find how many people think so to be extremely alarming. But I still think covid can be serious, albeit not as scary as I initially thought.</p>
