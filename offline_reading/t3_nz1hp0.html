    <strong>Black sheep of the Family - Din Din</strong>
    <p><p>Dinner last night with the extended in-laws. The conversation shifted to one person talking about their elderly father still "trapped in a nursing home," and how they don't see him because of the virus, and how he had his wedding anniversary through plexiglass recently. So much fear and sadness!</p>
<p>I'd been into the wine a little bit, was trying to stay off anything political,  but I blurted something like "He should be safe now! Ya'll are vaccinated, I mean, he's good to go, right?" </p>
<p>Person starts getting upset and arguing about safety and masks.</p>
<p>I made my next mistake, asking if anybody else was still un-vaccinated at the table. Out of about fifteen people, I was the only one still holding out. </p>
<p>So off we went on the whirlybird of crap. My argument started thus: "If everyone who is 'at-risk' has been vaccinated, and everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been vaccinated, what danger am I posing? I'm still young and healthy, already had covid (which was a runny nose and one night of minor aches). But I don't trust the sketchy genetic therapy vaccines." </p>
<p>Them- "But you're putting others at risk!" </p>
<p>Me- "But if those who are high risk are vaccinated, and those that want to be vaccinated have gotten it, what risk do I pose to the vaccinated?" </p>
<p>Them- "You're putting yourself at risk!" </p>
<p>Me- "No, I've already had Covid! Antibodies are still present in 80% of those who recover from covid, even a year later. Plus I'm young and in great shape!" </p>
<p>Thus it continued, round and around, and they could not correctly identify who I was putting at risk besides "myself" and other idiots that choose not to get vaccinated (the young and healthy.) They were also talking about the 12-17yo's getting vaccinated, needed to for school. It was just really sliding downhill. </p>
<p>It really hit the fan when I mentioned how Pfizer, Moderna, and Astra Zeneca are all connected - how these companies, up until very recently, were barely able to conduct limited human trials with mRNA vaccines, how the vaccines use synthetic mRNA and nanoparticles composed of lipids to deliver instructions to human cells for the manufacture of specific proteins. How these bio-companies are not liable for any harm or damage, how much money was funneled into the companies over the past few years...and how this new and emerging technology is unproven and potentially dangerous. Uncharted territory! </p>
<p>This just caused more chaos, things were getting heated with shouting (not by me). I eventually smiled and offered to change the subject. The only thing I'd succeeded in doing was making all the in-laws angry with me. </p>
<p>I reckon that's just a vent and probably most of you have had similar experiences in one way or another. I'll keep being the black sheep. Baah! Baaahhh!!!</p>
<p>"Stay safe!" :D</p></p>

        <p>That's a real bummer to hear.  Now they're(Govt) controlling family with their fear mongering.  These folks will never feel completely safe again.  MSM and their constant dishonest death chart helped slide their lies into home plate.  I still see people (young people), driving in their own vehicles, by themselves, all masked up.</p>

        <p>Family and friends have been the worst about all this. They also think they have extra right to tell you what to do because of it.</p>
<p>It's typical on many subjects.</p>
