        <p>With one exception, I know of a few people who have tested positive, but they all recovered without special treatment or hospitalization. One of them had mild symptoms - actually my spring allergies are sometimes worse than what he experienced. The one exception is a 90 year old woman who had an overnight hospital stay due to COVID.</p>
<p>Sorry if I seem insensitive, but I really don't understand what all the hype is about.</p>

        <p>Because people are dying from CoVid-19. Like my parents... both of them. Only 69 years old by the way and my mother was <strong>healthier</strong> than me.</p>
<p>Which is why I get a little angry when people say "I don't personally know anyone who died from this virus!"</p>
<p>Lucky you... I know two and they were my parents, my best friends, and the people who had been supporting me for the past 16 years and I still have their cremains in their dresser since my aunt and I are going to bury them together in W. Va. once this stuff is over.</p>

        <p>Never known anyone with it. Have known someone to lose their leg because they couldn't get treatment in time. Also have a family member losing their teeth because they were refused cleanings for several month with severe gum and then bone degeneration.  I wonder how many more there are.</p>

        <p>A lot of people are probably just dealing with any sickness at home instead of going out and spreading it just to get a test or medication. That's what I always do. But this is different and people are being forced to test in order to return to school or work. So I've had a handful of my friends or their family members test positive. Someone's elderly Dad was hospitalized and near death, but he recovered. Someone's older neighbor felt like shit for a week. My coworker working from home tested positive. She and half her family felt like shit, but then was over it. My friend who technically should've immediately died from it, just felt tired.  One of my close friends can't kick the fatigue, but she's also a workaholic with bipolar. That can't be helping. I know a few more from different states in the US that would describe it as far less hassle than the flu. </p>
<p>Anyway, Christmas hasn't changed for me in years. I live far away from home and friends, so I just spoil my son with presents and relax. I like it this way. So does he. </p>
<p>I hope everyone else is managing Christmas in ðŸ¤¡world.</p>

        <p>My entire hockey team got it. 1 ended up hospitalized with pneumonia. Had a family friend die from if at 60ish years old. Had my aunts friends die from it (2 75+ year olds)</p>
<p>All were unhealthy to begin Kathy. My friend that ended up in hospital also has autoimmune disease which didnâ€™t help.</p>
<p>All tested positive with the non-rapid test. </p>
<p>So while I believe itâ€™s been blown WAY out of proportion, it still is happening.</p>
<p>More people die from smoking related illness every year and itâ€™s still legal, so if we wanted to get rid of excess deaths we would get rid of cigarettes and other smoking items</p>

        <p>I know a LOT of people of all ages who have tested positive, had cold like symptoms and recovered.  I know of a couple people who had one foot in the grave already who apparently died with covid....not OF covid because they were battling other slow killing disease already. I do NOT understand the need for a vaccine if youâ€™ve had it already.</p>

        <p>There are 3 people I know of (friend of friend kinda thing).</p>
<p>It all seems like false alarm flash in the pan kind of thing because without much fanfare they were quickly released.  It's seems like they brought themselves to the hospital after testing positive after an abundance of caution.</p>

<p>It was a bad cold. I lost my taste and smell and was a little feverish and weak.</p>
<p>It's nothing to worry about if you are under 70 or healthy. I've been much more sick in my life. In all honesty, I've had hangovers that were worse than COVID.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's real but our reaction to it is absolutely insane.</p>

        <p>I know 2 people who got it and one of their relatives did as well (I don't know that person personally). One of the two people I know died of it a week ago.</p>
<p>I don't know a lot of people (am in mid 50's as were the ones mentioned above) and rarely go out. </p>
<p>Now, if I were to project my own personal experience into all this and just use mine, I would see a higher percent of people getting it and dying. But that would not be accurate, simply anecdotal.</p>
<p>Just because you don't know anyone doesn't mean jack shit. Up until a few weeks ago I didn't know anyone who had tested positive either. Didn't stop people I know from getting it and one dying from it.</p>
