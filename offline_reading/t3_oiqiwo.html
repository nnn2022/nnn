    <strong>Does anyone have a good analysis of current published studies on vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>Long time lurker here, I have been following reddit for years but never participated. Since we are currently living in a shit show, there are very few that see through the skeptical lens. Some of these people's only reference experiences of an alternative view are usually very out there 'conspiracy theories' being peddled on social media which causes them to be even more defensive.</p>
<p>I am wanting to share evidence from 'reputable sources' to those that are simply not ready to grasp the extent of what is really happening in our world right now. We are doing it tough down here in Aus. I have noticed a lot of people simple cannot handle anything that isn't sourced from scientists or governments. So I have been going directly to the source and finding contradictions and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Now I have been able to find explicit evidence from WHO that state the fact of covid deaths being counted with either a positive test or no test at all. Also the inconsistencies and/or false positives that PCR tests are cable of. Vaccines are the area that seem to be a lot more misleading.</p>
<p>I have read through a few papers and government publications but I am left going in circles. There seems to be a lot of jargon in the journals as well as terminology that I am not familiar with. These two things stood out to me in a Moderna study: "Eligible participants were healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age" and "Participants were not screened for SARSCoV-2 infection by serology or polymerase chain reaction before enrollment". Correct me if I'm wrong but, COVID is claimed to effect those that are vulnerable, especially older adults so why are they using healthy people that are young to middle age (unless I missed some data used from other vaccines? ). Secondly, they were not tested before enrollment, does that mean before the study? I would have thought that covid or not, the outcome would be effected without ruling that out. - I am putting my general population hat on here btw, I know it's all just bogus but average person logic begs to differ.</p>
<p>Has anyone examined the vaccine 'evidence' and what have you found/concluded? Also, the CDC site is a wormhole. I've noticed most of the aussie government publications are basically a copy paste from CDC or WHO.</p>
<p>TLDR; Wanting 'evidence' from 'reputable sources' for those that are sleep walking. Found inconsistencies in death count, and PCR test from WHO but can't seem to see any obvious signs in vaccination studies yet.</p></p>

        <p>18 months into this saga, it is now IMPOSSIBLE for people to change their minds when presented with data. It's so bad that they will dismiss video evidence of people having a seizure at a vaxx centre. Without supernatural intervention, you'd be wasting your time and energy trying to explain to people.</p>

        <p>If u read any official paper or document on covid/ vaxx it's all hypicrical garbage.  One line will literally contradict the last. It's written in a confusing manner with lawyer jargon that leaves u with more questions. </p>
<p>All by design.</p>
