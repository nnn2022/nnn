    <strong>How many of you believe that the lab leak theory is likely possible and want to see China held accountable?</strong>
    <p><p>Curious about the overall mindset of this sub. It's obvious that most of you are critical of the way the pandemics been handled by the US but I wanna know if you blame China for their part.</p></p>

        <p>Wuhan lab leak is the most likely possibility.</p>
<p>I hate communists.  But they are not responsible.</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci and his gain of function research is responsible.  When Obama shut him down, he moved the project to Wuhan.  </p>
<p>Fauci must be held accountable and tried publicly.</p>

        <p>A lab leak does not explain why the whole world changed the way of attributing death, it doesn't explain why a few globalist governors in the US, provinces in Canada, and other countries all put patients in elderly care facilities at the same time to drive up the fear factor. It doesn't explain the need for a covid passport or the heavy experimental vaccine push. It doesn't explain the dismissal throughout of any treatment available.</p>
<p>So, if it was a leak then it was one that was exploited by folks who were waiting for just such an opportunity.</p>

        <p>Watching Fauci and others respond to the 2009 flu in exactly the same way, redefining a pandemic and pushing rushed, dangerous vaccines, it seems exactly like they were ready and waiting to exploit just such a leak.</p>
<p>Fauci's comment in a 2017 speech about Trump having to contend with a dangerous pandemic during his tenure as president makes you wonder exactly how much he knew about it...</p>

        <p>THIS!!! The homogenous response of every government on Earth is the tell-tale sign that there is no virus, there may be a toxicity however, that is making people sick.</p>
<p>The vaccines are the end game, the literal "kill shot". And it's being mandated in every country that matters. All the leaders are obviously compromised in some way. Every single one of them, except for the Ugandan President that they just killed. The head guy from Belarus, I believe, said he was offered an enormous bribe to run the Covid operation through his country and he declined. None of these countries will get funding through the World Bank or the IMF if they do not comply. It's that simple. This is a global Plandemic from  the start. It's origins don't even matter at this point. Our response is everything now.</p>

        <p>Anyone interested in this discussion should read the twitter conversation by @EthicalSkeptic , who covers a lot of details about Fauci's projects there, the gain-of-function research mentioned in other responses, and some interesting timeline details including China's response and the number of detected variants as of oct 2019, WAY too early to have that many variants for something only just escaped.</p>
<p>It actually looks a bit like a particular trait of regular coronaviruses was added to a sars strain specifically to increase infectiousness, which is literally bio weapons development.</p>

        <p>Definitely not a "leak", this stuff has been prepared for years.</p>
<p>The anti-vaxx psyop has been going on for a while, leading to Google and Facebook effectively banning anti vaccine criticism in 2019.</p>
<p>Moderna giving up on using the mRNA technology for medication in 2017 and switching to vaccines (which were not profitable at the time), meaning they didn't have enough time to do animal testing (which killed all animals in the previous 30 years of research).</p>
<p>If it came from China, probably. China had a huge victory thanks to Covid, the economic damage was quite small to them, but to the rest of the world it was disastrous. It accelerated the devaluation of the Dollar and thus the decline of US power, which is a main goal of China.</p>
<p>But the US elites had equally to gain from Covid. We saw the biggest wealth transfer in history, from the middle class to the ultra rich. And Gates and the likes have been pushing for depopulation for ages, now they finally get their wish.</p>

        <p>Whether it came from a lab or not, and if so how it came about, is an international political issue and/or an issue about lab safety procedures.</p>
<p>Regardless of origin, the outcome was obvious from the start, and so the scientists and policymakers are the ones who caused this needless reaction, the panic and the lockdowns. And they continue even now to perpetuate and worsen it. They are the ones who need to be held responsible because its their own choice and own actions, nothing to do with China.</p>

        <p>I don't believe that Covid-19 is anything but the regular old seasonal flu.  </p>
<p>Just before the supposed "Covid" outbreak in China, China was having a lot of trouble with the Hong Kong protests.  The protests were even gaining a lot support around the world.  Then out of nowhere Covid appears and suddenly China has the perfect excuse to lock everyone in their homes and maybe even make a few people disappear.  </p>
<p>Then we also had the Democrats in the US and other would be dictators around the world jump on the Covid narrative as an excuse to grab power and strip their would be peasants of their rights.</p>
