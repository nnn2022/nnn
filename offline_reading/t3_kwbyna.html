    <strong>The irony of people.</strong>
    <p><p>A few weeks back I was coming home in a taxi with some shopping, I had a conversation with a taxi driver and the conversation moved towards vaccines, I told him that I don't really trust the vaccine and he said, begrudgingly "Why? It's for your health, you'll be healthy". This guy said this all the while being maybe 20 stone, had a McDonald's cup by his side and empty McDonald's wrappers... Probably from lunch. </p>
<p>I don't take health advice from stupid people.</p>
<p>I've learned to stop giving a fuck because I'm realising that a lot of people people run on fear-based scripts, have 0 critical thinking skills and are energy vampires at very least (at least it's what I've gathered as of late)</p>
<p>Tell me something ironic or something stupid somebody has said to you in regards to the pandemic?</p></p>

<p>some people need to understand that this is not an exaggeration, but a &rt;literal&lt; fact..</p>
<p>these people are rightfully called NPCs and even that is not an exaggeration, but its somewhat literal (not 100% though, as they have the potential to be free thinking humans, they just have not individuated yet)</p>

        <p>My father once ranted about "maskless idiots" and "superspreader events". This guy was a deadbeat parent, proud of it, and thinks men who actually look after their kids (such as pushing a stroller) are embarrassing.</p>
<p>As you might expect, his opinion is not one I take with any seriousness.</p>

        <p>I feel u. Honestly if people want to wear masks and do as they do, I really don't care at all it's completely each to their own, it's when they start virtue signalling online and bullying people for not wearing one when I have a problem, a lot of them give 0 shits about anyone else's health, they just enjoy that mini dopamine hit they get when they're congratulated through likes on social media, or to "feel" like a good person. I see a lot of these people sharing "mental health matters" too online, but wouldn't give a second thought of messaging somebody that's struggling because realistically, they don't care about anyone else. It's all about looking good and feeling righteous. </p>
<p>I have a guy on social media always calling "anti-vaxxers" disgusting and degenerate or stupid, but I bet he wouldn't take a second look at the videos circulating of people that have had vaccine injury and are now paralyzed because of it.</p>
