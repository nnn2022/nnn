        <p>How did they go from being encouraged to arm themselves with weapons to help finish off a nearly-dead enemy, to complaining about the needing of armor to help themselves deliver the final blows to their nearly-dead enemy?</p>
<p>This has to be the worst logical comparison to one's skepticism about wearing a facemask. Their premise must be that those who complain about facemasks, are delaying the eradication of covid. The problem with this argument is that, like any other kind of virus, it will keep continuing to evolve into something less deady as time goes on, but at the cost of being able to live longer. Facemasks already have a trivial effectiveness against it, which is why their usage is always <strong>recommended, but never mandatory</strong>, as per the CDC. We already have natural immunity that can take care of any future evolved forms of covid, which has also played a factor in why new deaths have been plummeting lately.</p>
<p>This comic would've made sense if the armor was actually needed by the rallied villagers to help them finish off their enemy. If you pay close attention to the beginning, we can see that even without being encouraged to wear armor, the villagers and the hero knight were still able to fight their enemy to a weakened state of being ready for them to deliver the final blows. This is why this comic makes no logical sense to me, given that their enemy would've still died, with or without them wearing any armor. </p>
<p>Had the villagers been in doubt about their fighting ability after a long, drawn out battle, then this comic would've made sense. Instead, we get another, "apples to oranges", comparison of weapons and armor, that really fails to deliver the underlying lesson that it was trying to deliver.</p>
<p>I do agree with the little girl's message at the end. It really reflects how we all feel about those who try to make these dumb analogies to compare to the skepticism of wearing facemasks.</p>
