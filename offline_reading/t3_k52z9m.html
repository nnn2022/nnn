    <strong>I’m stressed beyond belief with the effects lockdown have had on my life.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ll make a list to make it easy to read. </p>
<p>-I lost my job and spent 3.5 months without unemployment money because of the state backlog, and had to rely on charity from family during that time <br>
-I finally got the unemployment benefits but live in an expensive area so most of them go to my rent with little left over for food, Internet bills, toiletries as needed and incidentals 
-I am so incredibly demotivated to look for work most days, so apply to the bare minimum because I can’t bring myself to do more
-My previous job experience is in low/unskilled positions despite having a college degree (millennial reality, am I right) 
-I can’t bring myself to up-skill because I’m not in the headspace for it since I’m depressed and anxious about the current lockdowns, recession/finding work/economy, and other personal issues<br>
-Receive multiple rejections for jobs I apply to, or job interviews/hiring process takes so long that I wonder if there will be an end to it. I read an account of someone stuck in HR limbo/hell waiting on an offer 
-The transit authorities in my area announced austerity cuts to bus and train services this summer; I can’t afford a car so this could very well affect potential job prospects 
-I come from a traditional family and am a woman so my family is constantly attempting to get me married to men I don’t know and wouldn’t like. 
-I always decline and my family threatens me saying they’ll leave me to become homeless. We already argue so much over lockdowns, they’re pro-lockdown/masks so our relationships have been immensely strained and up/down during these god-awful times. I admit a lot of it is due to reactionary speech on my part, but I literally can’t control what I say with all the suffocating pressure of everything falling apart in my life </p>
<p>What are the options for me? It feels like I have no where to turn, no where to go, I can’t bring myself to improve my skills and life and try and find a semblance of stability because my mental health is in the gutter. This is all a literal nightmare. So what’s the solution from here on out?</p></p>

        <p>Hang in there... This group gives me hope that there are many of us out there aware of the reality of what’s going on... Never posted on here before today but finally decided to do so... I think having this community of like-minded people helps to reduce the feeling of overwhelm from the massive groupthink and propaganda everywhere. Do what you can day by day even if just small actions, and take time for self-care, meditation, whatever you can do to get some inner peace in the face of it all. We’re on the right side of history. You’ll make it through!</p>
