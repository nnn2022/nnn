        <p>Yep, if it's not happening near them they don't care. Also, they don't follow mandates because they care about health, they do it because they're too cowardly to consider an alternative. "There's nothing you can do."</p>

        <p>I don't think that's entirely true. Partly true, maybe.</p>
<p>A lot of people do seem to see it as "we're in this together, we have to go through this together". They believe only 100% public buy-in to public health measures will stop the pandemic and save lives (from the virus, from overcrowding, from long-covid, from prolonged restrictions). They know it's hard, but they're convinced it's the only way.</p>
<p>It's sad. They aren't bad people for wanting to save lives. I think they've got this one partially wrong and I wish they were willing to listen to opposing views. </p>
<p>I think they haven't thought through what happens after COVID, e.g. do they think gov'ts will give up all this surveillance power, and haven't considered that maybe some of these restrictions are over the top.</p>

<p>At this point, I don't particularly care whether they are "good" or "bad" people - it's like the argument about "good" or "bad" Germans during WWII. They are pursuing, and in favour of, agendas that are destroying economies, lives, and our liberties.</p>
<p>If a herd of stampeding cattle was charging towards me, and I had a Gatling Gun but nowhere to go, I wouldn't pontificate about their motivations. I would keep shooting until they were all dead.</p>

        <p>honestly I'm just trying to look at things from their pov cause there's so much toxic division out there right now. it's dangerous for our future. (and yes so are the lockdowns and other heavy-handed restrictions).</p>
<p>doesn't mean i want to stand back and let them continue pushing stricter restrictions. i don't know what's the right way to approach this whole mess but i don't think furthering the us vs them divide is the right way. you have a line they can't cross, of course, re restrictions etc... but unless they're actively crossing it I figure a bit of empathy won't hurt. might be futile but can't hurt.</p>

        <p>I understand what you mean they are not bad people but it is false virtue. Underneath that surface of a caring appearance is an unacknowledged immorality. You can see that in the way they suddenly, hypocritically and viciously attack anyone who challenges their dogma by questioning the narrative.</p>
<p>This phenomenon will only increase in severity as time goes on and the vaccine rolls out.</p>

<p>absolutely, didn't mean to dismiss that. they let themselves indulge in anti-social  behavior on the pretext of saving lives.</p>
<p>though i think for some of them, they may really see it as justified (even gentle!) self-defense, because anyone who questions the narrative is actively harming people. but that's a lot of speculation.</p>
<p>'false virtue' that's a good way to put it!</p>

        <p>Misleading title.</p>
<p>It’s actually an interesting study that looked at people from the US and from NZ: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103120304248</p>
<p>The authors conclude:</p>
<p>“Across our two studies, both those who more strongly feared contracting the virus and those who more strongly identified as liberal exhibited widened asymmetries, as well as greater moral outrage. Indeed, these greater asymmetries were mediated by heightened moral outrage. Of note, we observed these patterns in both the USA and NZ, suggesting they were not a relic of a particular political climate or a country that had yet to effectively contain the virus. Rather these patterns may reflect deeper ideological differences, such as liberals' greater emphasis on avoiding harm (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009) or conservatives' greater valuation of personal liberties (Boaz, 1997).”</p>
<p>In other words, on average (ie more often than not):</p>
<p>Doomer = liberal + scared shitless of covid</p>

        <p>lol...you know, it's ironic. I always been a cross been a liberal and conservative, like a "conservative liberal" you could say...At first it baffled me that it's the liberal minds who are the paranoid delusional ones, when you would think the conservatives would be more neurotic by nature. But after closer examination, I began to see the trend throughout the years of liberals' being much more inclined to act rashly, radical and cause driven, which their self righteousness has been compounded by a narcistic quality believing their education gives them some superiority over others, while the conservative minded tends to "think" first and apply reason. I've always been fascinated by the psychology of people and what drives them and this is some good material.</p>

        <p>this should be obvious to anyone. They don't care about health, pain, suffering, sickness, etc...</p>
<p>They care about the sense of power and self-righteousness they can feel in that moment. It's why they'll wish sickness, suffering, and death on your FAMILY and FRIENDS (those who may actually disagree with you and actually do wear masks and believe in all this bullshit) just in the hopes that YOU get to suffer through observation. </p>
<p>I don't believe a single one of them gives any shits about any of it other than that sweet sweet feeling of superiority they get. Most of them are abject degenerate losers with 0 lives or purpose, and are, quite frankly, mostly net-zeros to the world. It's something they can glom onto without actually becoming a useful or dare I say decent person and it just catapults them into the stratosphere in their own mind. </p>
<p>They get to save the world from the apocolypse! Sponsored by the billionaires they claim to so loathe. The venn diagram between these braindead muppets and those that had "PaRt oF tHe ReSiThTanCe" on all their SocMed profiles is a big fat fucking circle.</p>
