    <strong>a covid chronical - it's all gonna burn</strong>
    <p><p>It is just yet another step for them to tighten their control over the population.</p>
<p>They are putting us into "covid zones" to turn us against each other and keep us from wandering too far.</p>
<p>They enact control on zones that have more of the resistance population because of "high numbers due to non compliance", therefore we need to do more restrictions. This results in civil unrest in the community.  </p>
<p>Other communities listen to the government, and they ease restrictions for a treat, but not too long, we need to keep wearing our masks and distancing, but at least they are opening restaurants for a week. Looks like this green zone has been green for too long. It is now an orange zone.</p>
<p>"Well", you say., "At least we aren't red like the other zones. We sure are good at listening!" </p>
<p>to anger</p>
<p>"WE ARE GOING INTO THE RED BECAUSE OF THESE ANTI MASKERS, NO WE NEED TO CLOSE DOWN EVERYTHING TO BE SAFE. ANTI MASKERS MUST DIE."</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The government is enacting control, and zoning us and separating us. They are 'balancing the books' to ensure there is enough resistance for civil unrest, but not enough to change the status quo. That's right folks, we are allowed to be here, just enough to make noise but not enough to do anything. We are here by design. </p>
<p>They want to break our spirit. This shit is straight out of a sci fi. And according to sci fi, "the end" of the pandemic doesn't happen in the way the NPCs thinks it's going to. </p>
<p>No amount of lawsuits or anti human rights are going to stop this. This thing is part of something much bigger. There is just no other way to explain the global compliance, how staggeringly fast it happened and with such few ingredients! A mild virus similar to what we have seen in the past (seriously, look up the history of H1N1 and SARS, they follow an eerily similar timeline (2 years). </p>
<p>Did you know that grim sci fi has always been my genre, but after this I don't think I could watch another dystopia flick again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe they are breaking our spirit in preparation for......</p>
<p>(hint: there is more than one answer)</p></p>

        <p>Aye, and there will be a demand for “universal basic housing.” Just like people losing their business and jobs will cry out for “universal basic income.” Perhaps not even of want but of necessity and perhaps this is by design. The masses are being herded in a very particular direction. How it will truly, “organically,” be manifested is yet to be revealed but the general direction is certain: towards the realization of the collectivist “great reset” agenda. </p>
<p>There is a massive uptick in crime where I reside, I get daily updates about cars being broken into or straight up jacked; people getting robbed, some at gun point. My neighbors (both immediate and distant) post videos of people checking their car doors throughout the night, or packages getting stolen in broad daylight. And I’m over here thinking; more and more people are getting those camera doorbells—to the point where we’re creating quite an impressive network of surveillance. In parallel, there is a growing public demand for “”something”” to be done regarding the rise of crime. I’m wondering if someone somewhere is encouraging all this to be moving in this particular direction—either directly or indirectly; either way—consequently, in both criminal and technological natures. </p>
<p>You sure nailed it, u/FunCartographer3102, we <strong>are</strong> in it now.</p>

        <p>“Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
<p>Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”

        <p>Your comment about watching dystopian hit me right. "You create your own reality" nowadays is what the wise little guy on my shoulder whispers into my ear every time I start. I am becoming superstitious in my old age even.</p>
