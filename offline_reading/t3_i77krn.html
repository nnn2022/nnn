    <strong>My face sheild isn't good enough anymore</strong>
    <p><p>LONG POST INCOMING</p>
<p>Hey my fellow lost skeptics. I'm writing this post to describe my experience with PTSD and mask use. When I was little, my sibling and I were playing a game. She held me under covers for a little too long a little too closed in and I started to feel like I wasn't able to breathe. She didn't know any better of course, but it still traumatized me to this day. Que 2020 and the mask problem. I immediately told my doctor about my problems wearing a mask and she wrote me a note for work stating that I had the medical condition of claustrophobia, and couldn't wear anything covering my nose and mouth. She suggested a facesheild instead, which I was happy to wear in order to appease the masses and keep my job.</p>
<p>My work gave me 2 face sheilds instead of the masks. I keep them visibly clean and free of damages. My work is perfectly fine with them. I use them in the grocery store and nobody has ever said anything to me. Today I had an appointment with the doctor who issued me the note. I got to the clinic, don my face sheild, and hop out of my car.</p>
<p>I get up to the outdoor pre sreening and the girl running the thing asks me the usual boring dystopia questions about where I've been and what my body's been up to. She then asks me if I have a mask. I say, "No, I wear a face sheild because I have a medical condition."</p>
<p>She then presses on about how "You have to wear a mask or we can't see you". At this point I am increadibly annoyed and I pull out the note from my doctor, who worked in that every building. She sighs and says "Sorry, I have to check with my manager. I'm just doing my job."</p>
<p>After going in and conversating with her manager for 5 minutes, she comes out and says I can go in. I go in, pay my $30 copay and go sit down. Problems over right? Wrong! The nurse comes to get me and takes me back to the room. She gets my weight and height and sits me down to start asking me questions. Another nurse pops her head in and interrupts her asking if I was wearing a mask. In response, the other nurse says "Omigosh, no, you're right! It's so early, I didn't even notice you weren't wearing a mask! The other nurse hands me the mask, expecting me to out it on.</p>
<p>I calmly explain to them that no, the face sheild that I was wearing is my mask, as so have a medical condition approved by my doctor. The peaking nurse leaves because she doesn't seem to want to deal with me. The nurse asking me questions presses on, asking me to please just deal with it for a short period of time. This is where my fight or flight kicks in, and I'm visibly shaking. I somehow manage to pull up the doctor's note, from the very doctor she works for, whom I'm about to see.</p>
<p>She goes on to explain that, "At this clinic, the higher ups are VERY serious about the mask thing, and that they do not accept notes from doctors exempting the use of a mask."</p>
<p>At this point i'm almost crying , but I remembered the trick that appeased my gyno when i had to go see him. I say I can hold the mask inches in front of my mouth and nose under the face sheild so that it helps some, but I cannot under any circumstances have it pressed against both my nose and mouth. I can even have it pressed against my mouth if she wanted, but not covering my nose. She agreed, and even told me that of my dr says it's ok, I could lower it when she comes back in. She proceeds to get my BP (It was through the roof, go figure. My doctor had her come in again and take it after we were done) and my BPM was 130. Does that sound like someone who isn't going to have a panic attack to you?</p>
<p>My Dr. was really nice to me, and tried her best to calm me down when she finally saw me. She agreed that the way I was treated was ridiculous, but also that there was nothing we could do about it to prevent it in the future. Unfortunately, I have to go to the hospital for a radiology test next week, and they are associated with the same company my Dr. works for. I'm already increadibly stressed about how things are going to go there.</p>
<p>I would consider suing the company for violating the ADA if</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I wasn't already dealing with wrapping up a legal case involving a drunk dirver that hit me a few months ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn't such a HUGE company. They would probably wipe the floor with me and any legal counsel I could afford to get. I can barely affford the $30 copay it takes to see my doctor, so I just feel kind of hopeless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sorry this was such a long post. I just really need to vent to peopel who get it. I'm home now, in the bathroom crying about my future and sort of wondering if anything is worth the effort anymore. I struggle with suicidal ideation, and while I don't have the means to kill myself, I do wonder how I am going to keep going in the future</p>
<p>TL;DR My Dr's note to wear a face sheild instead of a mask due to claustrophobia, was not accepted at the clinic that very Dr. works in and I had a very stressful morning because of it.</p></p>

        <p>Just yesterday, at a mall I went to, I saw some people chastizing a guy who was wearing a face shield. From what I heard, they claimed the face shields weren't good enough, that droplets could still fall from his nose and mouth which can potentially infect others, blah blah blah. Seems like these supporters are being brainwashed, to me. Only masks allowed, and they have to be <strong>their</strong> specific kind (aka surgical or black cloth masks) or it's unacceptable.</p>

        <p>Covid is very racist.  It sees the black, turns around and goes right back where it came from.  Same reason it will infect concerts and other outdoor events, but not mass BLM gatherings.</p>

        <p>I agree. It would make for some really clear evidence highlighting these people's superiority complex! I just got a DM from a throwaway account saying there is no such thing as medical reason not to wear a mask. What a troll! I ignored and blocked them even though I really wanted to bite. These people are more hazardous that COVID itself.</p>

        <p>It breaks my heart. How can people be so inconsiderate? I bet none of these people who are chastizing face shields have ever had a panic attack before in their life. It's incapacitating. It's terrifying.  The first one I ever had sent me to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. I kinda figured the radical pro maskers were a little off the rocker, but today I learned they can be CEO's of medical companies. They are supposed to put my health and safety first and I saw none of that today. It makes me want to say eff my health problems and just rot away unable to walk because it's clear to me that that's what they want.</p>

        <p>I honestly couldn't tell if those people were his friends or strangers or what. I assume they were strangers, but who knows. And yes, people aren't just being inconsiderate right now, I think they are being psychopathic monsters at times. The world is going crazy right now, and I'm trying really hard not to go crazy with the rest of it.</p>

        <p>I'm already my own brand of crazy. I have ADHD, depression and anxiety and haven't seen my therapist in months due to COVID and financial issues. I'm getting more and more fragile by the day and I'm afraid. I'm usually and extrememly nice person. I like to give people the benifit of the doubt but mrore and more lately I have felt like all anyone wants is a confrontation. </p>
<p>Even here in WA state, where supposedly people are nice. That's why i only shop at one store, once I established the facesheild was ok there but I'm just waiting for the day that some greeter with a big ego and nothing to do harasses me for a medical note. It wouldn't surprise me if they people harassing him were his "friends" at this point.</p>

        <p>Awe, I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm in WA state too and have stopped going to doctor appointments cuz of their masks rules. I don't know if you're on any meds atm but I take the over the counter kratom to help with my anxiety and fibromyalgia. Gas stations sell it and it's an amazing plant.</p>

        <p>I was looking into that and what the different kinds of strains do. Seems like the red strains are geared more toward calming anxiety, and the green and white strains are better suiting for energy if I'm correct? I was interested in trying it but when I brought it up to my doctor today she said she couldn't give me any medical council about it. I'm on wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression, but it's not working as well as it used to but that's a completely different issue from what I actually had to go to the doctor for, as I can easily get my wellbutrin refilled without having to go into the office itself.</p>

        <p>Yes, you're correct, the red will relax you and help you sleep and the white gives the most energy. Most doctors don't know enough about Kratom unfortunately. I can't take Wellbutrin, it gives me suicidal thoughts and I turn into a major bitch. Kratom has been a life saver since I started taking it over a year and a half ago. There's a kratom subreddit, if you want to get more info. The people are awesome over there, I would link it here, but I don't know how too, ha ha. I also have PTSD, so I totally get not being able to wear a mask. My husband was refused service from a gas station for not wearing one, even tho he can't. I made numerous complaints against them with the health department, L &amp; I and a civil rights complaint. And now they have no problem serving people who can't wear them. I don't understand how there can be a fine for not enforcing the masks but not be a fine for violating people's civil rights. Frustrating.</p>

        <p>My husband was a victim of various abuse and a violent crime as a child and the masks are extremely triggering for him. It’s been a hassle trying to do things in our area as masks are required, he has to go outside take it off, come back in, over and over. </p>
<p>It’s crazy that a society that had just started to appear to care about mental health doesn’t get that it’s not a “minor inconvenience” for everyone.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that our society even started to care about mental health to be honest. It still felt so taboo to tall about things like that in anything but a personal circle of close friends even befire covid. I can count on one hand the number of people in my life who actually know about my 10 year long struggle with suicidal ideation. Not even my Dr. knows because if I mention it to anyone there's always the potential that I might get taken away to a mental health facility against my will, and I've heard stories. A lot of places still treat you like a criminal for wanting to hurt yourself.</p>

        <p>Legally, I should be. But power comes before justice now I suppose. Thanks for the sympathies. I really need to calm down. I'm thinking about taking tomorrow off work by calling and telling them I have vomiting and diarrhoea since thsoe are two of the many on a list of symptoms that I'm straight up not allowed to have at work and must report immediately. It wouldn't be a lie, I am so physically stressed out right now that my body is reacting that way. I would have to get a covid test if i did that though and thise things are increadibly painful and expensive. My insurance doesn't cover them, they are $300 out of my pocket.</p>

        <p>I know it may be an inconvenience and may cause drama each time, but you should threaten or call the police and have them come down to enforce your doctor's note. Since it's established that legally you are to be exempt, you have the right to get law enforcement involved if any public establishment refuses you entry for no mask or tries to force it on you despite your doctor's note</p>

<p>This society votes for either Neoliberal Democrats or Neoliberal Republicans. I don't think they're very concerned over whether or not I get access to healthcare. Like you they just want to say, oh well Obamacare was an improvement, stop whining. </p>
<p>Not yet, I haven't found a Kindle version and I'm not willing to pay $30 plus tax and shipping for a paperback that I'm reading to humor someone else in trade. I'm going to see if I can order it and pick it up at the library contactless of course.</p>

<p>this is a baseless claim.  Are you referring to the instance where he was there with a very close friend and his wife?  And he had tested negative the day before?  And there was no one there?  Functionally, it's the same as going to a restaurant and sitting outside.  Would I do it?  Probably not, but as things go, it's probably okay.</p>
<p>It sounds like you did roughly 1/3 of the required research and are now providing D-rate spin on things.  </p>

        <p>&rt;I wear a piece of cloth, but it doesn't restrict my breathing. Call it a compromise.</p>
<p>If it's sheer, it doesn't protect anyone.  It's not a compromise; it's a way for you to self-identify that you don't care about other people or their health concerns.</p>
<p>&rt;I've had a respratory infection, I had a nasty flu I caught in Mexico over spring break. Somehow I'm not worried about it, maybe because I don't take sensationalism in the media as seriously as you do.</p>
<p>It's almost like the flu and COVID are two different diseases, and the one that you got has vaccines and effective treatments and the  other doesn't.</p>
<p>&rt;Weren't you just arguing yesterday that rich people should be allowed to tank the economy, get bailouts, and then get massive bonuses? I've met people in jail who aren't that big of assholes.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, time for "let's move the goal posts and now pretend he said something he didn't say by twisting words around."  You complained about bonuses during TARP.  Most of them shouldn't  have happened--we're in agreement there.  However, to give a blanket statement that none of them should have gotten a bonus is wrong.  Many of the banks didn't need the loans, didn't want the loans, but were forced to take out the loans anyway and pay them back with interest.  If a bank didn't take the loans, would it have been a big deal if they got bonuses?  Then why for a loan that they didn't need?</p>
<p>And all of that ignores that banks' contracts with employees often prescribe bonuses in many circumstances, and not paying those bonuses would have been an illegal breach.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is relevant to the conversation; other than to distract from the fact that you know you're being an asshole and personal attacks is all you got.  And maybe someone who put others' lives at risk before--landing them in jail--would have used that time to think about their place in society and our obligations' to each others' health.</p>

<p>They don't qualify me to make that determination, but the logic and critical thinking skills I got from those degrees help me parse what scientists are saying about why they think cloth masks work.  Plus, plenty of them came out and directly said the sheer masks don't work when people started selling them.</p>
<p>&rt;Well, if you're going to call me an asshole, yeah then you being an asshole is at issue. </p>

<p>&rt;ust the fact that you'd even bring up "well some of them deserved their bonuses" Shows that you have greater sympathy for them then you do of the working class in flyover country that you hate.</p>
<p>No, I think that workers should get monies promised to them in their contracts with their employees.  And I've never said anything about "flyover country" or that I hate it.</p>
<p>&rt;d argue that banking should be a public utility considering how the US system is set up. </p>
<p>I adamantly support postal banking.  I think that would be a great thing.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't think they should ever be getting absurd bonuses and stock benefits. They're cash vampires, the tail wagging the dog.</p>
<p>I'd be fine bringing back Glass-Steagall.</p>
<p>&rt;But since you don't seem to know anything about the history of economic thought, and refuse to listen to any economists who talk about it, you don't understand how financialization has changed the economy and made it even more unstable and short term focused.</p>
<p>Another lie.  I support many things to reform and provide more oversight to banking.  You know that you are literally arguing against employees getting their contractually deserved bonuses, which meant that the banks would have just earned larger profits?</p>

<p>I've already made my position clear, I don't think they should get the bonuses EVER. I don't care about their fancy contracts, I don't feel the least bit compelled to care about rich people who destroy the economy and wage class warfare against the poor and working class. </p>
<p>Again, they're cash vampires. It use to be that interest was considered unearned income. I strongly suggest listening to these episodes to inform yourself with a perspective outside of whatever you learned in grad school. John Bates Clarke just basically rewrote economics and said there's no unearned income. There are massive ramifactions to this. I even keyed it up to where he talks about it.</p>

<p>Then you don't care about workers.  Either contracts are honored for all for workers to have power, or they won't get any if we pick and choose which workers we do and do not like.</p>

<p>I get that you enjoy being condescending, but I spend a significant amount of time and money each month accessing economic journals so I can keep up on the most recent developments and theories in economics.  Thanks for providing a 17 year old link, though.</p>

<p>Oh please, get real LMAO. Most workers don't get any contract, other than "Your job is everything we say at any time and anything can change any moment" </p>
<p>Especially rich coming from you, who insists that any shift away from at will employment to what most other industrial countries have will just hurt workers. God forbid they get some rights. Only the fucking fat rich assholes. Really unbelievable that you'd think I'd shed a tear for these people. Their money should be taxed away almost entirely, it's economic rent.</p>

<p>And if you don't honor the contracts that workers <em>do</em> have, it leaves them with even less power.</p>

<p>Ah yes, again with the deliberate mis-construing of what I've said in the past.  There's a few points to be made here: more worker protections, the fewer workers firms hire.  Higher unemployment benefits leads to lower worker participation.  That's how this works.  The whole point is to find a happy medium in there.  There are plenty of worker protections I'd like to see enacted; I've just argued against some of the ones you've proposed in the past because they weren't policies that would help workers so much as you perceived that they would help <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Not in the least bit, it doesn't benefit anyone but them. This is well demonstrated by the fact that they still get their bonuses and most workers aren't guarenteed anything but if they don't do exactly what they're told or screw up they will be fired. </p>
<p>Also, LOL doesn't that apply to rich bankers as well? If they get a worker protection in the form of a contract that must be honored, doesn't that make fewer firms want to hire them? LOL of course not, your rules only apply to those you don't like.</p>

<p>No, what I'm saying is that if you can summarily decide which contracts to honor, someone else can come in later and decide other workers' contracts aren't worth it.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, LOL doesn't that apply to rich bankers as well?</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>&rt;If they get a worker protection in the form of a contract that must be honored, doesn't that make fewer firms want to hire them? </p>
<p>It means that banks would hire more people if they needed to provide fewer protections (because they would be shelling out less money).  Highly competitive industries though, force firms to bid higher and higher, and prospective hirees demand protections.  Doesn't always work though: when you have a big bank announcing that each employee will have one weekend a month where they will be guaranteed to not be called in to stem workplace suicides, it still might not be great.</p>
<p>&rt;your rules only apply to those you don't like.</p>
<p>Who is that?  Because I want everyone to be doing as well as possible--you're the one who wants to be spiteful against those people that you don't like.</p>

        <p>So your logic does apply to them, and you're just hurting them by giving them a right. </p>
<p>It's just really amazing to me the mental gymnastics you go through. Most people don't get bonuses or golden parachutes. Yet you're trying to argue that protecting these people somehow does a service to the community. This is a patently absurd conversation, that I can't even believe I'm having. </p>
<p>You seem to really respect the finance industry, like they're just out there busting their asses to make things better. This is ridiculous, that industry is incredibly predatory, and it has used its leverage to create political power in order to regulate itself. This is all at the expense of the public. Insiders run every single regulatory agency, and most have been all but neutralized. </p>
<p>The industry makes its money off economic rent, previous schools of economic thought posited that this type of income is unearned and should be taxed away.</p>

        <p>Well, like I said. I probably won't be able to file a suit anyway. I have a lot going on with my mental and physical health right now, and I don't think I can manage it. Plus they are a huge company, the biggest in the state i believe. What i don't understand is how they can deny me medical treatment. It's possible that the issue I'm having right now could lead to my death, and if they don't give me medical treatment, technically wouldn't they be liable for that? I'm not very knowledgeable avout these kinds of things, but I am very curious, so I'm doing some research about it. I don't know how I'm going to handle things next week when I go in to see the radiologist, but I want to be prepared to defend myself</p>

        <p>Jesus dude, that's absolutely horrible. If you are having serious trouble with panic attack like me right now and do NOT have an addictive personality, I would highly reccomend asking your doctor for emergency fast-onset anxiety medication like a benzo. Saves my life in these situations and allows me to relax and take a breather from all the turmoil caused by masktards and lockdown fetishists.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry. Essential employees seem to try to be polite about the mask thing <em>most of the time</em> but they don't do a very good job at it. At my old work we would literally accost people at the door, and we had to even inquire what their disability is if they can't wear a mask. Imagine walking into a store and having to explain you have PTSD from being smothered. Absolutely disgusting.</p>

        <p>Hello fellow anxiety sufferer. Thank you for the advice. I could maybe check into that. Idk I sometimes have problems regulating substances and I sometimes don't. I've been better about not smoking weed when I shouldn't be as of late, but it's still a fine line and I've asked my partner to help out with hiding it from me and stuff like that. In return I give back rubs. :)</p>
<p>I have imagined it. Back in the beginning of the mask mandates I put my face shield on and rehearsed what I would say in the mirror, if that were to happen. Luckily my go to store has a big sign with all the acceptable froms of face coverings on it and there is a picture of someone wearing a shield and nothing else. If anyone gives me any flack I can just point to the sign and say I'm wearing acceptable covering. </p>
<p>I hope you are doing okay at least. I know doing well is extremely rare in a time like this.</p>

        <p>I went into work the other day with my face shield on, as usual. I'd been given permission from my manager <em>just the day before</em> to be able to wear it during my shifts. As I was getting ready out the back, one of my coworkers was like 'you know you have to wear a mask, too, right? you can't just wear the shield'. I told her that the government allows face shields and deems them sufficient enough on <em>their very website</em> (masks a mandatory in my state, but you're allowed to put whatever you want over your face as long as you're covering your mouth and nose). She went on to say that the shields would do nothing against a respiratory virus. I didn't want to argue, so I just shrugged, repeated that the government allowed it, and started working.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I see her talking to my manager outside, and immediately get a horrible feeling. Sure enough, a few minutes after that my manager comes up to me with a box of masks and says I have to wear them from now on. I was angry, but just asked 'why,' flatly. My manager said 'you just have to.', and again, I didn't want to argue, so I put on the mask.</p>
<p>I'm still so furious at my coworker. The masks are horrible to wear, especially during long shifts. They're hard to breathe in, and they hurt my ears and cheeks. What, so I can't wear a shield just because <em>one person</em> is scared? Wearing a face shield doesn't pose any danger to anyone! This whole thing is so ridiculous and it's all bullshit! The bloody masks don't protect you either!</p>
<p>I'm so pissed off that the last scrap of choice I had in what I could put over my face has been taken away.</p>

        <p>My best friend doesn't have any specific traumas related to cloths over her mouth, but she has had some lung aspiration issues due to various different medical conditions involving the throat and air passages, so she can't breathe well if something even pourous like a cloth is pressed against her mouth</p>
<p>So I definitely get where you're coming from. And in CA at least doctors have been encouraged not to give these exemptions in the first place</p>

        <p>Hi dear one. If I may give advice to you? Try meditation and positive affirmations. There are apps and YouTube videos that you can find that will guide you.  A simple meditation is just to count numbers in your head 1-100 until you feel calm. Deep breathing into your belly (diaphragm) is another simple practice that will relax your nervous system. Raw fruits and vegetables will also calm you naturally. Hope this helps, bless you.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate your kindness. I've tried mediation before but even when medicated, I can't seem to sit still enough to do it, and my inner never ending run on sentence of thoughts prevents me from being able to focus on the guide. But I definitely need to get more fruits and veggies in my diet and and that's something I know I can do. I hope the rest of your day is good to you.</p>
