    <strong>A question: I feel like I should start speaking up but I am worried about my mental health....</strong>
    <p><p>So I am a pretty convincing conversationalist, I sit dead center in politics, I get along with people, and I think my friends and acquaintances somewhat respect my intelligence. I think I could at least convince some to question the narrative. </p>
<p>I don't have a fear of being "cancelled". I think if I don't speak up I won't forgive myself. This won't change until someone starts speaking up.</p>
<p>However,  I ruminate. I don't care so much about what other people think. But I think about what they say alot. Or what I'm going to say next. Being off Facebook has been positive for me.</p>
<p>My questions are for those who are actively speaking up on social media. How do you deal with the haters? And how do you not let it consume too much of your time? And... do you think you have changed anyone's opinion?</p></p>

        <p>If you don't have haters then you are not living life right. You have to take a stand for what you believe in life otherwise there's no point kn being a human being. Please speak up we need your voice. You will absolutely wake at least one person up and that is worth it. You have to decide to not care what other people think about you and really live in that truth. You are correct here - sghare your knowledge with the world and forget the people who cant handle it.</p>

        <p>Look, I've lost close friends and family members over this stuff but I still speak up. I spoke up to a stranger the other day because I could tell he was as frustrated as me and it turned out he was a total anti-lockdown person. It could have ended poorly, I guess, but we have to find each other and raise our voices about this because we are being absolutely flattened. We have an uphill battle because we must fight fear, misinformation, mischaracterization, obfuscation of facts, corrupt government, doublespeak and cherry-picked data. The other side think they are on the side of righteous truth and they think Science is with them. This sucks. </p>
<p>My mental health is in such a bad place that about every other week I want to die. So I take a break, and then I KEEP GOING. You know what will be bad for my mental health? Fucking doing this for the rest of my life. I have a child. This is not the world I want him to live in. I can get off social media, patch things up with my extended family, and never speak up of this again when it's OVER. But until it is, we absolutely have to keep going. </p>
<p>I've been doing more in real life rather than online, but my husband speaks via social media constantly. He doesn't fight as much as he is persistent. He gets death wishes constantly. But he will also engage people in real conversations and show them that he is a real person. He has to take breaks, too, but he shows up whenever possible to say "Hey, we don't all believe this!" Don't think of yourself as you. Become a persona. This is how I survived retail. Create a little distance in your mind between the online self you show to people and the real person controlling the online persona.</p>
<p>We both get threatened with death on the regular. But it's the internet. That's what people are like now.</p>
<p>If you're on our side but you won't speak up out of fear, you are as bad as the pro-lockdown people because you are letting them control the narrative. When it's over, we can all tend our gardens and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.  But right now there's work to be done.</p>

        <p>I feel just like you regarding wanting to die about once a week, but I look at my three boys and decide I best not....yet. We all just do our best everyday, I have only had an argument with one family member so far but we still get along, but I‚Äôll never change his mind I‚Äôm sure. Thing is I would still absolutely help and protect them even though they would turn me into contact tracers. üôÑ I‚Äôm shocked at the sheer volume of people falling for this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù and all the policy that they say is public health. It‚Äôs like the twilight zone! It‚Äôs like we have always worn masks or socially distanced. I hate the world so much right now.</p>

        <p>I think I am going to start putting up fliers instead. I've got an awesome flu 2018 vs covid graph. Definitely puts things in perspective. Maybe I can get to non social media people.</p>

        <p>People are so deep in the swamp of brainwashing it's impossible to get them to see the big picture (they're taking away our free will and suspending the rule of law so we all become unwitting medical research participants) right away. </p>
<p>Yesterday I saw the food distribution line in my local town. I live in a small town and the giveaway site was packed with families. At every shop and stop I made I asked people if they had seen the bread line. That part of government pandemic policy is that people go hungry is an indication that the whole response is a bungled sack of dog shit. Anyone can see that. </p>
<p>Focusing on the massive failures these pols are foisting upon us has to be done quickly, in order try to protect things from getting worse.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been pretty quiet on Instagram for the most part but I‚Äôm getting more and more angrier the longer this continues and I‚Äôm getting to the point of giving zero fucks and just blasting my social media with data and facts. I realize most people aren‚Äôt capable of having their minds changed over this but even if I can get thru to one, that‚Äôs a start.</p>

        <p>I only have reddit because social media was just not good for my mental state, but this is exactly what my husband says he wants to do on his Facebook is just start blasting it with different sides of what people keep posting which is actually a bunch of bullshit to keep up the fear. Just cross post the information we all keep sharing and do it over and over make new accounts if you have to.</p>

<p>You have to be as comfortable with hitting 'unfriend' on facebook as you are hitting 'block' on reddit.</p>

        <p>Just post what you truly believe no matter what other people think.<br>
I do it since day one, some of my friend came to me and told me I was right and they told me to keep doing it. Some other disagreed. In the end, the only friends or followers I want are the one that accept that I have an opinion and I am not scared to say it. They don't need to agree..</p>

        <p>Honestly, if you care about your mental health you will keep quiet on social media and find another outlet to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù. People tear each other to shreds over this issue. No one is going to change their opinion. Sad fact.</p>
