    <strong>There's no escape from the mention of Corona</strong>
    <p><p>As the title says, it feels like every day since March has been nothing but corona. I go on Youtube and every person I watch just won't shut up about "these uncertain times". They literally ruin their own content by refusing to release in-demand videos made before the lockdown because it doesn't feature masks or social distancing or worse; encourages people to go out for non-essentials. I don't even watch vlogs and I still can't get away from excessive mask usage and endless preaching.</p>
<p>Then you get off Youtube and go on social media and we all know that's a shitshow, so you go to the store to browse. Oh look, every single magazine and newspaper is either counting the cases of the day, declaring we're all going to die by the end of November, or feature models wearing designer masks on the front cover. Everywhere you look there's signs telling you to stay apart or people wearing masks so you can NEVER forget we're "in the middle of a global pandemic". </p>
<p>Okay, that's fine. I'll go visit some friends or family, but oh no, nothing fun has been open in months and nobody has any gossip so instead, all you can talk about is how many new cases or the new restrictions or how Dave across the road had a house party last week, do you think someone will report him? You can't even talk about Christmas or Halloween without being reminded that it's probably not happening this year. I go to class and someone is throwing a hissy fit because nobody is wearing masks and the teacher won't open the windows during a storm (no joke, a guy in my class stormed out today because the teacher said he was cold and closed the window).</p>
<p>I feel like I'm losing the plot, now. I bought Stardew Valley last Thursday and I've already played for 54 hours because there's nothing else to do. I can't even read books because my new glasses are stuck in my home country and that's gone back into lockdown. For fuck sake, there's just no end to it! And you know this will be the thing that people will talk about forevermore. Look at me, I survived a GLOBAL pandemic! Do you remember the before times? Those were the good days, we still had jobs and an economy and hope. </p>
<p>Just kill me now and get it over with.</p></p>

        <p>Speaking of Mel (different Mel, likely a satanic kiddy fiddler), I think everyone should watch Braveheart. It will ease your fears of being shot in the head by a twitter mob for wrong think. Men have died with much less at stake. And in brutal fashion. </p>

        <p>It's funny, I always bury my head in the sand like an ostrich when it comes to current events, politics, and just general happenings in the world. I figure they don't directly effect me. And if they do, I'll find out about it sooner or later. Even then, odds are I won't care about it because it's likely there's quite little I'll be able to do about it.</p>
<p>So when the virus first hit, I brushed it off and didn't give a shit about it - like anything else that the mainstream media and social media push. Then I kept hearing about it more and more and it started to really fucking annoy me, because it was something that I didn't think was a big deal, wasn't something that effected me, and I couldn't do anything about changing it anyway. I even made a comment over at r/unpopularopinion, back in I think April, about how I was so tired of hearing about this virus every. goddamn. day.</p>
<p>Then when the US really started to flip their shit, lockdowns were imposed, etc., I got really pissed. That's when I went from burying my head in the sand to going out of my way to go against and talk about this scamdemic.</p>
<p>So I'm still beyond tired of this virus bullshit being shoved down my throat 24/7 literally everywhere I go, but I'm at the point where I'm desensitized to it and am happy to fight against all the bullshit surrounding it.</p>

        <p>This has got to be the story of so many people, myself included. We just lived our lives and ignored social media and politics 99% of the time. Then lockdowns hit and suddenly EVERYONE is forced to become political because they’ve interrupted and destroyed our lives. I fully expect this to be the highest voter turnout we have ever seen, despite “fear” of the virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was there a couple months ago playing Animal Crossing (though I eventually tired of it). I've taken up hiking because at least you don't see anyone. I also find going to the movies one of the less Covid things you can do. The movies don't mention it and they can't enforce mask wearing in a dark theater. But our local dictator, Andrew Cuomo won't reopen theaters in where I live in NYC for... reasons. So I've got to schlepp myself to NJ (strangely movie theaters are safe across the Hudson river) but I think it's worth it. It's basically the only pleasurable thing left.</p>

        <p>I went on retreat in a church in Arizona (I am a miserable Californian). Wouldn't you know it, the first thing I see is hundreds of families playing games, laughing eating and... acting as if old normal never left.</p>
<p>During the retreat itself, we were not required to wear masks, nor socially distance. The two things out of the ordinary were--no techno screens of any kind and no talking. Surprisingly, not talking was pretty easy.</p>
<p>You may not be religious, OP, but those 5 days taught me the importance of iconography. Everything I saw, heard, tasted, felt reminded me that I was in the presence of God.</p>
<p>Contrast that with VirusRegime. Your job, your entertainment, strangers on the street, the government and billboards all remind you that you are IN A PANDEMIC!!!! (I exaggerate). But controlling your sensory inputs controls your perception and influences what you believe.</p>
<p>This is why totalitarians always push such aggressive propaganda and why they are such iconoclasts. "Total" is key here because they want to possess all your faculties, and in so doing make you act against your own will.</p>

        <p>Cheer up dude. Turn off the news as soon as it comes on. Just turn off the tv altogether and go for a walk. Go find some psilocybin in the woods and trip your balls off on the way home.
I gave up mushrooms years ago but I'm going out looking for some tomorrow anyway. 
Join a yoga class, learn to draw or whatever. Don't let the bastards grind you down. Make plans for the future and focus on those plans. If you can dream it, you can make it happen.</p>
