        <p>They have to have reasonable and probable grounds as far as I understand. </p>
<p>I suppose this is yet another ticket that will get thrown out after a year.</p>

        <p>I don't know what's going on in Canada but damn...Trudeau saying that he admire China's dictatorship,Chrystia Freeland saying that asking questions isn't a responsible behavior.</p>
<p>In Québec there's a curfew from 8pm to 5 am so people who need to go home after work or need to get medications or baby products at the pharmacy and those who need to get medical care are supposed to be exempt,workers are supposed to have a paper from their employers and STILL the police officers are giving them tickets that starts at 1500 and can go up to 6000$ if you don't have an id...</p>
<p>During holidays we were not allowed to see anyone and the police of Gatineau/Québec went on full Gestapo style and tried to get inside a home where a man went to see his parents !! Even Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that event,i mean the son of the president of the United States knows about a village like Gatineau...This is not right.</p>
<p>This is tyranny pure and simple.</p>

        <p>Her public statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Officer stated he is ‘arresting’ owner for ‘obstruction’ (seen in video). He does not explain the grounds of obstruction ‘obstruction of what?” (seen in video). He did not have owners ID at the time of ‘arrest.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Officer stated he is arresting owner, although no laws were broken and he said she hasn’t committed any crimes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Officer knew he would not officially arrest owner. He cuffed owner and put her into his car. He knew beforehand he would just be holding owner in his car for 15 minutes. He blatantly lied to a citizen who was not breaking a law (seen cuffed and escorted in video).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Officer ‘arrests’ owner after he becomes visibly frustrated that the owner would not hand over ID (seen in video). Citizens do not have to provide ID to officers and may choose to peacefully walk away in this situation (see stepstojustice.ca) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Officer reaches into building, trespassing, to physically grabbing owner (seen in video, pulling owner out from building forcefully). No laws were broken by owner or crimes committed. 
The police offer said he was there as a peace officer, he arrests the owner for  obstruction.  So the owner decides to be silent in the end.  Did he arrest her for not handing over her ID, for obstruction, Or for being silent? He illegally arrests the owner and wrongfully detained her. 
The police officer detained her for 15 minutes and then releases her with a fine for not wearing a face covering.  Owner did tell police officer that she has an exemption. (See health order M245 page 4 for exemption)</p>
