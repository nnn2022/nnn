    <strong>Macroeconomic Design</strong>
    <p><p>Just free-flowing here, cause, ya know, every other social outlet is so rabidly infested with confirmation bias seeking sheep. I digress...</p>
<p>If I were to design a macro-economic Black swan, with intent to create a mass shift of assets before running the price higher, I'd do it EXACTLY HOW THIS PANDEMIC WAS ORCHESTRATED.</p>
<p>In 2018 it was realized that equity markets had reached their peak price the retail market at the time could sustain. We saw a couple VERY FAST broad market dips. These were the tests that showed there was no retail support. Keep in mind quantitative easing had been going on for 10 years at this point. They stopped the easing, and the market couldn't sustain itself, so easing was reinstated. Rates dropped, money printed, government starts buying equities directly.</p>
<p>This eternal quantitative easing is obviously unsustainable. So... the government needs more money. Under what circumstance can they just print more? Maybe a global pandemic?</p>
<p>This "black swan" or overblown viral pneumonia outbreak, has been used to print $2.4 trillion SO FAR. This alone would not fix things. We have to have velocity of money for the economy to be healthy. Look at Zimbabwe, just printing the money fixes nothing. By "locking down" for so long, it creates this slowing of the velocity of money as people are scared about maintaining income, so they save, or put off large expenditures.</p>
<p>Everyone has been trapped for almost a year. Hoarding money, The government printed more than ever to prop up markets. As soon as we go back to reality, people are going to spend money like the world has NEVER SEEN. This is called velocity of money. The $2.4 trillion in money printing would NEVER WORK without causing an artificial 12 month bottle neck on spending (the pandemic), so people will actually use the money that's created.</p>
<p>We're in for the roaring 20's 2.0. Long tech equities until the government stops printing. Which, with a VERY DOVISH Yellen, is unlikely in the next 4 years.</p>
<p>I've been forced to work from home. I'm going to figure out how to make a shit ton of money and rub it in these work from homes faces. I'm fucking over this shit, and over sacrificing my career to be responsible for another person's health.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight ladies and sirs. People want to join us but they are afraid to speak because of their employers. Self employed and business owners will be the only ones speaking up.</p></p>
