    <strong>Stop blaming people for covid deaths!</strong>
    <p><p>What the fuck happened to the people's brains over the past year?! Seriously, what the fuck happened?! Does covid affect the brain's functionality?! Why do I feel that everything right is now wrong, and vice versa?!! Do these mindless sheep hear themselves when they talk?! Like, WTF?! Look, I was one of the people that advocated for lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic, thinking that we need to "flatten the curve". I followed the protocols, and so did most people. But, in most countries, they did not work! Ohh, so that means that these stupid measures are unreliable, right?! WRONG! WE DIDN'T FLATTEN THE CURVE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THEM, at least according to some woke hipsters online! Ok, your mom/dad/grandma/whatever died from covid, I'm sorry for your loss. However, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!! NOBODY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT! THE VIRUS DID IT! Your loved one, unfortunately, did not handle it and died. It sucks, but this is life! WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE AT SOME POINT! GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL! Viruses similar to covid had existed since the beginning of time, and yet nobody ever blamed anyone for the death caused by these viruses, until now! I swear if I saw one more covid fucker blame me or other people for the death of their loved ones, I'm going to lose it!</p></p>

        <p>Governments worldwide are, and have been, broke for quite some time. They needed to gain absolute control of the economy and society in order to become totalitarian and will now work on saving their political posts and economies through even more draconian measures. This virus was the only way they could do that, plus they will now push their green agenda even harder.</p>
