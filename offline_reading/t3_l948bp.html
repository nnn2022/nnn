    <strong>How are things in your area/country ?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm looking to see how things are im different areas and countries. </p>
<p>I'm living in the Netherlands. 
Cases are reported as anything from 3k to 15k a day usually goes up and down in 1k increments daily.</p>
<p>Currently we are in full lockdown. 
Only food stores open. Masks must be worn in these shops or your fined. </p>
<p>Masks must be work on public transport or your fined. </p>
<p>There is a curfew in place. You cannot leave your home between 9pm and 4.30am.</p>
<p>The government are doing alot of take about "The Great Reset" but as I don't speak Dutch I don't get full details on this.</p>
<p>I've 0 hope in this turning around anytime soon based on public reaction here. Debating moving country.</p>
<p>How's things where you are?</p></p>

        <p>Oh my god, that's pretty horrible.  Here on the east coast of the states it ranges but mostly everything is open or opening but not without all the bullshit safety precautions that will likely never fully disappear.  Limits on occupancy in different places, mask mandates et cet.  As far as I am aware there aren't any full lockdowns here in the states but I could be wrong on that.</p>

        <p>I'm east coast NY, but nowhere near NYC. It's the same here except NY wants you to test and quarantine if you leave and come back. But someone here said it's not enforced anywhere, not even airports. Honor code, I guessðŸ˜‚ I don't think there's a curfew. Might have had one for the first two weeks. Bars and restaurants opened back up this week, but they never stopped doing take-out, even alcoholic drinks were allowed as take out. Masks are mandatory everywhere inside, but I've seen no yelling at non masked people. Besides masks, everything seems relatively normal and has been since early summer. Some schools are open every day and some of them are only open a few days. I'm not miserable or anything, but I'm looking forward to moving eventually. I'm from down south and no longer want to make this state my permanent home.</p>

<p>I saw your other comment and it left me thinking of this is a plan to destroy Europe. I don't see any other reasons for this.</p>

        <p>I'm in Utah, about 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City. Things here are pretty good. Masks in stores is really the only thing that is still weird. Everything is open with no real restrictions (besides loosely enforced masks). I was at a pizza buffet with my kids today, and the place was packed. We wore a mask in, but once we sat down, masks weren't worn. Few people seem to care, but since life if pretty normal here, most put up with masks, though everyone i know is over it. Our cases, hospitalizations and deaths have all been going down since November, and the trajectory here looks like things should be back to normal in a few months hopefully. I get annoyed by the whole situation but I constantly have to remind myself the I live in one of the least restricted places on earth.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m in Kansas (US) and the only people still participating in the pandemic are schools making the kids wear masks and social distance and the health department still thinks they run the show but nobody cares anymore. We still pretend to let the county health officer have his say. But literally nobody abides by any of it except the superintendent of the school. Heâ€™s a doomer that eats this shit up and loves the extra control and power over the students and teachers.</p>

        <p>Mask mandate indoors and out at all times, except they have not yet instituted it for when you're alone in your own home or car. Can't travel to anywhere in the world without either a negative test or quarantine upon return. Most businesses are open, but the capacity requirements are so low that I don't know why they bother. These are some of the strictest restrictions in the country, but most people support it continuing, which I do not see changing.</p>

        <p>I'm in the USA, Pennsylvania to be exact. We have a mask mandate but it really only depends on who is willing to enforce it. I'll wear one or not depending on my mood and haven't gotten much shit from people when I don't. We seem to be back and forth locking down and being opened up. We just had a month long lockdown last month and then things opened again. I'm always just worried they'll do it again (it's online school hell for my family, have 3 kids and 2 are school aged, we do not enjoy it) Right now,  schools and restaurants are open, thankfully. Feels like we're all subject to the whims of our nutty governor, though.</p>
