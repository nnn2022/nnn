    <strong>Does our side put forward poor, counter-productive or misconceived arguments?</strong>
    <p><p>We - rightly - condemn the fearmongering that is part of the Covid-19 hysteria, but it is increasingly obvious to me that what we have are two camps of hysterical fearmongers.  Some people who affect to be on our side of the argument want to shoehorn their hobby horses into this - 5G, DNA vaccine modification, anti-vaccination, etc.  I am not dismissing these arguments and theories.  I am open to all arguments and theories that are backed by evidence or otherwise supported by a good theoretical case, but I do wonder about the motivations of some of these people and whether they are (intentionally or otherwise) assisting the other side by drowning out more reasonable and moderate arguments.</p>
<p>Vernon Coleman's interest is vaccines.  He has written at length about the subject for years.  He may be right in everything he says.  I am not a medical doctor.  He is, and so I will consider carefully what he says.  Furthermore, I will not be accepting the Covid-19 vaccine in any event.  </p>
<p>But I have now watched a number of Dr Coleman's videos and listened to his interviews on the Richie Allen Show (Allen has him on regularly), and he comes across as agenda-riven and disingenuous to my critical ears.  </p>
<p>In the video I link below, he refers to 'global genocide'.  He focuses on the inane sayings of a certain David Lammy, but why?  Lammy is a peripheral figure in British politics and not a central player in all this.  He brands ordinary doctors and nurses, and other NHS workers, who administer the vaccine as war criminals where they act otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of what Dr Coleman considers fully informed consent.  Towards the end, he breaks down and starts crying.</p>
<p>I think what is going on is disgraceful, but in most cases, any ordinary people caught up in this, including most registered medical practitioners, nurses and NHS staff, should not face criminal charges as they are acting in what they consider to be good faith and have limited agency as individuals.  They are wrong, and they should know better, and they should have the courage to speak up, and I have lost my respect for most of them, but that doesn't make them criminals.  Human motivations are much more nuanced and complicated than is being suggested in some quarters.  </p>
<p>Aside from all that, the allegation of war crimes is just inaccurate and clumsy.  The British state has not declared war on any other state.  We are not at war, nor are we in a state of social conflict that could fall under the Laws of War.  Perhaps by some tortured process of logic, you could make some sort of case that the actions of Western governments are wars against peace, in that they are maybe intended to stoke up some sort of international war, perhaps against China, but it's a bit of a stretch. <br>
Legally and rhetorically, calling them war criminals isn't a good avenue to go down, in my personal view.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's been driving me nuts for some time. </p>
<p>There are some who question everything from the mainstream media, while accepting theories unquestioningly from their favorite sources. Irony. </p>
<p>And the anti-lockdown protests become unpalatable to many people afraid to be associated with fringe theories. I've been there, and the open mic policy leads to rants on 5G, communist global takeover and worse. It's too much for most. </p>
<p>We need to fight fire with fire, a simple marketing friendly strategy to counter the propaganda.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are hurting more than helping. That's it. Leave the rest for later.</p>

        <p>You're still fighting the last war. This is a NEW kind of war. Facts versus truth. Falling for the lies---or pretending to---, or knowing the truth.</p>

        <p>You assume people are rational. They’re not. Most people want to live in their bubbles and anything that disturbs it they will close it off or lash out. </p>
<p>Also most people look at the practical side of life where they just want a job and a family. They could care less about anything else. </p>
<p>One of my buddies said to Let the Dead bury the Dead. Good advice.</p>

        <p>Anyone who is claiming war crimes is an idiot, it would come more under crimes against humanity if it did come to this and I completely agree that every one of these horrible elitist, globalist pricks and the lackeys they control in government deserve to be prosecuted. As for those who don’t speak up about it and are ‘just doing their jobs’ need to get a grip, I’m not gonna make the typical laboured metaphor of ‘the nazis we’re just doing their jobs too’ because that gets us nowhere. The thing that really dismays me is the fact that in the face of overwhelming adversity that people won’t stand up for themselves and what they believe in! That’s how we fail, that’s how we let the truly bad people win.</p>
