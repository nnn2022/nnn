    <strong>Is anyone considering moving countries before vaccine mandate for travel? And some overwhelming thoughts of mine.</strong>
    <p><p>I for one am trying my best to move to the states before this shit begins, and I’m from Australia where they announced we would need the vaccine to fly our main airline. I’m finding it so hard to move without a job sponsor so if anyone has any ideas, please let me know! </p>
<p>I will 100% not receive the vaccine. There’s not a chance. I love travelling with all my heart and I live for it, but there’s a 0% chance that I’m going to bought off. </p>
<p>I feel like if I had to spend my life in one country, it would be the US because the states have some diversity to them. And because people there actually care about sticking up for their freedoms and not just being good little citizens. </p>
<p>On a final note, where do you think they’ll go with this vaccine stuff? Will they require a covid one for the next year or so and then stop? I’m starting to think that they will require them indefinitely, which means goodbye to seeing my family. Just heard IATA said they will or likely will be pushing for vaccine travel passes where you must how your vaccinated, and that’s why I feel like this will be a long term thing. Will we be able to overthrow this in time? Where does it end with vaccines if we don’t? Will we need them to get groceries, attend concerts etc.? My mental health is decreasing as I keep reading more and more into the fact this is going to get worse and eventually become a dystopian nightmare (well, it already is), especially whenever I read about the great reset. Does anyone have any hope to offer?</p></p>

        <p>The best time to leave Australia was 9 months ago. The second best time is now!</p>
<p>America is one of your best options and it’s giant and diverse in every way - many travel opportunities especially if you enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities (climbing, kayaking, snowshoeing, skiing, swimming, snorkeling). Not a lot in terms of unique, historical cities if you ask me (short of NYC, New Orleans, San Francisco and Boston) but don’t quote me on that because I’m not into cities as a traveler - I’m nature and quirky small towns all the way. </p>
<p>Florida has vowed no mandatory vaccine; though I don’t believe any US governor will have the guts to make them mandatory statewide and it can’t really be mandated at the national level. </p>
<p>I’d advise sticking to a red state of possible. They simply care more about freedom and rights than blue states. <em>A lot of people in blue states envy the control the Australian govt exercises over its people and openly wish Americans would submit like Australians, so that “covid would be over by now.”</em></p>
<p>Florida is warm and one of the freest places in the world right now. There are others but that would be my pick.</p>
<p>Hang in there.</p>

        <p>I can tell you that there will be a massive resistance in the US, to a forced vaccine. We're more or less tolerating the mask thing for now because "ehh" - the whole thing is beyond obnoxious and unconstitutional, but we're ultimately still waiting to see where this all goes - will they really push it all the way to compulsory vaccination? That's the ultimate line in the sand for all resisters. But the second that starts, there's going to be a tidal wave of backlash. Harlem Shake in the streets.</p>
<p>Our (hopefully unnecessary) resistance would probably embolden people in other countries (such as Australia) where everybody isn't completely zombified, and some of the men are still men. Europe would be less likely to revolt, but maybe they'll surprise us.</p>
<p>And should that horrible future come to pass, well, I think the pro-lockdowners will start to wake up to the extent of the opposition. You can't exactly subdue and forcibly vaccinate a big chunk (30+%?) of the population, not without the military getting involved. Or (more likely) if they try to pull it off through incremental social engineering, ie "you can't go to the supermarket without proof of vaccine" ... well, congratulations, you just "activated" a huge number of Christians who firmly believe the end times are upon us (re: "mark of the beast"). They may not FIGHT fight, but they're not going to go quietly, either.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to put all this in spiritual perspective: human life isn't the end-all, be-all of existence. Most humans believe in something worth more than living itself - whether that's a higher power, moral right and wrong, the safety and inviolability of their family, etc. I really hope it's not going to go anywhere near that far, but absolute worst case scenario? Well, some shit might be worth fighting and dying for. That's just how life is, and there's not much we can do about the era we were born into, and the associated challenges. I doubt most people involved in the world wars really wanted to be spending their limited human lifespan there, getting shot at and gassed and bombed, but that's how it was.</p>
<p>The most important thing for now, is to realize 1) you're not alone, and 2) it's OK to share your truth with other people, no matter how they react. You don't have to be forceful, don't have to get in their faces, but you have every right to exist in this world, just as much as they do. We are all part of the human race, too, so we don't just have to roll over and go along with whatever devious, dystopian shit they have cooked up for us.</p>

        <p>I've been preparing to leave for months and my bags are packed. I could have left a few weeks ago but I didn't want to go to any of the places which were open and the thought that i might get stuck somewhere else I didnt want to be would be even worse. </p>
<p>The main concern I have is 'would I be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire?' I'm in the UK and I still have a right to go mask-less and I can defend that right. If I was elsewhere I might end up in jail for non compliance. Also here, I have an income and healthcare and a roof over my head, for now.
I also just started a new relationship, which is quite a big deal.
But I know that none of those things will matter much if I end up in a camp, with a big syringe in my arm.
I'm ready to run for the hills if need be. I don't have any survival gear but I'd make it work. The only thing I know for sure is that going down without a fight is not an option.</p>

        <p>I am seriously too. I'm in a country that most just roll over but because we're so tiny, we would never mandate it first. It'll come after everyone else. So I have more time to prepare to leave eventually or find a way out. </p>
<p>It's terrifying, I guess I have only one thing that I can say. I hope that things will improve, and I'll donate what I can to any cause that finds out truth. I'll do what I can to spread the truth and wake up my friends and family, some of whom don't want to be told that this isn't the case. Who accepted the loss of rights as acceptable. Who doesn't think. </p>
<p>It may be terrifying but it hasn't happened yet, there's a chance to go back. But I'm still planning for the situation that I may need to run and flee, I'm preparing for the moment that I know I can't stay anymore because it just became too terrifying. </p>
<p>I guess it's also sometimes tuning in, but managing to say that this isn't the end of the world. I'll be continuing to build my own business or find other sources of income as the offers I have for work are far from the ones that I want with some of them having some interesting checkups and I'm afraid of being pressurized to take a flu shot. </p>
<p>I guess it's just being hopeful and optimistic about what I can do to change my situation. That I know that I'm not powerless but I'm not surrounded by people that would help me in this goal or understand the importance of handing over their rights.</p>

        <p>I'm not too worried cause in the worst scenario, I could actually drive through Europe up to Sweden lol.     </p>
<p>Anyway, I don't think vaccines will be mandatory, at least in most European countries. Australia, on the other hand... You'll know better than me obviously, but if all the stuff we read here is true... Flee the island as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>You need to go the root of the problem and that's not the vaccine mandates. It's the enforced drug system (aka medical system many believe in). When that becomes optional, vaccines will be made optional too. Along with everything else drug related. And maybe, maybe, you will see true health solutions.</p>
<p>Given what's happening there I would try to leave. Make enough money so I can leave.</p>
