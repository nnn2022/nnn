    <strong>Top tier logic from my school</strong>
    <p><p>So today I was supposed to do a dance audition for my school's musical (we're doing a virtual cabaret if you're wondering). My brother took me over to the school so I could be there on time, but there was nobody at the door when I arrived. I thought either 1.) I was early so they weren't ready to let me in yet or 2.) God forbid I was late and they already started. I pull on the door handle to get someone's attention so they could let me in. A teacher tells me she can't let students in because of Covid. Mind you, it is raining and freezing cold out. Also, I have a heart condition, which means I shouldn't be outside in the heat or cold for too long and the school is well aware of this. Another teacher comes to the door and says the same thing, and he goes to find my theater teacher. I'm still to stand outside in the freezing cold rain while all this takes place.</p>
<p>The second teacher tells me that the in person auditions are canceled and I have to submit a video of myself doing the dances. My theater teacher canceled them just to be "extra careful." However, she didn't inform us of the cancelation until the last minute. I didn't see the post she made on Google Classroom because the stream wouldn't update for some reason. My brother had already left the school, so I had to call him to come and get me again. They couldn't let me wait for my brother inside. Nope, I had to wait outside in the freezing weather. Even though I had a heart condition. Luckily I live right around the corner from my school so I didn't have to wait too long.</p>
<p>The fact that the school would rather make a student with a medical condition wait outside in the cold than risk exposing someone to COVID is sickening to me. I told my mom and naturally she was pissed so she called the school and spoke to the vice principal. He apologized, but I don’t know if they did anything else. I doubt they did. They care about my health so much that they make me wait outside in the cold knowing that could be harmful for my heart. I know it was only a few minutes, but they should have still let me inside. What I experienced today is illogical. If they keep saying this is about your health, they're dead wrong.</p></p>

        <p>No common sense anymore.  Teachers/Professors are lazy AF and only want this BS to go on so they can do the bare minimum.</p>

        <p>That’s terrible. My school did that too when we were in person and it was the worst. That’s so good that your mom called the vice principal though. I hope your audition goes well!</p>
