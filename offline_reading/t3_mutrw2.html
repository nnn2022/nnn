        <p>This is why I don't invest in crypto: the world governments will ultimately ban them so that they do not compete with their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>The tokenisation of currency and its twin sister, UBI, are the second most dangerous threat to human liberty. (The most dangerous being the trifecta of vaccines, microchips and the Internet of Bodies.)</p>
<p>The reporting in this article is very deceptive as they claim that the CBCD is being developed to increase the City of London's (UK's financial centre) competitive in the wake of Brexit. This is a lie because it's ultimately about UBI, credit score, ultra-surveillance and vaxx-passports as is already happening in China.  </p>
<p>This wording was fascinating to me:</p>
<p>&rt;...The Treasury said two new forums would be established to engage technical experts and key <strong><em>stakeholders</em></strong> including financial institutions, retailers, businesses, civil society groups and consumers.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Bank added that the taskforce would engage widely with <strong><em>stakeholders</em></strong> on the benefits, risks and practicalities” of a CBDC.</p>
<p>This looks eerily similar to the WEF's 'stakeholder capitalism' which we know has nothing to do with capitalism and everything to do with authoritarian technocratic rule by an infinitesimal elite.</p>

<p>As usual, and keeping in line with the central banks of the US, Canada, Eurozone, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil, etc, the BOE has shifted its mandate from price stability to the trojan horses of climate change and 'green' economies.  </p>
<p>&rt;These would include helping firms to “scale up” and the use of a “sandbox” – a testing environment – to explore financial products that would help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Our vision is for a more open, greener, and more technologically advanced financial services sector,” he said.</p>
<p>How an AI-driven CBDC housed in power-hungry server farms would be considered 'green' is beyond me, but let's ignore than because Rishi said so.</p>
<p>The most blatant lie in this entire article is the idea that CBDCs will neither replace bank deposits nor cash. How do they expect us to believe that their technocratic control grid will work with financial independence from Big Gov?  </p>
<p>&rt;Threadneedle Street said no decision had been made but said a CBDC would represent a new form of <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">digital money</a> that it would issue for use by households and businesses. “It would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them,” he added.</p>
