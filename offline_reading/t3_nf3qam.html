        <p>Sorry you can't get the images. But they are very disturbing. So maybe it's a good thing. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;CHESAPEAKE — Lying under the covers, Kimberly Parker could feel bumps rising on her arm.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She didn’t bother to flip on the lights to inspect them. Her body was an achy wreck. Parker had slammed into a wall of exhaustion and crash-landed in her bed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It was not surprising. She had heard plenty of other people complain about feeling tired after getting their COVID-19 vaccines, and this was her second dose. She went to bed early March 30, hoping she could shrug off the fatigue by morning.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The next day, she felt pins and needles pricking under her skin and a swollen feeling in her arm. Strangely, though, not in the arm injected with the Moderna shot.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Standing in front of the mirror, she could finally see the rash. It looked like miniature cobblestone, paved down her arm.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As it progressed, it crept north, expanding to her chest. There was more — on a leg, the side of her face and smattered across her abdomen. The pelt of a shower helped her discover the pimple-like clusters that had reached her back.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I’m literally staring at it so often, I can see it spreading,” she said a week later.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Parker, a 31-year-old Chesapeake resident who works at a commercial real estate company, is one of the rare people to experience a skin reaction spanning her body after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Her rash — a measles-like explosion — caused her severe burning for nearly three weeks, but is otherwise considered harmless.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;About a month since the shot, the pain has dissipated, but her experience has left her frustrated with a health care system that allowed her to go weeks without answers. The pandemic — through its isolation — had caused her enough stress. Given the millions of people receiving vaccines she would have hoped for more attentiveness from medical professionals when something went awry.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the the first two weeks, she visited two walk-in clinics, called the local health department and Moderna, and saw her primary care physician, but only after many days of waiting for an appointment. Along the way, a nurse had dissuaded her over the phone from making an appointment with a dermatologist. Had it not been for that advice, Parker believes she might have received the right care sooner.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She posted on Facebook, grasping for answers from the armchair experts. Unsure of where to turn next, she reached out to the newspaper for help.After connecting with a reporter at The Virginian-Pilot, she was pointed to a dermatologist at Eastern Virginia Medical School. She also saw an allergy specialist the following week, through contacts The Pilot obtained from the Chesapeake Health Department.___“Moderna arm” and “COVID toes:” Those are nicknames for some of the vexing skin reactions vaccine recipients have experienced after getting their shots.Doctors are seeing bluish and purplish skin on people’s feet, a reaction some have also had from the coronavirus itself. Experts don’t know the cause of the frostbitten look, but the thinking is blood vessels are contracting from inflammation, causing a sluggishness of the blood in the toes. Though uncomfortable, the swelling subsides, and color eventually returns.Moderna arm, aka COVID arm, is an itchy, raised, red rash circling the injection site.Dr. Richard “Hal” Flowers, assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Virginia, said the arm rashes are the most commonly reported skin reaction. They fade away after a few days, though it’s not quite clear what’s triggering them.In the past, people with egg allergies have struggled with vaccines because they were developed in eggs. But some patients also are having delayed skin issues after receiving one of the new messenger RNA vaccines — Pfizer and Moderna’s shots — which were not made in eggs.“An immune system recognizes something as foreign and reacts to it,” Flowers said. “It could be a reaction to the vaccine components, because it’s supposed to start to recognize this virus, or it could be the polyethylene glycol — something that kind of keeps the vaccines soluble — and it’s a common allergen.”When Parker posted on social media her selfie pictures, friends suggested Moderna arm.She Googled it herself. Was that it?Hers was no itchy splotch. More to the point, it wasn’t on her injected arm.“I see ‘COVID arm,’” she told them. “But that’s not my rash.”Researchers recently looked at 414 skin reaction cases following COVID-19 vaccines between December and February and found that 83% came after Moderna shots, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. The study ended before Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose vaccine entered the fray, so it’s not included in the findings.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Other skin conditions included hives, measles-like flare-ups, full-body rashes and swelling linked to cosmetic fillers used to plump wrinkles.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Anecdotally, patients are reporting cases of shingles, too, the reactivation of a dormant chickenpox virus, which can cause painful skin blisters. But scientists have yet to establish a connection between the COVID-19 vaccines and that infection.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Based on the study, Parker’s condition, which most resembles a so-called “morbilliform eruption,” is even more unusual among the rare reactions. The term essentially means “measles-like,” though it isn’t measles.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Only 27 cases were documented in the study, with just 10 instances occurring after the second dose.</p>

        <p>Sounds like hives, an allergic reaction. Very small chance of it happening to everyone else… in fact these are the people we are trying to protect with the vaccine.</p>
