    <strong>COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by airborne transmission</strong>

<ul>
<li>Some infections can be spread by exposure to virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours. These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space.</li>
<li>This kind of spread is referred to as <strong>airborne transmission</strong> and is an important way that infections like tuberculosis, measles, and chicken pox are spread.</li>
<li>There is evidence that under certain conditions, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation. Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example while singing or exercising.</li>
<li>Under these circumstances, scientists believe that the amount of infectious smaller droplet and particles produced by the people with COVID-19 became concentrated enough to spread the virus to other people. The people who were infected were in the same space during the same time or shortly after the person with COVID-19 had left.</li>
<li>Available data indicate that it is much more common for the virus that causes COVID-19 to spread through close contact with a person who has COVID-19 than through airborne transmission.<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html#edn1"> [1]</a></li>

        <p>So no need to social distance right? This virus is apparently capable of doing everything but killing people under 50 without underlying health conditions.</p>

        <p>The problem is that nearly everyone has an 'underlying health condition' that CoVid-19 says "YUM... time to KEEEL ya!"</p>
<p>Minor high blood pressure, minor overweight... the list goes on of minor health issues that 75% of people have that CoVid-19 likes to eat those people like Skittles.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why that is and find a way to prevent that because those minor health issues aren't going anywhere.</p>

        <p>It seems maybe the CDC should leave their lab once in a while and explore the actual 
world around them</p>
