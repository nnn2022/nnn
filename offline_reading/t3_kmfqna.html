        <p>Wow the fact that they‚Äôre encouraging it that hard is fucking weird. </p>
<p>80% of workers turn down jobs that don‚Äôt offer it? That seems like a VERY made up stat.</p>
<p>Saves on child care? Yeah, because you can totally just throw your kid in a room and leave them for 8 hours while you try and focus on your work.</p>
<p>And lastly, this once again only appeals to the white collar types who are lucky enough to even have that opportunity, guess everyone else can go fuck themselves? The slaves that make your food and coffee, the plumbers who unclog your toilets, etc.</p>
<p>This whole thing is disgusting. So glad my boss prefers me in the office. Working from home sucked.</p>
<p>ETA: ‚ÄúStudies show that remote employees work longer hours and are more productive than in-office counterparts.‚Äù LOL. Now we can all be slaves working 12 hours a day from our homes! It‚Äôs just THAT convenient!!</p>
<p>ETA # 2: gig economy? Honestly most bosses would hate that idea unless the job is mindless crap. I‚Äôm sure most bosses would rather work alongside someone that they know can do the job well, knows the company, and has a good rapport with them. This just sounds like propaganda to try and make people think this is the normal. It‚Äôs NOT.</p>

        <p>YMMV but I fucking <em>hated</em> working from home. And I am one of the true Introverts‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that is now conflated with misanthropic, friendless, virgin shut-ins as an attempt to disguise their mental deficiencies as a simple set of personality traits. Also 80%? That can‚Äôt be accurate.</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this. My main question is... how popular are these ideas? They can use buzzwords and phrases all they want, but the bottom line when they say something like... "recruiting for knowledge workers can expand to new geographies and include previously underrepresented populations like disabled or chronically ill workers."</p>
<p>This can mean outsourcing, or really any number of things they want it to mean. In the past they have used feel good terms like "global equality" but what they actually mean is redistributing wealth from 1st world countries to 3rd world countries in order to level the playing field and make everything more equal. Maybe not a bad idea. Maybe a terrible idea. You know what they say about opinions. </p>
<p>They might couch it with the phrase "disabled or chronically ill." But what does this really mean for all the people on already existing social welfare programs like SSDI and similar. Are they to be disqualified because they are able to work from home? It doesn't seem like they are telling us the whole plan. Or maybe they don't even have a plan. Who knows. Also, it is <strong><em>clear</em></strong> that the WEF has drawn a line in between what they term "knowledge workers" who work remotely from home and whatever term (i have yet to find out what they are calling "the rest of us") they are using for people who are not "knowledge workers". I wonder how many "predictions" the WEF has gotten right over the years. This would give us a baseline for how much of what they have said in the past has been implemented.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. I am just fascinated by this.</p>

        <p>I fail to see how this is a bad thing. I've been working like this for the last 3 years and it's awesome. I get deadlines and where I work and how I work is up to me. So long as I get things done. I've finished work laying down in a boat in the middle of a lake sipping a beer. Why the hell would I want to suit up and sit in a stuffy office all day?</p>
<p>The gig stuff sucks because any anti stability is anti worker and I'm not in favour of that but all the rest of it is good progress.</p>

        <p>Oh no I don't mind the remote stuff if it comes with a good stable contract but what I sense probably will happen is due the the increase in supply in workers the remote economy will go hand in hand with the gig economy. Just yet another way to cut costs for megacorporporations and one other way you will be made to be more productive while not being compensated for it appropriately.</p>
