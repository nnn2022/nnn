<li><strong>Daniel Andrews</strong> has literally said his goal is to <strong>do “damage” to the economy</strong> (source in press release).</li>

That said, there's a class action lawsuit underway. There's also a few law firms fighting this. And check out this petition:

        <p>From https://lockdownsceptics.org/postcard-from-melbourne/</p>
<p>"I’ve given up trying to have an adult discussion with anyone here. I know of only two people who are lockdown sceptics like me. Every single other person you speak to is a complete COVID Lockdown fanatic who will not contemplate any other view. It’s quite unsettling. Aussies love to make out they are this rough, tough, she’ll be right, bunch of rebels when in reality they are a nation of supine, compliant rule followers who love nothing more than ‘dobbing in’ someone else for not following the most petty of rules and regulations. They are such a nation of bedwetters"</p>

        <p>one more story from Melbourne </p>
<p>"<em>Last weekend, I wanted to take my two youngest kids out to get an ice cream. Such frivolity is not a permitted reason to be out. To get around this edict, I asked my 13 year old daughter to write out a fake shopping list, so that if questioned by police on the reason we were out, we could produce the fake shopping list and plead that we were out in order to shop for vital supplies at the supermarket across the road from the ice cream shop. So my daughter is caught up in my law breaking lifestyle too."</em></p>

        <p>Wait! "Most people here seem to WANT this"? Why would any sentient human being want to live in a dictatorship? Are you saying that Australians are so petrified by a virus with a 0.26 percent mortality (mostly old folks) that they joyfully discard their liberty?

        <p>Idiots who are terrified of the virus because they've fallen for the media scare campaign and are convinced it will kill them if not stopped in its tracks by the government <strong><em>want</em></strong> this and more. They are more than happy to dob in their neighbours, friends, even their own family for being evil little virus spreaders breaking the rules designed to save them all. </p>
<p>They care about NOTHING except for covid and covid lives, people who are largely very elderly and aren't being protected by lockdowns in the first place. Truth is they don't actually care about those lives as they never have cared about the same lives that have always been vulnerable to viruses like Influenza.</p>
<p>I can't live this way if the NSW premier does this.</p>

        <p>This reminds me of the wuhan lockdown actually, where they litteraly barricaded peoples doors, and police came with food to their houses. I thought Australia was like one of biggest oppositions to China and CCP?</p>

        <p>Curfew is probably an effort to quell gatherings. Or at least that's the given logic behind it, you aren't wrong about it forcing people out at the same time. There's a lot of people who shop late or otherwise work to a different schedule than it allows.</p>

        <p>To be fair, politicians and health officials here get up on TV daily telling people the virus does not discriminate and can kill anyone any time, we can't get complacent blah blah. Every death is an avoidable tragedy which we are all in some way responsible for.</p>
<p>The media has created constant fear since February. We are also being bombarded with 'long lasting health effects!!' as the new 'be afraid' tactic, particularly for young people.</p>

        <p>I had that sort of leniency in my opinion of people back in March, even a bit in April. Aside from the fact that at this point anyone and everyone should have noticed that they know more people who get knocked out with the flu every year than have been sick with Covid; it's the demand that everyone else "stay the fuck home". If they are cowering in their homes they are no safer because the rest of us are forced to do so. Yet they insist on the army and police putting their boots on our necks so that they... what? Don't feel like they are missing out on society by being hermits?</p>

        <p>Are they still doing this? Are you serious the government officials are? I don't watch so have no idea that the officials are still acting like it doesn't discriminate when our own stats (which include people who like an elderly local terminally ill didn't even have symptoms) prove that it does. Fuck these people.</p>
<p>Also death isn't avoidable. These deaths could have easily been people who died from the flu this year or next or just about any other reason. Death isn't avoidable and every death isn't tragic, sometimes it's just life. Trying to hold it off by not living is a greater tragefy.</p>

        <p>Oh my fucking god this is sickening and blatant lies. Do they have any idea the number of children and up in hospital for influenza and even die? More than covid! In fact influenza is among the top causes of death for children under 1, and aged 1-14 years but mostly targets under 5s. The flu targets children unlike covid. You don't base statements on outliers, and I would like evidence they are in hospital for covid and not for something else and tested positive. </p>
<p>This is an old person's illness, shown by the statistics. It poses less or equal a threat to the flu for those under 65 or 70 years. We don't get hysterical about that and live in fear. Trying to induce anxiety in people who are not at risk, acting like this virus causes complications in and kills people indiscriminately is a <strong><em>lie</em></strong> </p>
<p>Someone young testing positive to the virus doesn't mean they have been <em>stricken</em> by it. Language like <em>this virus can strike anyone</em> is designed to induce fear, when the vast majority are so sick that they wouldn't even know they were infected (asymptomatic) or wouldn't see a doctor and would normally shrug it off as having a weird cold and that is it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cases are not a disaster, or an emergency. There will never be zero cases of this virus in the world again including here</em></strong></p>

        <p>This is pretty accurate but I'd like to clarify:</p>
<p>- curfew is 8pm - 5am (still ridiculous we have one)</p>
<p>- The permit is to go to and from approved work. You don't need a permit to go to the supermarket or for a walk but police are stopping people in cars and on the street fairly frequently to ask what they're doing. </p>
<p>- We did have a period of about 1 month where the lockdown was loosened in June/July. Basically all that meant though at the height of 'freedom' was max 20 people in cafes/restaurants, retail started to open up and you could have guests to your house. </p>
<p>We had 6 days of a further loosening in which cinemas, gyms etc. had opened with distancing and lots of regulations. 6 DAYS. And then we were put back into lockdown because cases started rising. </p>
<p>And yes it's becoming very clear mess up of hotel quarantine was the cause not the opening up of society.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What is going in Melbourne is a <em>travesty</em>. We have no finite end to this. The government has made it clear it won't stop until the virus is basically gone. That's their plan. We started our stage 3 lockdown 1 MONTH ago. We have had mandatory masks at all times out of the home for 2+ weeks now. We are now in stage 4 lockdown AND CASES ARE NOT FALLING. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We are tired. We are jobless. We are hopeless.</p>

        <p>Hey cheers so much for this, have made those changes now.</p>
<p>The 1 month - I still count that as lockdown. We were in stage 3. Yes, we could sit in a restaurant but had to sign in and give all your personal details, etc. It still felt like a lockdown - at least to me.</p>
<p>I'm open to discussing it though - I want this press release to be as accurate and non-biased as possible.</p>

        <p>We have a couple of government schemes set up and some things like rent relief and business grants. But it's a patchy system where a lot of people miss out and a lot of people for no reason are earning astronomically more on the scheme than they did before. </p>
<p>You could for example have been earning $300 a week in a retail store pre-COVID and under the Jobkeeper scheme, you are now guaranteed $750 a week until the end of September. However, there are so many industries and individuals who do not qualify and are getting next to nothing. </p>
<p>The issue also is how long this has gone on for. Maybe March-June was survivable. But it's August and people and businesses are at the point where costs are too high with no money coming in and they're folding even with government assistance. </p>
<p>I went to the city for the last time the other day and there are so many For Lease signs and places permanently closing. It breaks my heart. Melbourne is normally such a beautiful, proud and vibrant city which is built on small businesses!</p>

        <p>March to June was not survivable. Our lockdown wasn't as bad as yours where I am and many businesses are gone, many will soon be gone, and others will eventually be gone over the next year or two.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I only say basically because I've been pretty lucky, personally. My school has a good distance learning program set up, and there are some upsides to this whole thing, though they're very minimal. I've still spent most of the year actually at school, even though a good 1/3 of it has been taken up by distance learning. Of course, this will all change if I can't go back at the end of these six weeks, for the last month of Year 12, and if I can't do any of our Year 12 traditions (Muck-up day, Valedictory, final assembly...etc), because then it really will have been ruined.</p>

Year 12 was precious to me knowing I would never again spend 6 hours with my best friends and peers all day 5 days a week again, or my teachers I was close to.

        <p>It's okay, big boy Russell Crowe says Andrews is doing a good job so everything must be sound. And when you inevitably come out the other side of this, enjoy more cases reported because that's what will happen. Look at Aberdeen, Scotland. Fuckers there have done something similar with only 50 odd people testing positive, it is mental!</p>

        <p>Most Australian people don't have any idea about that false flag.. even with 24 years to think it over.  Meanwhile all redacted evidence on Port Arthur is sealed until 2025.. the same year that this COVID-19 exercise is going to have run its course.  </p>
<p>That same year Australia will be in possession of $5bn worth of spy drones to "protect the country from China" (<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/430958-australia-buys-us-drones/">https://www.rt.com/news/430958-australia-buys-us-drones/</a>).  </p>

        <p>Daniel Andrews is a traitor. He said we are in stage 4 for 6 weeks. However he doesn't have the legal authority to do that. His state of disaster can only be implemented for 1 month maximum. If you look at the official declaration the lockdown is exactly 1 month. He can then declare a state of emergency 1 month at a time up to 6 months, then I suspect he will implement state of disaster again. He is a fucking liar and the blood on his hands will justify everything he has coming to him.</p>

        <p>Look up Victorian gavernment gazettes, all declarations need to go through that, I found it in the special edition on August 2nd I think. I'm on mobile now but if you go through my posts I linked the PDF recently. The acts which grant the powers are the public health act and the emergency management act.</p>
