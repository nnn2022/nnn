    <strong>Interesting information pulled from the CDC website</strong>
    <p><p>There isn't a Fauci out there that can convince me that sars-cov 2 is worse than H1N1 was back in 2009-2010. We are being subjected to the greatest worldwide scam of all time.</p>
<p>We have to start asking ourselves, why is sars-cov 2 being handled so differently?</p>
<p>From the CDC(read over these numbers a couple of times and compare them to sars-cov 2):</p>
<p><em>"From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1) virus.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1) virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.** Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1) virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age."</em></p>

        <p>why? profit. control. and the soul.</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jv26ro/vaccine_needs_to_be_stored_at_70_degrees/</p>
<p>SS -"This means that at this temperature it is inert or not active. That means at -70C there is a very limited amount of latent and/or kinetic energy that can be expressed.</p>
<p>If it were an explosive, biological material, a virus or bacteria that could rapidly grow, <strong>a biological nano-machine</strong> that had to stay in stasis until delivered that would all make sense but a simple vaccine with common adjuvants does not add up. </p>
<p>The only time I have seen injectable material that had to be maintained at these kinds of extreme temperatures it was a modeled AIDS-like virus used to transport RNA to other cells, meaning a biological engine used to splice DNA and alter the genetic material of the target cells.</p>
<p>I know what happens with binary replication in cellular transport systems. The first injected virus changes a cell, which creates 2 copies, those 2 copies change 2 cells which creates 4 copies, it doubles at each interaction. At some point half the body changes the other half and the host dies."</p>
<p>*This was info by someone listed as Dave Meckanic online and I found it very interesting so I looked into this RNA vaccine situation more.  </p>
<p>"A new class of vaccines, “RNA vaccines”, has recently been developed. RNA vaccines rely on a different way to mimic infection. Compared to previous vaccines, this method is more robust, more versatile, and yet, equally efficient. Therefore, the RNA vaccine technology holds great promise to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases, such as influenza or cancer.</p>
<p>Have you heard about RNA vaccines? This technology recently made the news when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation invested $53 million in the German company, CureVac, which specializes in the development of these vaccines" - Graduate Student Group at the Harvard Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>"mRNA vaccines, trick the body into producing some of the viral proteins itself. They work by using mRNA, or messenger RNA, which is the molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action. Inside a cell, mRNA is used as a template to build a protein. ‘An mRNA is basically like a pre-form of a protein and its (sequence encodes) what the protein is basically made of later on,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.</p>
<p>"To produce an mRNA vaccine, scientists produce a synthetic version of the mRNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins. This mRNA is delivered into the human body, whose cells read it as instructions to build that viral protein, and therefore create some of the virus’s molecules themselves. These proteins are solitary, so they do not assemble to form a virus. The immune system then detects these viral proteins and starts to produce a defensive response to them.</p>
<p>Because mRNA vaccines are only now beginning to be tested in humans, there are a lot of fairly basic unknowns which can only be answered through human trials. ‘What is really the current challenge, I think, is to understand whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response in the human and to understand, for example, which quantities of mRNA will be needed to do this,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.</p>
<p>Other outstanding questions include whether the proteins that have been chosen for the vaccine are the right ones to prevent a coronavirus infection in the body, how targeted the immune response is to this particular coronavirus, how long any immunity would last, and whether it causes side-effects such as increased inflammatory responses like redness and swelling or, in the worst case, aggravates disease." - Horozen the EU research and innovation magazine</p>

        <p>Would you happen to know what temperature a meningitis vaccine would have to be stored at? More specifically, the meningitis vaccine that was used in Africa starting 2010? </p>
<p>Back in 2010, a doctor, by the name of Nancy Messonnier, was asked to develop and distribute a meningitis vaccine for everyone in Africa. The program was called MenAfriVac. The founder of and largest donor to MenAfriVac is the Gates Foundation. Today, Nancy Messonnier is the director of the NCIRD, National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Disease. The NCIRD works within the CDC. Messonnier is one of two doctors that was given the lead on Operation Warp Speed. </p>
<p>They had some issues with the vaccine Messonnier developed. They had issues with its storage while transporting. At least that was the excuse the organization gave after the vaccine injured a number African children. </p>
<p>I have been researching MenAfriVac and Messonnier for a few months now. The MenAfriVac program was transitioned into something called MenAfriNet. The Gates Foundation and the WHO refer to MenAfriNet as a "vaccine and disease surveillance program". It is a system and program that keeps track of most of the African population, in the name of health and safety.</p>
<p>I have found more than one similarity between MenAfriVac and, the program being quietly rolled out all over the world, COVAX. The people and organizations that started, funded and worked within MenAfriVac, are the same people and organizations that started, are funding and working within COVAX. From everything I can tell thus far, COVAX is a billion dollar, multinational MenAfriVac. COVAX seems to be following very similar processes to the ones MenAfriVac used for vaccine development, program implementation, marketing, funding, etc. Which leads to believe, at some point, COVAX will transition into a "worldwide vaccine and disease surveillance program". </p>
<p>I don't have much experience with the medical side of things. I am just someone independent journalists contract when they can't get their hands on certain kinds of information they need. So, I am not familiar with vaccine storage temperatures. I am really interested in learning more about storage and handling of the meningitis vaccine that was used in 2010. If I am not mistaken, MenAfriVac, was the name of the program and the actual vaccine that was used.</p>

        <p>Suggest you poke around google scholar or ask a professor or pharma person.</p>
<p>Good luck with the research.</p>
<p>Sounds typical. We know they are crooks by now.</p>
<p>Are they going to pay for their crimes or what?</p>
