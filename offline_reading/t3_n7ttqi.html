        <p>&rt;We also had data from the Diamond Princess showing not only that the mortality rate was much lower than we had initially thought, but that there was a direct correlation between advanced age and greater risk.[2] <strong>At this point it should have been more than evidence that focused protection was the way to go</strong>, but this was not what happened. Instead, despite the fact that many of us carried on per usual in March, the very next month the entire world would shut down.</p>
<p>Interesting that as the entire world was being shut down, nursing homes were ordered to admit active Covid cases- integrating the very sick with those same people for whom focused protection should have been afforded.</p>
<p>This was an entire year ago and the MSM would have it memory-holed.</p>
