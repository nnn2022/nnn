    <strong>I’m so sick of this</strong>
    <p><p>When did questioning something turn me into a crazy republican? When does taking care of myself without putting an unknown vaccine into my body become such a bad thing. It’s scary that this is what we have come too. Can’t I have a choice as to whether I want this vaccine? I already had Covid why do I need a vaccine? </p>
<p>Isn’t it a red flag to anyone that they’re pushing this so much? Why? I’m just tired of this, I’m labeled as crazy for questioning things</p></p>

        <p>You don't even have to question things. You can simply read directly from the FDA's documents and get called a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>&rt;"Get the vaccine to protect others"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"The vaccine lasts longer than natural immunity</p>
<p>At this time, there are limited data to address whether the vaccine can prevent transmission of the virus from person to person. In addition, at this time data are not available to determine how long the vaccine will provide protection.</p>

<p>&rt;There aren't any bad long term side effects and you won't get ADE</p>

<p>Simply directly quoting stuff off the FDA website will get you banned in most forums now. I've never seen anything like this. Before this drug, every single drug that has ever been advertised to me came with an absurdly long warning about risks and side effects. The side-effect lists have been parodied by comedian skits numerous times, since most pharma commercials are 30 seconds of them pumping the drug, and then 2 minutes of them reading horrible side effects off. Now when it comes to this drug, stating any side effect at all is borderline illegal.</p>

        <p>Vaccines are not about controlling spread, they are about controlling disease. By controlling the disease, you do reduce spread, as your body carries a lower viral load if you're infected and vaccinated. I don't think anyone expected the spread to stop... maybe some nonsense on cnn or fox, but I've never heard anything on the news about controlling the spread, and I watch everything from Forbes to nbc and independent media... and even a few radicals on either end. </p>
<p>Flu shots have to updated every year to account for this. Swine flu has now made its way into the yearly flu shots, and covid will be likely be the next yearly addition.</p>

<p>And as a fellow mid 30s dude, you're likely not as strong as you think. I got my first adult flu at 31, and almost put me in the hospital. I eat incredibly well and exercise and all that, and it still put me down for over 2 weeks. I suspect I had covid, as well, and that worse slightly worse.</p>

<p>the average viral load was negligibly different in the vaccinated, and the highest viral load was in the vaccinated.  (the bar on the right extending lower means fewer PCR cycles were needed to detect it, meaning higher viral load)</p>

        <p>I belive what you are referring to is summed up in the paragraph, towards the end:</p>
<p>"Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar."</p>
<p>They were not directly studying viral load, admitted they did not validate the suggestion, and that more testing was needed. They could be right, but total viral load (blood, lungs, sinuses) different that what is seen in the sample (a single swab) used in a lab. Unfortunately, that's not very definitive.</p>

        <p>the data in the graph directly contradicts their wording.  either the data is incorrect, or the wording is incorrect.  i tend to go with people saying whatever they want.  specifically with your comment, they add the word "breakthrough" in front of cases, which is a fucking copout, because according to the CDC, a case is not breakthrough unless it's under 28 ct and has hospitalization or death.</p>
<p>a higher viral load means it's positive at a lower PCR ct.  the data clearly shows negligibly lower average viral load in the vaccinated, and significantly higher viral load at the lowest ct detected.</p>

        <p>Nothing about their summary contradicts their findings. They had 1 data point, and admitted to not having  enough information to make an actual assessment about viral load. There is a HUGE difference between in vitro and in vivo studies. This was an in vitro study, which means they are only looking at things like cell cultures, not the entire biology of a person or animal.</p>

        <p>&rt; What are you even talking about? The authors of this study were clear: they did not have enough data to determine viral load.</p>
<p>they did not say that.  every ct increase is another viral amplification cycle.  if the test for a sample is not positive until 30 cycles, and another sample is already positive at only 25 cycles, the 25 ct test has higher viral load.  period.  that's literally how PCR works.   lower ct = higher viral load.  always.  what they disclaimed was putting a numeric value on the viral load levels based on ct.</p>
<p>the reason why they disclaim it, and rightfully do so, is because labs can run all samples at x ct period while other labs run incrementally until positive or hitting an upper threshold (usually 40 ct).  even worse, the testing protocols in many labs are different when they know a person is vaxed vs unvaxed.  vaxed usually get incremental while unvaxed can get fixed.  because this outbreak is almost 500 people, and most people were tested at different labs, you don't know whether and how many were just tested at fixed ct, or even what each lab used (because it's not standard), vs people who were tested incrementally.  we know at least some were tested incrementally though, as they had positive results under 15 ct in both groups.  the max in the unvaxed group was 35 ct, but we don't know whether that was incremental or just that the lab they went to runs everyone unvaxed at 35 ct.  similarly, the max in the vaxed was 40 ct, and it's likely, but unknown, whether they run everyone who is vaxed up to 40 ct to know whether they should report it as a positive breakthrough, or positive non-breakthrough.</p>
<p>as they state on the graph, the bars rep the 75th percentile of test results, and the whiskers are the min/max.  the min and lower 75th are both lower ct on the vaxed group.  definitionally, that means the viral load is higher.  the only question is how much, which they didn't have enough information to conclude based on the tests.  that's why they can't put a number on it.</p>
<p>&rt; Are you trying to take their work out of context, to fit your political goals? Gotta stop those evil, evil vaccines, right?</p>
<p>i'm not the one with buyer's remorse, feeling guilty over injecting myself with an untested drug that now has been repeatedly shown to be ineffective at what it was supposed to do, while increasingly being reported to have more and more severe side effects.  you're more angry that other people didn't blindingly make the same decision as you.</p>

<p>Might. Could. More studies required.

        <p>they're disclaiming the exact numbers because i'm not sure there's been much study on exactly what the differentiation is per cycle incrementally.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf</a></p>
<p>&rt;A typical RT-PCR assay will have a maximum of 40 thermal cycles. The lower the Ct value the higher the quantity of viral genetic material in the sample (as an approximate proxy for viral load). Ct values obtained in this way are semi-quantitative and are able to distinguish between high and low viral load. A 3-point increase in Ct value is roughly equivalent to a 10-fold decrease in the quantity of viral genetic material.</p>
<p>it's well known and scientifically undisputed that higher ct = lower viral load.  that's fundamentally how PCR works.  they just don't know exactly how much viral load.  from cycle to cycle.</p>

        <p>Oh that's my problem? Wow. Thank you for your insight, edge lord. I wish I could be stunning and brave, like you.</p>
<p>They can not make a determination on vital load because they had 1 swabbed sample from each person. That is incredibly inconclusive because viruses also live in your lungs, mouth, blood, etc. The SAMPLE they got had more virus present, not the entire person. They could be several reasons, for that, but this study did not investigate. </p>
<p>Taking a result of 1 in vitro test and  generalizing it to the ENTIRE ORGANISM is not how science done. Maybe enroll in a community college and take 1 chemistry or bio class. It's pretty clear you are having serious difficulty actually deciphering scientific  data, and cannot tell the difference between different types of lab analysis and what they actually mean.</p>

<p>It's time to aggressively and peacefully not comply with their demands and protest.</p>

        <p>I was labeled crazy when I started seeing how psychologically manipulated humanity was. Everything outside designed to degrade the person past the point of no return. Hence why people suffer because they feel lost. People weren't taught to question literally anything in life. Question religion; met with disdain. Question societies mold; met with disdain. Question the modern dating structure; called an incel. Only because I knew people were hurting but didn't know why until I did.</p>
<p>What's happened in the last 1.5 years goes well beyond just covid.</p>

        <p>How and where are you questioning things? There is a lot of disinformation going around, with covid, and people do get lit up for sharing it. I can definitely see how some of it may be purely skeptical, but context and framing are important. Things are hot right now. If someone is going off on you, it's highly likely it's because of a personal experience with covid... or they misinterpreted your intent and took it as an assault to reason.</p>

        <p>When did questioning something turn me into a crazy republican?
- it doesn't. questioning is good. But be careful where you get your answers, because there is a lot of misinformation around.
When does taking care of myself without putting an unknown vaccine into my body become such a bad thing?
- These vaccines are new. Developed for a new disease that is causing a pandemic. They aren't unknown. It's a bad thing because you can get really sick or get long lasting effects after getting COVID. You will also likely infect more people if you are not vaccinated and get COVID.
Can’t I have a choice as to whether I want this vaccine?
- Yes, but currently people are enforcing strict rules to prevent infections from spreading. I don't think there is or will ever be a mandate. However, unvaccinated people provide a better breeding ground for more dangerous mutations, so by not getting vaccinated you might be self-perpetuating the situation.
I already had Covid why do I need a vaccine? 
- Me too, I only needed one shot of Moderna. This protects you a little better than just having had covid once.
Isn’t it a red flag to anyone that they’re pushing this so much? Why?
- Have you seen what's happening all over the world to sick people? Do you like lockdowns and curfews? Doesn't that warrant some urgency?
I don't think anyone is crazy for questioning things, I DO think there's too much FUD being spread.</p>

        <p>Rule where I live is that if you've had covid within 6 months of your vaccination, one shot should suffice. So I am currently fully vaccinated with one shot.
Haven't experienced any downsides so far.</p>

        <p>It should not have been. Trump made it made it that way. Negligence in "budget cuts" included cutting the Obama pandemic task force, and a fraud tax force (which led to the cares act money going to large corporations). Then he tried to gas light us all by saying he was concerned the whole time, when he was clearly not. He also then started calling it the china virus and wuhan flu, and stopped  international travel with china... when at the time, the data was showing the infections were coming from Europe. There was plenty of other nonsense, like Pelosi's go hug an Asian campaign, but it all paled in comparison to trumps ineptitude and childish way of communicating.</p>
<p>Then the Republican party refused to mitigate trump, started pushing back on public health strategies, and largely refuted the vaccines...all while more people were dying in this country since the Spanish flu or WWII. </p>
<p>If you overlay a vaccination rate map with an election map, they are almost identical. It's unfortunate that the skeptics in the middle have been swept in with the Republicans, but it's not suprising. The majority of this country is done with the bullshit, and is waiting on everyone else to either get vaccinated or sick so we can move on. Unfortunately, your average skeptic looks like they are preventing that, and people are ready to throw down about it.</p>
