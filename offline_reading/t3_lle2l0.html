    <strong>Hey guys, this is a cross post from my blog, wanna see what you guys think of it</strong>
    <p><p>I know this past year has been hard for us. The events that unfolded around us this last year have been difficult, and many of us have struggled or even lost loved ones. But if we stick together, we will come out on top. </p>
<p>The world is moving down a path that is difficult for us to follow. No matter what other people try and tell you, plant yourself into the ground and stick to your beliefs. By the time this is all over, everyone will be apologizing to us!</p>
<p>I went into the store to get  mayo today, and I laughed for ten minutes looking at the sheep. They were all rushing around with gloves, hand sanitizers, face shields, and some of them were even DOUBLE MASKED. Oh, I remember when masks were bad, but wash your hands. Then it was ‚Äúwear your masks or you‚Äôll die.‚Äù Then it was ‚Äúmake sure you have a plexiglass face shield, four pairs of gloves, seven cans of Lysol, three gallons of hand sanitizer, socially distance 100 feet away all with masks covering every part of your body‚Äù.</p>
<p>I am sure that more people end up dying of suffocation than ‚Äúdying‚Äù of the ‚Äúchina-virus‚Äù especially when you consider the 99.999999999999% survivability rate. I just lounged through the store with my face full of air and feeling like a real American. Several of them tried to suffocate me with their masks, but as soon as I started ‚Äúcoughing‚Äù, they ran away squealing at me like a pig. Man, the stupidity of some people never ceases to be absolutely hilarious. </p>
<p>I heard the governor talking about more lockdowns yesterday. I cannot understand how anyone, even those half-brained socialists can support this. I-, as an American, have the right to leave my home, go anywhere I want, do anything I want to. These are MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. Every single day, these fascists try to steal our freedoms away. </p>
<p>These ‚ÄúD*mocrats‚Äù are going to take away our right to speak. Our right to own property! Soon, our right to live! </p>
<p>Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at these vaccines. The radical left-wing is trying to kill us all by<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/07/08/they-want-to-put-chips-inside-us-kanye-west-cites-debunked-anti-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/?sh=569ab30524b8"> injecting us with microchips</a>, nano-bombed chemicals by telling us it will save us from a hoax of a virus they created! Not to mention the historical precedent that ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù cause autism. Then they try to create policies that help the mentally disabled, the nerve of these people.</p>
<p>I really do wonder sometimes how they think how stupid we can be. I have spent this entire time ignoring their ‚Äúadvice‚Äù and have been fine. I have only gotten sick three times this last year, and my temperature only went to 103 degrees. I had trouble breathing once but when I asked my pastor, he told me it was the common flu! </p>
<p>This only tells us that now is the time to stand stronger than ever. The devil feeds on the ‚ÄúD*mocrats‚Äù and gets stronger with them. We must fight against him and make sure they never get power over us again!</p>
<p>Times like these I like to remember ,what a great day it was when Trump took office and started his quest against the corrupt leftists that maneuver the deep state against free thinkers like us who challenge their ‚Äúnew normals‚Äù and ‚Äúscience‚Äù through our own research. </p>
<p>He knew that they<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barack-Obamas-Birth-Certificate-Fraud/dp/0983759251/ref=pd_sbs_1?pd_rd_w=VcwEK&amp;pf_rd_p=3ec6a47e-bf65-49f8-80f7-0d7c7c7ce2ca&amp;pf_rd_r=XXXE45FZG2V7DC7SVWH9&amp;pd_rd_r=66291437-bc32-4fda-926e-7926d528ee82&amp;pd_rd_wg=4Rz53&amp;pd_rd_i=0983759251&amp;psc=1"> forged Obama's birth certificate</a> . He knew how they rigged the election. He knew that hydroxychloroquine<a href="https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study"> could cure anything</a>. He knew that they organized 9/11. He knew that they were trying to implement Sharia Law. He knew how they steal children for their underground ring and eat them. He knew the truth. </p>
<p>How did the dirty dog D*mocrats repay him? By denying Trump from helping real Americans! By rigging an election against him! By constantly spouting lies from the fake news media! This is what the Gospel of Q has revealed to us. </p>
<p>But then he abandoned us and condemned the riots! We did those riots for him! How does he not realize that? Looks like another politician who joined the radical left, hate to see it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Today, I tried to preach these truths to the brainwashed youth. I tried to use my ninth twitter account to lead them to the path of salvation, but it got banned for ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù like the rest . These days Twitter has limited our right to speak and voice our opinions. It has become the right hand of the Orwellian deep state aiding their 1984 globalist takeover just like the rest of the radical left social media. These fascist tactics are clear as daylight.  They claim to be ‚Äúanti-fascists‚Äù, but the oppression has gotten worse that Nazi Germany. Every day they attack more of our kind while we try to help them.</p>
<p>Soon, it may be time to give up on these people. They have made their harebrained conspiracies part of their lives and will never let them go, no matter how many times we show them the light.</p>
<p>Anyways guys, I wanted to end today by reminding you to do your own research and be open-minded to different viewpoints. That is what makes it different from the ‚Äúsheep‚Äù. Just remember that all the mainstream news sources are all corrupt and trying to brainwash you while any ‚Äúresearch‚Äù you get from them is flawed and should not be considered in any form. Anybody that tries to tell you that you should wear masks, and should social distance be an idiot that is bought what the media's been selling. Wake up and see what they are not telling you, don‚Äôt let them use fear-tactics and fake news to cow you into submission. </p>
<p>Have a great Tuesday!</p></p>
