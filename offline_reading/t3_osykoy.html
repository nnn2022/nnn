    <strong>Legal letters or templates for universities/employers mandating vaccines. Request.</strong>
    <p><p>Heyo! I saw a letter on this sub a few weeks back where someone wrote a strongly worded letter with legal threats in regards to a vaccine mandate, and was hoping someone had a copy or knew where i could find the post? I dug through this sub but cannot find it. </p>
<p>Any other legal info that I can pass along to a family member would be greatly appreciated. His university is forcing him to get the vaccine to be able to travel, making it so he wouldnt be able to play hockey and pursue his lifelong career if he refuses. This shit is so fucking evil and infuriating. </p>
<p>ty for the help</p></p>

        <p>Its not the letter template but here is some other useful information.</p>
<p>Know the law, the compromised U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has ruled that employers CAN require vaccination as a condition of employment (this ruling will have to be challenged in a court of law, so do not approach your employer with the false attitude of having the higher legal ground, they will likely dismiss you since the EEOC is backing tyranny):
https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws</p>
<p>Know the law, the compromised Department of Justice has said that vaccine mandates are legal:
https://www.yahoo.com/now/doj-says-legal-mandate-covid-173600309.html</p>
<p>Legal information about vaccine exemption status state by state (know your rights in your state before you approach an employer):
https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx</p>
<p>FLCCC Alliance list of Ivermectin friendly physicians:
https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-in-covid-19/how-to-get-ivermectin/</p>
<p>One these physicians may be willing to write a medical exemption.</p>
<p>Nothing in this post should be taken as medical or legal advice.</p>
