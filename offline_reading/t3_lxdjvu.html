        <p>I work as a cna caregiver for an assisted living facility. We have had a couple outbreaks of covid, but despite being populated exclusively be old people with age related illnesses we have had zero covid deaths. What I HAVE seen is deaths caused by the lockdowns. The elderly NEED socialization and especially those with dementia NEED routes. I have seen drastic declines in mental health leading to drastic declines in physical health. In the past year we have lost many residents that were relatively healthy before the lockdowns, we even lost a couple to assisted suicide. So when these pro-lockdowners ask "Dont you care about the elderly?" I explain this to them and say "Dont you DARE imply I dont care!"</p>

        <p>The good ol’ drunk driving analogy appears again for the trillionth time. My fav. The trusted fallback for doomers who are too dumb and brainwashed to come up with a single original thought.</p>

        <p>The pro-mask and lockdown people love to use these &lt;insert governmental regulation here&rt; comparisons.  The tropes are getting old.  Seatbelts, food safety, speed limits, whatever.  </p>
<p>What it really boils down to is that they want to prevent death and avoid all risk.  Death is a part of life, and we used to be capable of making rational decisions about whether or not certain activities were too risky for us.  No longer.  </p>
<p>Some people won't fly because they are terrified of crashing.  Fine, don't get on an airplane--but according to the mask/lockdown freaks' logic, we should ban air travel.  Others won't eat in restaurants because they think it's gross when others handle their food.  Same logic--no more restaurants for any of us.</p>
<p>If you are afraid of COVID, stay home, wear your masks, wear two masks if you think that helps.  But don't project that fear onto the rest of the planet, which is what has been happening.</p>

        <p>Thats what I don’t get. If I thought I was vulnerable to the virus I would stay home, I wouldn’t expect the people who didn’t think they were vulnerable to stay home as well</p>

        <p>It's impossible to understand until you think beyond the virus.  It's the biggest story on Planet Earth since the birth of Jesus Christ.  Vast fortunes being made, money printed that taxpayers will pay.  Election laws changed in the 11th hour to allow late mail-in ballots.  Testing, testing, testing. Cases, cases, cases.  Vaccines!</p>
<p>Follow the money...it is the root of all evil.</p>
