    <strong>I'm surprised they haven't charged a price for certain vaccines to create demand</strong>
    <p><p>If they came out of the gate with "vaccine will cost $1000 per dose" everyone would be up in arms about how it's not fair that only rich people can get it.  This of course would increase demand, because poor people want what rich people have. And then the government could have swept in as the savior and "forced" pharma to lower their prices, eventually concluding with the government paying for it. </p>
<p>Things seem worth more to people when they have some skin in the game.</p></p>

        <p>They would never do this. They want to get as many vaccinations as possible. In fact, they are incentivizing it by paying people to get it, free things paid for by their company, a bunch of PTO... you name it. Theyâ€™re trying to motivate people to get it.</p>

        <p>why bother?  their fear campaign is working great.  and the government already is paying for it.  you think these companies are just pumping out millions of doses out of the goodness of their hearts?  the same people that bitch about big pharma making so much money on necessary drugs are now cheerleading the biggest wealth transfer to big pharma in history.</p>
