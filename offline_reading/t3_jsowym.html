    <strong>A good buddy of mine nearly killed himself</strong>
    <p><p>One of my friends I've known since I was a kid attempted suicide last night.</p>
<p>Why might you ask?</p>
<p>He's been stuck inside of a shitty apartment with a roommate who is also a friend, and thankfully was there for him. He's been there for three months now. Only allowed to leave once a day for shopping or exercise, not both. He and I have talked a lot during this display of political corruption, and he was doing fine for the first few weeks</p>
<p>But weeks turned into months.</p>
<p>I was talking with him once again this afternoon, trying to see if was alright. He told me that the doctors found almost no vitamin D in him whatsoever. The poor man hasn't been able to see the sun for three months. </p>
<p>This is what I find sickening. These blind idiots who think the government is enforcing masks and lockdowns because the government cares are not only incorrect, they are entirely braindead, happily accepting anything the media tells them.</p>
<p>If the government truly cared about anyone, my friend wouldn't have tried to take his own life. </p>
<p>These bastards have taken too much from me and my family. My brothers highschool graduation, my grandparents, and my freedom.</p>
<p>They nearly took my friend.</p>
<p>Politicians who exploit millions of people for their own personal gain are sub-human filth. They do not deserve to be treated as humans, they do not deserve the rights us humans have, and they do not deserve to be in the positions they hold.</p>
<p>They nearly killed my friend, for what?</p></p>

        <p>That's fucked up. If possible maybe you should have him live with you so he's not cramped up</p>

        <p>That's disgusting what these bastards are doing knowing full well that it effects people's mental health and physical health too! Is your friend living somewhere that has a full lockdown or can he go out and about for walks and get some sun and fresh air?</p>

        <p>He's stuck in LA. He was living down there for a job opportunity around when the shit hit the fan. It wasn't insanely harsh at first but it just gradually got worse, seemingly reaching peak nasty about 3 months ago. </p>
<p>And believe it or not, but since Joe Biden has been elected restrictions are gradually being lifted. </p>
<p>Thankfully he's been able to get outside more often and last I heard he's planning on moving back out where I live</p>

        <p>I'm here in LA too and you can bet the dictator we have here is something else honestly! So glad to hear that he is able to get outside and get fresh air, honestly the weather has been great so far. I know since Biden got elected, it's like sleepy Joe is going to cure us of this scamdemic</p>
