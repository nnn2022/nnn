    <strong>I'm thinking of printing out questionnaires for anyone that ask me to get the vax.</strong>
    <p><p>Luckily, I haven't had to deal with anyone that persistent or any door to door covid truthers.  But if they do ramp it up I want to be prepared and instead of tell them what I think.  I want them to tell me what they think.  And if they are too lazy to fill out my questionnaire then they never really cared and were just trying to pat themselves on that back for asking.</p>
<p>Here are my questions so far:</p>
<p>1.5mil die of diaherria a year. 500k kids.  Why didn't we stop the world for them? Is it because their is no profit to be made?</p>
<p>Why did the cdc director say impending doom then lift a bunch of mandates?</p>
<p>If covid is so deadly why did we elect at 78 year old before there was even a vaccine ? Wouldn't we want someone young like Tulsi?  Seems way too risky if it's that dangerous.</p>
<p>If Pelosi is so scared of covid why would she go to a salon when they were shut down.  Did she really risk her life for a haircut?</p>
<p>If they mayor of Chicago thinks covid is so deadly.  Why would she stand in a crowd with no mask screaming into a microphone? Isn't she scared of dying and spreading the disease.</p>
<p>If covid is so deadly why would the mayor of Austin go to Mexico and zoom that he is in Austin.  Isn't he scared to die from traveling if covid is so deadly?</p>
<p>If Newsome is so scared of covid and gave Cali some of the strictest lockdowns.  Why would he be caught multiple times  eating out in large groups? Isn't he scared of dying and spreading it to others.</p>
<p>Why do these mayor's keep talking about covid and not care about the rise in violence of actual young healthy people dying?</p>
<p>If covid is so deadly.  Why are there so many nurse tik tok videos at the height of the pandemic?</p>
<p>Explain why the vax is better then herd immunity.</p>
<p>Explain why all this money is going into ads about the vax.  That money could of saved and improved wayyyy more lives if used to actually help people.</p>
<p>Explain why kamala said that she wouldn't trust any vaccine by Trump but now I'm suppose to trust it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm gonna think of more and print it out and keep it around. If they are too lazy to fill it out then they also don't think covid is as deadly as it is.  Otherwise they would take the time to answer.  I guess you could copy/paste this type of stuff to shill/bots and see what they say but they probably won't fill it out either. Since they also aren't actually scared of covid.  Also, anymore really good ones for my questionnaire are appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Here's some to add: </p>
<p>If the jab doesn't prevent asymptomatic spread, getting covid, or dying from covid, and carry a risk of injury or death, why are low risk and young people being pushed to get it? Why is anyone? What does it actually do? </p>
<p>If Insulin is FDA approved and (large but accurate statistic) of people die because its unaffordable, why does the government not make it cheap or free? Why focus on an untested experimental drug with a bad track record and no actual benefit? </p>
<p>If the government is really worried about all the people dying of covid, enough to enforce jabs, why not do other changes like on lifestyle, health, diet and nutrition? Why do those dying of other preventable diseases not matter? </p>
<p>If we need 90% jab rate to get to herd immunity, then why do places like Iceland, with 90%+ jabbed population, go into lockdown again? </p>
<p>Why, if most of the cases in the hospital right now (i believe it was like 65%+ but source for yourself) are jabbed or double jabbed are the media/powers that be claiming it is a result of the selfish "anti-vaxxers"? </p>
<p>Why, when there is a clear trail of evidence and obvious signs that Faucci is lying about the fact he was a part of gain of function research on coronavirus, at the lab right next to the initial corona outbreak, is anyone giving him a platform or following his advice? </p>
<p>Do you see a conflict of interest in any of the policies and parties involved? </p>
<p>Do the jabs make sense to you? Do they do anything? </p>
<p>Why wouldn't the powers that be help solve any of the problems in the world before now? Why not sustain the impoverished who are suffering the lockdown effects instead of funding a military we aren't even using? </p>
<p>Just some ideas :)</p>
