    <strong>CDC did a great move</strong>
    <p><p>Some people seem to be cynical about this particular move, and while they might be right or not, CDC did a great move by not caring what the haters think, and imposed these guidelines on May 13, so it caused a huge rift between the doomers, some even questioning the point of the vaccine. Hilarious to see this civil war going on and seeing who really "trusts the science". </p>
<p>Because we all know, if CDC imposed these guidelines later in June, July, August, September or whatever, they'll STILL complain "its too early", so there's no satisfying those people either way because the goalposts were always meant to be shifted. By the CDC's own admission + no "impending doom" in later months, more will start waking up (if the opened states haven't already).</p></p>
