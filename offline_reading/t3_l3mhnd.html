    <strong>It's obvious that young people wouldn't be bothered be the lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Talking primarily about Gen Z here (my gen). Already the most socially awkward and obliviously miserable generation before the "pandemic" happened. Enslaved to technology. Social media is the real disease. The real "virus." It reset our psychology and fucked up our social dynamic post-2010. Every generation forward is going to ride the waves of this shitstorm and kids growing up in this cultureless divided era will probably even have a worse mental health decline.</p>
<p>Since people are already used to spending too much time indoors, why would it bother anyone if the government forces them to? I've read a few posts mostly from college students who genuinely don't even want the lockdowns to END. Granted, they are likely in the minority, but I can guarantee you there's a LOT more people with that mentality who don't let anybody know.</p>
<p>I guess it takes a generation (two decades or so) for something that would have been part of a dystopian sci-fi film to become at least semi-normalized. The terrifying question is: What will THEIR kids accept as just "the way things are?" I can barely even conceive of it.</p></p>
