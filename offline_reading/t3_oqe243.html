    <strong>An idea to help but not sure how to implement it.</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking it may be nice to have an easily found thread here where we have ways we can help each other. Like a list of resources or something. 
I see that letter posted from time to time that people have been giving to their jobs or schools to excuse them from the jab, it would be nice if it was a resource we could easily find. </p>
<p>We could add to it like if you know of some doctors who are willing to help get exemptions for the vaccine. Or politicians we should be writing to. Maybe if you know of some marches or protests happening, or would like to organize your own and what you would need to do to make that happen. I feel like we are quickly approaching a place of needing to possibly take action of some sort and having a way that we can help each other would be beneficial. </p>
<p>Would something like that be even possible and would any of you be interested in knowing what sort of resources we have?  Or more importantly, sharing what resources you have already found.</p></p>

        <p>Doctors don’t just write medical exemptions &amp; they can be denied. </p>
<p>Take the religious exemption, never mention a specific church or religion because that’s a sure way to have it denied.</p>
