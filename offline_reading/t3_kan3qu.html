    <strong>Instead of getting bogged down about whether there is or isn't a virus, or how contagious it is or isn't, I urge you all to truly look into the Terrain Theory.</strong>
    <p><p>The Terrain Theory is simple. It states that the internal biome of a person is the true indicator and faciliatory in the progression of disease/illness. And that disease/illness stems from the body responding to diseased/damaged/poisoned tissues, and the symptoms are than machination of the healing process. Should there be "viruses" or bacteria found at the site, these are there as agents of recycling and regrowth, and are created INSIDE our bodies, via the pleomorphic cycles of the building blocks of life called mycrozymes (or protids or somatids). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, instead of believing diseases are unnatural, caused by some outside source (which has only been proven when a body is INJECTED with diseased matter, not through natural means (see Koch's 4th postulate) and must be met with Modern Science's barbaric system of "Cut, Burn, or Poison", we should view all disease as a <strong>natural healing process</strong> and to not fear but truly trust that our body is working to return itself to its original if not healthier state and we should do our best to listen to the body and assist in this journey.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I urge all of you to reframe your thought process when you start to feel sick or develop any sort of sickness and think, "Thank you body for working to make me better, I will listen to your wisdom and will provide you with the nutrition, a positive and hopeful attitude, and the removal of dangerous/toxic matter, to assist as you go through this journey."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your body is truly capable of recovering from literally anything if you can project that mindset. Providing your body with good, nutritional foods, drinking clean water, and getting sleep gives the body the tools to manifest the above mentioned projected mindset. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Love you all!</p></p>

        <p>100% agreed. The greatest weapon the controllers have from the Covid hoax is the idea that we are subject to something external, whether it's a disease or the medical fascism that is emanating from it. People have developed more of a victim consciousness and a learned helplessness than ever. The idea of looking inward to notice our own organic independent power is impossible for so many at this point.</p>

        <p>Well put and I agree. The vast majority of people's mindsets or their psyche is basically, "My body needs the medicine (toxic substance that hinders the healing process), so I can get better or be safe!". </p>
<p>This can quite literally hamper your potential healing process, not just with the physical drugs, but because through your psyche you are negatively self regulating your body's mechanisms. </p>
<p>Hopefully through love and positivity, we can work to educate people about the power their bodies hold. It might be scary or it might cause very real trauma to realize the barbaric process you, or a loved one went through (e.g. chemo) was 100% not needed, and will most of the time kick in the cognitive dissonance, but, if you can understand that this feeling of complete "shittyness" is actually being presented to you by your body so that you may then learn and heal from the previous situation, you can get over it and truly, truly start living a life that feels right.</p>

        <p>I'm 100% on the side of terrain theory, though I don't discount germ theory when it makes sense, like in administration lf antibiotics, for example. </p>
<p>Looking at the long-term adverse health effects of those who survive COVID, they very closely mirror the negative effects of poor nutrition - increased risk of heart disease, stroke, etc. JUST A COINCIDENCE THOUGH.</p>

        <p>If you wouldn't mind, would you please clarify why germ theory makes sense in the administration of antibiotics? </p>
<p>The terrain theory argument, is that virus, bacteria, &amp; fungi develop as determined by the state of the body to assist in the repair and act as recyclers of damaged tissues, to the diseased area. When these processes are stopped via antibiotics, the symptoms (healing process) are stopped, which is viewed as a success.  </p>
<p>The only reason people believe we need antibiotics is because of the germ theory's false paradigm that states that the internal body is sterile and disease only comes from outside the body, they are solely responsible for causing the problem, and that is why they need to blindly kill a large amount of bacteria in the body. </p>
<p>And what's the proof that these bodies are responsible for the diseased tissue and not the other way around? Like I said before but to get a bit more specific, because Pasture argued that the body is sterile and only agents from the outside causes disease which is 100% not true. </p>
<p>We live in a world that completely negates the option of "without", by dubbing it sans any actual scientific proof, as a direct causal element to death and also spins it as a moral issue. </p>
<p>For example, currently, to the majority of the world, it would be deemed ludacris to propose to stop for, lets say 3 months, every single covid prevention strategy e.g. masks, social distancing, limits on occupancy, mandatory vaccine, and see how the human population fairs, because with no actual true data, just non-reality based guestimates made up by who knows (probably being funded by someone) using whatever figures, they state, using the media, that doing so would kill so many MORE people and thus it is immoral to even consider. </p>
<p>Same thing for Vaccines. We can't do an actual study using a true control group because it would be immoral to NOT inject kids with toxins... because they might catch some disease organically, which, if you understand terrain theory, does not make any sense as we know the virus, bacteria, fungus comes from within our body due to the internal biome's current condition. </p>
<p>It's a matrix of control. Completely abandon the fraudulent germ theory!</p>

        <p>Ok I agree that optimism is certainly helpful in keeping you healthy but I'm not convinced here. I have a chronic illness, no matter how much healthy food I eat, how much positive attitude I feel, it doesn't get better, and I need to rely on modern medical technology. What am I doing wrong?! Hope and optimism is good but it's not everything.</p>
