    <strong>I’m sick and tired of masks and restrictions. It’s time for us to get out of our comfort zones.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a high schooler in Ohio (United States). We had recently had a “spike” (I still don’t know anyone who has/had COVID and I live in the second biggest county) and DeWine might impose more restrictions later today and if he does, I might have a breakdown. I know I might sound selfish since DeWine isn’t nearly as bad as Cuomo or Newsom, but I can’t stand this spineless RINO giving us Ohioans unconditional restrictions and mandates! And it seems like everyone is too afraid to stand up against this tyranny! </p>
<p>Well, I’m no longer complying to masks. The reason as to why I brought up being a high schooler is because I have a 99.997% of surviving this virus. Childhood Obesity has a higher mortality rate and yet no one cares if someone overfeeds their child into obesity but how dare you not wear a mask or dine in at a restaurant!! I still have to wear masks at school and have to do school remotely 2-3 days a week despite only having a 0.002% of dying from COVID. Remote learning is simply not the same as in-person. I have trouble paying attention due to connection issues and the abundance of distractions at home. </p>
<p>Remember when I said I won’t comply to the mask mandate anymore? I might not be able to get away with not wearing a mask at school, but I do have a chance of getting away with not wearing a mask during swim practice and outside of school. I’m in my School’s swim team and I kid you not, people wear their masks to practice. They don’t wear it while in the water, but they wear it right before getting in and after they get out of the water. What’s the point of bringing your mask if you’re not going to wear it for the majority of the time? We also have Yoga and Weight lifting before or after swim practice (depending on the day of the week) and people are wearing their mask whilst partaking in those activities. </p>
<p>What’s the point of this post you may ask? I encourage you to not listen to the mandates if you’re an American. I don’t know about other countries, but the United States is a Constitutional Republic, and it’s WE THE PEOPLE who decide what we can and can not do. The government can’t punish us if we don’t comply with the mask mandate. If everyone stops wearing masks that’ll send the government a message that we’re not their slaves. The government is obviously enjoying all the power we had given them and it’s time for us to take back our freedom.</p></p>

        <p>I feel this so hard! I am old (39), but my entire life I have been a swimmer. Swim team/lifeguard/coach/instructor—this year, nothing. I have my own pool, still no students this year. I also coach aerial acrobatics. That has been ok, a few students...but no shows, competitions, nothing. Just yesterday I saw that the world’s competition has been postponed to 2023. Wtf?! I am so done.</p>

        <p>Dude, not that you care... I joined the gym in January. Not out of shape, but not particularly in shape either. Legitimately started going every day. Started running on a treadmil, but it just didn't jive with me. However, they had a pool... never was a great swimmer but I started. I gained so much strength and stamina in the span of about 2 months. Pretty therapeutic too.</p>
<p>Covid hits, gym was closed for 6 months. Now, they're only allowed back up to 30 percent capacity. With this, they have started reservations for lap lanes. This is in addition to paying full price for the membership. I can't even get a reservation unless I want to book a week in advance. Why am I even paying full price if I can't get a reservation?</p>
<p>The ironic thing is, when I went in to suspend my membership, all I saw were elderly and overweight people.</p>

        <p>I do care! Exercise is so important for physical <em>and</em> mental health! It’s just so outlandish to me. In our area, they had even closed down hiking trails at various points throughout this. I find it absolutely unethical. Covid or not, the entire globe locking people in their homes for upwards of a year is a crime against humanity.</p>

        <p>That must suck. Are world champion competitions held yearly? I can’t imagine having to miss 3 competitions because of irrational fear monger. I’m fortunate enough to have swim practices at full capacity (around 30 participants) but my team might not be involved in any meets this year. Hopefully these COVID restrictions will be a thing of the past in 2021.</p>

        <p>Well we were supposed to demonstrate in the olympics this year for pole (cool, right?) but that was canceled. I am on the executive committee for worlds, and we lost so much money over covid, that we ended up pushing it out. What state are you in? I am in Arizona, we are fortunate to not be fully locked down in my area, but highschool sports have taken a huge hit. Some schools opened and shut back down, some are staying w/ virtual, snd some are hybrid. <a href="http://www.polesports.org/about-us/join-the-movement/">http://www.polesports.org/about-us/join-the-movement/</a></p>

        <p>I live in Ohio and we’re not in complete lockdown (That might change tomorrow due having a “spike of 6,000 cases”) and most of the decisions regarding schools were made by school superintendents. The superintendent at my school allowed sports to have pre-seasons and have normal practices but the schools not so much (Apparently school sports doesn’t spread COVID but getting an actual education is super spreading). We were originally going to go all remote for 9 weeks but that was fortunately lessened down to 2. My school as of now is doing hybrid while another district nearby is doing all remote until January.</p>

        <p>It is so weird how covid restrictions are determined. I heard a school district nearby me is keeping sports open, but not in-person learning. There are also neighborhoods near me with community pools that open only Wednesdays and Saturdays, closing every other hour for sanitizing the lounge chairs, I just think its bizarre. But I am an extrovert. After 10 months of this nonsense, I am starting to feel like I would rather risk covid then live like this much longer. It is all just bananas.</p>

        <p>How can DeWine impose even more restrictions?  We've had mask mandates since July, can't gather in groups, all of that.  People are starving, unemployed, and committing suicide here after the "2 weeks to flatten the curve" has lasted from March to November with no end in sight.</p>

        <p>Bravery like this is what is sorely lacking. Your peers are spineless, brainwashed fools, and you are to be wholeheartedly commended for standing up to them.</p>

        <p>I was in high school in Florida in 1999 when the Columbine massacre happened. The school system attempted to crack down on anything "goth" including trench coats and any references to that culture. No one cared and the goths ignored it. It may have actually increased the number of trench coats just because we used to react to legit authoritarianism in a MUCH different way. I'm really worried about how little people care about infringements on individual freedoms this year. The ideal way for this to be handled is for half the school to show up one morning without any masks and make it clear that you will not be wearing them going forward.</p>

        <p>I feel you dude. I live in a Canadian province where there is 12 cases/ 1 millian people.  No one in ICU  no one in hospital and people are calling for more restrictions.  Our government has made people believe the only way is 0 cases.  We have a ton of restrictions already and have had them for months - everyone here is basically in love with the government and doesn't question a thing.  I'm honestly ready to be done with life.</p>

        <p>I just graduated from high school last year and I got my graduation taken from me by the lockdowns. I completely understand where you're coming from and I know it's absolutely miserable, especially because the younger generation is so compliant and very loud about it, but all that you can do is hang in there. I was in Ohio for a bit this summer because I went to Cedar Point (which was miserable because we had to wear masks at all times, even when we weren't near others...I wore a lace mask lol) and I heard Dewine talking on a local radio station at some point about cases going up. He sounded insane, but I live under the rule of miss Whitmer so it still sounded tame compared to her. I'm sick masks too, and everything else, of course, and I hope you can get away with not wearing one when you can.</p>
