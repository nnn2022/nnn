    <strong>I simply can't see the logic behind statements like this...</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/2q3rv1uaid661.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f18a76f2e012b12406fd06360995dce8bee5d5f1</p>
<p>Let's pretend for a second that everyone and I mean everyone stayed at home. I agree that the virus would no longer be able to circulate and we'd be over this in what, three or four weeks? (I'm no virologist so perhaps a bit longer)</p>
<p>However that's obviously not in the slightest bit feasible unless we want people to starve, looting and violent crime to be rife and society to completely break down. We still need the emergency services to be running, we still need engineers for the utilities to be going to work, food production workers, HGV drivers providing essential items, public transport workers to allow essential workers to get to work, carers for the disabled and a thousand other things the list is almost endless.</p>
<p>So let's assume that 80% of the population (an arbitrary figure) do actually just sit in their homes and do nothing (let's forget about their mental health for the sake of this, the lockdown fanatics seem to do this quite easily so we can follow suit for this thought exercise). That's still 20% of the population moving around spreading the virus.</p>
<p>So how long would it take for the virus to disappear considering that a sizeable chunk of the population can't simply "stay at home". A year? Two years? Five Years? Never? That's a long time to be sitting at home watching life pass you by.</p>
<p>A virus will spread regardless of whatever ridiculous curfews, tier levels, mask mandates or travel bans our governments impose.</p>
<p>I wonder if that thought has "sunk the fuck in" for these people?</p></p>

        <p>100% absolutely correct. The lockdowns are a FAILED method of controlling this virus. They simply do not work.</p>
<p>Same thing for the masks by the numbers we are seeing, it actually appears that the masks MAKE THINGS WORSE in the real world by making people more likely to catch CoVid-19.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns aside, masks don’t make people more likely to catch covid. Actually, countries like Japan or South Korea, where there haven’t been lockdowns as drastic as in the west, have seen far less cases/spikes - which might be because literally almost anyone is wearing their masks.</p>

        <p>Total lockdown is not possible. You either have tons of law enforcement out working, which means a virus is going to be a virus and keep spreading, or you have tons of criminals out. "Everyone, including police and private security, has to stay home" = "100% discount on everything you can physically get out of the store." Nobody's stopping them.</p>

        <p>So essentially they blame they essential workers for why they lockdowns haven’t worked. Everyone stays home except the essential, who in turn spread to those in need of essential service, and then blame the ones doing the essential jobs. Essentially this will never end and that is essential, essentially.</p>

        <p>I always thought it was obvious but I guess not... so we lock down, but as soon as restrictions get lifted the cases spike and then it’s lockdown 2.0. There will never be a way out of the restrictions until we just say enough is enough and re-open.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, what if there was no lockdown? Going by your logic then the virus spread rate would be much higher, therefore death tolls would also rise, are you REALLY going to say that being able to go the shops without a mask on is more important than thousands, if not tens of thousands of lives?</p>

        <p>If you think that locking absolutely everyone down for two weeks would solve the problem, you haven't been paying attention.  Yes, it's impossible, but put that aside- assume that somehow, we can.  Okay.  Remember how this virus was zoonotic?  Are you also locking down every last bat and mink on Earth?</p>
