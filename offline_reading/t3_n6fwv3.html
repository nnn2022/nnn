    <strong>Random thoughts from a new guy 1 year 2 months into this</strong>
    <p><p>They told us when I was kid that if Wallops Island NASA base was attacked we could hide under our desk. Think about that, hiding under wood to protect from falling concrete and Fire.</p>
<p>They told us after 9-11 that the TSA would be temporary. Its still here on steroids.</p>
<p>They told us after 9-11 in the event of a chemical attack to duct tape our windows. The only way that would work is if you wrapped the duct tape around your head and suffocated yourself.</p>
<p>Now they tell us that in order to get back to normal just take this Frankenshot 2 times then 1 a year for a booster. By the way if the shot makes you ill or if you die you or your family can't sue the manufacturer. All the while these companies are making record breaking profits. 15 days to flatten the curve and slow the spread has turned into 1 year 2 months later and MAYBE we can celebrate this 4th of July. Last I checked I'm a free man and don't need anyone's permission to live free.</p>
<p>Also we are not allowed to question the virus which supposedly has people dying in the streets yet Doctors and Nurses are seen in empty hospital floors making shitty TicToc videos. We are not allowed to question the vaccine that was rushed out and we still don't know the long term effects but what we do know so far should scare any rational person (blood clots, heart attacks, death a day later, rewriting of genetic code, infertility....) We are not allowed to question leaders as apparently they think they are our masters and we sheep should just line up, take the shot and say thank sir may I have another</p>
<p>Well fuck that. I'm tired of seeing places in my state closed down, people killing themselves because they've lost everything or they are in such a state of fear because of the media, the government and the rest of WuFlu bunch. The only way to win is not play the game. Fuck the shot, fuck mask, fuck social distancing and fuck anyone who tries to force you into believing this madness</p>
<p>True Bravery is standing up to the mob, True Bravery is doing what you believe to be right when everyone else says you're wrong, true bravery is living your life like you always did and don't let anyone else tell you any different. My Body, My Fucking Choice. End of </p>
<p>The government and its institutions have a very long history of lying to or experimenting on the American people what makes you think this is any different? Stand up or watch them take and take and take more of your freedom. Do you really think they'll give it back? Pay attention to history for you answer </p>
