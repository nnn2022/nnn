    <strong>Mask Wearing Skepticism?</strong>
    <p><p>On this sub I've noticed some posts that seem critical of masks. From what I've been seeing after the reopenings, places where people do not wear masks are seeing huge case spikes (and higher positive test rates as well). Where I live (Virginia), at least 95% of people I see wear masks, at least when not outdoors. Maybe I'm looking at things the wrong way, but I'm not totally anti-mask. In fact, I'm seeing it as more of an inconvenience at this point but I know that for some people that is not the case. Overall, I find mask wearing to be less oppressive than lockdowns. However, I would not want to wear a mask if I'm out in the hot sun and I'm nowhere near a gathering.</p>
<p>I'm unsure about mandatory mask wearing legislation, though. I feel that criminal penalties for simply not wearing a mask is dumb. From where I'm at, stores and businesses tend to require masks but I see it as more of a simple rule than a law.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't want to have to wear a mask in public forever but it looks like wearing masks seems to allow for a slower spread while being open. I'll wear a mask inside a store or public building but not so much if I'm outdoors/exercising/eating.</p>
<p>I'd say I'm kind of on the fence right now for mask wearing. I see quite a few people here against it. Maybe I'm wrong about something?</p></p>

        <p>I think what a lot of us worry about is the lack of a clear finish line. Too many people seem to want masks to become a permanent feature of the new normal.</p>

        <p>No one will criticize you for wearing a mask, or shouldn’t at least. All people are asking is to make your own decision and leave the rest of us the fuck alone about it.</p>

        <p>Businesses definitely can decide, but should also be prepared to lose business if they force the issue. Or gain it I suppose if they are in an area where that’s a popular decision</p>

        <p>California has been balls deep in masks and they are having a spike. I think its inevitable that it spikes and then comes down unless you dislodge it from your population EARLY and then close the borders for god knows how long.</p>

        <p>&rt;From what I've been seeing after the reopenings, places where people do not wear masks are seeing huge case spikes (and higher positive test rates as well)</p>
<p>This is blatantly false, where I live (Wisconsin) we’ve been seeing cases and deaths go down since early May and in my municipality mask wearing was always on the low end of compliance and our cases remained low through the entire ordeal.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not totally anti-mask. In fact, I'm seeing it as more of an inconvenience at this point but I know that for some people that is not the case. Overall, I find mask wearing to be less oppressive than lockdowns.</p>
<p>Masks are another form of oppression to merely an “inconvenience”. They are a symbol, and symbols are powerful. In this case they are a symbol of assimilation.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm unsure about mandatory mask wearing legislation, though. </p>
<p>I’m not unsure, I’m completely against it.</p>
<p>&rt;From where I'm at, stores and businesses tend to require masks but I see it as more of a simple rule than a law.</p>
<p>Let them lose business then.</p>
<p>&rt;Don't get me wrong, I don't want to have to wear a mask in public forever but it looks like wearing masks seems to allow for a slower spread while being open. </p>
<p>Masks actually don’t do shit to slow the spread in reality. They only have a 35% effective rate of worn 100% properly but almost no one wears them properly since it requires a ton of precision in procedure so the actual effective rate is less than 1%.</p>
<p>Also that’s assuming the individual is actually sick to begin with, asymptomatic individuals are not contagious, and no reason they should have to wear a mask. </p>
<p>&rt;I'd say I'm kind of on the fence right now for mask wearing.</p>
<p>I’m not.</p>
<p>&rt;I see quite a few people here against it. </p>
<p>Kind of the point of this sub.</p>
