<p>Yeah, I’m sure Amazon started out pretty good, but they quickly became an evil empire that puts Walmart to shame!</p>

        <p>Absolutely unreal. It’s amazing how so many people read 1984 in school and can’t connect the dots between the parallels here. It’s all: “the party knows best”. </p>
<p>I’ve been scared for the future for quite some time now, but it really feels like we’re hitting that point-of-no-return soon.</p>

        <p>Legit tho, I live In Ontario and it's like get one step forward and 3 steps back. I can feel my mental health breaking down, but I try and find coping skills. I recently started playing bass again and what not. Wish I had sooner. And i collect coins to help keep sane, other then that. Its hard to keep a balanced life when so much has already been taken away :(.</p>

        <p>Yes, I used to really like Canada but over the past 5ish years they’ve passed a lot of new laws that makes me glad I stayed in the US (even though I’m watching us fall apart rn, too). It feels like every time I turn on the news I have something new to be mad about, and I once found solace in discovering these groups after abandoning facebook, but now reddit is becoming like how FB used to be for me, except now I have the benefit of anonymity. But I need a break.</p>
<p>It’s good you’ve found an outlet, and music is definitely one of the most therapeutic. I think your message is a sign that maybe I should take your lead and pick up my guitar again and get off reddit for a bit. </p>
<p>I’d love to be able to change hearts and minds but it takes such a toll on you. Thanks for talking with me, fam :) </p>

        <p>Thank you friend ! I'm super happy knowing that reddit has a sub like this. I was losing all hope after being involved in a FB group called "FUCK THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT" it was legit pretty intense with all the justin Castro memes. That page was shut down and all the propaganda was flooding FB. Thank goodness for this sub Haha.</p>
<p>I always thought that the Americans wouldn't bother to wanna know what is happening with us, I'm just glad Theres more of us worldwide that's legit one big family that I can call... all these people here have been the closest I have ever had to a family. Always going to be here ! And yes sir, play that friggen guitar :) I play bass, so I had to warm up with some "my name is mud" by Primus haha. </p>
<p>Have a good day, eh :)</p>

        <p>Oh hell yes. Some Primus to get the old engine firing again! Love it! </p>
<p>I had to google the Justin Castro thing, so I guess I was pretty out of the loop, although I did know he (as well as the American left) deeply mourned Fidel’s death so it makes sense. It’s kinda funny tbh.</p>
<p>But I’m gonna go have a bonfire and try not to be political for the rest of the night, so have a good one, my brother from up north! And rock on!</p>
