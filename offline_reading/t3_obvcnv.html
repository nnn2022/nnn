    <p><p>Soo....we are NOT supposed to believe SOME physicians but we ARE supposed to believe the rest that are pushing an agenda, correct? This is what we are saying? So how do we know WHO to actually believe? And now we have "right wing physicians" and "left wing physicians"? Is it kind of like sports where we all pick our own team? Is this how our health is being handled now? So basically, what I've learned, is that everything is now political. So if I do something you don't like, more than likely it's because we are on opposite ends of what "team" we believe in. Ok..gotcha. This is how we are living life now. </p>
<p>Remember, if your DOCTOR tells you that you don't have cancer, it may be a lie..he may just be on the other side of politics. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>Good grief, people!</p>

        <p>According to the brainwashed morons who love their face diapers, "doctors" on TV are offering science. However, any real doctor (not on TV), who states that these injections are poisons which will genetically modify and kill people are called "extremists". It was already proven in Canadian, Irish, and Portuguese courts that the "virus" has never been isolated in a lab, and that the PCR test is a fraud. The sheep can't think, so they let the TV tell them what to believe. If the TV said to shave their heads and tape bunches of spinach to their heads, and that this would protect them against the so-called virus, these morons would do it. You would see face diaper spinach heads everywhere. Anyone who is dumb enough to get injected with this poison is a lost cause. The brainwashed sheep have been told and told, and given a ton of evidence which proves this entire "pandemic" is a complete fraud. If the TV doesn't say it, they reject all truth when offered. I said it before, and will say it again, that the brainwashed masses are now a cult.</p>
