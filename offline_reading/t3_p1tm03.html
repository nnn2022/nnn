    <strong>Are there any Indians in this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>I have come across many people who are able to look past the propaganda, but there is lack of unified voice on mainstream media. No one is questioning why children as young as 5 years old are participating in vaccine trials, about early treatment, about socio-economic effects of lockdown and things like that. It would be good to know you people.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not Indian, but over the past year I was doing some online teaching and I had students from India.</p>
<p>What was interesting to me was that they generally <em>also</em> didnt know people who had died. But they saw how bad things were on TV/internet.</p>
