    <strong>Boris Johnson’s plan is to test enough people to justify a second lockdown which will never end.</strong>
    <p><p>This is the second part of a series in which I entertain ~~Occam’s Razor~~ batshit conspiracy theories. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ipcfyn/i_think_the_primary_purpose_of_englands_new/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Here</a> is part one.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the UK government last night announced a very slight and specific tightening of the COVID-19 regulations. This led to the public asking many questions, none of which were answered in the Prime Minister’s press conference this evening or at PMQs earlier in the day. It appears that <strong>you can only meet up with five or less other people you know, but you can do so anywhere and in the immediate company of any amount of strangers.</strong> The places you can visit with those strangers - or at least the ones that provide human socialisation like restaurants and pubs - require ~~the Mark of the Beast~~ track and trace, and are therefore not worth visiting at all, and will fall into rubble.</p>
<p>This coincides with the government announcing that <strong>testing capacity will be increased to allow 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.</strong> This should lead any person with a rudimentarily knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic to ask the same question: <strong>”Won’t such a radical increase in testing lead to a dramatic rise in cases that doesn’t reflect the severity of those cases?”</strong> To this, the Prime Minister grows a proverbial Nordic beard and responds: <strong>”Yes.”</strong></p>
<p>It’s October 30th. 500,000 people - 0.8% of the UK’s entire population— have been tested for COVID-19 within a 24 hour period, not to mention that millions have received tests in preceding weeks. Within this timeframe, a disproportionate amount of positive tests occur in Leicestershire and north-west London, the epicentres of the UK’s Hindu population. These places, like Muslim areas before them hours before Eid, are put under local lockdowns on the eve of Diwali.</p>
<p>The night before Halloween, it is announced that case numbers have shot up. So many unrelated deaths now follow a positive antibody test that the official death count hits four figures. This results in a ban on trick or treating, <strong>but only after every mask, decoration and piece of candy has been sold, and while the stores that supply these goods remain only as affected as they were.</strong> Halloween parties are banned too, but they simply move to the pubs and nightclubs, <strong>where individuals cannot be seen knowing too many people, not out of fear of immediate police reprisal, but out of fear of the unofficial collaborator.</strong></p>
<p>All else remains normal. Black Friday comes and goes without incident, the entire Christmas shopping season plays out as in previous years. People follow peer example and take off their masks. The midnight on the first listening of “Fairytale of New York” is extra poignant this year. And then, on Christmas Eve, a catastrophe. Deaths of people with COVID in their system hit five figures. The country must lock down again. All are required to return to their homes and stay there for the foreseeable future. Presents that would have opened gleefully by the fire are instead delivered. Entire feasts are prepared, only to be gorged upon by the chef alone. Churches fall into rubble just as the meeting houses did.</p>
<p><strong>And so it remains for the rest of our years.</strong> The religious and familial aspects of Christmas are gone, but the consumerist aspects remain. Within a generation, Father Christmas lives in Crystal City, Virginia, his elves wear brown shirts and shorts and the children sing of Rudolph, an anthropomorphic van with red headlights. Within two, St. Jeff of California, who revived Santa’s tradition of delivering presents, was crucified by those who refused his gifts.</p>
<p>This is no longer about stopping a virus. If it was, we’d simply be locking down again. <strong>This is about destroying the very concepts of family, friendship, community, tradition and religion and replacing them with a state of self-serving consumerists who receive a package from Santa’s mythical rainforest in Virginia and get excited for the next one.</strong> This will be while the elites go to Mars, <strong>to do all the things we used to know how to do.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not breed, for pornography will provide. Do not seek role models, for the media will provide. Do not leave your home to seek products, for St. Jeff will provide. Do not seek fulfilment, for your planet is dying and St. Elon is building the rocket to Mars anyway, so it won’t be worth it. There was a reason for all this, but you’ve forgotten it. Your generation dies childless and obese.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Here in NJ, we’re at 200-500 cases per day and death rates largely in the single digits, and that’s supposedly even including probable Covid deaths. However, we’re still locked down hard with many businesses operating at 25% capacity. </p>
<p>We’re lucky we didn’t have a spike during Labor Day weekend, or we’d be moving towards a pre-emptive second lockdown for the Winter second wave the liberals are preaching about.</p>

        <p>Exactly what I thought.  The constant testing isn’t the stop the virus but justify the endless lockdowns.   Halloween and Christmas are cancelled, at least by governments but I have no doubt people will do their own thing.   And they’ll be blamed for cases rising.  However they can’t afford the economy to sink more so Christmas shopping will be allowed, with Boris making a similar speech to encourage us back into stores</p>
