    <strong>I need your help</strong>
    <p><p>Hello fellow truth seekers. I am writing this to request your help. I am trying to come up with a very articulate, concise, and factual reply when I’m confronted about not wearing a mask.  I live in the Seacoast of New Hampshire. I haven’t worn a mask unless forced to this entire “pandemic”..  I am very into alternative medicine, am a practicing herbalist and live an extremely healthy lifestyle. I support my immune system on a daily basis, detoxify my body, and don’t consume anything I don’t cook myself. Zero processed foods, chemicals, and omitting grains, sugar, dairy and starchy carbs. I was diagnosed with lunes disease in 2016 and have had to completely alter my life to overcome and manage the disease...a process that has changed everything about who I am and wha5i believe.  I have gotten away with not wearing masks r social distancing very easily this entire lockdown and most people in my state don’t seem to be bothered by it, though I’m literally the ONLY person in the grocery store without a mask.  Recently things have ramped up a bit In the last couple weeks and I’m finding more and more emboldened roomers who find it their job to confront me with their mob mentality and group think.  I was heavily confronted in an ikea store today by around six women who verbally attacked me and one ended up calling me a cu*t. I realized that I didn’t have a good factual reply to them to stop them in their tracks.  Something that they couldn’t deny and would blow an obvious whole in their line of reasoning and hopefully cause them to back off ( and have to think !). I réalisé that we are screwed if we stay divided so I’m trying to find something to say that gets my point across but isn’t out right mean. I do have compassion for these sheeple and would rather engage in a way that is unifying rather than dividing but I’m also perfectly fine rolling a few heads and standing my ground. Do any of you have a suggestion for a ready to go comeback to the mask pushing doomers ? A great couple lines to shut them up and prove my point ?? Would be greatly appreciated. Truly I send blessings and power to all of you, we ARE the resistance and we must réalisé the importance of our role. The new world order, new normal, must never fully come to be and it’s literally up to us to stop it.  Keep up the good fight, stay positive, ask for guidance, and don’t conform!!!!! Thanks in advance.</p></p>

        <p>It doesn't matter what you say, they're not <em>actually</em> listening to you. They word vomit their virtue signaling piece, insult you, and move on. Im learning that ignoring them- like literally acting like they are not there- works really well.</p>
