        <p>COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum..</p>
<p>There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.'</p>
<p>Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'</p>
<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>
<p>Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'</p>
<p>A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'</p>
<p>Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'</p>
<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>
<p>Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'</p>
<p>Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>
<p>Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING'</p>
<p>Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.</p>
<p>Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'</p>
<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and I’m starting to notice some of the same trends in NoNewNormal. This is why it is so important to stay on message and not get sidetracked by partisan politics or low-information posts. </p>
<p>Memes are great, but informative content should dominate the conversation on this subreddit. Or else we will become conspiracy 2.0.</p>

        <p>Conspiracies are political but they're not party political. Of course political parties can be involved in conspiracies, in which case, that's relevant. But conspiracies are generally not about the small-difference politics that can easily be used to encourage subs to degenerate into unproductive arguments and in-fighting instead of addressing their topics with facts and logic.</p>
<p>Also party politics and culture wars is of little or no interest to some people, including many posters on r/conspiracy. It's generally divisive. If you're coming from a position that is pro-humanity and against crimes against humanity, then you might want to see over the top of all that shite.</p>

        <p>I only saw this because someone was going through month old content and reported this as you guessed it,  "<a href="https://tinyimg.io/i/IGdhMNb.PNG">misinformation</a>".  </p>
<p>We all know that the people who are determined to shut us down are constantly up to dirty tricks and I have documented tons of it but having them abusing the reporting system is particularly ironic only makes it harder for me to identify and remove misinformation and all type of problematic content.  Not to mention, the vast majority of moderation is focused on having to deal with their trolling.</p>
<p>What exactly is their cause again?  Stopping misinformation or hate speech etc. they say which is quite ironic when they are spreading it themselves in order to use as evidence to shut us down.  Despicable.</p>

        <p>Funny you ask.  There seemed to be somebody going through your account specifically and reporting stuff from way back.  I saw at least 3 other new reports on stuff from you at least 18 days ago and I would guess there are probably more if I looked.  I was wondering if you had a secret admirer or something.</p>
<p>The fact that these people are combing through month old comments is pretty nuts when you think about it.  These were all bogus reports like this though so I don't quite get it.  I am beginning to actually think these people legitimately think misinformation means ideas they find offensive AKA thought crime.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the explanation and the work you do moderating. It must be a chore to sift through bogus reports. </p>
<p>Still though, I think three or four people made new top level comments on this thread this morning, which is weird to me.</p>

        <p>Interesting article, thanks for sharing. This portion stood out to me as especially relevant:</p>
<p>“Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) <strong>to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets;</strong> and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.”</p>
<p>I am concerned that bad actors will use the first tactic to delegitimize any space critical of the response to COVID 19 by flooding forums with off topic and low quality content.</p>

        <p>Maybe you mods could develop a phrase to use when we know they are showing themselves here. Get the word out about it and we can all just respond to these asshats in this manner. Too obvious or possibly effective? I don't know. Just an idea. The "shill" thing is overdone. But if we could collectively let them know, "I see you". 🤷‍♀️</p>

No reason given, but it's the 5th sub I've been banned from after a decade on reddit.  All of them were on the past 2 months and 3/5 called out me being in this sub.  One of them r/justiceserved gave me the option to recant, quit this sub to stay with them.  I gave them a polite goodbye.</p>

        <p>I got auto banned from the justice served sub for commenting here, I then subbed to this sub as a result because it must be a good sub if I'm getting banned for being here.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, I've never even used that sub. Clearly a bunch of anti free speech mental patients</p>

<p>I want doomers to come here and try to prove me wrong. Debate is healthy and will help strengthen my perspective. The automatic ban will only deter doomers.</p>

        <p>You have been brainwashed. I bet the Nazi youth also thought they were saving lives. Covid is being used as an excuse to implement global totalitarianism. I don’t oppose mask mandates or Covid restrictions, I oppose infringing on human rights. Closing churches, forcing children to be vaccinated, shuttering business and censoring dissent. </p>
<p>By all means, government must take steps to protect people, but this cannot come at the cost of our freedoms. We need to balance protecting people’s health with protecting human rights. </p>
<p>We cite professionals here too, such as Dr. Robert Malone - inventor of mRNA vaccines - who is being censored by corporate institutions. We should rely on public debate instead of censorship. </p>
<p>Extremism and totalitarianism always appear well meaning. That is how tyrants convince people that tyranny is in their best interests. If you scare people enough, they will willingly relinquish their rights.</p>

        <p>Read the constitution. Rights can be infringed if in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice so long as the due process rights of the accused are respected. Essentially, you need a guilty verdict in a court of law to force imprisonment. This is not new or controversial. </p>
<p>Regulatory law does not infringe on anyone’s rights. McDonalds does not have the right to poison people and it is reasonable to regulate in the name of public safety. No rights are infringed when you force a McDonalds employee to wash their hands. </p>
<p>You don’t have a right to drive…</p>
<p>Seriously, you need to go read the constitution. You’re clearly out of your depth as you don’t know what human rights are.</p>
