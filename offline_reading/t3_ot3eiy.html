        <p>&rt; President Joe Biden said Tuesday afternoon that a mandate to require all federal employees to be vaccinated is now "under consideration."</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Sources familiar with the discussion told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega that the president is awaiting the outcome of a policy review, but that likely Thursday, he will announce that federal employees will be required to be vaccinated or else they must abide by "stringent COVID-19 protocols like mandatory mask wearing -- even in communities not with high or substantial spread -- and regular testing."</strong></p>
<p>Wow...just speechless. This is surreal...it's like they've cranked up the heat to 11 in the last few weeks around the world. Are they trying to stir up mass riots?</p>
<p>I wonder how Americans are going to take this...is this enough to cause an uprising?</p>
<p>To all those who say "bOtH SidEz aRe tHe SamE" (which in many ways I completely disagree with) - do you think Trump would ever mandate vaccines for all federal employees? </p>
<p>Also, Biden randomly starts calling unvaccinated people not smart.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?</p>
<p><strong>Biden</strong>: That's under consideration right now but if you're not vaccinated you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Are you concerned that the CDC's new mask guidance can sow confusion?</p>
<p><strong>Biden</strong>: We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated and they're sowing enormous confusion. The more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned and there's only one thing we know for sure, if those other 100 million people got vaccinated,</p>

<p>No... We have a pandemic because you intentionally used faulty PCR tests.</p>
