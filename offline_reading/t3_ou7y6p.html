        <p>There's stuff even more recent than that, though less dramatic. Remember when the "health experts" were telling us that saturated fat was bad for you and unsaturated substitutes were healthy? Oops, turns out that natural saturated fat is fine in moderation and heavily processed substitutes full of trans fats are harmful.</p>
<p>Also hormones for menopausal women. They said it was great and encouraged it, then found out that for most women it did more harm than good.</p>

        <p>That information has been widely available for decades, but pharma tells doctors that their patented hormones (altered NOT to be better, but for no reason other than to be patentable) are better and prescribe them orally, so doses need to be higher and cause all kinds of side effects and tax the liver.</p>
<p>For fertility, bioidentical are used because it's too risky to give altered hormones during pregnancy, but for menopausal women...</p>
<p>Don't get me started. ;) It's a travesty and many women have died from heart disease and cancer caused by fake hormones taken as directed.</p>

        <p>How much do you know about this stuff? My naturopathic doctor prescribed me monthly progesterone injections because I haven’t had my period for 5 months after stopping my birth control (and my lab results showed that I have almost none).
She said it won’t be long term, just a few months until my body catches up. Should I reconsider? Or is it mainly an issue for menopausal women?</p>

        <p>It's a concern for women of all ages. </p>
<p>Here's a book that explains everything: What your doctor may not tell you about premenopause by John R Lee, MD.</p>
<p>You may not consider yourself as premenopausal, but because of xenoestrogens in our environment, many women produce too little progesterone beginning around age 30. </p>
<p>I think you'll find the information interesting and you can discuss it with your naturopath. If you tend to not want to read a lot of details, he has another book: Hormone Balance Made Simple. </p>
<p>Tbh, I think the best route is to get the first book and skip the parts that go into to much biochemistry or details for you if you aren't interested in all that.</p>
<p>Every woman should be educated on this to advocate for themselves on this topic. It's incredibly important to your health and quality of life.</p>

        <p>Isn’t HDL cholesterol good and necessary for men? For production of testosterone specifically. </p>
<p>Same goes for salt. America has the highest numbers of cardiovascular diseas and general heart problems, diabetes, etc in all of history. But sodium consumption is not nearly at an all time high. </p>

        <p>LDL is also good for men. Hell, cholesterol is good for everyone. What kills you is free triglycerides. All cholesterol does is package that fat so that it can pass throughout the body efficiently, repairing structures and producing complex compounds; like testosterone. Your cholesterol is obviously going to be higher then, if you're eating a high fat diet. Sure cholesterol can cause heart issues by clogging damaged arteries with plaques, but that's kind of like punching a hole in your wall and repairing it with duck tape and blaming the duck tape for ruining your interior decorating. Fun fact by the way, Lipator, a statin that lowers your cholesterol is Pfeizer's 4th most profitable drug, knowing what I said about testosterone, guess what their 5th most is? Viagra. </p>
<p>And you're dead on about salt. We tell cardiac patients to limit sodium intake to manage their fluid levels, but carbohydrates are also great at drawing in water. It's why you lose 5 lbs right away when you start a new diet, you're just dropping water weight.</p>

        <p>Yeah they usually shut right up when hearing this because they have no way to debate it. Likely mant of the 'trust the science' crowd rarely had enough contact with science to actually know of the mistakes it made.</p>
<p>So we must blast them in their faces. Asbestos, dmoking when pregnant, radioactivity everywhere, lead pipes to transport water and using all kinds of toxic chemicals as beauty treatments were all once promoted by the scientific orthodoxy and wete either praised or not criticised by the medical practitioners of their era.</p>
<p>Eugenics, phrenology and all manner of idiocies that USSR came up with were state approved scientific viewpoints, openly accepted by the elites of the time and speaking against them could be the cause for completely destroying one's scientific career. The USSR case could even ruin the life of non scientists, all due to being considered 'anti-science'.</p>
<p>And it is so easy to know that. You just need the history of past 2 centuries to know about the majority of what I listed above. No need to even know anything about what happened before the French revolution, so there is really no excuse for such blatant ignorance.</p>

        <p>First trimester here after 2 years of unexplained infertility and a loss in 2019. Almost 3 years overall trying to start our family. I spent the last two years cleaning up my diet, ridding my body of all sorts of toxins, medications, caffeine, and sugars, balancing my hormones, being poked and prodded by a team of doctors to figure out what was wrong with me. It took all sorts of tests and painful procedures to get us to this point. Lots of therapy too.</p>
<p>And this is <em>exactly</em> why I will not be taking the vaccine. No one can assure me that it will not cause this or any other problems for my child. I have been doing all I can for this baby. I will not be a lab rat. I do not want to participate.</p>

        <p>Right?? my doctors and midwife haven't brought it up with me, thankfully. in fact I've been the one to bring it up with them and they all get really quiet and tell me it's my personal choice but they do not recommend it given my history. It must be so frustrating working in that environment. I'm sorry this nonsense has put you in that situation.</p>

        <p>First off, congratulations!! My wife and I just had our first after several years of the same experience. We ended up having to do IVF and it worked the second time. We planned an induced labor and they were supposed to contact my wife 48 hours prior to do a blood test for Covid.  They didn’t. Anyway, they tested her(PCR) the moment we entered the hospital to give birth and she tested positive(of course). Worked from home, never showed any symptoms, etc.. After birth, they tried to force us to test our son, which I refused vehemently. For kicks, I asked what would happen if he tested positive, and they told me that they would incubate him(neonatal ICU) for several days and medicate accordingly. The rest of our stay, they treated us like shit, minus a few cool nurses. We weren’t allowed to leave the room and absolutely no visitors. One nurse came in, in full hazmat gear, scolding me for not wearing a mask while holding my child. I told her to mind her own damn business and to not return to our room. It wasn’t concern that I felt from most of them. It was aggression for the choice that our family was making. Several nurses and pediatricians came in over the next 24 hrs trying to convince us to test our son. They wanted to keep him for an extended stay while they stuck a cotton swab up his nose multiple times. I finally told the last pediatrician to have our paperwork ready the next day, because we were walking out the door. I guess I’m just giving you a heads up, and my message to you is to try to let it roll off your back. Whatever decisions you make regarding your child, be firm with them from the start. Don’t let them try to take away from one of the best moments of your life. I’m sorry for your struggle, I’ve been there, and I’m glad it’s finally happening for you guys. It’s truly a remarkable experience.</p>

        <p>Thank you! We will try our best!! I have a midwife picked out already and she said that she is able and willing to do a home birth. My only issue with that is we are 2 hours from a hospital in case there is a complication and my husband is firmly against it at the moment so I'm looking into nearby birthing centres as well. Last resort will be the hospital and only if I absolutely have to. Thankfully, I have had many appointments there over the last two years and no one has brought up covid at all with me (so far). I just have to follow masking protocols for the most part. I feel bad for my midwife though, and my GP... they will be getting all the questions thrown at them throughout this. I hope they're prepared to deal with this anxious mama lol. Ultimately, I want to be prepared as best I can so when the time comes, I can be confident in my choices. Thank you for your encouragement and sharing your story. I'm so glad to hear you were successful in IVF and in standing your ground. All the best to you and your family! Stay strong ❤︎</p>

        <p>Thank you!! Our next step was IVF and covid had drained our life savings so we had completely given up hope that we could have a family when it finally happened. We certainly weren't expecting it! And yes, we didn't feel right taking this shot before, especially being treated for infertility, but getting pregnant just made us more resolute in our decision. I am not risking anything for this baby. </p>
<p>I'm so happy for you!! Thank you for sharing your story with me ❤ Enjoy every precious moment and stay strong.</p>

<p>That last sentence is what the urgency is <em>all</em> about... and I'm sure they have a plan for when the truth surfaces.</p>
<p>We're already mad at the government. What happens when the other side is just as mad as we are, and more?</p>
<p>Remember, before you can replace one system you need everyone ready to embrace a new one. It's no coincidence that "America" as a brand name has been tarnished, trashed, and demolished. The flag has become a cartoon associated with media-created caricatures of "racist MAGA supporters from the South."</p>
<p>Remember when Google celebrated every country's Constitution Day except America's? <em>This was no coincidence.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccine side effects are coming.</li>
<li>Economic collapse is coming.</li>
<li>Systemic change is coming.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are one step ahead of us on all of it... And never think for a moment that ANY of this is "incompetence." If you ever think that, ask yourself how is it that they have ALL the money and power in the world and we are desperate to go outside without a mask, to not be locked down, and for the simple right to say no to an experimental genetic modification?</p>

        <p>The worst part about this is that thalidomide was such a non-essential intervention for the overwhelming number of people just like this mRNA vaccine. It was put out there as a drug to treat nausea from morning sickness (there are other uses even today, but this is what caused all these birth defects). No doubt, nobody wants morning sickness, but, except in very rare cases, it's not that bad. Similarly, nobody wants a coronavirus, but, except in very rare and fairly predictable cases, it's not that bad.</p>

        <p>From what I’ve experienced, they make drugs for one thing. Maybe it does or doesn’t work for that. But oh look, it has an unintended side effect of stopping twitching or maybe being pain relief. So let’s market it for that as well...
Which is how I ended up with my physician prescribing me anti-epilepsy medication for chronic pain.</p>

        <p>Every drug, chemical, food additive, etc. that was ever yanked from the market and banned, first had to be approved. The ones who figure these things out early and dodge the biggest bullets are always on the fringe doing their own reading, because it is an incontrovertible fact that it takes years and years for health issues to be officially recognized and addressed. In the interim is denial, heated debates, mockery, countless victims, and lots and lots of lobbying and PR shenanigans on the part of the guilty industry to kick the can just a little further down the road.</p>
<p>Don't let anyone ever make you feel bad about doing your own research and coming to your own conclusions. Even if you turn out to be wrong at times, you'll still come out ahead compared to the many people who don't even try</p>

        <p>Exactly. The processes fpr verifying the safety of new technologies are either non-existent or are compromised by the huge money that can be used by those pushing for them.</p>
<p>And if someone has the capacity to develop practical solutions based on novel technology and mass produce them quickly... Does anyone really believe that this someone does not have enough influence/money for bribes to push their product as 'safe and effective'?</p>

        <p>EXACTLY! Even poisoning from mercury can take months to appear. Minamata, Japan - sometime in the 50s I think it was - they found mercury in the water supply from a chemical company. The side-effects were pretty awful. Congenital disease, paralysis, insanity, death.</p>

        <p>My mom told me that when we were young, the pediatrician tried to push some new vaccine on us and she refused. She said the next time we were there, that particular vax had been crossed out in black sharpie on the recommended vaccine schedule poster. She asked why and the nurse told her they had too many deaths and the vaccine was no longer recommended. Yikes.</p>

<p>I was injected with the first measles vaccine in 1962. I got very sick from it. I was actually allowed to stay home from school I was so sick. </p>
<p>It was subsequently  pulled from the market. A  new measles vaccine was introduced in 1968 and is the same one still used today.</p>
<p>I've always wondered what damage it did to me.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear about your issues, hopefully there was no long term damage. My older siblings and I were born in the mid to late 80’s, but I just called my mom and apparently this was for my younger brother and it was the Rotavirus vaccine. They pulled it around 1999. My older brother also got red spots all over his body after a vaccine in the 80’s and the doctors didn’t seem to care. I’m just skeptical about new vaccines as you’re basically part of an experiment.</p>

<p>And it is not about that one medical treatment, it is about the model of them forcing us to undergo treatment, for ourselves or our babies and children. They are open experimenting on us, and they don't really care about us, they care only about themselves. All those people above could have been your child, all of those people could have been you. But thank god we can now abort all those miserable creatures, amiright.</p>

        <p>Yes you can't rush science.</p>
<p>But sometimes it's a race between science and nature, then what do you do?</p>
<p>This is literally the only way things can work. You can't rush science, but you cant also stand idly by while millions of people die when you are pretty, pretty, PRETTY, almost damn certain you have an answer? Even when you have a 99.99997% effective vaccine? You guys are such jokesters. EL OH EL! XD!! ROTFLMAO!</p>
<p>I honestly still can't tell if this is all just satire and I'm taking the bait.</p>
<p>If the entire world followed the ideology of this sub, even as it collapsed they would find another entity to blame or point their finger at.</p>
<p>Consider me <strong>DOUBLE Pfizer Based &amp; Masked-in-Public Pilled,</strong> because I'm going on a cruise this year and they require PROOF OF VACCINATION.</p>

        <p>Even if you want to believe the standards are better today, look who’s making the vaccines. Pfizer has the second largest pharmaceutical settlement at 1.2 <em>billion</em>, and JNJ in <em>2020</em> had to have their talcum powder recalled for fucking <em>asbestos</em></p>
<p>Also, Accutane was patented in the 1980s, and was recalled later for birth defects among other things, so that’s much more recent</p>
