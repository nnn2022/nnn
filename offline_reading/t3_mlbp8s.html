        <p>Let me first say I am right leaning primarily, and I don’t this it was planed. That being said that’s safe prediction to make seeing as most recent presidents have had some kind of out break virus. That being said I 100% believe that they capitalized on who was in office and used every opportunity to restrict our freedoms</p>

        <p>Almost every part of this pandemic was planned.<br>
It could mean "prepared for" or "staged". </p>
<p>The fact is, that there is not really a pandemic. The tests are extremely inaccurate with 95%+ false positives. And all numbers are extremely exaggerated. Doctors and experts who speak out against this are being targeted. Especially if they actually have a good treatment against the disease.</p>
<p>This all is the indication of a coup against the people, hidden behind a fake "medical emergency". And we see that in the solutions that are brought forward:  </p>
<p>1) Halting of normal life.<br>
a. Stay at home orders.<br>
b. Lockdowns.<br>
c. Forbidden to go to places for rest. parks/beach.<br>
d. Church is forbidden (while wallmart is open).<br>
e. Closure of normal business.<br>
g. Closure of health improving businesses. (Fitness/ yoga)  </p>
<p>2) Destruction of democracy.<br>
a. Extreme censorship 
b. Extreme propaganda.<br>
c. Attack of protesters. 
d. Witch-hunt on dissent.<br>
e. Attack on governments that want freedom.<br>
f. Fake testing.<br>
g. Fake elections.<br>
h. Preparation of wars.  </p>
<p>3) Gigantic money transfers<br>
a. Creation of enormous debt.<br>
b. Lots of money going to big businesses. <br>
c. Extreme demands by medical companies<br>
  (like military bases and no responsibility).  </p>
<p>4) Removal of liberty<br>
a. tracking and tracing of everyone. <br>
b. Pushing of passports.<br>
c. Be a guinea pig for medicine companies.<br>
d. Take-over of vital resources<br>
e. Extreme restrictions on travel.  </p>
<p>I could almost say that China gives people more freedom than the western countries 
(like the UK),  but it is getting really close.</p>

        <p>Right on. I just posted almost exactly the same thing in another forum. The lack of critical thinking skills in the majority of people is disturbing. To believe this narrative to be true, you would have to 100% believe that the government, CIA, MSM would never lie to push an agenda. To believe they would never lie, you’d have to be completely ignorant of history. It’s truly sickening. Well said my friend.</p>

        <p>He caused a lot of panic by giving an interview where he said we "couldn't rule out" that AIDS didn't spread by touching surfaces that infected people touch, or that it was airborne. Even though enough evidence was already available to pretty much rule these methods of transmission out. In turn this caused even more panic and stigma.</p>

        <p>Fauci is a Democrat operative and has had the proceedings that have occurred in the last year holstered for some time now jut waiting to pull the trigger. This plandemic was all about removing Trump because the Democrats knew there was no way to remove him other than nefarious activities.  Put stealing an election on the list next to planning a pandemic. Remember the Democrat credo well: "Don't let a good crisis go to waste".</p>

        <p>I think you are close but you're thinking just a little small. "Don't let a good crisis go to waste" is not a credo exclusive to Democrats. The people who use crises to gain power do not play the Democrat vs Republican game, except to pretend it exists to distract the peasants.</p>

        <p>Every single part of this so-called "pandemic" WAS planned from top to bottom. With that fucking POS, Dr. Fauci being at the top of it (along with Bill Gates). Anyone who can't see this is a fool.</p>

        <p>This right here is why no one takes you seriously. You're in the group of people who thinks that they're so much more enlightened than everyone else. In reality, you're paranoid and brainwashed and you probably trust everything Fox news tells you. </p>
<p>Now you need a scapegoat so you point the finger at a world renowned physician and bill fucking gates. I bet you believe gates is trying to plant chips in us and the big 5G is gonna kill us all.</p>

        <p>Who's "no one"? Assholes like YOU?! Go and take your shot you damn fool! Because seriously, NO ONE thinks Dr. Fauci is a "renowned physician" or that a eugenicist like Bill Gates is a great guy! And btw, you're too brainwashed to even know that Fox News has been pushing the vaccine propaganda 24/7 too!</p>

        <p>I remember seeing something after 2009 H1N1 saying that that should be a wake up call and we should be prepared for something worse. I wish I could find it. I also remember seeing an article a few months back saying that there's gonna be another pandemic next decade. So yeah they're all planned imo.</p>

        <p>If you’re over 30 years old and haven’t figured out that most crises are planned false flag operations for the elite to profit and gain more power from, you must have been in a coma. I’m most afraid of the children growing up now thinking that this is all normal and having no concept of what individuality and freedom actually look like. If we think things are bad now, just wait until they’re in power.</p>

        <p>the difference here being that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/19/trump-tweets-chinese-virus-racist/">anti asian sentiments on twitter have increased</a>, and the amount of anti-asian harassment and attacks has increased since trump's usage of the word, while the same hasnt happened for spanish people. calling it the chinese virus does demonstrable harm to chinese people and the asian community. it contributes to racism.</p>

        <p>You are literally contributing to racism right now by relegating the entire cause of any increases in "anti-Asian sentiments", harassment or violences to something as trivial as Trump calling it a "Chinese virus", that is fucking pathetic and simply childish.</p>
<p>This increase in anti-Chinese sentiment couldn't possibly have anything to do with China commiting acts of violence against the citizens of other countries and territories, or putting Muslims in concentration camps simply based on their religion.</p>

        <p>bro did you even read the article</p>
<p>also can you clarify how exactly im contributing to racism- i dont see how identifying a problem with trump's speech contributes to this. i also acknowledge that maybe some people have anti-chinese sentiments because of its govt, but that doesnt mean trump has not played HUGE role. i would recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>also the chinese govt doing heinous shit doesnt justify more anti chinese sentiment to individuals living in the us. it is quite literally racist to do this.</p>

        <p>Is it Asians? Or Chinese?  If Chinese, do you mean Han Chinese or one of the 7 other races in the PRC?  China is a country, and Asia is a continent.  None of the people who actually live there recognize these labels as their race.  </p>
<p>Calling this a chinese virus is just as racist as lyme disease is racist against Connecticutians</p>

        <p>i dont know what point youre trying to make with the first part of ur comment. im talking about harassment of asians in the us, who definitely do view asian as part of their identity. calling it the china virus contributes to this harassment.</p>
