    <strong>Word choice matters</strong>
    <p><p>&lt;rant class="text-uppercase"&rt;</p>
<p>Did y'all ever notice how all of everything is pure speculation regarding covid, masks and lockdowns? None of what is being said is based on hard evidence. I've noticed "the experts" always use phrases such as:</p>
<p>This could happen</p>
<p>It may reach a certain point</p>
<p>It is likely</p>
<p>There is potential</p>
<p>You could be</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<p>All gray area words that bear no weight and only stoke the fear fire.</p>
<p>People read (not comprehend - there is a difference) those words and (mis)interpret them as:</p>
<p>This will happen</p>
<p>It will reach a certain point</p>
<p>It's guaranteed</p>
<p>There is certainty</p>
<p>You are</p>
<p>Without any doubt</p>
<p>Case in point: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/what-if-covid-becomes-endemic.html?&amp;doc=106851355</p>
<p>I am tired of seeing any variants of the following:</p>
<p>"if we hadn't locked down we could have been at 10s of millions of deaths from Covid in America"</p>
<p>"you could be spreading disease so wear a mask"</p>
<p>"this new variant could spell trouble"</p>
<p>"vaccine efficacy might not be what we once though and could spell trouble for future immunity. They may not be the replacement for social distancing and masking up"</p>
<p>"It's just a mask; what's the big deal?"</p>
<p>As someone who used to write argumentative essays and documents, I would have gotten dinged heavily for using any variant of vocabulary from the first list. The worst part? This people don't even realize they're regurgitating the same information but replacing the gray area words with strong statements.</p>
<p>Here are things I can say will happen with 200% certainty:</p>
<p>We will have a huge economic recession as a result of this</p>
<p>Kids will have psychological issues going forward from this isolationism</p>
<p>People will be afraid of invisible threats and other people</p>
<p>Governments and Corporations know they have a free pass to do what they want to a population under the guise of health and safety.</p>
<p>There is a massive increase in crime</p>
<p>Kids are falling behind educationally</p>
<p>Social media is destroying the fabric of society</p>
<p>The world as we knew it is forever changed thanks to a generation of misguided and brainwashed masses. (The masses &rt; Da masses &rt; dumbasses)</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&rt;</p></p>

        <p>Yep, I notice that too. It is all ambiguous, speculative, and most of all meant to sound as exaggerated and scary as possible so people keep acting and thinking purely based off emotion</p>

        <p>Very good post. Especially your point about argumentative essays. Naysayers think it's hard to create propaganda but really it isn't. I've bullshitted plenty of essays by using careful word choice. It's rather easy to do, especially if you write for a living. And when you're writing for a "reputable" newspaper, it can feel really legitimate.</p>
