    <strong>Prolonging The Scamdemic - Part way through hayfever season, the BBC warned that the Delta variant causes a runny nose and headache, days later UK hospitals are now overwhelmed with people with hayfever and/or headaches.</strong>
    <p><p>Monday 14th June, BBC "Headache and runny nose linked to Delta variant"</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57467051</p>
<p>People arriving at A&amp;E with colds, headaches and hayfever</p>
<p>Saturday 19th June, Bristol Post "People arriving at A&amp;E with colds, headaches and hayfever - A&amp;E departments have seen record attendances in recent weeks"</p>

<p>What's more likely, that the BBC are a bunch of low-IQ fools who didn't realize they would cause the hospitals to become unnecessarily overwhelmed, or is it more likely that the globalist BBC know exactly what they are doing, spreading fear in order to make the masses easier to control, making them more likely to accept bad things they never would have accepted during normal times?</p></p>
