        <p>When the judge ruled that the military couldn't force troops to take the anthrax vaccine, the lack of full FDA approval was central to his ruling.  They are going to avoid the potential litigation issues of the vaccine coercion efforts by getting full FDA approval this summer.  </p>
<p>Please remember that the trials will not be completed until 2023.  Please remember there is no longer a placebo or control group because these companies decided their vaccines were so great that to follow protocol and keep a control group would unfairly punish those who didn't get the dose.</p>
<p>&rt;Moderna is seeking full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to administer its coronavirus vaccine in people 18 and older, the company said Monday. The vaccine is being given to adults in America under an emergency use authorization, which was granted in December.</p>

        <p>So fucked up. How is this even happening?  Im afraid current law suit like in tx wont set any new expanded precedent either...  like how about at least trials finished (!!) or hey this is  “gene therapy” (according to modernas own sec filings) not a typical vaccine...  or how about no mandatory vaccinations / health procedures - period!!!</p>

        <p>Honestly at this point I hope people to start dying off en masse and that this is stopped dead in its tracks...  It’s brutal what’s happening if you just want to make a choice about your own body And if you try to ignore it you can’t unsee these things not To mention now you have to consider whether you’re vaccinated to do certain activities...  and perhaps keep your job. fuck this shit.</p>

        <p>Fuck this shit indeed. Last week my work "lifted" the covid protocols. So I called in sick and said "Not feeling well, not coming in" which leads to an email. </p>
<ol>
<li>do you have any covid symptoms</li>
<li>contact with +</li>
<li>been tested</li>
<li><strong>Have you been vaccinated?</strong></li>
<li>some other bullshit</li>
<li>overreaching question</li>
</ol>
<p>I say all no's and a yes to number 4 because "lifted protocols" means the unvaccinated still wear muzzles. </p>
<p>I get another email. "Please send a copy of your vaccine card, thanks!" .....</p>
<p>I just replied "I won't be sending you a copy" and basically said I thought the protocols were "LIFTED" and that I'm tired of dealing with these overreaching questions that are nobody's business but my own. </p>
<p>Probably get fired. Just got married, first house, first baby, first 2 pets, and now I'm gonna get fired for standing up for my bodily autonomy and right to exist as part of functioning society without de-humanizing myself to the point where I consider myself a walking contagion, a literal virus or enemy. </p>
<p>Funny how HR has dehumanized me more than anyone in my life. De-Humanizing Resources</p>
