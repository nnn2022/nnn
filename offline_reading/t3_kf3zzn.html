    <strong>Ministry of Truth and 2+2=5</strong>
    <p><p>I just had the most fascinating interaction with a doomer and they are evolving. </p>
<p>Doomers have made the evolution </p>
<p>From: That information is incorrect. </p>
<p>To: Dismissing any information <em>even if it agrees or becomes accepted mainstream information</em> on the basis that if you're <em>not</em> a doomer, you are a wrongthinker, automatically wrong, and thusly to be completely ignored. </p>
<p>I find this development terrifying. </p>
<p>That anything I say is dismissed on the basis of my skepticism on covid matters. </p>
<p>The doomer I interacted with went as far as to say they are going to precrime me and say that my source is completely invalid because it comes from me. </p>
<p>They literally said they would make the assumption that because <em>I</em> posted the source, it was tampered with and somehow distorted. </p>
<p>I worry about the future. We are fast approaching 2+2=5 territory. </p>
<p>To where anything that comes out of the mouth or keyboard of a non-doomer will be presumed false or if correct, it is still somehow incorrect. </p>
<p>This goes beyond your typical denial that comes when you challenge someone's reality and into some frightening <em>you will comply</em> and <em>you will deny the evident truth</em> hysteria. </p>
<p>2+2 <em>will</em> equal 5.</p>
<p>Background: I cited a New York Post article that contained someone from Moderna admitting the vaccine had no data available showing asymptomatic spread would be prevented from by the vaccine. </p>
<p>The article contained an interview they were using as a source where the man said this out of his own mouth </p>
<p>The doomer argued that because I provided the source, it was <em>obviously</em> edited to suit a narrative and he/she would not accept any evidence presented by me. </p>
<p>Even though this has become accepted by doomers (that the vaccine won't prevent asymptomatic spread)  I must still be persecuted and marginalized for my wrongthink.</p></p>

        <p>This has always been the case! We are blasphemous non-believers, they will never trust us.</p>
<p>It isnt about actually following the covid guidelines, its whether or not you <em>believe</em></p>

        <p>I just posted about how I've given doomers papers directly from the WHO and CDC showing mask are not effective outside of a health care facility and they still would not accept the information. One claimed it was out dated because it was two months old after publishing. Then 2 days ago The NY post writes in article saying the exact same thing the paper said, smh.</p>
