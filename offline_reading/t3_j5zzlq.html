    <strong>The doomers were onto covid from the very start.</strong>
    <p><p>I remember back when covid was still in China (January I think), someone on the Wuhanflu subreddit posted a sensationalist and fake video. It showed CCTV footage of supposed Chinese people collapsing from the novel coronavirus. Oh. And shown with literally the soundtrack of Contagion 2011 in the background.</p>
<p>Most people on that sub (doomers) fully embraced the sensationalist fear mongering as if they were unconsciously hoping for this to happen all over the world. Only like 2 people had the common sense and guts to point out how the footage was from different Asian countries (because they showed different alphabets), and that all those people probably collapsed from heart attacks.</p></p>

        <p>I think it's because life tends to be boring and feels meaningless at times.  Maybe it's the ultimate sign of privilege that I have everything needed for survival and more, yet want less. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, clothes to wear, and I fantasize about having to defend it all when someone or something come to take it away.  There seems to be a primal need for adversity that a warehouse job and suburban family life just don't satiate.</p>
<p>I'd be lying if I said in the beginning of the pandemic I didn't get a little antsy thinking this might be it.  Finally something happening.  Reality set in quickly but the media continues to write their fantastical pandemic apocalypse magnum opus.  Why would they want it to end? It's like a TV show that was great in the beginning and gets worse with every episode.  If people keep watching they'll keep churning out trash. It doesn't matter if they're twisting and shitting on the source material.  Money talks and piles of bodies are like piles of cash for news organizations.  </p>
<p>That's also giving them the benefit of the doubt that its all about money and not something more sinister...</p>

        <p>How do so few people remember just back in January and February all that footage allegedly from China with people collapsing and dying in the streets? When none of that happened anywhere else I knew something was seriously afoot with how the media is trying to spin the severity of it. Itâ€™s obvious as the sky is blue, yet here we are.</p>

        <p>Yes, I belonged to a gay forum not on reddit and they were talking about it in January as well. They started warning everyone in February to go to the store and start stocking up on supplies because it was about to hit the fan. When March came they felt vindicated.
  It's still doomer Central over there so I moved on. Anyone who tried to talk sensibly about it was called Boris ( they were still hung up on Russia gate as well and some seriously believed Russians had infiltrated the site to sway opinion) last time I posted There was August about how Sweden was down to just a couple deaths a day and most likely reached herd immunity and they were like "stop trying to make sweden happen, it's not happening!". 
It was a real shame, I used to love their dark bitchy sense of humor but between trump and covid they have become insufferable. They loved fauci from the begining, they started calling him Saint fauci. Funny enough they didn't like brix, mainly because of her scarf fetish, they thought she was trying to hide an old lady turkey neck.</p>

        <p>Am I the only one who knew (from a friend in Mongolia) about a "pandemic in asia" in November of last year?</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/intelligence-report-warned-coronavirus-crisis-early-november-sources/story?id=70031273">US media</a> says we had intelligence about it then, and that it did not make it to the President's briefing until it was thoroughly vetted by January.</p>

        <p>This is the video <a href="https://streamable.com/5rqln">WUHAN CONTAGION ONEpoint6</a></p>
<p>There's 5 hours of video footage from china that I know of. Whether or not some of it was fake, overall it was a total shitshow.</p>
