    <strong>Check your political bias at the door</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't a purely political issue. Assuming what someone's opinion will be based on a preconceived bias is not doing anyone any favors and is being used to discredit this sub and the movement. I know republicans who are pro vax and think everyone should be forced, I know democrats who are afraid of the shot being harmful. If this becomes a partisan issue the movement is done for. Don't allow it to become one, there are people here that wish to destabilize and discredit this group and they are using methods which we are not aware of and honestly it will work if we don't wise up to it.  Thank you all, keep up the good fight and remember to put your mental health first.</p></p>

        <p>If the enemy is able to put a label on us (other than being against the new norm) they can discredit us. For example, however you feel about the pro life movement the following is true; it's obvious that using ad hominem attacks, and citing their party allegiance is being used to remove credibility and point out hypocrisy in the movement. :The hypocrisy of the pro life movement is that many of its members trample over women's rights in other arenas. So they are able to change the conversation from the actual issue to attacking perceived alternative motivations.</p>
<p>It's already being done here. Critics have tried to point out fallacies in our logic and hypocrisy in our beliefs. They've tried to say we are all anti mask, or anti vax, or Trump supporters. We are a diverse group, while you may be able to discredit 1 or even a sub section of this group with those tactics it will not work on all of us. We need to recognize, embrace and promote that we all come from different political , racial and socioeconomic backgrounds in order to be successful.</p>

        <p>Correct, and they are hoping and attempting (by giving us no other outlets through bans) to bring those arguments here as a way to subvert the group.</p>

        <p>I'll add that I believe it's not sufficient for us to be banned from other groups. That's not the goal, it's also not the goal to simply disband the subreddit at the height of its popularity. No you have to destroy the emerging movement by causing division and tension and then ban the group. Banning us now will remove us from this sub and maybe even Reddit but it will only strengthen our cause and conviction. The enemy knows this, and we are starting to be seen as a problem to be dealt with and resources are going to be allocated in a way we haven't seen before to "deal" with the problem. The number one search on books was anti vaccine. It was on the MSM, it's their move.</p>

        <p>Partly true. There from both parties on both sides of every issue. That does not mean it's not political.</p>
