        <p>I think she's trying to claim that every single COVID case (or at least the overwhelming majority) was caused by somebody not complying with restrictions and that, if every single person had complied with all of the restrictions, this would have been over almost as soon as it started. </p>
<p>Obviously she is wrong.</p>

        <p>In her post she says that her friend was at risk even before Covid was introduced. I don't even know what her ultimate message is, she sounds super incoherent like she's trying to mush different ideas at the same time and they contradict each other.</p>

        <p>I got the impression that she was saying that her friend didn't have long left to live following a cancer diagnosis. Then instead of being able to make the most of their last year of life, her friend ended up locked up at home unable to do anything because of the threat of COVID. </p>
<p>She never explicitly states it, but I got the impression that she was trying to say that this would have all been over a year and a half ago if everybody had worn a mask and stayed at home.</p>

        <p>She's an attention seeker (its her escape and addiction), using her friend as bait for that attention.  Then she plugs in her real intention to shame the anticovid people.</p>

        <p>A good reminder (that this gal clearly didn’t get) that life is short and you should live it to the fullest, love and hug your friends and family, do the things you want to do, see the people and places you want to see, no matter what TV or govt tells you.</p>

        <p>I think you simply don't get it.</p>
<p>She is angry that some people are denying the existence of covid and needlessly prolonging the pandemic. Covid, which caused her friend to stay home so that she wouldn't catch it.</p>
<p>She is not saying it's their fault her friend died, but that it is their fault that her friend had last year of her life made miserable. Which it very much is.</p>
