    <strong>Just a question as someone who supports the mask mandates</strong>
    <p><p>Even if the masks are used for some nefarious purpose like expanding government control, or for fearmongering, at what point does the cost of human life outweigh the alleged problems with masks?</p></p>

        <p>Dude, 300,000 lives is still a lot regardless of math. That’s an objective fact. Do they deserve to die for your personal ideals? And what if all the scientific evidence that show masks reduce transmission rates? No one seemed to care when surgeons wore them in practice, so what’s the issue now?</p>

        <p>So lets say I am 75 years old, have chronic hypertension, and copd from 50+ years of smoking. I then get covid and die. Are you, a stranger who lives god knows where, responsible for my death because you didn't wear a mask when you went to the store? Or am I to blame because my poor life choices and old age made it so a virus with a 99.7% survival rate was fatal for me?</p>

        <p>I am not personally responsible for that death specifically, but if everyone wore a mask, then the probability of that death occurring would have been reduced. Cause you may not be responsible for that death, but your grandparents who smoked back in the day, or other relatives who did it when they were younger? If they died those deaths would be on your hands.</p>

        <p>Those deaths would not be on me. Personal responsibility is what it's all about. I'm a recovering alcoholic. I don't think the world should cater to me, the minority, who has a problem with alcohol. It's up to me to make wise choices for myself. If I was in a high risk category for covid, again the minority, it would be up to me to take precautionary measures</p>

        <p>So if you don’t take them, and by not doing so affect the lives around you negatively, that makes you responsible. The same logic applies to drunk driving. If you get behind the wheel drunk and hit somebody, it’s your fault. If you have a virus and don’t take measures to limit your exposure to others and get them sick, that’s also your fault.</p>

        <p>You're out of your fuckin tree pal. By your logic, everyone is equal to a drunk driver because up until this past March, nobody wore a mask or social distanced, but we all caught and spread viruses at some point. The drunk driving argument is pretty overdramatic too. If some guy is hammered and hits you with a car, I doubt you would have a 99.7% chance of survival, and the crash sure as hell wouldn't be asymptomatic</p>

        <p>So if you know your comparison sucks, why use it? If you really believe that drunk driving is comparable to not wearing a mask, I don't know what to tell you. Should we outlaw outdoor gatherings because someone may develop skin cancer and die as the result of sun exposure? If you don't use your head, you could go down that rabbit hole forever</p>

        <p>Since I doubt you've actually read it, here is verbatim the first amendment of the constitution "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." So, I also didn't mention protests (who the hell has time for that?) My exact words were assemble, and to do so peaceably in the form of practicing religion is literally what the amendment says. Telling me i cannot goes against this. Also it doesn't say "public" assembly? Are you just adding that word into the constitution? Source: US Constitution</p>

        <p>Show me where I said that I didn’t care about heart disease. I do care about it, but Covid is a much more immediate issue, and unlike heart disease I can do more to prevent others from getting it than recommending a diet change or exercise. How can you actively prevent heart disease in someone other than yourself? And now compare that to what the CDC and other organizations the world over say you can do to protect yourself and others from covid.</p>

        <p>No, it isn’t a much more immediate issue. Twice as many people have died from heart disease than covid, so if covid is important to you, then I damn sure expect the same vigor to be displayed towards saving people from heart problems.</p>
<p>Not to mention, masks are FOR THE WEARER. All the bs about “your mask saves me” is just that: bs. If a person is immunocompromised or wants to be safe, then they can totally wear a mask. But mandating healthy people wear masks isn’t about health</p>

        <p>Masks have never been for the sake of the wearer. Masks have always been advertised as a way to prevent you from spreading anything, cause you could always be asymptomatic, or latent, or have it and not know it, thereby limiting your spread of it even when you think you’re healthy. Wanna talk bs? Let’s talk about all the politicians who downplayed the virus yet somehow those same guys are the first in line for a vaccine. Also Mitch McConnell always wore a mask.

        <p>&rt;What are the negative effects to wearing a mask?</p>
<p>Well there's the obvious, with government mandating mask-wearing. But that aside, mask wearing always comes with social distancing. Which leads to a large spike in (mostly small) businesses closing, unemployment, poverty, home loss, terrible education, anxiety, depression, suicide, etc. List goes on and on. Gets even worse if you're a proponent of lockdowns.</p>
<p>All for a virus that you'll possibly maybe catch, which then can potentially maybe sorta kinda have the chance to harm you, when those who are truly afraid of this weak as fuck virus could just stay home. It's easier than ever to stay home and be lazy. It's also what you'd do if you truly cared about saving lives. As opposed to going out in public and then demanding everyone else be as terrified and paranoid as you are, expecting them to adhere to your standards of safety and sanitation.</p>
<p>&rt;Surgeons</p>
<p>Speaking of surgeons, the best part of all of this is that how people wear masks is likely to not even help very much, since the Average Joe doesn't wear one like a surgeon does. The Average Joe wears a dirty old piece of cloth (likely improperly) over their mouth, touches it all the time, doesn't store it properly, and doesn't wear a quality of mask that's actually effective. That's not to say that they don't ever help in certain scenarios, but the notion that dirty old cloth masks are our saving grace is silly.</p>

        <p>Did you read that article before posting it? The author states that surgical masks are useless and only N95 masks that are properly fitted are useful. The HHS recommendations at end of that article don’t even include masks as a tool for limiting spread. They recommend hand hygiene, covering you mouth when sneezing/coughing, avoiding those who are sick, etc.</p>

        <p>But yet the CDC still advised against using them. “ Due to the limited supply of both facemasks and respirators each flu season, the CDC recommends that these be used only in occupational health care settings by a professional looking after a patient with “known, probable, or suspected H1N1 infection.” And this is referring to surgical masks being used in a controlled setting, by professionals, with proper donning and doffing techniques. If the surgical masks aren’t very effective, how effective are cloth masks?</p>

        <p>&rt;A study conducted by Dr. William Lindsley at the West Virginia University Urgent Care Clinic in February 2009 found that a surgical facemask admitted 20% of respiratory particles given off by a coughing simulator (a machine) placed six feet away. In contrast, the N95 respirator blocked nearly all respiratory particles.</p>
<p>Yeah, N95 isn't for peasants, we only get surgical facemasks at best.</p>
<p>Also, mask wearing really only is effective (at best) for wearing in close contact siutations like in your household. Do you think people wear masks in their own home? 99% of the mask fanatics out there do NOT use them at home. </p>
<p>&rt;A study conducted in 2008 by researchers in Australia found that facemasks used in households to prevent transmission of the flu virus were not effective, primarily because people didn’t use them regularly. </p>

        <p>Masks were never meant to protect you from others, they’re meant to protect others from you. That’s why they’re much more effective if everyone wears them. If I can limit what I put into the world, then the chance that someone else gets covid from me, or something else from me is limited as well. So if everyone wears it, the chance that you get it also goes down by transitive property</p>

        <p>Listen, saying "if everyone wears it" is not arguing in good faith, it's like saying "communism is great, if everyone would just obey". Because people don't. YOU don't. YOU don't wear a mask at your own home. ALmost nobody does that. And that's how the spread keeps happening. Wanna explain why california is a dumpster fire in caseload despite all their mandates?</p>
<p>As a matter of public policy, masks have been proven over and over to NOT WORK. Please show me a study that demonstrates otherwise (spoiler alert,  you can't, just look at real life, with uncontrollable waves of covid spread in all the restrictive states and countries).</p>

        <p>Can you prove a cloth mask prevents death? If anything the typical cloth masks lowers the wearers immune system due to oxygen restriction, and depending on whether or not they change or wash it, it probably leads to infection</p>

        <p>Sure can. Data from Germany indicates that not only is the infection rate (determined by infected population over population total) much lower, but the recovery rate is much higher. They have a nationwide mask requirement. The US has no such mandate, has a much higher infection rate and a much lower recovery rate.</p>

        <p>Masks, never because I don't believe that the science supports the efficacy of wearing masks outside of hospitals settings. If something doesn't work it doesn't work. I won't start wearing the magic anti-tiger rock around my neck even if tiger attacks are up by 15000% (not trying to be an asshole, just illustrating the point). </p>
<p>As for the lockdowns, shutdowns, distancing measures etc. probably never as well because I don't believe that you will reach a point wear the lockdown cure is not worse than the disease until well beyond the point when most people would voluntarily isolate. </p>
<p>With that said, I would be forgiving of the people who want lockdowns etc. if at least we were facing a disease with significantly greater lethality than any in modern history. My rationale for this is that I believe in the power of natural selection of not just organisms but also cultures. So if no organism and no culture has ever instituted measures even approaching what we are doing now to control a pandemic then I am immediately highly skeptical that the measures are good for society. Furthermore, I would argue, if we were able to handle worse pandemics in the past without full on shutdowns of society then we will be able to handle it now.</p>
<p>Nonetheless covid is nowhere approaching the most lethal disease in modern history. In many countries it is not even the most lethal pandemic in 30 years.</p>

        <p>If the virus is airborne, then no, regular masks are not effective. At best, they reduce viral load.</p>
<p>If the virus is transmitted by droplets, then your mask will catch those droplets. </p>
<p>Lots of studies show conflicting data and you can cherry pick the ones that fit your belief.</p>
<p>I'll be honest and say I don't mind people wearing masks. As an RN that works very closely to patient's faces, I appreciate masks. I've had patients accidentally spit in my face as they talk to me and others that don't cover their mouth when they cough/sneeze. So masks on them are a plus for me. </p>
<p>But, I am concerned about the slippery slope this creates. Next comes mandated vaccines. Then what?</p>

        <p>I can tell you are at least self aware of the fearmongering so there's hope that you can pull your head out of the rest of the lies. The first step is accepting that literally everything you hear from "news media" is either a complete fabrication or a twisted distortion of some underlying truth. It's a hard leap to make.</p>
<p>So on the mask subject, let me put it to you this way. I grew up and went through pretty standard science classes in high school which all had roughly this to say on the subject of the human immune system: it's amazingly intricate, and sometimes it fails entirely. <em>Even the common cold can kill you if you aren't careful.</em> Those exact words. But that's what's happening this year. The seasonal 'bug' that always, always makes its way round those with average to low immunity, <strong>did its ordinary thing</strong>. The only difference this time was that the news, in a rapid coordinated effort that ought to be firm proof that there is SOME kind of conspiracy afoot, went absolutely apeshit all at once. "People are dying! You have to keep your distance! Stay at home! Shut down your business!". Never mind that there is not, nor ever has been a truly accurate lab test to verify if someone has this virus which can distinguish it from "has ever had the cold in the past few years". Just count everyone who reads positive on this bogus quick test as a Case so we can report BIG NUMBERS (this isn't standard medicine, a Case is usually a person who is literally feeling ill, presenting symptoms). </p>
<p>The math works out like this: 99.98% means that out of every 10000 people who fall ill with this disease, about 2 of them will die. If you assume that Every Last Man Woman and Child in the U.S. could be a capital-C Case, that would leave us with over 65 thousand dead. Tragic, huh? But that's flawed thinking. Not everyone in the world is going to get sick, a hell of a lot of us have made up our minds to avoid that bullshit test whether we feel ill or not, and peak season for this disease already came and went. The curve may or may not have "flattened" like they said but it's over and done. There's no Second Wave (that's because they dragged this out all the way to a whole new flu season). There's no Asymptomatic Carriers lurking among you spraying virus out of their disease ridden airways. That's absolute nonsense they made up to sell you on those mandates you're so fond of. You have to eject it forcibly from your mind or every discussion you have about this is going to be clouded by "...but, the deaths!" Sorry dude, but people die. It doesn't give anyone the right to declare by force of law that I have to wear a useless piece of cloth.</p>
