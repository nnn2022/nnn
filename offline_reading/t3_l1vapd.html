    <strong>I'm not having the Vaccine Because:</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>It takes 10 years to properly develop a Vaccine. Not 10 months. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would I need to take something %95 effective to combat something I'm %99.7 not going die from? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccine was just another goal post that was conveniently moved as soon as it was reached. (Remember when we where told as soon  as there was a vaccine things would go back to normal, yet here in England we are still in a national lockdown with no end date) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've never been more healthy and I don't want anything to compromise that. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm a white, working class, male. So even if I wanted the vaccine I'm the last person on the list of 66million to get it. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I've never been anti vaccination. But I am anti propaganda, and all China virus has been is one big marketing campaign.</p></p>

        <p>In France, there are talks of "vaccinal passport" . You would not be able to go to the restaurant, cinema, travel, use public transportations... if not vaccined.
They say vaccine will never be mandatory, but they will make you an outcast.</p>

        <p>Go read some posts on the covid vaccinated sub. People who have never had mental problems before are developing major depression and anxiety sympotms after getting the jab. Most people's mental health has taken a hit during the last year and this is just going to exacerbate that</p>

        <p>I support you, mostly. It is good that you are ok. Inside and out. But using drugs is ok, lit, little bit of white from time to time, some blue, red, purple, green home made pills, weed, crystal meth and so on. It is ok, cool. But 1 dose of some fluid is bad? Come on people. No one cares honestly, but this shit talking from both sides is apsurd. I will "vax" myself and I respect your choice. I don´t care, but saying that this is some drug or something lethal is funny as fuck from someone who was an addict.</p>

        <p>Because I see no reason to take it. I am a largely healthy 30something who works from home in a job that has nothing to do with healthcare. When I’m in the office, I work in a building the public doesn’t come in to. Let my grandparents and family who are in health care have access.</p>
<p>Because I don’t see the point if we still can’t have normal life. What is the incentive for me to take it if I still have to wear a mask and still can’t have a fully reopened society? Once the vaccine is available for all, restrictions should end and maybe then I will consider the vaccine.</p>
<p>Because I don’t want to risk side effects. There’s been too many reports of allergic reactions and illnesses to make me comfortable with taking it.</p>

        <p>Yup, something about covid has people sliding deflection arguments left and right. You point out the inconsistency in the data. </p>
<p>The one thing I learned that did make sense though - was the case numbers are higher than normal on purpose. Like the reason a car crash would be counted as covid is because with that noted - the infection spread can be studied. If that’s how it was presented it would be no problem, but we’re using these case numbers as justification to shut down, which isn’t fair. </p>
<p>I believe there will be enough rational people to fight back and we will see the pendulum swinging to convict all of the criminals responsible</p>

        <p>It's hard to make decisions given data that you don't trust. Amplify that with the fact that most people don't go looking at the data and trust the face value and trust "experts" to do the thinking for them. Amplify THAT with fear. And you get a bunch of headless chickens clucking at each other running around fighting amongst themselves. Nothing any of us could have done. The general public is way too dumb to figure anything out.  </p>
<p>Fear is the driving force in "long covid". Even people I consider smart and healthy have told me this fear. To me, it doesn't justify the lockdowns lasting this long. Keep in mind, I was pro-lockdown when they were saying "2 weeks".</p>

        <p>Yes, when this first started out, with the projections of millions dead, I can see how the world came to a halt. </p>
<p>Now people seem to have this false instilled belief that they are safe because they are going everywhere with a mask on, when the truth is we are all safe because this wasn’t a deadly pandemic as projected. the policies never caught up with the updates in the data, And the only people who can stop the lockdowns are the people profiting billions/trillions of dollars imposing them</p>

        <p>https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/statementsandletters/theprevalenceoflongcovidsymptomsandcovid19complications Here's the ONS saying it looks like about 10% at 12 weeks, based on early experimental data.</p>
<p>We all want to be free, but seriously, if the vaccine works we're really not that far away from being able to live free <em>and</em> not permanently disable a chunk of our previously young, healthy population. Isn't that better?</p>

        <p>There are a couple criticisms I can point out about this survey.</p>
<p>1) Asymptomatic people were probably not part of the survey. So only the people who had symptoms or were affected most probably replied to it. Selection bias.</p>
<p>2) When there's a lot of fear over something, and you finally get it, you tend to be more aware of "symptoms" you may have already had but never paid attention to before. For example, you may have always had a stuffy nose or was never really that aware of your breathing until you got covid. This can affect people's responses. The study states that they want to do a qualitative question about how badly it affects people's quality of life to get a sense of how bad symptoms are. So definitely less than 10% have life affecting symptoms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And finally, I'll ask this to you: should we lock down for a year every time there's a new novel infectious disease? I mean covid is 99% survival rate. And we're still in lockdowns. Imagine something mildly more potent.</p>

        <p>Don't forget that it's an mRNA process, so very very new. While mRNA vaccines are promising, we don't yet have the billions of doses given to determine the rate of frequent side effects let alone outlier effects, or the more than a century of longitudinal studies across massive populations, to be as confident of this method as the traditional method.</p>
<p>These are just neutral, uncontroversial facts about the new-method vaccine. What to take from those facts is, or at least should be, completely up to you. I don't fear growing another arm or anything if I take the mRNA vaccine, but I still won't do it because I'm not prone to being an early adopter if costs are too high or risks too unknowable, which is currently the case for mRNA vaccines. I will have the exact same opinion when we start to use bacteriophages seriously in place of antibiotics, though we are in a better place in terms of experience with those than we are with mRNA vaccination.</p>

        <p>I don't get why this simple calculus is so hard for people. The polio vaccine killed people for decades before they got it right. Now, if I had had polio in the 50s, I would have probably taken it anyway, because it's freaking polio. But give my age demographic and general health, I'm more likely to die in a car accident going to get the vaccine than I am to get and die from covid.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and I’d rather die a quick death of Covid (which is more unlikely than dying in a car accident) than to suffer from autoimmune diseases for several decades before I die, because I wanted to be a guinea pig for the pharma industry.</p>

<p>The vaccine spread polio and by the time the vaccine "worked" it pretty much killed itself off. The reality is if they did nothing polio would have died off much sooner.</p>

<p>However I'm a bit of a pussy. If my doc tells me to do it whilst I'm in for a visit or whatever, and he says not to worry about the autoimmune stuff, I might just, because I do trust him, it doesnt cost me time or money, and I dont want to ruffle feathers. I will not do it if some random Joe wants me to however.</p>

<p>Why should we blindly trust pharmaceutical companies that are some of the most unethical corporations in the world? Don’t believe me? If you Google “Pfizer criminal history” this is the first thing that pops up: “Pfizer has been a “habitual offender,” persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards.”</p>

        <p>I'll try to answer each point you made. Maybe i'll get downvoted or ban, and I know I won't change your mind, but even if I just modify your perspective, progress would have been made.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The aim of this vaccine is not to eradicate Covid (like  we did with measles) but to limit the spread of the virus. Just like the flu, each year, a new strain arrive, so labs create a new vaccine. Each year. So the technique require way less time.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because even if there is a very little chance that you die from it, many people that were young with no issue before end up having very bad side effects (check the xray photos of  covid patient lungs. And because the 95% effectiveness is for the error margin if  tha vaccine work or not. It will not hurt you in any form.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes because not every citizens are vaccinated right now. I'm not a fan of lockdowns either, but it is the easiest and cheapest form of control for gouvernement to limit the spread.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I tried to put it in the second point, in the worst case scenario, the vaccine will do nothing to your organism. In contrary,  chances are way higher that you contract breathing difficulty thanks to covid, even after having it, that having side effects by the most checked and verified vaccine in history.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm a healthy white male to, and I feel you. I won't get the possibility to get vaccinated before at least 6 months. But hey, vulnerable and none vulnerable people are dying from it, and mostly, people are taking beds in hospital, and we do not have enough of them. So I'd be glad to take it if it mean I won't occupy an hospital bed for a week when another person would have need it to survive.   </p>
</li>

<p>Have a nice day mate.</p>

        <p>You're starting with the assumption that we need to do something to limit the spread of the virus. We don't. This isn't different from any other cold or flu virus, occasional severe side-effects included. Your points hinge on the virus being something that it's not.</p>
<p>&rt;in the worst case scenario, the vaccine will do nothing to your organism</p>
<p>If it does nothing to you whatsoever, then how on earth does it work? I don't want to inject myself with some engineered bullshit no matter how "harmless" it is. I don't need it and I don't want it.</p>

<p>The science behind the most effective vaccine started developing years ago, vaccines work using the virus itself to trigger a response in your body, now it attacks a specific protein in the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because you can infect others that are more exposed to it and because you don't know if you'll be in the percentage of people who died without previous medical conditions or get completely fucked lungs afterwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logistics behind the vaccine and the magnitude of infections due to morons like you or people in this sub is what makes the vaccination plan/production so much complicated as opposed to other pandemics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst side effects for the vaccines are more rare and less severe than the more common and worse afflictions caused by getting Covid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The why are you running your mouth if you're going to complain about not being prioritized because you don't work Covid areas.</p>

        <p>I'd rather take my chances. I havent even heard of a covid case personally, let alone organ damage being done to anyone because of it. So id take a guess that it is somewhat rare</p>

        <p>I don't vaccinate myself to protect others. I don't vaccinate my kids to protect others. It's not my job and I feel no obligation to inject our bodies with a rushed vaccine to protect others. I doubt there are any significant "long-term effects" to worry about for the majority of the population.</p>
