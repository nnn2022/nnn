    <strong>fight big pharma strict educational unsafe vaccines mandates to save kids health</strong>
    <p><p>after a comment battle i thought it might be good to say</p>
<p>big pharma has been and still is injecting mercury a known neurotoxin into USA kids causing brain damage</p>
<p>its precisely because a rampant big pharma lobby wants to mandate the injecting of health destroying, sometimes life destroying bad product into our kids that negatively impacts on their health that i am taking the time to talk to you.</p>
<p>bobby  Kennedy, famous JFK relative, environmental lawyer has been fighting them in the courts for a decade</p>
<p>watch the link below and you will understand a little better what the extent of the lobby's effects are on your education systemis . it is not health concerns that are truly driving policy around vaccination in Americas education system.</p>

<p>he won this battle but then they re introduced it in the flu shot and a flu shot mandate.. this is it seems they have intent to keep pumping mercury into kids brains in the USA causing a autism epidemic</p>
<p>see this more recent</p>
<p>Robert deniro and a another vaccine injured attorney talking at a press conference about how journalism has also been shut down by big pharma money</p>
<p>short highlight clip</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIDdXqa14nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIDdXqa14nw</a></p>
<p>the full press conference</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GluT_R99pck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GluT_R99pck</a></p>
<p>it is only through educated people willing to fight that we are going to stop an increasing epidemic of harm,</p>
<p>so i pray take the time to get educated by looking at the links above and stop advocating for vaccine mandates and being ignorant of the size and power of the vaccine lobby.</p>
<p>at the very least i<a href="https://lobby.it">t</a> is inhumane and discriminatory to back in education the marginalization of those families who have suffered or are aware of the possibilities of death and injuries but i guess excusable if based on ignorance which itself is being generated by the vaccine lobby.</p>

<p>most people probably do not know big pharma is the biggest lobbying force on the planet! the press is being corrupted by big pharma too.</p></p>
