    <strong>Youtube comment shadow banned for saying "Corbett Report"</strong>
    <p><p>(I was advising someone on where they'd find some useful information)</p>
<p>I know this because when signed in, I could see it there along with 13 other comments. I signed out and viewed the same thread and lo and behold, 12 comments, mine wasn't there.</p>
<p>To be sure it wasn't a problem with my account I checked three other comments I made around the same time and they were visible whether signed in or out.</p>
<p>I knew certain URL-links had been banned because the same thing happened weeks back when I posted the link to an eBook - 1200 Studies: The Truth Will Prevail (has a lot of good info on vaccines that the industry would rather people not see. And let's not forget Youtube/Google <em>are</em> in the pharmaceutical industry now.)</p>
<p>So keep this in mind when you type the name of somebody that the establishment doesn't like. It might be that no one can see the comment except for yourself.</p></p>

        <p>I noticed the same. I tried to upload his latest editorial and it kept getting shadow removed. Itâ€™s the algorithm surely. I doubt the mods on here are actively removing Corbett report stuff?</p>

        <p>Not sure about Reddit. This was simply including his name in a youtube comment (not on his channel). Yeah algorithms for sure. Shows how far they go in their effort to suppress info.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm using the alternatives more and youtube less now. Not going to sit by while free speech is eroded away..</p>

        <p>I've just made a new account and it's already on the shadow ban list.  I can't even write "when you think you can respawn". Or "George lives matter"  on scarcity studios channel.  Comments are there signed in but not signed out.  Even comments that stay hardly ever get a like now so I'd assume they're all on some level of banning.</p>
