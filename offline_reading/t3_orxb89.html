    <strong>Hey you, doomer. Yeah you, that's right. I'm talking to you. I have some hard questions for you.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>1.) When has it ever been the case in history, that the group who harasses, censors, persecutes, and exiles those who question the government <em>were the good guys?</em> </p>
<p>2.) Did governments around the world suddenly stop using the thousand year old technique of propaganda/psychological warfare? In particular, to turn their citizens against any particular group of individuals they deem to be a danger against the ruling class?</p>
<p>3.) When did big pharma suddenly stop being a corrupt monolith whose very survival depends on <em>more</em> of their customers being sick and unhealthy?</p>
<p>4.) When did the greedy greaseball that is the American military industrial complex become an infallibly trustworthy entity?</p>
<p>5.) Would you drive on a bridge that was a) rushed into production and b) the construction company that built it has no liability if the bridge fails?</p>
<p>6.) This is perhaps the most important question, especially to the American (in name only) doomers. Is it really that inconceivable for so many in this sub to have a strong sense of distrust towards the American government? The same entity that in the last 100 years has admitted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) kidnapping innocent men and women, drugging them with LSD, DMT, MDMA, mescaline, Psilocybin, meth, cocaine and more, and violently beating + sexually assaulting them while under the influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) deliberately infecting a large portion of the black community with syphilis under the guise of being treated for "bad blood"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c) injecting terminal hospital patients with radioactive plutonium without telling them exactly what it was they were being injected with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d) using prostitutes to lure unsuspecting men into a hotel room to be unknowingly drugged with LSD, MDMA, meth, psilocybin, and more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e) testing biological weapons by releasing experimental bacteria on american citizens in San Francisco not once, not twice, not thrice, but SIX TIMES </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>f) <em>after injecting the measles vaccine into thousands of babies in third world countries, and subsequently  finding out that this led to severe immune disorders, (and sometimes death) then proceeding to inject over 1500 African American and Hispanic babies, only stopping when reports of African and Hispanic children dying at an alarming rate 3 years later came up.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To add to point f), the CDC later admitted in a public statement that the parents were unaware their children were being injected with a non FDA approved, experimental drug. <em>Sound familiar?</em></p>
<p>Is it <em>really that crazy to not trust the entity that did all the above and more, when they tell us we must be vaccinated, or else?</em></p>
<p>Above; I mentioned that American doomers are American in name only, and I meant it. The spirit of America is to live and let live, to respect the bodily autonomy and personal choices of those around you, and above all else, protect the innate right of the governed to question the government.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to fight for the right of the governed to question the government, even though you're a disgrace to everything our forefathers and fallen patriots fought and died for, <em>I will still fight to the death to protect your freedom to choose to do so.</em></p>
<p>Ponder these questions, and comment your response. I do not wish to argue with you, but merely help you understand that we are not irrational lunatics that hate all vaccines, we're just aware that governments didnt stop being corrupt and untrustworthy in 2001.</p>
<p>Edit: for everyone else in the sub, I highly encourage you to screenshot these questions, and send them to every doomer you feel has an ear to listen. Obviously, there will be many that will simply resort to ad hominem and reply with the classic "REEEEE", maybe this will even be the majority.... but the seed will (hopefully) have been planted. These questions are made to force the average doomer rethink their position and examine it from a historically aware lens. This is crucial in order to preserve our freedoms in the safest, most effective manner; instilling critical thinking in the average doomer.</p>
<p>Do not give up hope for your fellow countrymen and women, for there will be a light at the end of the tunnel so long as we just keep going.</p></p>

        <p>These are great questions.</p>
<p>Of course, Doomers will never answer. They'll say something obnoxious and condescending like, "Ouf, I don't have time to explain this to you."</p>
<p>These people can't even defend their own bullshit position.  And in the current corrupt environment, they don't even have to.</p>

<p>And yes, you're correct that they do not have to defend their points. The state thinks and speaks for them, they just don't know it, like a fish doesn't know that its wet.</p>

        <p>For the Moderna claim, I didn’t like that the source behind the story was Wikipedia (which didn’t provide a source). So I searched around a bit and found / few different articles stating the same. On Moderna’s website they make no mention as far as I can tell of another product on the market either. So it appears that that is true.</p>
<p>Kind of scary that Moderna has worked on at least 20 other drugs but none have made it to market (or are even close) except one, their COVID-19 ‘vax’ and it hasn’t even been through the typical process due to EUA. So yeah, if people want to go be the animal trial, go for it. Don’t tell me to though, you can fuck right off </p>

        <p>Agreed. The actual data, logic and reason is on our side, there is no need for anyone to spread disinformation or use deceptive practices (not that you were) when you have that on your side. </p>
<p>I don’t always click through every link posted but in this case I found that to be a particularly fascinating claim that has a good chance of sticking out to the ‘normies’</p>

        <p>This times 100!
I’ve brought up some absolute facts about COVID19 and the jab.  They don’t want to hear it.  They aren’t even the least bit curious.  They don’t want to see proof.  Many of these are friends and people I’m related to.  It’s easier to dismiss offhand and call me a tim foil hat wearer than to do any critical thinking.  They don’t want the red pill, life is easier in the matrix I guess.  I don’t know if it’s an attention span problem as much as a selective attention span problem.  Most of them have no problem watching hours of fake MSM and won’t question a thing.  They won’t even question it when it’s contradicting and makes zero sense.  It’s gotta be MK Utra mass hypnosis or something.</p>

        <p>“Doomer” here, I’ll take a shot at replying. I agree with almost everything you said. Governments and pharmaceutical companies have a history of doing evil things. Here’s the problem though, what if the vaccines are actually safe and effective? In that case, what’s the government supposed to do? (A) If they try to get everyone to take the vaccine you’ll say people shouldn’t because the government can’t be trusted. (B) If they do nothing you’ll say their silence is suspicious and if the vaccines were safe then why isn’t the government trying to get people to take them. No matter what the government does you will say it’s proof that the vaccine is dangerous so what difference does the government’s position make? Is there anything that would convince you the vaccine is safe?</p>

        <p>As an "anti-vaxxer" (funny how either side of this topic has a nice label) I'll share my views. This reply ended up being longer than I thought, please do take the time to consider my points. </p>
<p>First off I wanna say I very much hope and pray that these vaccines are actually safe and effective, and that they will actually bring us out of this pandemic. I am not a sensationalist, I do not hop on bandwagons because it's fun and exciting. I'm a realist, I weigh up evidence from both sides and come to my own conclusions. I'm not always right, and this is just my opinion.</p>
<p>If this pandemic was truly as deadly as it has been made out to be, there would be absolutely no need to 'push' the vaccine on anybody. For example, if a vaccine for cancer was released do you think the government would need to bribe, cooerse or threaten anybody to take it?</p>
<p>My concerns about the vaccine are not necessarily about the vaccine itself - but rather the path it lays for the future.</p>
<p>I think we can both agree that covid is a very survivable virus for the vast majority of people (99.7% to be exact) - and that the vaccines in response are under a year old.</p>
<p>A vaccine normally takes 10+ years to study for safety, because you cannot change time. For example, there wasn't enough time for a full pregnancy term during the covid vaccine testing. And if the baby does seem alright, how do we know what neurological issues could crop up years later? Unless the scientists making the vaccine have a time machine, absolutely noone on this planet knows with 100% certainty that they truly are safe and effective. Especially since this is the first time ever using mrna tech on humans.</p>
<p>Given the apparent risk of death by covid, or potential health issues from a rushed vaccine - I'm going to take my chances with covid. Is it selfish? Absolutely. But I'm sorry pal, other people's health is not my problem.</p>
<p>Also we now know that the vaccines don't even stop you from contracting OR spreading the virus, so really what's the point?</p>
<p>Now factor in the crazy response from the world leaders. There are many many many red flags in this response and if you'd been following from the start you'd be living in denial to believe that everything they've done is for our safety.</p>
<p>&rt;what’s the government supposed to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liability for the vaccines they're pushing would be a great start. They don't even have confidence in their own product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isolate those at risk as it's such a small percentage and leave everyone else to get on with their lives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer the vaccine, but do not force it. It's a personal decision. You could achieve herd immunity through a percentage vaccinated and a percentage with natural anti-bodies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not censor, cancel or smear any discussion against the narrative. This does not install much trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use the pandemic as a springboard for ever increasing overreach and control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, this pandemic is weak. The virus does kill people, but literally only 0.3% by the CDC's data. The response does not match the severity. Something else is going on. If the virus was more severe, it would justify their actions.</p>

<p>The 99.97% rate is a fake number that Emma Jimenez claimed was from the CDC but it isn't. The actual numbers vary by age, as you said, but the overall case fatality rate in America is 1.77%. That's the number of deaths divided by confirmed cases. There have been 34.4 million confirmed cases in the USA and 610'000 Americans have died so far.</p>
<p>You say that if the pandemic was truly deadly then no one would need to push the vaccine on anybody, but is that true? The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed a total of 200k Japanese and covid's already killed three times that many Americans. I don't know anyone who describes nuclear weapons as safe so I have to conclude that deadliness isn't the point here.</p>
<p>I don't believe the vaccines risk long-term side-effects. I feel fairly safe in that belief because dozens of vaccines have seen large-scale usage over the past century and none of them had long-term side-effects. Of course I can't possibly know that the vaccines are safe with perfect certainty but I do know with certainty that a lot of the covid survivors are leaving the hospital towing an oxygen tank. I know with certainty that covid often causes permanent lung damage.</p>
<p>You are right that you can still get covid even if you've been vaccinated and you can still spread it, that's true. But that's true of every vaccine. Vaccines are not an impenetrable shield, they're more like army training for your immune system. Having a strong military doesn't make it impossible for a country to be invaded. On the other hand, not having a military makes it a lot more likely that you'll be invaded and a lot more likely that you'll be killed or maimed when it happens.</p>

        <p>Depends what you mean by trust.</p>
<p>Trust that they aren't malicious? Sure. Trust that they aren't being swayed by position and optics? Not so sure. that's why trust, but <em>verify</em> is important.</p>
<p>Do I believe the vaccine is inherently designed to be dangerous? No. But the pharma industry has a huge history of fabricating data and pressuring doctors. </p>
<p>The extent of which the optics around covid have been warped is evident just by Fauci himself, dude was hated universally for how much he fucked up the AIDS issue, and then suddenly he's a Messiah because Orange man bad.</p>
<p>The optics have muddied any messages that may have been clear or well intended, so the best option is to go "hey here's our analysis, and also here's the data for any third parties to audit"</p>

        <p>I get where you’re coming from, pharmaceutical reps are notorious for pressuring doctors to upsell meds.
I don’t understand who’s supposed to be trusted and why? Peer-reviewed studies seem like the way to go, they require analysis backed by data because otherwise there’s nothing for peers to review. But I’m not going to read those studies myself.
Doctors who only do research and never prescribe anything should be trustworthy, right?</p>

        <p>Not really. Research gets funded by whoever wants the result that benefits them. It's unfortunately unavoidable. Which is why you can always find "Study X finds Outcome Y" for pretty much anything.</p>
<p>So what's the answer? Just distrust science? </p>
<p>No</p>
<p>The answer is all anyone sane has been saying (mind you, a lot of nuts in this sub):</p>
<p>Put the option on the market, display your data, and let people make their own medical decisions in conjunction with their own doctor who knows their medical history if possible.</p>
<p>I have no issue with the vaccine existing or being promoted, I have <strong>huge</strong> issues with withholding services and access to society based on whether or not you've taken it.</p>
<p>I say this as someone with 1/2 shots and likely getting my second fairly soon.</p>
<p>I don't care if the shot prevented cancer with zero risk, don't make it mandatory.</p>

I don’t disagree that an uncomfortably large group of people all over the world have become ridden with fear and easily manipulated.

        <p>I am your target audience</p>
<p>1.)  As in all cases, both sides of a heated argument have bad actors that perpetuate the things listed here, which ever side is 'right' is going to have members of their group who can be deemed guilty of harassment, censure, persecution and the exiling of others from their current community. Neither side is clean in this, I will likely be downvoted so much that it is effectively censure  and I suspect a fair amount of harassment as well. I am not a part of this community though I will be exiled from it.</p>
<p>2.) Propaganda is a genie we can not put back in the bottle, it is a part of our collective experience and something we have to learn to live with, everyone uses it from the government on down to your social friends group. There are certainly bad faith actors exploiting the Covid situation to profit themselves and others in power, I would argue that is not the cause of the covid situation rather a symptom of the inherent greed and the large number of people who are willing to profit on the misery of others. From my perspective, being on the other side, I see this exploitation as occurring from actors in your own group profiting on selling the belief that this covid is some deep conspiracy that exists to keep you down. People selling air time on TV channels or selling merchandise over the internet or at rally's. I am sure it is occurring from greedy people who support my side as well and that is unfortunate and should I see it in my social circles and among those that agree with me, I hope I would call them on it.</p>
<p>3.) Big pharma has a lot to answer for and I support them answering for it, but the Covid situation, in so far as I can tell, was not caused by big pharma, they are however providing a solution to it, though if they were the cause, I would still support some serious prison time for those responsible, rather tired of the inconsequential fines for the opioid crisis rather than the Prison time some of these people deserve. </p>
<p>4.) I am not sure what the military industrial complex has to do with the Covid situation, perhaps I am not the target audience when it comes to this.</p>
<p>5.) Well, to make your analogy fair, is the side of the river I am standing on a forest that is  on fire and the bridge was built by the corp of army engineers in a heroic rush to save as many lives as possible? Yea, I think I would take my chances on the bridge, even if I understood that if it failed those responsible for trying to save me would not face legal consequences.</p>
<p>6.) Oh yes, our government has done many many bad things, on that we agree, it has also on occasion done good things, I hope we can agree on that as well, each situation has to be judged critically on its own merits rather than to be presumed morally corrupt by default. 'Big government' does not have an incentive to poison its entire population, including themselves, A morally corrupt scientist wishing to test their science on the uninformed is not what is going on here, we are as well informed of the risks (and there are risks) as we can be, but due to their being so many unknowns we are not as well informed as we would like to be, but, they are attempting to inform us and they are taking it themselves, which is not something that could have been said about the morally corrupt scientists in your examples.</p>
<p>I would like to further address some issues that I only tangential hit upon.</p>
<p>I believe that a huge issue is the restrictions on those that are unvaccinated in attending public events and patronizing businesses.</p>
<p>I could argue that you do not have a right to enter a private business except as protected by various laws and regulations which you can find <a href="https://www.erieinsurance.com/blog/anti-discrimination-laws-for-business">here</a>, not being vaccinated is not among those listed, thus by insisting on your right to enter private business you are disregarding the right of the property owner to determine who can enter their premise. This is a valid argument and it is ultimately one you can not win in the courts until your legislator's add you to the protected classes.</p>
<p>There is a growing divide among businesses that insist upon proof of vaccinations and those that want your business regardless. And irksome for many of you a growing willingness for the government and large corporations to make it easier for individual businesses that want to discriminate against the unvaccinated, to do so. Those businesses that do discriminate would argue that they are doing so to protect their patron's and their business. There is intense pressure on both sides and businesses are making what they believe is in their best interest as we are essentially voting with our dollars which type of businesses will succeed and like all good capitalist's markets it will play itself out.</p>
<p>I live in a very blue area that is already heavily vaccinated and most businesses do not require proof, I do believe that those few that do are generating a disproportionate amount of noise and that by and large it is mostly a non issue as most businesses just want to do business. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>

        <p>Great answer! Your response to 5 was pretty eye-opening - I feel like "it was rushed" is one of the weaker arguments, considering that they didn't skip any steps and were able to make more progress in a year with more funding, more dedicated effort, more volunteer trial subjects, etc.</p>

        <p>Here's an argument that people in denial use; they don't want to depopulate the world because then the income tax falls. There's less workers to build infrastructure. There's less people as slaves for the elite. </p>

        <p>I don't think mistrust of the government is unreasonable. I don't think it is unreasonable to be aware of the past transgressions of all the organizations you list: pharma, the US government, the military industrial complex. I think there is definitely a place for well informed discourse on important subjects like this, including dissenting opinions. </p>
<p>But let me flip this around a bit: you are using your perception of all these things (government, pharma, the military, the ruling class) to form your opinion on the vaccine. "Surely if the government and pharma, who are absolutely definitely not perfect and have done all of these bad things in the past, support something it must be evil" is your thought process. So here is the counterpoint to all of that: if the least desirable, least successful, least educated part of society is so afraid of a vaccine it sends a strong signal to the rest of us that your fears are baseless. Historically the conspiracy theorists, the people who make assinie statements like "even though you're a disgrace to everything our forefathers and fallen patriots fought and died for" are the bottom of the barrel of society in most if not all metrics. They aren't successful, they don't have healthy lives, they aren't productive members of society. They are usually failures with identities based on disproven theories and are therefore drawn to radical views. Well adjusted, happy, successful people don't fall into these pits of misinformation on the internet. It is really no different than religious radicals in the middle east, if you take a bunch of people with shitty lives and offer them some sense of belonging they will flock to it. </p>
<p>So if you took a hypothetical person who has been in stasis for 2 years and woke them up today with no knowledge of the pandemic, and exposed them to your screed, they would absolutely be driven away and implicitly trust the vaccine. They would look at the people that inhabit this sub, and then look at the well respected members of society getting vaccinated and living happy healthy lives, and go get their shot.</p>

        <p>Don’t forget to mention the nuclear testing we did in the Southern Asian islands, only to send back the natives that lived there prior so they could see the effects of nuclear radiation on people who already had nothing.

        <p>I don’t remember all these pharmaceutical adverts on TV growing up in the 70’s and 80’s.  Seems they started to creep in during the 90’s.  Does anyone really watch an advert for a prescription drug and ask their doctor about it?  Or is there a connection between the proliferation of big Pharma adds and fake news?  Set aside the fact most news outlets are owned by just a handful of companies.  Who really pays those big fat salaries to those fake news “journalists”?  I’m guessing big Pharma.  I’d be okay if I never saw a prescription advert again.  Back in the day we relied on doctors and pharmacists to know those things.  How did we ever survive without prescription drug adverts?</p>

        <p>I see your point, but that's also part of my argument. Censorship, for any reason, is tyrannical. I absolutely do not agree with the tactics Lincoln pulled as far as violating the shit out of the constitution, nor the federal government's decision to censor anti-war speech. </p>
<p>It is never, EVER okay to censor the people. If someone has a bad idea, let it be shot down in the battlefield of discourse. The more we censor the people, the further we regress as a society, for uncensored discussion is the foundation of true, meaningful progression in society at large.</p>

        <p>Sure, my point is that asking if it was ever the good guys could easily be answered "yes". I think what he did was tyrannical but Americans do in fact view him as the good guy. Rephrasing your question might be beneficial. For instance: "name one time in history where suppression of ideological opponents is to this day seen as a good thing". It's much more succinct and much harder to answer. The people we are against are masters at word games. So we must be deliberate and concise in our arguments.</p>

        <p>I mean isnt that what has been happening? I havent seen excamples of censorship per se (a reddit mod deleting your post or comment is not government censorship, epsecially if the sub is not political or covid related), just "bad ideas" beeing "shot down in the battlefield of discourse". </p>
<p>Ive seen a lot of people create content or comment on the safety of the vaccine and while there are ofc always people who just stupidly shout that they are wrong without an explenation, there are also people who try to debate and share information and knowlege. Seems far from censorship for me when you can easily comment on reddit, yt, twitter, fb etc.</p>
<p>Just because you have the right to voice your opinion doesnt guarantee you to be listend to or for people to like what you are saying.</p>

<p>I actually don't really care that they censor in the end. What's happening now is sort of the same as the state's reaction after the printing press started to be widely used. People will find a way around it, we always do. My guess is it'll be decentralized mesh networks that puts the censorship to bed, and that isn't far in the future.</p>

<p>Well attaching a fact check or disclaimer to posts with misinformation is not exactly censorship in my book as long as the post itself itself is still there. Othere than that i do not know how welse the governement or social media companies have interfered.</p>

<li>1Probably never, maybe Massachusetts Bay Colony vs Providence. </li>
<li>2a) No. </li>
<li>2b.) Do you think you guys are a threat to the ruling class? Cute. </li>
<li>3.) No. And they have certainly proved to be lead by short term oriented managers and morons again. </li>
<li>4.) No, lol. </li>
<li>5a.) Maybe, really depends on the technique used. In China they build lots of road bridges in 24h </li>
<li>5b.) Depends, if it is getting you out of a bad situation, say flooding, yeah, I'd take the army pontoon raft bridge to get to safety, wouldn't you? </li>
<li>6.) Distrust towards the government is certainly a good idea, especially the US one.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the American thing, live and let live... Not so sure, a few school kids that get shot might like to have a word. Ah wait, never mind.</p>
<p>Now to the actual heart of the mater:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes the governement is a terrible, but not everything that you read is a lie. </li>
<li>There are actually a lot of people that died of corona. That is a fact. Go do your own research if you don't trust the sources you have seen so far. </li>
<li>Many fewer people that are vaccinated are dieing of corona. Again, do your own study if you don't believe any published research. </li>
<li>Not only the government has an agenda, everyone does, including a lot of the lowdest anti vaxx voices. Virtually all of them make money with alternative medicinal treatments. So they are just like the Pharma companies, just smaller. </li>
<li>Getting the vaccine if you can is important as there are plenty of people who cannot get it for various reasons (too young, have allergies against ingridience, compromised imune systems etc) and they rely on the rest of us to not give them the disease.</li>
<li>Yes, a very small number of people that get the vaccine will die. And some of them would have survived corona. But just like surviving corona is a game of chance, as is surving the vaccine. Just with much better odds in favour of survival.</li>

        <p>This is what i dont like about this subreddit (and subreddits on the other side of the discussion as well tho they arent as bad in my experience) </p>
<p>The post was meant for "doomers" to awnser some questions and explain stuff that seemingly proofs the vaccines and the government are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>Posting this in your own echo chamber is ofc generating more positve reactions instead of actual awnsers but this is a good thing for the OP (and the echo chamber as a whole) because then they could say they presented the information and asked critical questions and noone could awnser because the post is supposedly factual/ communicating hard truths even if it isnt.</p>
<p>Still, so far so ~~good~~ normal/expected.</p>
<p>But then there is this comment above me, explaing fallacies in the original post and taking on the questions that "doomers" were supposedly not willing/able to awnser because they couldnt. And there are, at this point no comments, just downvotes! It seems there really is no intent to by most (not all) participants of this sub to question their beliefs or take new information into account while they just downvote if it doesnt fit their narrative. </p>
<p>Its just kinda sad.</p>

<p>I mean that's the thing right. Anti vax people see themselves as distrusting the government which on its own is a positive thing because the government is awful, but pro vax people see it as a complete rejection of science and protecting your fellow man. In my opinion, the studies, which many are done outside the US support the safety of the vaccines. The same science backs up the idea that anti vax people in this case are a huge danger for public health. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't trust the government, I trust scientists and the dozens of studies that back up the safety of these vaccines. The technology behind the vaccines didn't come from no where and has been proven to be safe. Do you think you're safe from propaganda? In my mind the anti covid vax mentality sprang from the anti mask mentality which sprang from conservative authority figures denying the severity or even the existence of covid against expert medical advice. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big pharma is awful and needs to be torn down, but they also made of corporations and have a vested interest in the virus being neutralized so businesses can go back to normal so people can afford to pay into the corrupt healthcare industry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worldwide medical and scientific intellectual field back up vaccine manufacturers and a trust that to a point. I don't think being skeptical is a bad thing at all, but at a certain point you have to realize that you're doing a lot of damage by denying the vaccines ability to stop covid from spreading and mutating into more harmful forms. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I was told the bridge was safe by hundreds of accredited experts and crossing would help ensure I had a few more years with my grandparents, yes every time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't trust the government to do anything, but that's just not all this is about. Worldwide health doesn't rest solely in the hands of governments, it's up to the people to decide what's best for them, and I respect that. What I don't respect is hiding behind a distrust of government to justify a distrust of science that's coming from all of the world.</p>

<p>It did spring from the Right but not because of denial. It had to with being able to make your own decision to wear or not wear a mask. To get or not get the vaccine. That is what OP is saying. He's not anti-vax or anything else. The Left is all about "my body, my choice" when it comes to murdering unborn babies but what about when it comes to masking or getting a vax? It all goes back to having the right to choose. I do not need anyone telling me I have to mask up or get a certain vaccine. I'll make my own choice. I just ask that you respect my choice when I make it. That's all.</p>

        <p>I mean we have to decide as a society between safety and personal choice. The government regulates what people do for reasons of public safety all the time. You can't drive drunk or fire a gun straight up in the air because while those are personal choices, they can hurt other people who are uninvolved. There are lots of people out there who can't get vaccines for valid biological reasons, and when people who could get the vaccines don't, it puts both groups at risk especially if those involved sent taking other precautions like masks and distancing.</p>

        <p>You're being extreme. Me choosing to not wear a mask is not in the same ballpark, it's not even the same sport as someone drunk driving or, for God's sake, firing a gun. I didn't say I wanted to go out in public while being COVID positive and spit on people. I don't get the flu vax either. The last time I got it, I was sick as hell for a week. I'm relatively you and relatively healthy so I'm not getting it. I'm not wearing a mask either. I wash my hands regularly and use hand sanitizer when I go out. I'm not gonna get in anyone's face and be breathing on them. That's my choice. I'm sorry of you disagree.</p>

        <p>You’re just spreading propaganda and misinformation mate. Unless you have underlying condition, (which I have a feeling your aunt did) then Covid is literally almost 100% survivable without the vaccine. There is no reason for anyone healthy to remotely get it, also the ones who do get it can now go about their lives.</p>
<p>Shutting down businesses, crushing livelihoods, forcing the elderly to die alone, screaming at people for not wearing masks, ruining childhoods by forcing masks on children and not allowing them to play, driving people to deaths of despair from overdose and suicide, and demanding people give up the basic human need and right to socialize face-to-face while framing an experimental injection as the ticket to freedom... all these things aren't selfish...</p>
<p>But living normally is? </p>
<p>It’s not about acknowledging the hurt, it’s about stopping unnecessary restrictive measures to contain a highly survivable flu.</p>

        <p>I never used the phrase "relatively deadly". Those are your words. I said relatively young and healthy but let me be more specific. It is my opinion if you are under 65 and have no pre-existing conditions you shouldn't get the vaccine if you choose not to do so. Not sure what any of this has to do with "walking over dead bodies"? Can driving down the interstate at 75 MPH be relatively deadly? Should I never drive on the interstate? Is my job at a steel mill relatively deadly? Should I not go to work? Everything in life has risk involved. Just because you think I'm living dangerously doesn't make it true.</p>

        <p>Thank you for discussing. You might want to check out the WHO vaccine summit Dec 2019. Their think tank admitted that doctors study vaccines for a handful of hours in their years at school and are not qualified to answer the legitimate questions of concerned patients/constituents. They also admit that there are no long term studies on how the many vaccines that are pushed interact with each other. From the horses mouth 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>That's not how VAERS works, millions of people are getting these vaccines and some die from unrelated causes after getting it. As for not preventing covid, the different vaccines have different rates of protection efficiency. All studies support that the mRNA vaccines in particular greatly reduce severity of covid and transmission rates in the cases where it doesn't completely stop infection.</p>

<p>This didn't stop people from assuming it was covid that killed someone - oh they got covid then died. thats a covid death. doesn't matter that they had bad lungs and a history of heart attacks and was obese.  </p>
<p>oh, but if someone becomes paralyzed or has debilitating rashes or dies within 2 days of getting the experimental injection - "some die from unrelated causes"</p>

        <p>Covid kills people with medical conditions more than people without. That's a given. If you don't trust the causality of covid death reports, you definitely shouldn't trust these reports. The first people to get these vaccines were the vulnerable and unhealthy, so it tracks that many would die shortly after receiving the vaccine. Everywhere I can find info on covid vaccine injury seems to have a lack of backed up reports.</p>

        <p>You're like a Christian appologist preaching to the choir that evolution is a lie. </p>
<p>The logical fallacies in this post are mind blowing. Not that you care. If you cared about the truth you'd find there are countless demonstrable facts that can only lead you to the conclusion that the vaccines will save countless lives and allow things to go back to normal. Just like they have since we started using them 100+ years ago. </p>
<p>Apparently believing in a giant conspiracy being coordinated by thousands of experts in their field across hundreds of governments worldwide is more in line with reality to you? Anti-vaxxers are literally maiming and killing themselves and others then wondering why they are being called stupid. </p>
<p>Side note, studies are finding one of the permanent effects of covid is a drop in cognitive function. So it looks like anti-vaxxers are going to get even dumber as they all eventually end up with the disease.</p>

<p>I'm not refuting vaccine effectiveness at all here, although it seems you may have been triggered by me pointing out the supposed trustworthiness of those pushing the vaccines. What I'm talking about here is that mandates of any kind are absolutely immoral, that censorship of dissenting opinions is tyrannical, and history proves this.</p>
<p>Name me one time where the ruling class who censored people who disagreed with the state was a good guy. No ad hominem, just name me on group of censors who were morally just in their actions.</p>

        <p>It has nothing to do with "believing" some authoritarian figure. It's about understanding what trained science has discovered through demonstrable evidence. </p>
<p>You believe and spread demonstrable lies and pretend you're the victims of tyranny when people punish you for those lies. No one is being censored for telling the truth.  The truth is you're helping a virus maim and kill people and there are plenty of examples to use where stopping people who do that is the right thing to do. You're not the victim. You are the oppressor.</p>

        <p>1) Nazis
2) Propaganda isn't the extreme conditioning device it was in places like Nazi Germany and the USSR
3) That's an America problem
4) Cannot answer. Why? See my username
5) The covid vaccines are methods to stop the internal spread of cells, while the bridge analogy is like saying that the vaccines take you from a to b, so the point does not stand.
6) Morals and governments have changed hugely in a fifth of that time, and have shifted more in the last century, in which empires have disbanded, WW2, the Cold War, the Gulf War and a lot of other wars happened, populations have grown, information ca now spread further and faster. Dictators and elected leaders have risen and fallen, and standards for rights have gotten higher. The paranoia of a century of instability has worn off, so acts like this and few and far between. So almost everything is more trustworthy.</p>

        <p>The American freedoms are meant to be taken literally, doobie. That’s the actual point of the Constitution; to outline your inalienable and god given rights to the freedoms written in the document. Clearly also states under no circumstances can these rights be declared temporary. Not for a pandemic, a war, or hell rising from the earth. When it says we have the right to freedom of speech and to peaceably assemble, it literally means we have a freedom to say what’s on our minds and that we can congregate as we see fit as long as it peaceful. It doesn’t say (*you can’t have your rights if we say you can’t). It’s called needing an amendment to the constitution to change it. Not like our government even gives a shit anymore but that’s a different story. It’s meant to be literal is all I’m saying.</p>
