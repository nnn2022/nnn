    <strong>School Plans to Reopen (details)</strong>
    <p><p>I work as a college biology professor, and my school has been working this summer on a reopening strategy. I was pretty happy about the prospect, and I let them know I was able to return for in-person classes. We had a college meeting the other day where we learned the details of what was needed, and I will share some of those details here.</p>
<p><strong>Face mask protocol</strong></p>
<p>Teachers must stay behind a plexiglass wall the entire time we teach. In addition to that, we must wear facemasks at all times. </p>
<p><strong>Virtual Learning Options</strong></p>
<p>The students had an option to opt for virtual learning, so we need to record the lecture so they can take the class asynchronously and we must find a way to engage them. Also, some of the classes have too many students for the socially distanced classroom, so we need to have a rotation of students who can attend the class "live".</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Weekly Testing</strong></p>
<p>We have mandatory weekly testing for all teachers and students. If a student tests positive, they need to quarantine in a separate dorm and then they are sent home to finish the semester as a virtual learner. I am not sure what happens if a teacher tests positive. </p>
<p><strong>Contact Tracing App Mandatory</strong></p>
<p>In order to enter the school you must have a contact tracing app downloaded and you need to scan it to gain access.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Tolerance Policy</strong></p>
<p>It was mentioned that if any student disobeys the social distancing/masks/etc. that security should be notified and the student would be escorted off and expelled.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I just wanted to share this here to see what you all thought of all these restrictions and if they are reasonable or not. I will share my own personal thoughts in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, I was quite excited to teach this fall, but with these measures in place I have lost any enthusiasm. I could live with the face masks and having to do extra work to accommodate for the virtual students, but the weekly testing and contact tracing especially get me. I do not want to install an invasive app on my phone, nor do I want to have regular medical tests. I also especially do not want to be put in a position where I need to snitch on a student for violating the guidelines. I feel quite hopeless and stuck. I want to work and I love teaching (plus I need the money to pay my bills), but this whole situation makes me want to quit (though my employment options otherwise are limited).</p></p>

        <p>Is this a school in the US? The mandatory weekly testing and the contact tracing app is a deal breaker for me. And wow... You actually get expelled for not social distancing or for not wearing a mask...</p>
<p>In my opinion, these restrictions are not reasonable. One thing that made college a great experience for me was the interaction I had with friends and others on campus and working together on some assignments or projects in person. Also some of the events that college would host including workshops or job fairs. These restrictions seem like they're going to take all of that away which would make me just go with online classes.</p>
<p>It is sad to see that students are gonna end up seeing each other as "biohazards" or risks to other peoples' health. Not only that, I imagine in an attempt to enforce these restrictions and make sure students are complying, the micromanagement will be so big that it will seem like an elementary school (socially distanced lines, monitoring students entering/exiting classrooms, lining up for food at the cafeteria, etc.).</p>

        <p>Our school put in the guidelines that "any student or family refusing a masknor requesting an exemption must choose the remote learning option."</p>
<p>Remote learning for us! </p>
<p>The most insane thing is that I will be dropping my kids off at school as the day ends for various sports practices all through the year. Soccer (I hope), volleyball, basketball, track and softball. For volleyball, soccer and basketball clinics there has been no masks required. Same kids... Same building. </p>
<p>It's insane.</p>

        <p>Oh OK. Wow, it's surprising to me that a school (probably more schools too) here in the U.S. is requiring contact tracing apps for entry. That's not a good sign. Hopefully they roll back on that requirement and the mandatory weekly testing requirement. I also hope that they change or remove that penalty for not socially distancing or wearing a mask. Imagine potentially not graduating on time just because you were standing to close to others or caught not wearing a mask. Are they also going to have the mask police on campus to ensure that students are wearing the masks correctly and not touching or adjusting them or making sure they put it on and take it off properly? I think that some students are going to get tired of these things too.</p>

        <p>In outdoor settings masks are not required I believe (when social distancing is possible), but inside they are. I do not know the particulars, but in the classrooms it is especially closely monitored, and I would imagine in the dorms and dining halls as well.</p>

        <p>It is a private school. I think the measures might be due partly to state mandates and also to make the school seem safe to concerned parents.</p>

        <p>I'm not a teacher or a parent, and I've been out of school for almost 10 years now, BUT....I would rather have no school at all than have school with all these rules and regulations. The testing and tracing.particularly bothers me. My husband's cousin went to college out of state last month, and now he's in quarantine because his roommate tested positive. Unfortunately, he came home a few weeks ago to visit with family, including my mother-in-law. Husband and I live with her, so we're really hoping school policies like this won't trickle down to us.</p>
