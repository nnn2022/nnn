        <p>I'd like to see actual stats that show how many people tested positive after the vaccine vs those who do not. Because it seems like it is very very common. 
Theres only so many times you can blame it on possibly catching it after completing the vaccine course before you have to look at the obvious</p>

        <p>Yeah it doesn't stop it. But it would be interesting if the stats indicated that the vaccine caused infection</p>

        <p>No he didn't. He was talking about what he'd settle for. Not what the first 2 proven vacines do:</p>
<p>&rt; “The primary thing you want to do is that if people get infected, prevent them from getting sick, and if you prevent them from getting sick, you will ultimately prevent them from getting seriously ill,” Fauci said at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit Monday.</p>
<p>&rt; “What I would settle for, and all of my colleagues would settle for, is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable disease,”</p>

        <p>That's from RT. It's the news the Kremlin wants you to read.</p>
<p>/edit - Oh jeez. The article debunks itself:
&rt; The majority were apparently infected shortly after receiving the first jab of the two-part vaccine – a period when the inoculation isn't expected to have kicked in yet.</p>

        <p>Maybe the headline was being somewhat sensational by not mentioning "before inoculation". But the report is sound and based on Israeli data which is also being reported in Western media like Sky News. It would have been biased had they omitted the para you quoted.</p>
<p>There were still around 1500 that tested positive after the inoculation. However that's no indication that the others were immune because of the vaccine or because they simply weren't exposed to the virus, yet. Probably impossible to get accurate data when there's many variables.</p>
<p>Personally, the eye opener for me was Pfizer's statement that clinical trials aren't exactly representative of what's going to be seen in the populous. I suppose that could be due to perhaps the trials cherry picking their subjects. Maybe you can enlighten me as to the age group(s) and health condition(s) of those that were in the trials? Though it's probably not worth the bother and we shall instead see based on live population data as the vaccine program progresses.</p>

        <p>More than sensational, the headline is misleading. I don't think 1500 actually qualifies as "thousands". Also, the vaccines were touted as "up to 94% effective". Seems like the more accurate headline should be "Vaccine Performs Better than Expected", but that would't be worthy of sharing on Reddit.</p>

        <p>Well that's not really an accurate headline either and probably sensational in itself. From the same article:</p>
<p>Israel's coronavirus tsar, Nachman Ash, reportedly complained to Israeli ministers about the insufficient protection provided by the first shot of the American vaccine. It turned out to be "less effective than we had thought" and "lower than Pfizer presented," Ash said.</p>
<p>However, yes they're happy with results after the 2nd dose.</p>
<p>We're definitely no where near knowing if the vaccine performs better than expected yet.</p>

        <p>Fair enough.
"Vaccine Performs Better than Expected So Far"</p>
<p>Far more accurate than their clickbait.</p>
