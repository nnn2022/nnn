    <strong>Experts</strong>
    <p><p>Experts said the world was flat. Experts said we were the center of the universe.  Experts said quasars were stars. Experts said neutrinos travelled faster than light. Experts thought the Milky Way was the entire universe. Experts thought the earth was 75,000 years old. Experts thought the universe was less than 2 billion years old. Experts built the Challenger. Experts built Chernobyl. Experts thought the moon had lakes and seas. Experts said masks don’t help lessen covid transmission. A few days later they said masks did help.  Experts said 20 million people would die of covid in a year. Experts said hillary Clinton would win a fair election against Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Why do people blindly trust someone because they have a paper showing they have higher education a few people agree they are very smart and deem them experts?  It’s sickening when people can’t think critically or answer direct questions. They just say “experts and scientists” say so even when there is nothing close to actual consensus.</p></p>

<p>There’s always been “experts”. You think the peasants came up with it and the king/emperor/whatever was like “yeah man, good one bub”?  Just because we’ve proved them wrong doesn’t mean they weren’t “experts” in their day. Invent a time machine and watch people laugh at our “experts” in few hundred years, if we don’t annihilate ourselves before then.</p>

<p>&rt;The flat Earth model is an archaic conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period (323 BC), the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period (31 BC), India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century. The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in ancient Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most pre-Socratics (6th–5th century BC) retained the flat Earth model.</p>

        <p>You can’t just pick a point in time you like. Most believed the earth was flat in the distant past. There were early theories of a heliocentric model. They were firmly rejected by the “experts” of the day. Sound familiar?  It wasn’t until the 16th century or so when “experts” started accepting this and it gained popularity in with the ruling class and academics. Do your homework and try to gain an understanding of historical acceptance of knowledge. There’s always someone who dissents with the “experts”. Sometimes they’re right. This seems to be logic you could understand. Now apply this to modern times and ask yourself why you trust every word out of the mouth of experts who were put on their pedestals by authoritarian government.</p>

        <p>Because if you control the information you control the thoughts.. if you control the thoughts you control the human.</p>
<p>Just the very fact that they are censoring things should be a giant red flag. If what they're saying is true why are they removing information why not let people just be crazy? What are they trying to hide? What are they so afraid of?</p>

        <p>I personally don't agree with the flat Earth theory but I question why they censor it. Why do they pick and choose certain things to hide from the people? What does believing in a flat Earth have to do with anything? They don't censor videos about the story of God and the creation of the universe. You can watch videos on the anunnaki and how they created man by splicing DNA with animals for days and days straight, but you say one word about a vaccine, one word about flat Earth, one word about election fraud, your banned.. erased from the internet.

        <p>Since you have an appeal to authority fallacy and can't think for yourself. Here is what your "experts" say...</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Mask mandates dont work:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work and some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a></p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17                   99.998%</p>
<p>18-49                99.95%</p>
<p>50-64                99.4%</p>
<p>65+                     91%</p>

<p>Examples of people that are vaccinated and die from covid:</p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/black-lives-matter-protests-haven-t-led-covid-19-spikes-n1232045</p>
<p>But lockdown protests did? </p>

<p>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-anti-lockdown-protests-spread-us-mobile-data-a9520561.html</p>
<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>

        <p>I'm going to ignore the irony of you calling me an idiot while simultaneously spelling your/you're wrong three times in one sentence.</p>
<p>Anyway. No, I do not deny covid. I have a household member with covid literally right now, as we speak.</p>
<p>Death count? It isn't so much about inflated counts (although there are inflated counts) as it is about a lack of speaking truth about WHO is dying. Do you know what the average covid death age is in my county? 78. Do you know what the average life expectancy is in my county? 78. I'm a person who is very rational and pragmatic. I know and accept that Mother Nature has given humanity a limit. Death is sad. Locking the country down because people are dying at a normal old age is ridiculous. If you want to talk about younger people dying from covid; let's talk about how the majority of them are morbidly obese. How is it that they get to ignore common sense practices for years on end, and then we shut the country down to save them? Nonsensical. </p>
<p>Safety measures? Like a cloth mask? Pfffft. I've seen people get covid with masks and people not get covid without masks. Miss me with that nonsense. Social distancing? Oh, you mean the kind that put a whole generation into the deepest depression of their lives? The kind that had February of 2021 rank highest in teen suicide attempts in who knows how long? That kind? Nope. Fuck that. I have one of those teens. When I saw her mental health begin to decline in the first lockdown, I basically commanded her to go see a friend. The vaccine? Oh, okay. I should put a vaccine in my body that I don't need? No thanks. You can. Feel free. Except when you get covid anyway, please do us all a favor and actually admit that it didn't do jack shit.</p>
