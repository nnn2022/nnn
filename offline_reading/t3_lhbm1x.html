    <strong>The war on natural medicine and self healing</strong>
    <p><p>I think the biggest thing I’ve noticed over the past year is the absolute vitriol for any comment on natural medicine or developing your own immunity through natural means- be it exercise (gyms closed), enhancing your immunity (vitamin D deficiency was marked in significant COVID cases- WEAR MASKS OUTSIDE) or constant punishment of anti-vaccine sentiment. </p>
<p>What I find most hilarious about the anti-vaccine movement is that, in Canada anyway, it’s been put on rich people in Toronto that ‘don’t care about everyone else’ and put kids in danger by not vaccinating </p>
<p>The ridiculous part, is as I’m researching for this post, I can’t even find the original articles I found before. Anyway, here’s one for California </p>
<p>https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/education/are-anti-vaxxers-more-affluent-than-the-pro-immunization-cohort-13030287</p>
<p>Why is it that more affluent people are anti vaccine? Are they privy to things the rest of us aren’t? </p>
<p>Let’s look at how research is done. </p>
<p>Peer reviewed research is the gold standard of research but the reality of it is, a study isn’t being done or reviewed unless it’s funded. </p>
<p>Who funds research you ask? </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies. They have the pockets and the money to fund it. This leads to a massive bias in the scientific community. </p>
<p>In terms of medical interventions, it’s pretty obvious to see there is way more investment and interest in a medical intervention where there is an outcome of profit (medications/vaccinations) than an intervention that is manual or a result of lifestyle changes (individual therapies such as chiro, osteo, exercise, nutritional advice, etc) </p>
<p>It’s nearly impossible to show non-invasive intervention is as effective as a pharmaceutical when you are comparing a massive study that is funded by a major corporation to anecdotal accounts of clients.</p>
<p>And I GET THAT.</p>
<p>The problem is, there is no option open to explore the outcomes of natural interventions or manual interventions because it will never be considered in the same league as the pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>It pains me that the past ten years there has been a massive smearing campaign against natural practitioners, culminating in this mess - yes there are bad chiropractors/naturos/osteos out there- just like there are bad doctors. </p>
<p>The difference is, a manual or lifestyle change suggested by a practitioner only benefits the client and practitioner.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical interventions involve long term investment into the company and will consistently address symptoms with no regard for actually healing the fundamental cause.</p>
<p>The long and short of all this is, 9 times out of 10, the ones that are smeared on MSM as being ignorant to science typically want to help you the most- by balancing and finding homeostasis within your own body. And it doesn’t involve massive amounts of untested chemicals injected en masse. </p>
<p>Be open and trust your body and your immunity. The government has no business controlling that or even hinting that it does. </p>

        <p>If a cheap, natural solution was proven to cure a disease, then Big Pharma couldn’t make any money on the expensive drugs they produce for people to be able to barely live with that disease.  Their whole business model evaporates.  So the natural cures must be ridiculed, suppressed, banned, prosecuted, and shunned.</p>

        <p>Vaccines are proven treatment.</p>
<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>That does notnmean that everything marketed as a vaccine is therefore safe.</p>
<p>There did not used to be a taboo about double checking the numbers you are given by scientists. That type of anti-intellectualism really only goes back to the 80s or so when they needed Global Warming to be the imminent crisis.</p>

        <p>when you look in to it, you will find that 'vaccines' have been 'controversial' since their inception nearly 200 years ago</p>
<p>the 'anti-vaxxers' won the first battle in the mid/late 1800s, as 'vaccines' are no longer allowed to be called 'inoculations'</p>

        <p>I totally agree and I am not anti vaccine at all, what I don’t agree with is accepting vaccines as a cure all for everything especially when there are significant risks associated with them. </p>
<p>I also don’t think they should be forced or required without any recourse for adverse reactions.</p>
<p>I also believe we do have an innate ability to heal ourselves without external intervention- to a point. </p>
<p>We need western medicine- there are situations that are beyond the ability of natural healing. </p>
<p>What we don’t need, is excessive over prescription of medications to perfectly healthy individuals under the fear of mortality</p>

        <p>I’ve been relying on home remedies, vitamins and chiropractic for my family’s minor health complaints. None of my kids have had serious ear infections. We rarely needed to see the pediatrician for illness. Of course,  that option was there if the problem progressed. The only emergency care we have needed was for broken bones from kids being kids - landing funny from jumping off the bunk bed and cracked a bone in the foot.</p>
