    <strong>We live on two acres in an isolated canyon. Invited my parents to bring their travel trailer and stay with us if things get really bad in California. They expect us to also welcome my sibling and their spouse, even though they voted in favor of the lockdowns.</strong>
    <p><p>My parents are fully on board and aware of the manipulation and takeover attempt that’s going down. Tonight we were discussing it on the phone, and I told them they’re welcome to come stay with us if things got bad enough, and told them we had also invited our two very dear friends and their sons to stay with us as well.
My mom kind of paused, and then said “you wouldn’t invite your actual family first?”, referring to my two brothers and their wives. I told her point blank “Nope. They voted in favor of and support what’s going down. They can get a hotel in town.”</p>
<p>My mom kept insisting that that was only out of just ignorance, and that they’re still family and we should take them in too.
I’m sorry, but no. 
Which <em>is</em> painful, I do love my brothers, we were best friends growing up and do still chat and get along well, but I’ve lost all respect for them. They support the lockdowns, masks, voted for Biden, and my sister-in-law in particular called anti-maskers selfish conspiracy theorists. You reap what you sow.</p></p>

        <p>I understand you but am simultaneously sad politics and this coivd BS has torn up so many families. Im in the same boat btw, my once devoutly religious and conservative parents started mindlessly repeating how racism is a problem (in a country with no blacks...lol) and reporting businesses which dont support masks because it "upsets them". My mom thinks trump needs to be dead. I mean, i dont hate them, im just sad they dont see it.</p>

        <p>I also have a travel trailer and am looking for new digs... but seriously, the brothers need to call you and ask you directly. And if it doesn't work out you can ask them to leave after awhile; and dang that would be tough families are tough, right? My brother pulled his trailer out of storage so I could leave my state and come live near him but we mostly align politically so it's been smooth. Not sure if any of this is helpful. Happy trails, to you.</p>

        <p>I agree with this stance. I have systematically removed any pro-lockdown people from my life so that nowadays I am surrounded only by people I know I can trust. If the shit really does hit the fan I don't want someone who will stab me in the back near me.</p>

        <p>It's not just covid - the world has been heading towards increased polarization every year.  I've seen so many posts lately on FB saying "either agree with me on ____, or unfriend me".  It's sad.</p>
<p>For me it's about listening and respect.  For many with a pro-lockdown view it's like a religion and they're a fanatic.  There's no listening, constant invalidating of my research through nitpicking of small details instead of addressing main points, ad-hominem dismissals of good sources, and a general disrespect.  It's that lack of respect that I can't be around.  On the other hand, I had a pro-lockdown friend who did listen and his motivation for being pro-lockdown is that it would be too stressful to distrust the government and think this is all wrong.  He just had his second baby and has other stressors too.  That I understood and had compassion for.  He was surprised and listened to me telling him about the Great Barrington Declaration and its signers, that skepticism is not a crackpot view.</p>
<p>So I don't support further polarization, but I do need to separate from gaslighting tactics.</p>
