        <p>I like it! I‚Äôm saving it.</p>
<p>They ban people on r/Covidvaccinated just for having a history of ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù
(I can‚Äôt tell you how much I hate that word)</p>
<p>I even posted something really nice.
Someone said how grateful she was for getting the vaccine and I replied: it must feel like heaven. </p>
<p>That it, that one simple sentence and I am permanently banned. </p>
<p>The fact they made a sub just to talk about how much they love the vaccine really makes my head spin.</p>

        <p>It's a common practice: they set up a bot that scours your posting history to see if you have ever posted in a wrongthink sub, and autoban you as soon as you try to post in their ~~echo chamber~~ "safe space."</p>
<p>Others are more subtle: they use a mass-tagger to label you, and effectively shadowban you if you post by ignoring anything you have to say.</p>

        <p>I was instabanned as well. I literally posted a comment and i refreshed my page not even a minute later to see I was banned so they must have a bot that checks where you post that just instabans you if you post from subreddits like this? It can't be a human moderator checking people's history that fast, can it?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it is very misleading. Here‚Äôs the study: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. </p>
<p>&rt;Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). </p>
<p>&rt;Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>
<p>Basically, more research needs to be done.</p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

        <p>Here's my stuff. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That‚Äôs an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 (COVID‚Äê19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7‚Äâdays. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‚Äêsymptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p>And</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>

        <p>Here's another good one.</p>
<h2>Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<h1>1. Create Faulty ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù PCR Test</h1>
<p>&rt;‚Äùwithout having virus material available‚Äù ^1  </p>
<p>&rt;‚Äúrelying instead on the Chinese scientists‚Äô genetic sequence published on the internet‚Äù ^2</p>
<h1>2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?</h1>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>&rt;‚Äú...the <strong>probability</strong> that said result is a <strong>false positive is 97%‚Äù</strong> ^1, ^2, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^31, ^32, ^39, ^40, ^44, ^45</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIt is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,‚Äù Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.‚Äù</strong> ^27</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>BBC: ‚ÄúMajority testing positive have no symptoms‚Äù</strong> ^28, ^29, ^30, ^31</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùNFL has 77 apparently false positive</strong> coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab‚Äù ^41</p>
<h1>3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis</h1>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùThey get <strong>more money</strong> if those <strong>patients</strong> are then <strong>put on ventilators.‚Äù</strong> ^3, ^4, ^5</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùOnce again the old adage ‚Äî <strong>follow the money</strong> ‚Äî and we saw that <strong>if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission</strong> payment through the CARES Act.‚Äù ^49</p>
<p>&rt;He added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any questions that <strong>perverse incentives have been created.‚Äù</strong>
&rt;-Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<h1>4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to ‚Äúcross-reactivity‚Äù with other coronaviruses...</h1>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. ^15, ^16, ^17,  ^18, ^47</p>
<p>&rt;‚Äù...<strong>all¬†10¬†of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.‚Äù</strong> ^46</p>
<h1>5. Cook the Books</h1>
<p>&rt;‚Äù...<strong>classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.‚Äù</strong> ^19, ^20, ^21, ^36, ^37, ^38</p>
<p><strong>Count Death by:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motorcycle accident ^22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident ^23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladder falls ^24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicides and murders ^25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gunshots?</h2>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùThese two people had tested positive for COVID, but that‚Äôs not what killed them. <strong>The gunshot wound killed them and it‚Äôs very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID</strong> when that‚Äôs not what they died from,‚Äù said Coroner Brenda Bock.‚Äù ^43</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùTennessee <strong>woman who died in February gets letter saying she‚Äôs positive for COVID-19‚Äù</strong> ^26</p>
<h2>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúIf [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But <strong>a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn‚Äôt give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,‚Äù Briand replied.‚Äù</strong> ^33 ^34 ^35</p>

        <p>I posted this yesterday in case you (or anyone) wants to refer to it:</p>
<p>For asymptomatic spread: JAMA - The Journal of the American Medical Association is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 48 times a year by the American Medical Association - published a study on December 14, 2020 in which is a meta-analysis of 54 studies with 77,758 participants. The study determined that even if you are living in a house with someone who is covid positive but asymptomatic (e.g. a spouse you are sharing a bed with) <strong>"the asymptomatic/presymptomatic secondary attack rate is not statistically different from zero, and the confidence interval is technically 0.7 ¬± 4.2, resulting in a range of -3.5%-4.9%, but attack rates cannot be negative, so it is truncated at 0.</strong> So they can‚Äôt say below 0 as your chances in a study but your chances of contracting it are effectively zero in this scenario. This is someone you live with and share a bed with. </p>
<p>So if it's zero chances you're going to get it from someone you live with... what do you think the odds are for walking by an asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic person at a grocery store or OUTSIDE are?  <strong>Source study:</strong> https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102</p>
<p>The best science prior to mid 2020 indicated that cloth and surgical masks had little effect in reducing transmission because they are not effective enough and people don‚Äôt use them properly anyways. Then all of a sudden, mask lobbyists (like Masks4All) demanded the mandates be put in place so politicians yielded. It had nothing to do with science and everything to do with lobbying. </p>
<p>The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 mask policy update was due not to new evidence but ‚Äúpolitical lobbying‚Äù: <strong>‚ÄúWe had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.‚Äù </strong> (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent). Source for quote:
https://twitter.com/deb_cohen/status/1282244773030633473</p>
<p>Studies on the effectiveness of face masks: So far, most studies found little to no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks in the general population, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn‚Äôt reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that ‚Äúthe evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks‚Äù, but supports the use of masks by ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.‚Äù https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some recent studies argued that cloth face masks are indeed effective against the new coronavirus and could at least prevent the infection of other people. However, most of these studies suffer from poor methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim. Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other measures, the natural development of infection numbers, changes in test activity, or they compare countries with very different conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A meta-study in the journal Lancet, commissioned by the WHO, claimed that masks ‚Äúcould‚Äù lead to a reduction in the risk of infection, but the studies considered mainly N95 respirators in a hospital setting, not cloth masks in a community setting, the strength of the evidence was reported as ‚Äúlow‚Äù, and experts found numerous flaws in the study. Professor Peter Jueni, epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, called the WHO study ‚Äúessentially useless‚Äù. https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A study in the journal PNAS claimed that masks had led to a decrease in infections in three global hotspots (including New York City), but the study did not take into account the natural decrease in infections and other simultaneous measures. The study was so flawed that over 40 scientists recommended that the study be withdrawn. https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A US study claimed that US counties with mask mandates had lower Covid infection and hospitalization rates, but the authors had to withdraw their study as infections and hospitalizations increased in many of these counties shortly after the study was published. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wearing masks for a prolonged period of time is not harmless, as the following evidence shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WHO warns of various ‚Äúside effects‚Äù such as difficulty breathing and skin rashes. https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tests conducted by the University Hospital of Leipzig in Germany have shown that face masks significantly reduce the resilience and performance of healthy adults. https://science.orf.at/stories/3201213/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A German psychological study with about 1000 participants found ‚Äúsevere psychosocial consequences‚Äù due to the introduction of mandatory face masks in Germany. https://corona-transition.org/der-maskenzwang-ist-verantwortlich-fur-schwere-psychische-schaden-und-die</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hamburg Environmental Institute warned of the inhalation of chlorine compounds in polyester masks as well as problems in connection with face mask disposal.https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The European rapid alert system RAPEX has already recalled 70 mask models because they did not meet EU quality standards and could lead to ‚Äúserious risks‚Äù. https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Germany, two 13-year-old children died suddenly while wearing a mask for a prolonged period of time; autopsies couldn‚Äôt exclude CO2 intoxication or a sudden cardiac arrest.  https://corona-transition.org/13-jahrige-maskentragerin-stirbt  https://corona-transition.org/zweites-kind-moglicherweise-durch-maskentragen-gestorben  https://www.thoughtco.com/carbon-dioxide-poisoning-608396</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In China, several children who had to wear a mask during sports classes fainted and died; the autopsies found a sudden cardiac arrest as the probable cause of death. https://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/31100/student-deaths-lead-schools-to-adjust-rules-on-masks-while-exercising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the US, a car driver wearing an N95 (FFP2) mask fainted and crashed into a pole.https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no country in the world that has mandated mask usage that has been shown to reduce spread as covid still spreads and is increasing globally despite mandatory indoor/outdoors mask mandates and high compliance levels, including now Japan: https://rationalground.com/post-thanksgiving-mask-charts-still-no-evidence-that-masks-work/ </p>
<p>Peru who has had mandatory indoor/outdoor mask mandates since March AND strict military enforced lockdowns is 10th in the world for highest deaths per million and has a higher death per million rate than the US who many have criticized for their lax approach: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/</p>
<p><strong>An analysis by the US CDC found that 85% of people infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask ‚Äúalways‚Äù (70.6%) or ‚Äúoften‚Äù (14.4%). Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4</p>
<p>Conclusion: At best: they‚Äôre pointless; at worst: they‚Äôre harmful</p>

        <p>I got banned from r/canada for saying government is authoritarian.</p>
<p>The dictionary definition of authoritarianism is : ‚Äúthe enforcement or advocacy of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom.‚Äù</p>
<p>If a curfew at 8PM enforced by police and fining citizens 1500$ for no apparent reason is not exactly that then I don‚Äôt know what it is. </p>
<p>So apparently now you can get banned for using a word in its exact dictionary definition context... 2021 is a very fun time to be around</p>

        <p>Isn't the point of the mask to stop viral particles from being transmitted out of the mask, not to protect the wearer from others? I know most people don't think that way, and it's accurate that the mask won't protect you because of eyes and such, but I thought the evidence was pretty clear that masks limit the outward spread of particles from the wearer. That's why surgeons and such always wear them, to protect the patient from anything that might be in their body.</p>
<p>Not trying to rock the boat here, I just found this sub and think the lockdowns are stupid, especially here in Ontario where the politicians are just spreading infinite fear and bylaw is fining families for going sledding. I just think the perspective on masks needs to be flipped in a sense, as protecting yourself was never the idea.</p>

        <p>Loosely fitted cloth masks only catch large droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus isn't spreading because people are going around coughing and sneezing in each others' faces. It's spreading via aerosols that hang in the air for a long time, which these masks do very little to stop. In fact, they might be making things worse by catching large droplets and re-aerosolizing them with every breath.</p>
