        <p>To be fair it’s a really small sample size since it hasn’t spread much in Canada and it would probably be more accurate to look at something like the US data, but even in the US the risk of dying under 50 is very very low.</p>

        <p>Absolutely but I think it's more about the way the information is presented in that they're not just listing cases and a total death count without context. I wish more countries would be more transparent about this info like this person did - you never see this sort of thing presented like this in the media.</p>

        <p>I agree. For example you could have a virus that kills 100% of group A and 0% of group B. Let’s say we have 10 group A and 10 group B. The virus now kills 50% of people on average, even though one group is completely unaffected.</p>
<p>Obviously this situation isn’t nearly the same as Covid, but the point is that it doesn’t make sense to compare Covid deaths without context</p>

        <p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong on my interpretation of this but:</p>
<p>The death rate posted here looks like it's the CFR or Case Fatality Rate. From <a href="https://www.virology.ws/2020/04/05/infection-fatality-rate-a-critical-missing-piece-for-managing-covid-19/">this source</a> </p>
<p>"CFR is the ratio of the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed (preferably by nucleic acid testing) cases of disease.  IFR is the ratio of deaths divided by the number of actual infections with SARS-CoV-2.”</p>
<p>CFR (the "Death Rate" posted here) is based on the cases we've identified.</p>
<p>IFR is the more honest number to go by because it means "out of this many infections, this many people died”.We probably won’t know the IFR unless we test absolutely everyone in a population sadly. </p>
<p>But we know there are more than likely many cases out there that we missed because the person didn’t get a test - so the real “Death Rate” percentage would be lower than what is posted here. </p>
<p>The Mortality Rate they’ve posted here is using the entire population divided by the amount of people who have died from covid - but it’s not a totally relevant statistic because that number would only be accurate if everyone in Canada had gotten covid which is probably not the case. </p>
<p>Does that make sense? I seem to be terrible at explaining this.</p>

        <p>So CFR is an over estimation while an IFR is an under estimation and IFR is the more accurate of the two(atleast in this pandemic)?</p>

        <p>IFR in theory would be 100% accurate, but we would need to test an entire population to find out what that is. </p>
<p>The CFR is higher than what the IFR would be.</p>
<p>Long answer short - it's less deadly than what is posted.</p>

        <p>I don't think the "Death Rate" posted here is IFR, it's CFR because the person who made this divided deaths by known cases. We wouldn't know the IFR unless we tested everyone in Canada. So if you share it, you can tell people the "Death Rate" percentages are actually lower than what is posted here but we won't have all the data to say by exactly how much.</p>

        <p>I think this is manipulative as well. Transparent as in it shows your obviously trying to show how low risk covid is to make people feel a false sense of security. Like "the numbers are so low and you couldn't be so unlucky to catch it". Or depending on what type of crazy the person speaking subscribes to you could add "plus, your (choose one: Republican, Christian, skinny, straight, white, smart, uses essential oils)!"  </p>
<p>If there is a chance my kid can die from this NEW virus I sure as hell not taking that chance so I can go to a BBQ with my friends. The rates may be low but they aren't 0.00%. Even adding in the "if you catch it your likely to have little to no symptoms!" Argument my point still stands. There is still a chance that my kid could be that 1. We also don't know what covid does long term even if you don't have symptoms. They are just now studying this, it could change your body in ways you can't even know about yet. Look at MIS-C! Wtf is that about? You can literally get something 4-6 weeks after recovering from COVID that can kill you and it is only for people who have had COVID.  </p>
<p>I'm just happy I have options and that I can keep my family safe, but jeez don't push others off the cliff with you by trying to show information in a way that favors your argument and hides the reality which is a bunch of "long term effects: unknown" "short term effects: unknown" "full recovery potential: unknown" "chance of mutation: unknown" "covid's effect on x age group: unpredictable" "covid's effect on children: unpredictable" "vaccine availablity: to be determined" "long term effects of a potential vaccine: unknown". Y'all can be test tubes for this, I'm staying out till we actually know anything beyond guesses and grasping at straws.</p>

        <p>The data is data that favors their opinion. As I said in my comment that there is no data showing the risks of getting COVID or the long term effects or transmission over time or increased risk studies of masked vs maskless. It's data to underwhelm the risk of covid and it's very obvious that that is the focus and that that is the opinion of OP. My main issue is that it is dishonest to claim op OP is being so "transparent" when they are not at all being transparent. In fact as you stated yourself their opinion isn't even here, so not transparent at all and just hoping no one noticed the one sides data.</p>

        <p>Then provide the data on the long term effects of covid. The only data I see is data that highlights the chance of people getting COVID. Nowhere does it show what happens when they get COVID or the unknown risks of getting COVID. Nowhere do see MIS-C mentioned. Nowhere do I see the risks associated with a rushed vaccine of this kind or the risks that come with taking an untested vaccine if it were released untested (hopefully that does not happen). There is no data here that would cause any fright, and that is the point of this data. It is not transparent towards our situation, it is transparent towards excusing those who are looking for something to excuse their entitlement so they can enjoy a BBQ with 30 of their friends or family.</p>

        <p>That is exactly my point. That is a major factor when it comes to risk assessment with COVID. By only showing the data about the numbers being low you're hiding the overall risk that comes with covid. You're basically saying 'look the numbers are so low so there's no need to change anything in your life it's totally fine you can do what you want Don't fall for the fear!" But in reality it's more like "look the numbers are so low but we still don't know so much about this. So don't live in fear but be cautious"</p>

        <p>I just think this sort of information is under-reported. And what I hear from people who are living in absolute terror are definitely misinterpretations of the facts thanks to the sensational nature of the news and “click-bait” titles on social media.</p>
<p>It honestly sounds like you might be afflicted by this fear too. I understand why that is, but I don't think you're coming from a grounded and logical place. </p>
<p>You don't want to take your kid to the barbecue on the very off chance that they might catch it and be one of the extremely rare cases that not only gets sick from it, but also gets hospitalized from it and even more extremely rare in that age category: dies from it. </p>
<p>But did you know that last year when you sent your kid to school without a mask, social distancing and constant hand-sanitizer usage - they were actually more at risk then of dying from the seasonal flu than of covid now? </p>
<p>That is what this sort of information can tell us. So we can make better informed decisions about public policies without allowing ourselves to come to a complete societal collapse.</p>
<p>Listen, in the past, you may have driven your kid to soccer or ballet practice or grandmas... and the odds of your kid dying in a car crash on the way there were way higher than of them dying of covid. </p>
<p>But you did it anyways, because at some point, we know that life is risk. And we're willing to take some risks for the enjoyment of life. Sure, cautious risks: you have to pass a driving test to even get behind the wheel, we put on seatbelts and have airbags, your car requires good maintenance... but we do it.. and we can trust ourselves and eachother to do that as well. Yes, someone may be reckless and drive drunk and you hit you - but we don’t often go out in life envisioning the worst case scenario - we just hope for the best and most of the time, we’re right to.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the fears people have come from misinterpreting data rather than the data pointing to things that should terrify them in this manner. </p>
<p>We actually do already have a lot of data on the disease as of now, it's not as mysterious to us as it was in March. We are 9 months into the virus spreading globally and many scientists worldwide are studying the effects daily. </p>
<p>It might be time to step out of March and into mid September. Perhaps your fears are trauma based, and that’s fair enough and I sincerely empathize… but I don’t think your fears are doing you any favours right now.</p>
<p>This isn’t about political agendas and conspiracy theories - it’s just about rational, solid facts - that’s all. Don’t let that upset you this much.</p>

        <p>You are comparing cars and the flu to covid, but that isn't accurate. We know the long term effects of those and we have many ways of prevention and it is a norm in society. Covid is not any of those things. It Is not studied, long term effects are unknown. This touches on more than respiratory, it reaches your heart, your brain even! It's a giant unknown and to act like it is just like other risks we take is very naive.  </p>
<p>Please do not jump to conclusions about me, saying I am not "logical or grounded" is just a put down that shows you have no respect for a differing opinion and view yourself as absolute in your knowledge. I am not falling for "click bait" or being fear mongered. I know the news is very scary and politically motivated right now and I have chosen not to be part of that culture and so I seek information through the newest published studies as well as observing changing mandates and my local area's way of handling the pandemic while also taking into account how the world is fairing in a general sense with this by observing how they are reacting and looking at their numbers.  </p>
<p>The data we have is not sufficient, I am glad we have what we have but it is still a large unknown. Nowhere are there studies of the long term effects and nowhere is there any knowledge on anything beyond treating the symptoms. They can't even predict what covid will do to someone. Some get hit hard yet are 100% healthy and young and others are are symptomatic and are older and have multiple health issues. Even outside of that there are some who go into heart failure while others have had brain damage, despite the thinking that covid is largely a respiratory virus. 9 months of studying something like this is insufficient and has provided us with little in the way of knowing what we are dealing with. If we did have enough we would have more than a vaccine by now. Treatment protocols would be much more advanced.  </p>
<p>I feel the only people being irrational are the ones who won't see the facts and choose to live with as little inconvenience as possible. I have adapted to the "new normal" without being part of the problem. Entitlement is not helping anyone, and is a large part of why America is suffering the most.  </p>
<p>You are only looking at the favorable data, and you are highlighting that in a post about being "transparent". That is my main issue here. If you are being transparent you should be adding that we do not know the long term effects and also add studies of mask vs maskless transmission rates or even touch on how the studies can vary depending on the data or the methods used in the study. I am all for gaining knowledge and I welcome learning more from this. I just don't accept manipulation, especially when it is being advertised as "transparency".</p>

        <p>MIS-C is rare. Only one person under 20 died of COVID-19 and it was a 19 year old and I didn't hear if he had MIS-C or not. Don't you think at the 6 month mark that we would have seen more people (not media) speaking out about long term effects and MIS-C by now if it was widespread?</p>

It is rare yes, but just like covid it is unstudied and not understood. It is new. Anything new should be looked at with caution, respect, and an interest to learn.  </p>
<p>Low numbers do not equal zero. They also do not mean that the survivors are out of the woods. No one knows the long term effects of this. Just look at history. The amount of things that were messed with before they were understood and the number of people who died as a result. We used to handle Mercury with our hands! Heck look at what happened to the Radium girls! We are supposed to learn from our past, or be doomed to repeat it. I never thought I'd say it but my history teacher was right.</p>

        <p>Low numbers do not equal zero but you can evaluate your personal risk and act accordingly. There are many more risks of death in life under age 60 that are just as fatal or more fatal than covid.</p>
<p>It's true that this is a novel virus but I really think we would have seen much greater hospitalisation numbers if long term effects were widespread. Hospitals were emptier than usual.</p>

        <p>So you admit it is an issue, and I do think that reacting to it with just fear is bad but like with any issue there needs to be a solution. Lockdown wasn't planned by a bunch of people consumed by fear and nothing else. It was planned by people knowledgeable in the area who know much more than the common Joe on this type of thing. People's responses to it as well as to covered in general have included fear but that does not dismiss that lockdown's intention is to be a solution to covid. The biggest issue is finding a solution that factors in the entitled people. Without full lockdown never stood a chance.</p>
