        <p>As someone who has family that lives in Sweden. They have handled the plandemic in the most common sense way possible.</p>
<p>Also their Constitution goes against most measures that alot of western countries had adopted. So they let people choose their own risk.</p>
<p>I do however believe that they will submit to the EU green pass without much of a fight.</p>

        <p>As a Swede I think I can come with some more insight. Sweden has a social climate where people place significant trust in the government and society, and there’s a great sense of social responsibility. The government didn’t put very heavy restrictions in place initially for two reasons. The first and main reason is that no one thought it would be needed. Information campaigns were put in place to minimize interpersonal contact, people were told to work from home wherever possible. We were all told “there’s a pandemic now, be responsible and minimize contact”. The second reason was that the constitution didn’t let the government do that, which has resulted in a new pandemic law which can let the government bypass the constitution in that specific area in the specific case of a pandemic. There were restrictions put in place later on after the first wave regarding maximum sizes of public gatherings and so forth, and many places asked you to use a mask. The key aspect of the perceived lax response was that social climate of trust in government. The government didn’t need to force anyone, it merely asked and everyone did their part. Slowing it down as much as possible until a vaccine was available, which essentially everyone is getting as soon as a time is available.</p>

        <p>I live there. All I can tell you this pandemic was created on purpose for a global great reset and there is no way sweden could go through the pandemic without masks or any real lockdowns. </p>
<p>I go out everyday since the pandemic started, NOBODY followed any real recommendations, life was 90% normal in sweden. Gyms, supermarkets, shopping malls, public transport looked normal. From the beginning until december 2020 I could count 1 person with mask out of 100. During the summer 2020 everything was open, I could see the news around the world and I was shocked to see life in sweden carried on as if they were protected by some kind of hand.</p>
<p>The only moment I saw some attempt to do something was during January-February 2021 but that was it. It lasted 2 months, during that time I saw maybe a few people wearing mask but most of the time nobody cared much. I took the public transport during rush hour and to my shock I could only count 2 maybe 5 people with masks on a full bus. Many times not even that, it was nobody cared about it.</p>
<p>Now, see the  situation around the world since everything started, people getting arrested for leaving their apartments during lockdowns, people getting attacked for not wearing masks, mass media 24/7 with fear mongering about the virus and how those who didn't wear mask were treated almost like criminals.</p>
<p>If this pandemic was created on purpose for a great reset, if presidents from African and south American countries have been assassinated for resisting the globalists. Do you really think, that a country like sweden could go on like this without any real restriction and living like if the pandemic wasn't affecting them?. NO WAY!!:</p>
<p>Just see the situation around the wold. See the latest news on covid passports to even enter a restaurant. Do you really think the globalists behind this would let sweden live normally unless it was sweden the country behind this great reset?. THINK!!!.</p>
<p>Watch this video below, this is shopping mall in stockholm. Tell me where you see swedes following any real covid rules?. They aren't, they enjoy normal life. It's been like that since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4b5w9zXUymA">https://youtu.be/4b5w9zXUymA</a></p>
<p>The comments you read below from swedes saying that they trust government and in sweden they prefer individual responsibility come from the collective society they live. In the real world, in the world I lived since March 2020 in sweden, nobody gave a F here in sweden.</p>
<p>And that's something the world needs to know, because things are about to get worse, much worse and sweden will not be affected by it.</p>
<p>Sweden is the extension of davos and the world economic forum and they work so close that even sweden appeared in the article "I own nothing, have no privacy...". With a massive image of a swedish city at the top of the article.</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20161125135500/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/shopping-i-can-t-really-remember-what-that-is/</p>
<p>Sweden is globalism, sweden is eugenics. But their collective society works as one entity so do not expect people who will come to this sub to tell you the truth about what sweden is all about. </p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/6m53suI</p>
<p>https://blogfactory.co.uk/2020/04/21/greta-thunbergs-great-grandfather-turns-out-to-be-the-inventor-of-the-greenhouse-effect-and-population-reduction-through-eugenics/</p>
<p>Soon we will be treated like criminals for not getting the vaccine, which by the way I don't believe 70% of swedes have been vaccinated, because I don't see so many around me who admit they took it. So be very careful with sweden, this is an organized sect and their own people are instructed to lie so nobody outside sweden knows the real situation the real NORMALITY in sweden.</p>

        <p>He is a conspiracy nut that I tangled with on occasion during this pandemic. He appears to be from Spain and is fixated on Greta Thunberg and the New World Order. He has always claimed nobody cared about restrictions in Sweden despite evidence and the fact that business cannot ignore them if they want to continue operating.</p>

        <p>Don't trust this guy, look at his profile. I'm not even sure if he lives in Sweden because as someone that is living here, we have had restrictions for amount of people in shops, gyms, no dance clubs, restricted sitting in bars and restaurants, early closing of bars, social distancing recommendations and masks in public transport recommendations. </p>
<p>Sweden didn't go as hard with the restrictions because FMH (almost like America's CDC) isn't only about desease control but also overall health and wellbeing of the population and they wanted to implement a more sustainable method of keeping numbers low because Sweden had a large caseload early on in pandemic from our holidays lining up with the early outbreak in Switzerland and Italy making it near impossible to stomp out the virus early and so was prepared to keep the restrictions until the vaccine is out. </p>
<p>The thing about the vaccine is also rubbish since I got my first dose (I'm in the lowest risk group), rest of the family is fully vaccinated and half of my friends are fully vaccinated and the another third on there first dose, it might be because people are expected to get the vaccine so it's not really a talking point.</p>

        <p>I don't think they handled it in the most common sense way possible, but compared to the madness that happened elsewhere, they handled it well.</p>
<p>They still implemented some nonsensical measures and allowed a mild amount of hysteria to take over the country. The most common sense way possible would have been to do absolutely nothing other than possibly issue some guidance that a nasty cold bug was going around.</p>

        <p>Use Google Translate or whatever. "Påbörjat vaccinering" = started vaccination (received at least one dose). "Färdigvaccinerad" = fully vaccinated (two doses).</p>

        <p>Who knows really, we had the same pattern last summer too. My personal guess is a combination of Swedish people maximizing time outdoors during the summer (minimal spread outdoors and vitamin d overload), and no forced testing within the country that drives up "cases".</p>

        <p>So in other words, huddling indoors is bad, which seems to solidify that lockdowns are bad.</p>

        <p>Several possible reasons, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seasonality of the virus</li>
<li>Schools and universities are closed for 10 weeks of summer vacation in June - August.</li>
<li>Most people take ~4 weeks of paid leave in summer, often going to summer houses on the country side</li>
<li>Enough immunity (from both natural infection and vaccines)</li>
<li>... and other known or unknown factors</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that it was basically the same last year. The virus basically died out in summer, and then another wave hit hard during fall (without major differences in restrictions). Another wave this fall is not unlikely, but I doubt it will be as severe as previous waves in terms of deaths and hospitalisations.</p>

        <p>But the deaths were almost none even when few were vaccinated, besides if 1/4th of the population is still unvaccinated then the deaths shouldnt be cut completely if it was so deadly. </p>
<p>They knew most would do as their told here in Sweden because thats just the general weak minded authority loving swede bending over as usual, so there was no need to lockdown, we got herd immunity and then vaccines get rolled out and the vaccines are praised for being the saviour when we most definitely would have very low deathrate without it thanks to not having lockdowns.</p>
