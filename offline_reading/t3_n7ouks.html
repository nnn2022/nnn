    <strong>Can’t afford to get the COVID vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I haven’t seen anyone else talk about this.  My deductible is $6k (ACA) and let’s just say that the last year has ~~decimated~~ put a crimp in my finances.  I don’t really leave my home much so I can’t get COVID or spread it to anyone.  I was planning on getting the vaccine once I became eligible, but if I get the vaccine, and suffer an adverse effect, I am on the hook for any medical bills. I suspect there are a lot of people like me who they are calling “vaccine hesitant” but really we are just cash poor.  Why doesn‘t the government cover the vaccine bad reactions?  They cover COVID treatments so why not vaccine reactions?  They could get a lot more people vaccinated if they did that.    </p>
<p>Also,  I don’t necessarily agree with all of you here but I found you all by trying to find other people who are not getting vaccinated and I dont like the shaming and derision on a lot of the pro-vax subs.  It’s very abusive.</p></p>

<p>If the government was to start paying for adverse reactions to the vaccine, that would cut into their profits from keeping the panic going.</p>

        <p>The government will cover expenses related to getting the vaccine. But it's impossible to prove, so in reality, you're on your own. Now aren't you glad you have "Affordable" care?</p>

        <p>I think you're right, but if they offered that they'd have to admit that vaccine adverse reactions exist in more than just that "very rare one in a million" that they always quote.</p>

        <p>Good point. The only logical reason they wouldn’t offer to cover the adverse reactions is because they know it’s more prevalent than they let on.</p>

        <p>High deductible plans are the absolute worst, but your chances of an adverse reaction are very low.  In many parts of the US your chances of COVID are also diminishing.  Life is inherently risky, so you’ll need to decide if you’d rather risk the vaccine or COVID.</p>
