    <strong>The full leaked "Canadian Plan" for 2021. I fucking hope this is fake or else these people are the absolute scum of the earth!!!</strong>
    <p><p>NOTE: This probably is fake (and i hope to high heavens that it is), but this past year has constantly blown me away with events that I never thought could happen, so I'm not taking any chances anymore. I've constantly made the mistake of saying "pffft that won't happen that sounds too ridiculous"... until it does eventually. So fuck that shit.</p>
<hr>
<p>Text version of leaked message from a Canadian Liberal Party member detailing a meeting steered by the PMO, dated Oct 10 2020.</p>
<p>"I want to provide you with some very important information, I'm a committee member in the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups, but the information I am providing is originating from the strategic planning committee which is steered by the PMO.</p>
<p>"I need to start off by saying I'm not happy doing this but I have to, as a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals.They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes."</p>
<p>The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phase in secondary lockdown restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily new cases of covid-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions), expected by end of December 2020 - early January 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program expected by Quarter 1 2021</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection, expected by February 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical facility capacity expected by Q1-Q2 of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced lockdown restrictions (referred to as Third Lockdown) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed, including inter-province and inter-city, expected by Quarter 2 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program, expected mid Q2 2021</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortage, large economic instability, all expected late Q2 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area, expected by Q3 2021.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with that provided road map, the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet an unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we are told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on an international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works. The federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (all mortgages, all loans, all credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.</p>
<p>In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness, the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which will provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lockdown through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada's HealthPass).</p>
<p>Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions. We were simply told "the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details". Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we come up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.</p>
<p>When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer, we were told that those who refused would first live under the lockdown restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more and more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refuse to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all your assets seized.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, after hearing all of this, it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I've ever witnessed before. In the end, it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it won't just be Canada, but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone.</p>

        <p>I mean, how farfetched is it really? If this email is any form of true, it makes complete sense with how the Canadian and US governments are acting. The collateral for paying off the countries debt would be true ownership of the people. </p>
<p>The idea being we're being sold out by our governments. </p>
<p>No clue whether the email is real or not, but it seems completely possible.</p>
