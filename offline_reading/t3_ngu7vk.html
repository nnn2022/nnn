    <strong>Pressuring and persecuting people who don’t want to get vaccinated must be stopped!</strong>
    <p><p>30y old F here. I personally used to be SUPER pro-vaccine, I even decided to vaccinate myself as well but the more I started to dig deeper and think with my own brain instead of what news and media try to make me think, the less I want to vaccinate myself against COVID.</p>
<p>Few of my relatives have died as well but it’s already told like million times that people don’t die of COVID. 99,7% of people survive COVID if they had no other health issues. People who have some underlying health issues die once they get covid. And most of them are risk group people. That’s why it mostly kills elders and not young people.</p>
<p>It’s unbelievable they pressure kids and young people with 0 health issues to vaccinate themselves with vaccines that are not even proven to be safe. Ps, vaccination DOESN’T prevent you from carrying it.</p>
<p>It’s pretty lame to criticize people who don’t want to run to vaccinate themselves without calculating it first especially cause we don’t even know what these vaccines will do to our bodies over years.</p>
<p>If you look at how people are being pressured and even offered free stuff to vaccinate it is suspicious and looks desperate.</p>
<p>I believe that vaccines are human right and everyone  should be able to decide whether they want to have one or not WITHOUT being criticized or labeled. That “us versus them” kind of mindset is getting worse and worse. People who have chosen to not get vaccinated are being labeled to be dangerous and against the society and it’s sickening. They just try to divide people and turn them against each other.</p>
<p>And some more fun facts of COVID, i know few folks who’ve taken two tests in one day in different places and one tests told positive and another one negative. I’m sorry but it makes people suspicious. Also one of my friends father was diagnosed with pneumonia AFTER he got vaccinated and they wrote COVID to his diagnosis. If that isn’t weird then what is?</p>
<p>Also, ALL of my friends my age who have had it have had nearly 0 symptoms. Isn’t it weird?</p>
<p>Ps, does media tell us to eat D-vitamin and work out to have better immunity? They only tell us to stay indoors and wear masks + get vaccinated, no one tells us to take care of our health to have better immunity. So it’s also one of the things that makes me deeply doubt that medical institutions and governments care about our well-being. One of my friends works at hospital and told me that low intake of D-vitamin and obesity are HUGE risk factors.</p>
<p>At the end of the day there’s nothing delusional or weird about people being suspicious. It’s normal that people use their brains and don’t believe in everything that media feeds us.</p></p>
