        <p>Is that what people in the UK are told? What? I hang out with my friends all the time, bars usually or back at homes, several people, no masks, no tests, its been 13 months. They act like everyone currently has covid, and is infectious. That's the basis for this.</p>

        <p>This is what we are told, but I'm not sure how many obey - it is not enforced.  In public, most people will say they agree, but probably do their own thing anyway.  I'm still having people over to my place and have been throughout this whole thing, although I culled my friendships with anyone who took this thing seriously back in March 2020 and I'm better off for that - deleted Facebook, etc. only thing I have now is Telegram.  Honestly, I feel pretty good.</p>

        <p>Seatbelts don't hurt me.  The vaccine can.  It's not safe.  People are getting sick from it quite frequently.  People are being put into the hospital because of it.  People are dying from it.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who would wear a seatbelt that was edged with shards of glass.  I really don't.   A seatbelt has a MUCH higher chance of saving you than a vaccine.  Most car crashes are fatal without a seatbelt, but covid is generally harmless.  It doesn't kill that often.  So...</p>
<p>The equivalent to getting the vaccine for covid is wearing a seatbelt edged with shards of glass and only driving 5 miles an hour.  I don't know anyone who would do that.</p>

        <p>Yeah cause why would you wear such seatbelt, but even with normal seatbelts, there are people that believe that seatbelts are dangerous. I aggree that there are cases where it would be better to not have the seatbelt on (for example when the car is on fire) but most of the times it’s way better to have it on, and it’s the same with vaccines</p>

        <p>No it's better to have a vaccine that isn't more dangerous than the virus. </p>
<p>But this mRNA vaccine is more dangerous. </p>
<p>Damn near every single reported case is nothing more than a positive PCR test result on a healthy person. I will not take an unsafe vaccine just because of a positive PCR result when I'm healthy.</p>

        <p>You know that the vaccine is not for people that allready have the virus but that it’s a preventive measure, also i don’t know why my edit disappear but there i said that the fatality number for covid infection is more than 1% while from what i know people say that 15 people died from the vaccines (none of them are certified if they really died from it or not), and 650 milion doses where given (i divided the number by two cause most of the vaccines need two doses per person to work) and got that the fatality rate of vaccines is 0,000005%</p>
<p>Also if you say that there are positive covid pcr tests that should be negative than that just makes the number for covid bigger</p>

        <p>Oh good because I've already had the virus and so I don't need the vaccine.  I've been offered it twice and signed paperwork in HR declining it. </p>
<p>And the way I see it, any virus that spreads as quickly as Covid did (around the planet in 3 to 4 months hitting every single nursing home in America at nearly the exact same time) has already infected over 90% of the population. Thus, pretty much everyone still alive has survived the virus and doesn't need the vaccine. </p>
<p>Also one final note.  </p>
<p>I am not worried about dying from the vaccine. I simply don't care for the nasty side effects that have proven to be very very common</p>

        <p>Ok i will end our conversation on one last note and that is that it works like flu, if you had it you won’t have it for some time but your imunity system will stop working against it after some time (that’s why people who take flu vaccines don’t get the vaccine only ones but i think it was once a year or once every few years, and it will probably be the same with covid). (Btw by the thing that i just said i don’t mean that covid is like a flu, i mean it has a similarity)</p>

Is 2.85m dead, 131m infected
Place that into your calculator 2.85/131 than multiply it by 100 to get the percentage and wow you are right i am spreading lies it’s not 1% it is over 2%</p>

        <p>All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15% and ~1.5‐2.0 billion infections by February 2021</p>

        <p>People are getting the vaccine because they want to go back to normal.</p>
<p>You don't go back to normal by complying with their demands.  The only thing the vaccine is going to get you is a "new vaccine resistant strain" and another vaccine next year.</p>
<p>I've talked to a lot of people about why they got the jab.  It's always "so I can travel... So I can shop without a mask... So I can see grandma... So I can this or that."  I haven't had a single person tell me they got it because they're afraid of the virus.</p>
<p>Next year, when they still haven't gone back to normal despite having gotten a fresh covid 21 vaccine, they'll blame us.  We can't go back to normal because us stupid and uneducated folk won't get the vaccine.  If we would just comply a little harder, the people forcing us to comply would allow us to have some of our rights back.</p>

Where is your line in the sand and how hard are you willing to fight for it is a question we all need to be asking ourselves right now. If you draw a line in the sand, prepare to be uncomfortable because it will be crossed and you will have to make a decision on how you will fight that incursion.</p>

        <p>Both statements are correct. In the seatbelt analogy, for example, two people may be wearing seatbelts but there’s always the chance of a car crash killing them. If you’re crushed by a semi truck, it doesn’t do crap.</p>
<p>The seatbelts do provide protection to the person in many cases, for obvious reasons</p>
<p>The vaccines may help, but there’s no 100% guarantee on it. There’s no 100% protection on anything, but there’s always a way to be prepared.</p>

        <p>Yes. Obviously. Because if they allow people who have been vaccinated to act normally, which they’re obviously able to without being a threat to themselves and others, you create a tiered society, which would at best prompt a public outcry and at worst full blown social unrest. So yes, he’s lying, for a reason.</p>

        <p>The difference is as long as everyone drives sensibly you won’t need a seatbelt whilst all you need to do is cough or sneeze or breath in someone directions and they can potentially catch it and the same works the other way round</p>

        <p>So your saying despite the fact that we have seen viruses and bacteria under microscopes and it’s been scientifically proven the link between disease and them from something such as germ theory which proved the miasma theory wrong your saying I agree with this theory or am I miss understanding something</p>

        <p>If two ppl are vaccinated I see no reason why they can’t meet indoors although his analogy has a bit of a discrepancy. The fact that car crashes occur is horrible but we can’t ban cars bc ppl require them for everyday needs. There are very few ppl that absolutely need to see their friends. Also car crashes do not spread from person to person lol, so it is far less dangerous. Also car crashes are a permanent problem while Covid is not if we simply get vaccinated when it’s our turn. That is not a sheepish thing to do. It is not patriotic or brave to expose your friends and family to a deadly virus</p>
