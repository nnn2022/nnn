        <p>i think curing cancer has been the objective of mrna therapy research for much of its lifespan, so this is a very nonsensical sentence to me:</p>
<p>&rt; we were able to demonstrate the potential of mrna vaccines in addressing covid-19</p>
<p>like, hey guys, we have this amazing technology we've been working on for over a decade to cure cancer, so we decided to debut our new technology to the world on a completely different disease in an extremely time sensitive and tensely politicized global situation, to make people confident in it as a cancer treatment.</p>
<p>what about that makes sense? what about using new tech, that has never been used for a vaccine before, in an emergency situation for no reason -- when they could have just used traditional vaccine technology that many people already trust and we already know how to do -- makes sense? they could have debuted mrna therapy as the cancer treatment it is, and its image would not be ruined by this highly politicized situation. now a lot of cancer patients are going to distrust something that actually could have saved their lives. they SERIOUSLY fucked this up.</p>

        <p>Wait what is your point here? They made a vaccine for COVID first cause it’s a contagious disease that has wrecked the global economy. Now they are now moving on to develop a vaccine to prevent skin cancer which has not been previously possible without mRNA tech.</p>

<p>If you want to get super specific about wording then yes Covid itself is not a disease, but rather a contagious virus that causes disease.</p>

        <p>Idk dude. I’m clearly for vaccines but the fact this discussion is banned literally everywhere else bothers me. I understand why mods might think it helps but it clearly doesn’t. The fact you can post dissenting opinions on this subreddit and the subreddit actually facilitates good faith discussions without banning people I think is rather valuable.</p>

        <p>I mostly agree. Problem you’ll see on here it that people make up their own facts and think the world is conspiracy driven. </p>
<p>I personally got the vax a few months ago but I’m open to hearing scientific arguments against it. People saying it was created for population control and that we are all now magnetic speaks to the failure of our education systems tho. This is mostly a USA and UK group from what I’ve gathered</p>

        <p>Sure but what helps quell those arguments of conspiracy and speculation is not a crusade by the media and platforms to shut down all discussion about the vaccine. It’s completely counterintuitive. People here aren’t really the ones making up facts either, it’s often deceptive media sources pandering to their concerns. What helps is addressing those concerns and pointing out that a lot of the info they have comes from dubious sources. What I also find is that the people who claim it’s magnetic and such are a tiny vocal minority and that most people on here realise that information is stupid.</p>

        <p>Hit the nail on the head. Tiny vocal minority (aka bad apples) ruins everything. But yeah, silencing opinions is a bad look. I think the way the sensors see it is that a person could easily believe the conspirators and act in a way that causes harm to themselves. Not a good thing in a pandemic where stupidity is essentially contagious</p>

        <p>Our response to covid wrecked the economy. Many effective treatments were available early on and they were suppressed because "there wasn't enough research" and instead an experimental vaccine with even less research was hastily rolled out. The EUA never should have been issued and it should be revoked immediately. Many in the pro Vax community are saying so and they are also being suppressed. See a pattern and problem yet?</p>

        <p>Yes but scientists can only deal with the problem at hand using the tools they have. It’s a fact that Covid resulted in a series of decisions that wrecked our economy. Fixing the Covid issue would allow everyone to move past that. I agree that there is a lack of interest in alternative treatments, however they are largely disputed in the scientific community, unlike the vaccine which practically all researchers who have looked into the topic agree is safe and effective. There has to be a grounded scientific basis to revoke the EUA which never showed itself. There were scientists concerned things were happening too quickly however most have retracted their concerns after proper studies came out about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, and furthermore after millions of people have been vaxxed. There is a lot of pressure on scientists right now to ensure that anything they say is absolute and well evidenced, otherwise what they say could result in the loads of harm.</p>
