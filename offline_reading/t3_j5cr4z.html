Unfortunately, our most-abused award (and I'll bet you know which one it is) is not one that we can disable, unlike some others.</p>

        <p>Did it ever possibly occur to you that the facts and logic locking down the world is why there are less deaths. For example the US who refuses to lockdown has 200000+ deaths and it is still climbing rapidly where as tuberculosis only killed 515 people in the US. Tuberculosis is only killing people in places with poor healthcare and corrupt governments. You should try to fact check everything you say, you'd find that everything you say is utter shit. Next time you're dumb ass wants to try to prove a point try not spewing your opinion from your emotions like a 12 year old girl.</p>

        <p>When did I brush off the poorer countries? And no TB is not as fatal with good healthcare systems. TB has a 3% death rate where as Covid sits at 5-7%, if you had the reading skills of a five year old you'd be able to see that covid is a much bigger threat to the US Population because not only does it kill more people but it spreads much much faster than TB. Try reading what I am saying before answering, you might learn something about your ignorance, selfishness, lack of empathy, lack of intelligence, and overall lack of brain cells.

        <p>This post makes it obvious that all the ad hominem you’ve been using is what we learned folks called “psychological projection”. Any critical thinking at all on your part and you’d find that COVID-19, relative to other viruses, has faaaar more asymptomatic cases, which aren’t factored into the JHU numbers, which only consider confirmed cases. Fauci recently said that the US’ death rate, factoring in asymptomatic cases, is 1%. The WHO’s best estimate is that 750 million people in the world have been infected, for a death rate of - wait for it - 0.1%. As for me getting COVID, seeing as I’m not 90 with stage 4 cancer, I probably won’t even realize. As for you, you should probably go outside. You might like the fresh air</p>

        <p>Everything you just said proves that you went to extreme lengths to prove your point when the information is right infront of you. The percentage of deaths varies per country based on social and wellness factors such as access to hospitals and population density so you would realize that the death rate is much high that just the US. If only you idiots would stop infecting eachother we could actually bring the death rate down to what the WHO thinks it is. For an anti-maskers you sure quote the government alot. Maybe you should listen to your own advice and start thinking of others not just yourself. You're a selfish bigot with no reason to care about anyone else because no one else cares about you. Instead of endangering those around like a bitchy Karen whining about her freedom put on a mask and do something to help. I'm not from the US. Thank God. But I don't wish death on anyone there especially not 210000 people. So you can say what you want but 210000 deaths are not worth your ignorant ass not having to wear a mask. If you want to keep talking and making a bigger fool of yourself keep going. This is already getting cross posted and you will be shamed for your selfishness and ignorance of human life. Have a nice day.</p>

        <p>A) that was auto correct
B) more people would die without any lockdown proceedures 
C) why would you post this if you aren't anti mask
D) In Canada we went through the lockdown early, got our cases under control, then after we could manage the few hundred new cases and had proper contact tracing we reopened. Saving lives and saving money instead of putting people's lives at risk because we were too scared of putting our own lives on pause so no you're not saving lives. You're ending them. Go take your "I'm a Savior of the economy" attitude and gtfo. There are systems in place to help people in situations where food is scarce. Canada and the rest of the world have handled this situation better than the US could handle a nerfgun. So if you're gonna think for even one moment that lots more deaths and avoiding a lockdown is gonna save anyone's life you are wrong. An early lockdown would have prevented your country from becoming the hell mouth it is today. A food bank can fix hunger but a doctor can't fix death. By fixing the most important threat to people's lives you prevent the domino effect that is US politics and economy. As a business student I can tell you for a fact that they can keep running an economy from home without putting lives at risk. So I'm sorry you feel your "Freedom" is threatened but by ignoring it you are taking away other people's freedom if not their lives.</p>

        <p>You're addressing me like I'm a rabid right winger when I'm in fact a Classical Marxist. I'm well aware that western notions of "freedom" are reflections of the material reality of America being at the end of the global supply chain. I'm disappointed in many of my comrades for taking a similar stance as the one you've laid out, that they're choosing "lives over economy". 21st century global capitalism means that it isn't a binary choice, and that "saving lives" from lockdown kills in other places along the supply chain. It just so happens that the people who bear the brunt of lockdowns are in the already super-exploited parts of the globe, ie the global south.</p>
