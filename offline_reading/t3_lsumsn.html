    <strong>goddamnit, the new anti-vaxxers are your fault, not ours</strong>
    <p><p>I read this recently at discussions with other well-met and like-minded individuals on this board:</p>
<p>&rt;"Call it by what it is: gene therapy. If you categorize the phizer/biontech gene therapy a vaccine you have already lost."</p>
<p>And it has some truth. Of course, just because I do not like this new therapy does not mean I need to disavow all other vaccines. Just because I am vaccinated does not mean I need to sign up for the new therapy. There is no logical correlation, because they are fundamentally different. But words have power. The push to even call it a vaccine seems to be motivated by the belief that by correlating it to something old and well-tested, it will make people less fearful of it.</p>
<p>Which, you know, worked for a while.</p>
<p>If you wanted to talk about your concerns to some people, as long as you debate a vaccine (see above statement) - which have been known to be the foundation for everything good, ever - you will have a hard time.</p>
<p>After all, we had vaccines for decades.</p>
<p>But here is the kicker: They starkly understimated the negative sentiment the vaccine will produce. The issues I am seeing is, controversely, people growing to question ordinary vaccines more and more, and I will certainly not blame them at this point. Thoughts like "Is this what the so-called "vaccines" have been all along?" or "If I can be influenced like this so openly, have they been doing this in the past?" are logically inbound. Because it is a LEGITIMATE QUESTION to ask. The person will "do his own research." Which they are still hoping we wont do. And he will inevitably find that they were enough bad experimental vaccines that the media has been silent about, more than enough vaccine victims, to cement his newfound belief.</p>
<p>And it does not matter that these missteps are maybe a small, tiny percentage and that they did more good than harm, in general. The pedestal vaccines were put on in the past was way too high, and negative news were suppressed because the public was believed to be too reactionary to handle them while still taking the vaccine. Which means the foundation of vaccines is flawed, and the pedestal has deep structural damage they just painted over with glitter and toothpaste. Put the weight and dubious nature of the new "vaccine" on top of this structure, and it will all come crashing down.</p>
<p>They are tainting the image of vaccines, and trying to pin the blame for that on us. BUT IT REALLY IS ON THEM. You decided to call it a vaccine in the first place. Now deal with a population that will likely never advocate for any vaccine ever again.</p></p>

        <p>This fits pretty well for me.</p>
<p>I was kinda indifferent towards vaccines. Not really thinking much about them, just assuming they are a helpful tool to reduce disease-risk.</p>
<p>The more I've witnessed vaccine-skeptics being publicly shamed and censored, the more skeptical and interested into what they were saying I actually became.</p>
<p>The way to earn my trust would have been to have a public debate with the skeptics and addressing their concerns. Not to call them dangerous lunatics and tell me I shouldn't listen to them.</p>

        <p>Well because it is becoming irrefutable. Its easy to dismiss paradigm shifting ideologies because quite frankly changing your belief is a painful process. ( literally neurons being killed ) but it has gotten to the point with hypocracies and asking for blind faith that even the most "rational" thinker can see it. Things will change shortly. For better or worse just remember to love thy neighbour.</p>

        <p>I’m the last person that could be called anti-vax. All my shots are up to date, my son’s as well. We both even have our rabies shot because of an encounter with a bat. Got the twinrix vaccine required by my previous job. Had our flu shots every winter (until this year). </p>
<p>I’m firmly against this injection they’re calling a vaccine. And because they’re calling it a vaccine, I guess that makes me anti-vax now? Congratulations MSM.</p>

        <p>This... they should never have called this gene therapy a vaccine or made clear the difference between attenuated virus vaccines and gene therapy vaccines.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the former but a hell of a lot of problem with the latter because I know how the gene therapy vaccines have ROUTINELY killed lab animals down to the last one with hemorrhagic deaths.</p>
<p>I can find no documentation that these idiots ever fixed those issues with the gene therapy vaccines.</p>

        <p>The Reddit anti-anti-vaxxer movement did more to make me an anti-vaxxer than any "mommy bloggy" ever could. There's something about having people private messaging you hoping your family dies from the flu because you said other countries don't promote annual flu vaccines to the entire population that just really makes you question the whole thing. Treating any medical invention as some miracle that should be mandatory and anyone who questions it should be publicly shamed is as unscientific as it gets considering what we know about the likes of J+J and Pfizer amongst others.</p>

        <p>Vaccines themselves are bad too; anything the government has done to us has never been for our benefit. It's clear as day to me, still not sure why some people don't get it. Vaccines were created to keep us sick and where the government wants us; under their thumbs.</p>

        <p>Flu shots are fine because no one is forced to get one. If you feel like getting one because you find evidence that it will protect you, great. In a perfect world, vaccines are 100% safe and effective and everyone voluntarily gets them, and no one ever gets sick. But you see the problem with this thinking right? If a plan relies on "if 100% of everyone did this..." or "if x thing always/never happens..." it's not a good plan or theory. That's what the whole issue with these measures is, people can't and shouldn't be forced to do the same thing.</p>
