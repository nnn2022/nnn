    <strong>When will people see forcing others to do something against their will is immoral and wrong?</strong>
    <p><p>Its at a point where theres literally no point even engaging with certain people because even when i present a peer reviewed counter article to their shit, or that reinforces my points, theyre not gonna change their stance on things anyways.</p>
<p>So the only real solution is this: you wear a mask. You get a vaccine. I will do neither. You respect my decision to make my own choices based on my own health, and ill respect yours.</p>
<p>I can be an asshole and still respect your rights. I can think youre an idiot for getting an experimental vaccine. You can think im an idiot for not getting one. Dont like me? Dont talk to me. No one is forcing you to. No one is handcuffing us together either, so youre free to stay away from me as well. Im not a dog. I dont chase things that run.</p>
<p>If you cant handle that, you lack a conscience. I have no issue being around you. I can respect your space. I never sniffed people or got close enough to anyone in a way that would have made them uncomfortable before the scamdemic, i have no intentions on doing it now. I go about my business. You go about yours. Pretend im vaccinated and wearing a mask like you pretend covid is dangerous if thats what you need to do in order to make it through this without getting throat punched by someone whos had enough of 1930s germany larpers.</p>
<p>Now unfortunately, when you have a governing body or self imposed authority like the cdc/who pushing the fear narrative and reinforcing the beliefs of people who look to the state for security, you end up with ethics issues. Because those people would stand idly by and watch their neighbours get held down and injected with something against their will in the same fashion the germans in the 30s watched their jewish neighbours get dragged from their homes and tossed in box cars where they were sent to places to be worked to death or just killed.</p>
<p>So if you dont stand in solidarity with the people who dont want the mask or the vaccine  defending their right to body autonomy, dont be surprised if a civil war happens because there are a LOT of people who would rather die than trust the official narrative and to no fault of their own. The track records of the people they oppose speak for themselves, accomplishments and atrocities in all.</p></p>

        <p>The US used to allow government officials to involuntarily commit and labotomize people they deemed were dangerous to themselves or others.  This was misused to harass political opponents, and was used on women who questioned men too much.</p>

        <p>“Pretend im vaccinated and wearing a mask like you pretend covid is dangerous...” LOL! Love it. </p>
<p>But really, although you make an awesome point, it’s likely they will never see their actions as unwarranted because we live in a society built around telling people what they can and can’t do. </p>
<p>Why can’t I drive 70 mph through downtown? I mean, I can, but after so many times, they’ll take my DL and thus my right to drive. Same goes for taxes - you don’t HAVE to pay in a chunk of your hard earned money, but if you don’t they will take you from your home and loved ones and cage you for as long as they please. </p>
<p>These actions are of course justified by whatever dangers the claim to be preventing or the benefits gained by forcing our will. But sadly, this is what they have always done, we just waited a little too long to draw the line..</p>

        <p>I've said it before, the Nazis thought they were the good guys. The Soviets thought they were the good guys. Mao thought he was the good guy. </p>
<p>The people who oppose the good guys are the bad guys. People who question authority are the bad guys. The people who don't fit the narrative are the bad guys.</p>
<p>We're the bad guys.</p>

<p>A few years into the totalitarian regime. That's how most felt the soviet union or recently venezuela. Most eventually realize they were idiots who destroyed themselves.</p>
