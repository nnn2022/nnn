        <p>See I can understand the woman on the lefts actions in an office environment, frankly a manager should ask her to go home if she's that worried. What I really don't get is a guy swimming with a mask and gloves but no shirt. If he's that worried he should not be swimming in the ocean, it's full of microbiological life, waste and other dangers.</p>

        <p>Nothing dumb about rejecting the idiotic, dehumanizing dystopia that is the "new normal". I'm also getting tired of these types of comments.</p>
<p>To all future commenters of "Is tHiS SuBrEdDIt ReaL?" Yes, we are real. Yes, we reject the new normal and think it is horrible. If you like it then keep it to yourselves and stop forcing us to partake in your apocalypse fantasy.</p>
<p>The fact that there are people that support this and are surprised by the fact that we do so actually terrifies me. No sane human should be supporting this.</p>

<p>I'm also ashamed that so many people enthusiastically accepted dystopia and hysteria for about 10 months now and much more disturbed by the fact that there are those that want this to continue any further than it has.</p>

<p>My condolences, but the uncomfortable truth people have to start facing is that old people are equally likely to die from any infectious disease and COVID isn't special. Infections are one of the leading causes of death among the elderly Would you demand the world to shut down, everyone to drastically alter their life if it happened because of the flu? In fact it does happen, but we never call for that. Plus, the flu is actually deadly to children, but we don't care about that.</p>
<p>&rt;It needs to be continued, and much harder, or millions and millions of people will lose their loved ones too.</p>
<p>No it doesn't, it doesn't need to continue because these measures don't work and will not change the final outcome anyway. Might as well not have them. In fact, there will be extremely heavy consequences for the measures we have imposed so far. Better for it to stop as soon as possible i.e now.</p>
<p>&rt;Nobody is enthusiastic about this. Nobody likes this.</p>
<p>I see the opposite everywhere on Reddit. Fortunately, they are not representative of the real world.</p>
<p>&rt;It‚Äôs horrible. I am missing out on the most important years of my life.</p>
<p>All the more reason for you to be against this. There WILL be lasting consequences to your later life with these things continuing. I assume you're in the same age group as me, we are going to be paying for this for decades in the future. I'm sorry but that is unacceptable to me. I should not have my future destroyed to save old people who would have likely died within the year. I'm sure given the choice, the elderly would agree as well. It's already hard enough as it is with the field I am in, I don't want it to be worse. Life is not to be spent avoiding all risks.</p>
<p>&rt;But this could have been so much shorter if we took it so much more seriously. So many lives could have been saved.</p>
<p>No. It wouldn't have. Stop repeating this and stop thinking this. You have been gaslit to think this and in turn are gaslighting me. There is no way to control a virus. Period. No way. Look at how Europe was lauded as taking it seriously and look at where they are now. Half of them are back in lockdown.</p>
<p>That's the unfortunate truth. None of this was necessary, because none of this works. Nothing we did was in the playbook of any health organization. What we did was take unprecedented measures that were never proven to work and have torn a hole in the fabric of society that will take forever to rebuild. We have turned neighbors onto each other and made humans regard their fellow man as a walking pile of disease. This is extremely damaging and we haven't even come close to understanding what the ramifications of what we have done are.</p>

<p>Sure, elderly people are dying from Covid-19. That's not the problem. The biggest problem is the perfectly healthy 35-year old who suddenly goes into complete respiratory arrest and can not breathe. These patients need ventilators to help them breathe until they recover. If too many people get sick and stop breathing all at once, there won't be enough ventilators to go around and they will be slowly asphyxiated.</p>
<p>&rt;No it doesn't, it doesn't need to continue because these measures don't work and will not change the final outcome anyway. Might as well not have them. In fact, there will be extremely heavy consequences for the measures we have imposed so far. Better for it to stop as soon as possible i.e now.</p>
<p>It's not about changing the final outcome in terms of cases, it's about spreading out cases so healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, like running out of beds or ventilators. Finland and Norway, which have a combined population equal to Sweden, have 10 times fewer deaths than Sweden. This is because Sweden didn't impose any restrictions at all, causing too many people to get sick all at once.  As Swedish hospitals reached maximum capacity, hospitals turned away people deemed too young to suffer serious Covid-19 complications and ICU units turned away people too old to recover from Covid-19 complications. Both groups suffered and saw deaths. Nursing homes administered morphine to dying residents since they were not allowed to administer oxygen.</p>

Look at how Europe was lauded as taking it seriously and look at where they are now. Half of them are back in lockdown.</p>
<p>Europe has relapsed because they eased restrictions thinking Covid-19 was over when it wasn't. And if you propose having no lockdown, you'd be right back where you started. Sweden had no lockdown and suffered economically just as much as neighboring countries on top of the additional deaths. Earlier this month, they also began implementing tighter restrictions.</p>
<p>&rt;That's the unfortunate truth. None of this was necessary, because none of this works. Nothing we did was in the playbook of any health organization.

This is extremely damaging and we haven't even come close to understanding what the ramifications of what we have done are.</p>
<p>It was in the playbook and it does work. The point is to lower cases so hospitals are not overwhelmed. We managed it for a while, but now hospitals are back at the breaking point because of easing restrictions. Sweden's Prime Minister, who did not send the country into lockdown nor place any travel restrictions, was pleading on a televised address for the country to do more now. Politicians are turning neighbors onto each other and made humans regard their fellow man as a walking pile of disease. Don't mix it up with Covid-19.</p>

        <p>&rt;The biggest problem is the perfectly healthy 35-year old who suddenly goes into complete respiratory arrest and can not breathe</p>
<p>This happens unfortunately, but it is rare. If it comes to the point then we have triage.</p>
<p>&rt;These patients need ventilators to help them breathe until they recover</p>
<p>You seem to be stuck in March, like a lot are. We don't use vents in hispitals anymore, they were found to be more detrimental than helpful. Now we only use them as an extreme last resort.</p>
<p>&rt;it's about spreading out cases so healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, like running out of beds or ventilators</p>
<p>They've had 10 months to figure that out now. Not my problem anymore. Entire new hospitals could have been built in this time if they sped up the paperwork which takes the most time.</p>
<p>&rt;This is because Sweden didn't impose any restrictions at all, causing too many people to get sick all at once.</p>
<p>Wrong, they made recommendations, which should have been done everywhere unlike this human rights travesty. They had more deaths in the beginning because as Tegnell himself admitted they failed at keeping nursing homes safe. The rest of the populaation is fine.</p>
<p>&rt;As Swedish hospitals reached maximum capacity, hospitals turned away people deemed too young to suffer</p>
<p>I haven't heard a single report about this. In fact, I've heard the opposite that the healthcare system was never overloaded.</p>
<p>&rt;Nursing homes administered morphine to dying residents since they were not allowed to administer oxygen.</p>
<p>The humane thing to do when there is no feasible way to save them. Relieve pain and allow them to pass peacefully, rather than keep them hooked on machines for months on end to keep them "alive".</p>
<p>&rt;Europe has relapsed because they eased restrictions thinking Covid-19 was over when it wasn't.</p>
<p>So your solution is what, endless, indefinite restrictions? You need to start understanding what is feasible and what is not.</p>
<p>&rt;Sweden had no lockdown and suffered economically just as much as neighboring countries on top of the additional deaths.</p>
<p>Well, how about that. Sweden doesn't exist in a vaccuum. The only reason it suffered economically is because everyone else is suffering as well. At least I'm not hearing reports saying that 60% of Sweden's small businesses are gone forever like in NYC. Currently just about every country that has implemented tight restrictions has had worse, similar or just marginally better outcomes than Sweden.</p>
<p>&rt;Earlier this month, they also began implementing tighter restrictions.</p>
<p>Lol making the restaurant table limit of 8 is hardly "tight". Come talk to me when you have police breaking into your homes to see if you are more than 6.</p>
<p>&rt;It was in the playbook and it does work</p>
<p>Not in ANY of the pandemic response guidelines I have read. Here's my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jdfp03/z/g985gop">comment going into more detail.</a> I'm gonna need a source on that your claim because for a pandemic much worse than this I don't see much recommended. Even if it does work, it is too costly to consider. No wonder they never tried this before. Imagine we did this every time we had a disease scare.</p>
<p>&rt;The point is to lower cases so hospitals are not overwhelmed. We managed it for a while, but now hospitals are back at the breaking point because of easing restrictions.</p>
<p>Like I said, not my problem anymore. They've had 10 months to come up with a solution. Maybe they shouldn't have closed all the field hospitals that they set up before. Also, you do know that hospitals are regularly overloaded in normal flu seasons right? How come I never heard anyone crying about that back then?</p>
<p>&rt;Sweden's Prime Minister, who did not send the country into lockdown nor place any travel restrictions, was pleading on a televised address for the country to do more now.</p>
<p>Is there a problem in Sweden? With daily deaths still low and cases flattening out, I fail to see it.</p>
<p>From the way you type about Sweden, I assume you're Swedish? So I'm going to help put things into perspective for you. Go outside, walk in your streets and breathe fresh, clean air and appreciate how you don't have to do it with a fucking mask. Because I have to wear one as soon as I step foot outside.</p>
<p>Go sit in a bar with your friends, have a drink and maybe go talk to the girl in the corner giving you the eye. Because right now there are billions without the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>Go to the club and party. Because there are those that have had that privilege stolen.</p>
<p>Go into a store, or a mall and notice how you aren't forced to put on a mask. Because the rest of us are under threat of fines or jail if we do that.</p>
<p>Have a dinner party with your friends and loved ones without having to worry about the military breaking down your door and arresting you. Because there are those among us who actually live with that fear.</p>
<p>Appreciate the rights and freedom you have and don't call for tighter restrictions on yourself. Honestly, I can't believe there are people living in free places that are calling for their freedoms to be restricted. That's quite scary really.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, people are losing jobs, homes, can't feed their families, suicides have risen hugely, mental health is awful, and people have lost the things that make life worth living.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry for what happened to you, and I'd never wish that on anyone else. But risk balancing is so so important, especially in times like these, and it seems we have forgotten how to do it! The great Barrington declaration looks like a better approach in a lot of ways. It has it's flaws, sure, but our current approach has many more. It focuses more on giving individuals the opportunity to risk assess for themselves while giving those at risk the means to protect themselves. It was written by leading scientists too, so just goes to show how 'the science' is not just what we're told, it is in fact a wide spectrum of different views but most importantly observation and evidence. We tried this crazy approach for nearly 10 months now, and it isn't working. That could never be the fault of a small group of people who don't comply, and if it really depends on 100% compliance to work then it is not a solution. We need to learn from our mistake and try something else.</p>
