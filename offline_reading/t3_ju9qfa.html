    <strong>The Church of Covid</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; <em>As Juvenal observed, the people will tolerate just about anything as  long as they are fed and entertained. This has always been true of  America. The ruling class could get away with murder as long as the  standard of living kept rising. The question lurking behind the store  closings and shuttered retail areas is how will the ruling class keep  the people fed and entertained while they loot the economy?</em> </p>
<p>Such an astute observation. I think the obvious answer is that there will need to be a lot fewer of us to "feed and entertain"...</p>
