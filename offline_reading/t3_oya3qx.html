    <strong>Somatic manifestations of stress and other things</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't really so much a rant as it is a vent. Just sharing feelings in case anyone else is having these same feelings and feels alone. I have a feeling there might be others out there that are having the same challenges and struggles and thoughts. And maybe if I post this others will know they are not alone. </p>
<p>The situation where I live has progressed to a point where I am becoming physically ill from the intense pressure and the constant psyop being inflicted. I wake up every morning from a fitful sleep with a horrible stomach ache and overwhelming nausea. It's such a heavy feeling of grief and deep hopelessness. I feel it making me sick. It really reminds me of how I felt after my mother passed away. I was completely out of it for a good two years, I felt like I was in a fog, nothing made sense and I felt like I was sleepwalking all the time. Nothing seemed real. I was trying so hard to survive and stay above water. I don't remember a lot of details about what happened during that time and this reminds me of that same feeling. I felt like I was constantly struggling to process what was happening. Same thing now. When I woke up in the mornings I would have to remind myself, she's really gone, it really happened. It's definitely grief, I feel like I'm grieving what we've lost.</p>
<p>There are times I cry, I feel hopeless and so desperate to get out of this world. I feel like a rat trapped in a maze. Can't say I'm suicidal, but I have moments when I wish I wasn't alive anymore. At one point I actually had a thought that the second my heart stops beating all of this will be over. It was scary and peaceful at the same time. But once again I have to stress I'm not actually suicidal I'm just tired of all of this.. It's just so suffocating and it feels like there is no way out. I am a single woman ,middle aged, no family.. My whole life has been here, friends work etc. I had a great life prior to this. Now I have lost some of my closest friends but I have made a few new ones and become a lot closer to a few people who are on the same page here so that was a nice surprise. They have saved my life I couldnt have made it without them. The new people in my life feel so different. I've known them for a shorter time but the bond feels so much stronger than it ever did with my old friends who I lost. I can't even explain it it's very strange. But they seem so much more alive to me , so much more engaged in what's going on around them. My old friends seem numbed out to everything. When I have conversations with my new friends the flow between us is more electric, it's like we are on the same frequency. I know this probably sounds nuts but it is what it is.</p>
<p>I am in NYC. I have been here for decades of my life. I am actively taking steps to prepare to leave. I don't know when that will be but I am trying to get my professional license for my career up and running in a couple of other states so I have options. I can't leave right now at this very moment because I wouldn't be able to work elsewhere. That's why I'm preparing. I'm also working on a religious exemption through an attorney because I'm pretty sure my job is going to mandate the vaccine. And yes I actually am religious so this is not a fake thing for me. If it's not accepted, it's not accepted but I'm not going to go down without a fight. If by some miracle I don't have to take this my job is remote and I would be able to move because of that. So there are various factors here at play.</p>
<p>Anyway we've had the vaccine passport since April. Most people have been absolutely clueless that it even exists. Ever since this went off I've been warning people, telling everyone I can..... look what's happening, but no one listens they just don't care. They think it's not a big deal. I have felt like chicken little but everything I said that was coming has come. At this point I am not allowed any entertainment venues restaurants or gyms. To be honest this is not a big loss for me. I don't go to the gym, I do like to go to concerts but I can live without that for now and I'm always on some sort of healthy eating plan and I prefer to cook my own food. I only go out to eat for special occasions so not going to a restaurant is no loss to me. That said I worry that I will not be able to buy food soon or get on the subway or walk into a government building or go to a doctor's office. My mind races wondering what's next. If I sit here and think like a psychopath I've been able to predict everything that's happening. I could completely see them blocking me out of the Lyft app so I won't even be able to call a cab. I can see them blocking us from grocery stores. Everytime I think of it and I think no they would never do that I now think oh they absolutely would it's lawless here we've been thrust into full-on fascism and everyone is running around in their masks waving their vaccine cards loving every second of it. I know my time here is running out but I can't leave right away. I'm having nightmares about this. I'm honestly worried about basic things like food. Of course I'm prepared but my mind goes to such dark places.</p>
<p>My mind goes in circles, if I take the vaccine it doesn't end there. If it doesn't make me sick the first time the third fourth fifth and sixth booster shots probably will. Do I want to rope myself into permanent vaccine stupidity and have my life revolve around allowing the government to inject me with whatever the hell they want whenever the hell they want? Of course not. Even if I had taken the vaccine there is no way I would be on board with the continual pumping of shots into me for eternity. There is no end in sight and I would never be a government lab rat. I also would never ever want to be part of a society that excludes people for their medical choices. This is absolutely horrifying and disgusting and evil and cruel. I can't believe there are people that are so loaded with fear they love this and they want more of it. It sickens me. It frustrates me to see people think this is just about a virus and a vaccine. I wonder how anyone could not see that there is way more going on here. This is so post-911 the way they are doing things. To this day we still take our shoes off at airports. That was temporary 20 years ago. I fear that this will be exactly the same. They are using an emergency and people's fear to change the world forever. And once it's permanent There's No Going Back. There are times when I almost feel like I'm going crazy, then I speak to someone else who sees this and I feel like okay I'm not nuts.</p>
<p>I almost wish I could unsee everything I see. That I could go back to trusting the government, there was a time when I did. It's been a long time but there was a time in my life when I was young and I never suspected things. Today I learned that the cousin of someone very close to me works in a lab and noticed co-workers labeling positive covid tests with the word Delta variant. My friend's cousin asked why are you putting Delta variant on these samples when we don't have the capability of testing for that here? They said they were told to do it and they wouldn't say who told them to do it. Once again this is confirmation of lies. Isn't covid enough? We have to keep the Delta variant narrative going? The constant fear-mongering is just too much. This has broken millions of people forever they are never going to be normal functioning people ever again after this. A lot of them have been altered into a permanent state of fear and I hate the government and our media for destroying human beings like this. And I really hate that we can't question anything and point out lies and inconsistencies without being called deniers and anti-vaxxers. I know this virus is real and I know it kills people I've seen it do that. I'm not in denial at all. And my vaccination record for my job is two pages long. I'm so sick of people being so All or Nothing it's exhausting and I just want this to stop. Everyday I feel like I'm slipping a little further away from my will to keep going. Anyway I just wanted to share this. If you are feeling this way to You're Not Alone.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not an all or nothing type either.</p>
<p>On one hand I know COVID19 is lethal for some, causing long term health issues for others, etc.  On the other, the vaccine that is a form of experimental gene therapy is still on trial by scientific authorities for any long term side effects.  There's a reason why trusted vaccines take at least 10 years of vetting.  It's not antivax to have less trust for the COVID shot than the MMR shot.  Technically the FDA has less trust in the COVID shot, otherwise this shot wouldn't just have an emergency approval but a full approval.</p>

        <p>Yes to everything! I hate how people will descend like programmed vultures screaming at you or banning you if you so much as mention anything that isn't a stupid tik tok video singing the praises of a vaccine?!</p>

        <p>You are not alone.  Stay strong.  Resist, and draw strength from your resistance.  Look for options.  I won't wear a mask.  My regular dentist was all in on COVID safety theater, and wouldn't see me unless I put one on in the waiting room.  Doesn't make much sense, since they need to get inside your mouth...and I wrote that, asking them the logic, but they wouldn't relent.</p>
<p>I then filled out webforms for 8 different local dentists.  4 replied "no way" without the mask, 2 didn't reply, and 2 were happy to have the business.  I picked one, and a few days later sauntered into my new dentist, no mask, no vax, and the moron receptionist immediately told me to put on a mask.  I politely showed him the email from the office manager with the "no mask exemption" and that was that.  Have been back 3 times, no issue.  Waiting room has masked people, but nobody says anything.</p>
<p>I'm giving you this example because there is still free enterprise in this society, and competition for customers.  Call around, make clear you will only do business with stores/companies/service providers who don't enforce mask or vax mandates, and that you have money to spend, and you might be surprised.</p>
<p>Good luck, and keep the faith.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the encouragement! I'm glad you are doing this! I try to do it as well! I look in store Windows to see if they require masks or not and if they have signs up saying mask required or no service I don't go to that store. Fortunately there are a lot of stores around where I live so I do have choices. But I only go to the stores that don't require a mask. That may be changing of course but who knows. I also try to stick with small businesses because I know they are getting killed right now. I do all my shopping in mom-and-pop or family owned stores I don't go to any chains anymore! I like your strategy for finding a doctor who deserves the business!</p>
