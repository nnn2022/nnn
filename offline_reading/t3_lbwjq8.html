    <strong>Just broke ranks on the facediaper. Feels good, man.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a deep deep blue small city with effectively 100% mask compliance, even outdoors. Aside from people seated at restaurants, I have not seen a unmasked face indoors since probably April. One of my lunch spots is one of the few buildings in this city without a mask sign on the door, and the cashiers all wear those dumb half-face chin shields so I had a suspicion they didn't really care.</p>
<p>I psyched myself up, walked in like I owned the place, smiled, and ordered politely. Absolutely no comment about my naked face, so I left a $5 cash tip on a $13 meal. Went and waited patiently while playing with my phone, got my food, and left. Even had an employee ask me how the weather was outside, as if nothing was happening.</p>
<p>Despite having 0 fear of the virus, I felt my fight or flight response go into full activation, not sure if I was about to start a conflict. But as soon as I left the store, I felt relieved and psyched that my little experiment panned out. I plan to go back there regularly and keep buying my expensive lunches to build a positive relationship with the staff.</p>
<p>I'm fairly convinced that a huge fraction of the population is simply terrified to break ranks and be the first one to break the rules. I'm hoping little acts like this will embolden others to push back. Let's bring back normal, one small challenge at a time.</p></p>
