    <strong>You don't need to keep saying "I won't be forced to take the vaccine". No one is forcing you. But here's why you should have it anyway</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, no-one is forcing. No-one will force you. No-one will come to your house and inject you while you're asleep. You don't need to be angry about something that won't happen. You don't need to proclaim loudly in every post "I won't be forced to have it". News alert - you're not being forced. So, that's the end of that.</p>
<p>Society will move on. It's a very similar situation to cigarettes. In most countries, cigarettes are now socially unacceptable. You can't smoke on planes, buses, trains, workplaces, restaurants, clubs, etc. If you want to smoke at work, you normally have to go outside to a small space, far away from anyone else. That's what's likely to happen with unvaccinated people. There will be places you can't go, transport you can't use, insurance you can't get, etc. But no-one is forcing you, the same way that no-one is forcing people to stop smoking.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, now that's clear and everyone's calmer, here's why you should get the vaccine anyway.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever your age, you have a risk of Covid. It is a small risk if you're younger, but a risk nonetheless. The vaccine will reduce that risk even further. (Source: <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know</a>  and   <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/getting-a-pfizer-or-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-can-drop-your-risk-for-infection-by-91">https://www.healthline.com/health-news/getting-a-pfizer-or-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-can-drop-your-risk-for-infection-by-91</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine protects you against all known variants right now. Catching Covid protects you against that strain and you can still catch other variants.  The vaccine protects you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness. (Source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine offers longer lasting immunity than catching Covid does.  (Source: <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/marty-makary/92434">https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/marty-makary/92434</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine stops you spreading the virus if you have it but don't have symptoms. (Source: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1112">https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1112</a>)</li>
<li>People cannot shed the vaccine, and the vaccine does not make you magnetic (Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html</a>)</li>
<li>Even if you consider yourself low risk, if you don't have the vaccine, you may still get the disease and not know it, and then accidentally pass it onto others around you who are at higher risk. If you get the vaccine, you reduce that risk of spreading, and therefore, reduce the risk of infecting others. This will reduce the number of deaths and hospitalisations, and get the waiting times for other illnesses back down. At the moment, because of Covid, waiting lists are at 5 years. If people got vaccinated, it wouldn't spread, people wouldn't get ill, and hospital resources would be freed up. Vaccines save lives - not just by protecting against Covid, but also by saving the lives of cancer patients (among hundreds of other illnesses) by ensuring they get treatment quicker.  (Source: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-record-high-hospital-waiting-list-in-england-as-5-1m-need-treatment-12329156">https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-record-high-hospital-waiting-list-in-england-as-5-1m-need-treatment-12329156</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally, for those of you worried about an experimental vaccine, it might be worth knowing some facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>This explains the rigorous and detailed testing and scrutiny that the authorisation process requires. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</a></li>
<li>Every single component part of every single vaccine has been in development for years. The viral vector vaccines are the same type of vaccines that have been used for 50+ years. The mRNA vaccines have been used for other things, plus they've gone through huge amount of testing over the past decade. Recent technology advancements have improved the delivery method, which has allowed this vaccine to be made, but they absolutely did not just start making it a few weeks ago!  (Source <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly</a>)</li>
<li>All types of vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people with an incredibly small number of problems. Out of 138 million vaccines in the US, there have been 280 deaths. This is 0.000002%. These deaths are also not yet confirmed as vaccine related. It is more than possible that these are coincidental, as people die all the time, and it's obvious that some of them would have had the vaccine recently. Even so, using the highest possible number gives a tiny percentage.  (Source <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/1102-vaccine-adr-death/">https://fullfact.org/online/1102-vaccine-adr-death/</a>)</li>
<li>mRNA stays in your body for 72 hours. So, you will have the same long term effects 73 hours later than you will 10 years later. There is absolutely zero evidence whatsoever about infertility, "lumping" of spike proteins in organs (that doesn't even make medical sense), heart problems, or anything else. (Source <a href="https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18587406#:~:text=mRNA%20in%20the%20cells%20disappears,sooner%2D%2Dby%2024%20hours">https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18587406#:\~:text=mRNA%20in%20the%20cells%20disappears,sooner%2D%2Dby%2024%20hours</a>.)</li>
<li>It is absolutely worth noting that any side effects the vaccine does give you is your body's natural immune response. Sometimes, this is mild or severe, but it is the exact same response that your body would have done if you caught Covid for real. The vaccine isn't anything else other than replicating the Covid spike protein. It causes the exact same response. So, if the vaccine is responsible for any side effects, that person would have experienced those side effects from Covid anyway! The vaccine does not cause side effects that Covid would not have caused. </li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The exact combination of the vaccine ingredients plus the delivery system is new. Point 1 above mentions how individual development has been happening for a while, but it is obvious that the entire package as a whole is new.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't pose new risks.</p>
<p>Consider this comparison. Samsung build a new phone, the Galaxy S30. They have added one or two new things into it, a more powerful camera and GPS chip, for example. That exact phone would have had no long term studies, because it's new. There's no data on how it effects people 10 years in the future. It might cause cancer for all you know. But people trust it, because it's an established technology. It is the exact same with the vaccine. There have been no long term studies, but like the phone example, it does not mean that it's unsafe.</p></p>

        <p>Sure it is. The killing of thousands of children doesn't effect society? The practice itself doesn't effect society? "Not even a debate" your right,  it's not. Do some historical research.  How have societies that adopted that practice in the past fare? What happened to thier society? (Hint: They aren't around anymore). Yeah, a society that allows the death of 1/3 of its incoming population,  but that "doesn't" effect society.  Is there still contention over Roe vs Wade? 40+ years later we are still a society divided over this one practice, but that "doesn't" effect society? Idiot.</p>

        <p>Grocery store: You can't come in here without proof of vaccination </p>
<p>Free thinker: how am I supposed to buy food and feed myself?</p>
<p>Grocery store: Sir, it is entirely your choice whether not you get vaccinated but we do not allow the unvaccinated to enter. Our policy is for the greater good and safety of others.</p>
<p>.
..
...</p>
<p>Do you see the problem here? Nobody here is talking about having our doors broken down and needles shoved in our arms against our will. What will happen is that normal life will be impossible unless you get vaccinated and people will be divided into 2 tiers of society with unvaccinated being the 2nd class citizenry. If your choices are get vaccinated or starve it's not really a choice at all.</p>

        <p>There's takeout which, one, is not usually really healthy and way more expensive since you're paying extra to have someone prepare, cook and deliver your food. Then, there's growing your own food which is very time consuming and if you don't know what you're doing may end up not growing anything.</p>
<p>They could easily put these restrictions of no vax/no service on takeout and buying seeds to grow food.</p>

        <p>&rt;<strong>Makary:</strong> I was having this conversation with one of my colleagues who does a lot of immunology research. And I asked the question -- I like to put big questions out there to have a discussion -- and the question was, do you think natural immunity or vaccinated immunity is stronger, and which one's more durable, two different domains. And I'd love your thoughts on that. <em>But one interesting thing he said was he thought that maybe natural immunity, if you really get sick and you've got to mount a big antibody response, may be better because your body is developing antibodies and memory to all of the surface of the virus, not just the spike protein, and that may be better immune protection.</em>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Racaniello:</strong> I think it's an interesting question and there's no one answer because every virus is slightly different. [...] And we don't know enough yet. So I think if people are making a blanket statement that natural infection is always better, that's not always correct. It really depends on the virus. </p>
<p>And so you would say that "The vaccine offers longer lasting immunity than catching Covid does" is a good summary of that exchange?</p>

        <p>I would say that it's an excellent summary, and so are the other paragraphs, that people get different "viral loads" so each individual cannot be sure if they have immunity. They could have a small viral load so no immunity formed. They could have had a huge viral load that overwhelmed their system and left no lasting immunity.</p>
<p>People who have had Covid cannot tell what immunity they've got.</p>
<p>The vaccine is the only way to be confident about your immunity levels</p>

        <p>You think you have the perfect argument, but it's based on the assumption that paternalism and technology are the lord and savior. Health is not one-size fits all. That kind of thinking doesn't apply to how people on this sub think and it's not sustainable. It's actually dying, which is why all this false logic and cringey big pharma campaigns come off so desperate. Good luck</p>

        <p>Question for OP since he has all the answers:</p>
<p>The goal of the vaccine is to reduce COVID symptoms/make you asymptomatic, correct? So the theory is that if you are vaccinated you are less likely to develop symptoms, thus will have a lower viral load, thus will transmit less virus to others right? </p>
<p>So let's say two people are standing right next to each other and both get a nice dose of virus straight to the face.  One person is vaxxd and the other person is not.  Both people end up being asymptomatic.  So in this scenario, how exactly is the unvaxxd person any more of a threat than the vaxxd person?  They're both asymptomatic meaning they both have low viral load meaning they both have the same rate of transmission.  Care to clarify why unvaxxd guy is a threat but vaxxd guy is not?</p>

        <p>In your scenario, the vaccinated person is much less likely to get infected, so they probably won't even be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>There is also a much bigger chance of the unvaccinated person getting infected and getting symptoms, potentially leading to their hospitalisation and death, or long term illness, or increasing the chances of them spreading it around.</p>
<p>That's the clear difference between vaccinated and not.</p>

        <p>&rt;There is also a much bigger chance of the unvaccinated person getting infected and getting symptoms, </p>
<p>What are the actual numbers here?</p>
<p>Because these descriptions get thrown around a lot - "big chance", "bigger chance", "small chance", "great risk", etc.  Sometimes they are even talking about numbers that are actually less than 1.0%!</p>
<p>&rt;That's the clear difference between vaccinated and not.</p>
<p>So what is "a much bigger chance" in actual numbers?</p>

        <p>Numbers at this level are difficult to paint the right picture.</p>
<p>If someone said 1%, you'd say "that's very small". But we're talking about huge numbers. In the US alone, there's been 150 million vaccinations. 1% of that group is still 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>Even 0.1% is still 150,000 people.</p>
<p>So at these volumes, percentages sound small but still have a huge impact</p>

        <p>Please define what you mean by "infected".  Infected by the virus or not developing COVID19 from the virus?</p>
<p>My scenario clearly states: "Both people end up being asymptomatic. "  Now explain to me how if both people are asymptomatic how the unvaxxd person is more of a threat.  And please back it up with sources of scientific data and not what CNN is telling you.  Thanks for providing this info!</p>

        <p>Oh yeah your scenario was nonsense and very unlikely to happen. My point is that the vaccinated person is less likely to be asymptomatic because they are less likely to get infected. So the unvaccinated person will catch it and spread it around</p>

        <p>How is my scenario nonsense?  It's been estimated a large % of population had asymptomatic infection before vaccines were available.   Therefore my scenario is quite likely that a person without the vaccine could be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>". My point is that the vaccinated person is less likely to be asymptomatic because they are less likely to get infected. So the unvaccinated person will catch it and spread it around"</p>
<p>Less likely to get infected with with what the virus or the disease?  How do you know this do you have a source with this data?</p>
