    <strong>What’s with all the mask assumptions?</strong>
    <p><p>Every troll that comes to this subreddit comes to argue masks. The explanation of this subreddit is about the skepticism and the resistance to the new normal. On top of that, I’d say only about 20% of the posts on here are about masks. The majority are about the lockdowns, arbitrary laws, government overreach, fishy vaccination stories, and law enforcement harassment. I’m guessing it is because masks are the only things they can really argue? Even though I’ve yet to hear a decent argument from them. It’s mostly “You guys are stupid! You killed my dad! Wear the mask or else!”</p></p>

        <p>their life sucks so much ass that they gotta tell everyone else to also stay home, stay “safe” and mask up because it’s within their comfort zone. These people probably don’t get out much outside of a pandemic let’s be honest</p>

        <p>Simple. They think masks are the only thing that can prevent covid and lockdowns. So when they see people against lockdowns, they want to remind us that masks will fix everything. Masks stop covid. No covid equals no lockdowns. It's comical.</p>

        <p>It's because they keep themselves "informed" by watching the "news". All protests that are aired are portrayed as "anti mask" protests, like that's what this is all about</p>

        <p>Because there is facts showing masks significantly reduces the spread I agree with the vaccine being weird I’m waiting for more research but we have enough research on the masks to show they help like doctors wear them when doing surgery so bad, potentially deadly bacteria don’t go into the patient’s body or go into the doctors lungs</p>

        <p>Lol you really still don’t get it. No I don’t want to talk about why masks may or may not be good. I think, when used properly, masks do work. Again, this sub is not about whether they work, it’s about pushing back against rights violations and the normalization of it all</p>

        <p>I really doubt we will be wearing masks for more than a year or two depends on how long it takes to find a working vaccine who knows this one might be the the vaccine that stops it  and I think if they said that they just meant for now this is the normal until it’s slowed down alot</p>

        <p>Haha that’s what they told us 11 months ago! “Two weeks to flatten the curve.” And again, idk why you are so fixated on masks. It’s about the economy and unconstitutional actions by government officials. Those are way more important than masks. Those are the “new normals” that I’m worried about.</p>

        <p>The problem is that you are operating under the assumption that Covid is catastrophic. We are all here because we believe it has been blown out of proportion by the media to fear-monger us. Now, before you start yelling “ Two million worldwide deaths is a big deal! We need to shut people inside to save their lives! Screw the economy, it’s just money. Lives are at stake!” Consider this. The World health organization estimates that 40-50 million abortions are performed worldwide each year. Now if you are a super liberal you’ll say “well those aren’t really lives so screw them.” But also consider this. The U.N. Estimates that 9 million people worldwide die from hunger each year. Hunger affects all of us. Nearly 700,000 human beings died of AIDS in 2019. In 2016, 1.6 million people died from diabetes. In not a single one of those years did we: shut down economies, lock people inside, deem people inessential, restrict travel, close borders, or give people checks that ran up national debt. The media didn’t fawn over the deaths of those that are hungry, or those aborted babies. In fact, the media praises the murder under the guise of basic human rights. Where are the daily reports of “X number of people died of hunger today and anther X number we’re hospitalized for malnutrition?” Why is it that all of these deaths are thrown away, when they constitute .73% of the world population, yet Covid deaths get all of this attention and constitute .03%? Even if we did nothing. Even if we let the disease run it’s course and kill however many it would kill, the WHO estimates are still under 40 million worldwide deaths. And that’s not just over the course of one year, it is over the course of the Virus until each and every person on the planet has gained herd immunity. So why is it so important to save the lives of some 2 million people per year while ignoring some 50+ million deaths?</p>

        <p>I’m not a super liberal lmao I don’t have a side they’re both kinda dumb or at least the people make it dumb but the reason why this is being viewed as a big deal is because how fast it took over nobody cares about people who die of hunger because it doesn’t directly affect them and when I say nobody I mean people of power and and the coronavirus if we treated it as not a big deal would have taken a lot more lives a worldwide virus could wipe everything out if not taken seriously but people getting abortions because they can’t afford a baby or just aren’t ready for one yet won’t wipe everyone and like aids or herpes we have protection against those and but they’re always people who will get it and die you can’t just say this thing and that thing kill more people yearly because it’s not the same thing compare it to other pandemics and when you do that it’s on track to be one of the most deadly if not taken under control</p>

        <p>As we agree. The response to this flu like virus is selfish when compared to, say, worldwide hunger responses (or lack thereof) because it doesn’t threaten them personally. Well idk about you but I think it’s pretty hypocritical for governments to state that “ever life matter” while a significant portion of the population is dying and there is no mention of it</p>
