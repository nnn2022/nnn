    <strong>Peer-Reviewed Paper: C19 May Have Started To Spread in Oct 2019 (Seriously, Does Anyone Even Care!?)</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: Not that it matters when the pseudovaxxes are being foisted upon the entire human population, but the experts want to distract us with more evidence that the disease was circulating prior to Dec 2019. What a big yawn. So what!?!?!? It's not like it changes the fact that it was a bioweapon and that we should reject C19 vaxxes.   </p>

<p>&rt;Abstract<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Questions persist as to the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence is building that its origin as a zoonotic spillover occurred prior to the officially accepted timing of early December, 2019. Here we provide novel methods to date the origin of COVID-19 cases. We show that six countries had exceptionally early cases, unlikely to represent part of their main case series. The model suggests a likely timing of the first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17 (95% CI October 4). Origination dates are discussed for the first five countries outside China and each continent. Results infer that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in early October to mid-November, and by January, had spread globally. This suggests an earlier and more rapid timeline of spread. Our study provides new approaches for estimating dates of the arrival of infectious diseases based on small samples that can be applied to many epidemiological situations</p></p>

        <p>Who - after 18 months of unending lies, contradictions, debasement of science, censorship and flip-flops - believes ANYTHING that the ExPeRtZ say about the disease? We've ALWAYS known that China was lying from Day 1. A paper saying that the disease was spreading 2 months earlier than reported by the CCP shouldn't change the opinion of anyone who's been sceptical of the narrative.</p>
<p>Do you really think that the world will hold China accountable?</p>

        <p>Depends, anecdotes aren't evidence admissible in court. Science done properly is. That's all my point is.</p>
<p>And yeah, I'm not sure how believing those in charge (I never believed them, even before the 'pandemic') is possible for most people now.</p>

        <p>I don't get your logic. The disease was spreading in November 2019 in US. According to your logic, American was lying from November 2019?</p>

        <p>How would we know COVID began in Wuhan or even in China if this is the case?</p>
<p>I suspect the COVID might have actually been created at some Pfizer/Moderna/Rockefeller lab  that could be located almost anywhere in the world. Maybe the Rockefellers ordered the virus to be "discovered" in Wuhan (after it had spread to almost every corner of the world) just so that people would frame the WIV for COVID.</p>
