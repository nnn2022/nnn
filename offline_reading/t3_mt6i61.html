    <strong>Question</strong>
    <p><p>Is there going to be some sort of war that happens because of this? It seems like at this point a Civil War is inevitable. Maybe even something bigger then a civil war.  </p>
<p>I am deeply concerned.</p></p>

        <p>I wish, not for the violence or opportunists, but for this would be the only way to change the system, to dethrone the evil that heads our planet. </p>
<p>What’s happening is just like what the nazis did, they convince the people that Jews are the enemy, the neighbours snitch on eachother within the community, and quietly people who are in opposition to the government will just “disappear”. </p>
<p>Have your friends over during lockdown? Straight to jail, coming from abroad, even if you’re a citizen? Straight to covid “hotel” for “testing”. </p>
<p>The fines and abuse people are taking from cops and law makers are going to result in a weakened community, they have sown division amongst us, and in some cases we have seen violence erupt among citizens. War? I doubt that will happen, because at every juncture the covid cops will be there to take in those who resist, and the medics will be there for those that are compliant. </p>
<p>Slowly the system we helped build, fund, and educate, will be turned against all of us until there just won’t be a place where we fit in. </p>
<p>In China, for example, there are people with low “social scores” that literally have to essentially be exiled from the community because they can’t get housing, won’t be served at some places, won’t be given the same opportunities as others. </p>
<p>That’s all coming soon to a North America, Europe or Australia near you. </p>
<p>They don’t need to have us fighting in the streets either, even though it happens. the digital age will sign your fate. Don’t comply, don’t get the vaccine passport, don’t show that you’re pro mask, pro fauci, pro Biden, pro cnn, then you are categorized into the “at risk person” folder, and once you’re there, increased surveillance is on you, new bs laws and restrictions are being made up on the fly, if you’re under surveillance by a corrupt militia, government, “justice system” where these new laws can be made up whenever, and enforced however, and whoever’s discretion, it’s only a matter of when, where, and how they want to get rid of you, the problem. </p>
<p>So if you are a rebel, a free thinker, enjoy these days while you can because it’s only going to get worse from here on out. Your family, those you thought were your friends. They will all turn on you to live the easy life the government is peddling.</p>

        <p>I think the pro lockdown side is too weak to fight themselves. They'll be expecting the government to fight for them. Where this becomes a problem is if other country's military gets involved. And you know how they love to do that shit.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State. </p>
