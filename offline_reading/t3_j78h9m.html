<title>Uh, what? Are they trying to claim that covid increases stillbirth or is this a very subtle admission or guilt that a lacking of staff owing to assisting the 98 year old is linked to a increase of stillbirths?</title>

        <p>The stress from lockdowns and the economic toll of social distancing could possibly wipe out a generation of children. This will no doubt be whitewashed.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18485167/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18485167/</a></p>
<p>&rt; Compared with women with an intermediate level of psychological stress  during pregnancy, women with a high level of stress had 80% increased  risk of stillbirth (relative risk = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.2). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/covid-19-threatens-undo-decade-progress-women-childrens-health/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/covid-19-threatens-undo-decade-progress-women-childrens-health/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Around 118 <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/11/coronavirus-will-worsen-inequality-years-come-imf-warns/">low- and middle income countries</a> have  reported more than 1.1 million additional child deaths and an  additional 56,700 maternal deaths due to a reduction of essential  maternal and child-health interventions since the coronavirus crisis  began.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There has also been a surge in reports of abuse directed at girls and  women, with an additional 31 million cases of gender-based violence  documented over the six months of lockdowns.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Reversals in learning outcomes due to school closures have already  affected 1.6 billion children, and an additional 150 million additional  children have been plunged into poverty by the far-reaching  socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; "There is no doubt that the pandemic has set back global efforts to  improve the health and well-being of women and children, but that should  only serve to strengthen our resolve," said Dr Tedros Adhanom  Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/pandemic-set-global-development-back-25-years-just-25-weeks/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/pandemic-set-global-development-back-25-years-just-25-weeks/</a></p>
<p>&rt; But the report stresses that the widest-ranging catastrophe has been  economic, with every country taking a hit regardless of the actual  spread of the virus and the sums of money involved “impossible to  fathom”. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In terms of lost global gross domestic product (GDP), the world is  currently experiencing the worst recession since the end of the Second  World War - “when war production stopped in an instant, one entire  continent and parts of another were destroyed, and  three per cent of  the world’s pre-war population was dead”. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The last time this many countries were simultaneously in recession,  the report notes, was in 1870 - “literally two lifetimes ago”. The  impact on individuals has been colossal: extreme poverty has risen by  seven per cent in just a few months, with 37 million people now living  on less than $1.90 a day. </p>
