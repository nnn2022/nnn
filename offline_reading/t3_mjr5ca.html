        <p>This is what actual fear looks like, not wearing a mask to help protect ourselves and our neighbors. We have to learn to control our paranoia, even during this frightening time where millions have died in the span of a year. Could the dystopian outcomes he predicts happen? Sure, anything can happen. Will they? No, probably not. Each of us should do our part and we will get through this together. Do not let the black hole of skepticism become cynicism become nihilism.</p>

        <p>That's no more fear-mongering than when surgeon's wear masks to prevent infections. It's basic science that has been in practice for over a century. Just because you don't know why something is fact, doesn't mean it's fear-mongering.</p>

        <p>Except the evidence for wearing masks by the general public before the pandemic was very weak.</p>
<p>In general most professionals and health agencies didn't think they worked</p>
<p>&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946â€“July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>The evidence for mask wearing since the start of the pandemic has not improved, no matter how much it's been repeated.</p>
<p>Coming together would have been continuing with normal society while trying to protect the vulnerable as best we could. Not doing the unprecedented action of shutting down large portions of a complex interconnected world economy and damaging opportunities and the lives of the next generation for years to come. Lost production + massive debt accrued will need to be paid for and we selfishly put that burden on the future.</p>
<p>And then the same people that advocate for these society destroying actions want to cover it up with masks which have a really weak scientific basis. So now they can point at people and blame them for not wearing their masks.</p>

        <p>Or, people are doing the best they can in an unprecedented situation. No need to see conspiracy here or project a dystopian future. Itâ€™s very easy to play armchair world leader and decide what would have been the better course of action, especially when real lives arenâ€™t at stake. Safe too, since nobody can criticize your untested hypothetical solutions. Look, I donâ€™t think everything is roses and Iâ€™m sure mistakes have been made, but all this conspiracy-based nonsense is getting out of hand. People like the guy in the video sounding so sure about things they know fuck-all about.</p>

        <p>But it's not an unprecedented situation. Humanity has had pandemics in the past, much worse than this and it never shut down. Why did we have to shut down? On what scientific + economic  basis did we shut down?</p>
<p>It was political and ironically Johns Hopkins wrote about it in a pandemic planning report for the WHO just a few months before the start of rhe pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;During an emergency, it should be expected that implementation of some NPIs, such as travel restrictions and quarantine, might be pursued for social or political purposes by political leaders, rather than pursued because of public health evidence.</p>
<p>&rt;"It is important to communicate to political leaders the absence of evidence surrounding many NPI interventions and the adverse consequences that may follow them."</p>
<p>&rt;.. there is a broad lack of evidence of efficacy and a lack of understanding about secondary adverse impacts.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownCriticalLeft/comments/m67mdl/during_an_emergency_it_should_be_expected_that/</p>
<p>But mass hysteria followed and we didn't pay attention to the scientific literature.</p>
<p>Where is the conspiracy here? What are you talking about? This is just governments trying to take advantage of a crisis like they always do for more control over their population. Like the homeland security bill after 9/11 - mass surveillance more control.</p>

        <p>No, this is the world trying to use itâ€™s technology and scientific knowledge to combat a deadly virus. I donâ€™t know the full history of pandemics. If they didnâ€™t lockdown in the past it was probably because it wasnâ€™t feasible in those times, no scientific understanding of the benefits + lack of mass communication to make it possible on a wide scale. The conspiracy is all over this subreddit and particularly in this video, which is why I posted. The sad thing is itâ€™s been so normalized you likely donâ€™t even recognize it as conspiracy and just accept it as reality. I am not ignorant to the fact that those in power donâ€™t like to let go of power. I do know that much history. That is why we should hold them accountable. But to project abuse of power when there is no real evidence, as these conspiracy theorists do, is fear-mongering plain and simple, and can only serve to distract and divide us at a time we should be unified.</p>

        <p>No it wasn't feasible due to the monetary system. Now we can shut down and pretend that lost production doesn't matter because we can dump trillions in stimulus on society. But someone needs to pay for that. And we are forcing our economic pain and hardship on the kids and future generation. Its a backwards society. A healthy society builds for the future, we are stealing from it.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't know the full history of pandemics</p>
<p>It seems there is a lot you don't know but take everything for granted. Likely you are in a privileged position and are unaffected by the lockdowns so you don't care how they affect the working class or how they have indirectly affected countries down the supply chain in the 3rd world.</p>
<p>What conspiracy? Please tell me? He is saying the vaccine passports are not about vaccines.  I don't believe they are. Like the mass surveillance of US citizens was not simply about finding terrorists.</p>
<p>I think its a shame how ignorant most americans are about government, history and monetary policy.</p>
<p>You are unwilling to stand up for anything, call any skepticism about government actions conspiracy theories because you don't understand how governments work to seek more control over their people.</p>

        <p>If the data that covid has a survival rate of 99.8%, and the other data showing how lockdown measures and mask mandates do nothing aren't enough for you, you're deluding yourself. Do you really think they want the best for you? After 1 year of locking you down and turning you against your fellow man. Look at HISTORY. Those who don't know it are doomed to repeat it. Don't be fooled into thinking we're better now. The evil that existed 100 years ago exists today.</p>

        <p>I know these are hard times, but stop being afraid of what <em>could</em> happen. Stop being cynical. The lockdowns and masks are for the benefit of everyone, especially the vulnerable among us. It's not just about you and your demographic's percentage of survival. Even if you are safe you can spread it to those who aren't safe. This is an unprecedented situation in our lifetime, but not in history. The difference is this time we have the technology and scientific understanding to fight the virus more effectively. This fear-mongering from the video doesn't help. It hurts. There's a time for skepticism, but this is not that time. This is the time to band together, and that includes governments and corporations around the world. Those systems are corrupt, I don't deny that, but they also have the capacity to do good. And they are doing good, from all the evidence we have.</p>

        <p>Nobody said the pandemic wasn't a horrible world-changing event. You're forgetting this virus killed over 3 million people last year, and that was with all our mitigation efforts, lockdowns, mask protocols, social distancing, therapeutics, and now the vaccine. We do what we have to do to survive. Like I said to another poster, it's easy to play armchair world leader, when real lives aren't at stake and nobody can question your hypothetical solutions.</p>

        <p>It's not the pandemic causing the problems, it's the misguided "mitigation" efforts. Most of what was done was pointless and people would have died nonetheless. Lockdowns saved nobody, yet they are killing millions.</p>
<p>Schools should have never been closed. Universities should have never locked students. Travel should not have been suspended. Curfews, bans on outdoor activities, and a large number of similar measures never made any sense, were never proven to have any positive effect, and only served to infringe on citizens' freedom and increase further economic collapse.</p>
<p>The leaders who made those decisions should have put them to a referendum, not usurp power that they were never wilfully granted.</p>

        <p>You're in denial because you are guilty as the rest of you laptop class cowards. You have blood on your hands.</p>
<p>&rt;All children, of all ages, and in all countries, are being affected, in particular by the socio-economic impacts and, in some cases, by <strong>mitigation measures that may inadvertently do more harm than good.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Schools for more than 168 million children globally have been completely closed for almost an entire year due to COVID-19 lockdowns, as of March 2020.</p>
<p>&rt;Today, more vulnerable children are becoming malnourished due to the deteriorating quality of their diets and the multiple shocks created by the pandemic <strong>and its containment measures. Efforts to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 are disrupting food systems, upending health and nutrition services, devastating livelihoods, and threatening food security</strong>.</p>
<p>&rt;More than 94 million children are at risk of missing measles vaccines <strong>because of paused measles campaigns in 26 countries due to efforts to control COVID-19</strong> (as of November 2020), threatening to exacerbate ongoing measles outbreaks.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Lockdowns measures can expose children to a range of risks</strong>. Several factors related to confinement measures are likely to result in heightened tensions in the household, added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods, and social isolation. These are well known risk factors for violence at home.</p>
<p>&rt;Thus, <strong>school closures</strong> such as those triggered by COVID-19 may, in effect, push girls towards marriage since school is no longer an option.</p>
<p>This is just from Unicef.</p>

        <p>Death is a part of life. 3 out of 130 aka 2%. You wanna shut down everything for 2%? You're a fucking psycho. Even if it was more, if you're scared stay your ass home. Don't demand shit from other people. Plus these death counts are all bullshit. If you die with it within 28 days no matter the cause, it counts as a covid death. The masks and lockdowns have been proven to be nothing but theater. I'm sure those bandanas are stopping the spread...</p>

        <p>I will never look back with shame considering there are plenty more suffering than the 2% who died "of covid". Open your eyes and maybe you will see you're being fooled.</p>

        <p>How am I being fooled? People have died and others are suffering. It is a global pandemic, these are the realities and everyone is working to get past it, except for people like the guy in this video. They see conspiracy in everything and distract from the real problems, dividing us when we ought to be united against the virus.</p>

        <p>A 'pandemic' with a 2% (inflated) death rate. You do realize that overall death numbers have been pretty flat over the past few years right? You also obviously didn't care about flu deaths in the past. Why is that? It's not a pandemic. If it was a real pandemic, we wouldn't be having this debate. We'd all be scared for ourselves. Without you or the media telling us to be.</p>

        <p>No.  It's the opposite. Millions will die due to the lockdowns in the coming years.  It's not that the deaths were acceptable, its that it would have been the least bad result.  But our immature society that only thinks of the now, and went completely irrational was unable to consider the results of our actions. There is a reason why in no previous pandemic the world shut down on such a massive scale. Because production needs to keep moving for people to eat and live.</p>
<p>Shutting down society to try to save mainly people at the end of their lives is and was ridiculous.  The young amd next generation will have the burden of our selfish foolishess.</p>
