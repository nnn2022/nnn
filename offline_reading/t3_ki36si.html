        <p>&rt; We the people have consented.</p>
<p>Here's a great comment I read on another site. It's specifically about the election and the media, but it also talks A LOT about the lack of rebellion = our consent.</p>
<p>Quote follows, enjoy:</p>
<p>"John Locke's Second Treatise on Government, written in 1689, can be summarized with the following:</p>
<p>Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.</p>
<p>In this case, is the government an impartial judge, as it is choosing to not even evaluate potential wrongdoing of other parts of the government?</p>
<p>A further comment on the social contract comes from Philip Petit's Republicanism from 1997, where <strong>he argues the theory of social contract, classically based on the consent of the governed, should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be manufactured, Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are in an age where modern media allows consent to be manufactured to an unprecedented degree. And not just because major news media outlets all agree to present stories a certain way, but a modern means of peer-to-peer information sharing - social media - is blatantly preventing certain information from being shared in order to maintain a preferred narrative. For that reason, it is impossible for the average person to take the pulse of the masses...does the media's promoted narrative really reflect the will of the people? Or is the information that is suppressed the will of the people?</strong></p>
<p>One thing we know is that our elections do not indicate the will of the people, either because closed-source counting machines like Dominion are used, or because we have video of poll workers stashing ballots and counting them unobserved. Election officials and judges that deny such action took place or are suspicious only help to manufacture consent and further delegitimize the government's official means for determining the will of the people.</p>
<p>I'll close with one final point. I know that the UN is widely derided, and with good reason. But back in 1948, with the help of Eleanor Roosevelt, it created a "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," a document that builds upon the principles of the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution. Part of the document states,</p>
<p>"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."</p>
<p>We all have a right to free and fair elections. Lack of such elections means the government has no authority. <strong>The media-government entertainment complex is extremely heavy-handed in its manufacture of consent</strong> for this election. <strong>In a civil society with an effective social contract, it would be possible to object to this manufactured consent</strong> and get appropriate redress for an election cycle that makes the government illegitimate. <strong>We have a right to do so. But those running the media-government entertainment complex and their useful idiots have broken the social contract by not permitting any dissent.</strong></p>
<p><em>What constitutes an "effective rebellion" to this sort of social breach?"</em></p>

<p>If grandma wants you to test before coming, that's her choice in requirements. I'm betting though that the op is restricted by their government, which is bs imo. It only lasts as long as the sheeple allow it.</p>

And I think there is a very big chance that I won't be able to fly once the vaccine is rolled out, so I'm taking my chance now.

        <p>I completely understand doing stuff you don't want to do under duress. Sometimes it can't be helped. At least when it comes to self preservation, bending a bit to preserve your life or livelihood is just a reality of life sometimes.</p>
<p>But you should understand that it's not just simply about "30 seconds of discomfort" same as it's not "just a mask". It's about not wanting to do something you deem to be stupid, unnecessary, immoral or uncomfortable but doing it anyways because someone with more might tells you to. As long as you're not doing these decisions lightly, it's understandable. Because this is a spiritual war we are in. If we keep giving them what they want every time they ask for it, we will surely lose in the long run.</p>
<p>I'm kinda tired when writing this so I don't blame you if my point doesn't come across that well.</p>

        <p>You're right - I was over simplifying. My brother isn't vaccinating their family either, so I just really worry that I won't be able to see my nephews for years if they mandate a vaccine to fly. I'm not getting the vaccine no matter what, so I'll comply with this once or twice so I can see them. Not a lot of people I would do it for tbh, but I'll do it for them.</p>

        <p>I don't live where you do, so I don't have to bend over for the government like you do. Even then, if you don't fight back and create a better future where they aren't slaves to political whims, then maybe you don't love them as much as you think.</p>
<p>I'll bet that you missing seeing them because you fought for there rights would raise their respect for you, and love you all the more. I'll also bet that if more people did that in Australia, the government would be forced to back down.</p>
<p>But what do I know. I'm a dumb yank who was raised on the belief in basic rights the government can't take away.</p>

        <p>You sure you dont live where I do? I flew from California to Hawaii. You can't fly without a test. </p>
<p>My nephews are 5. They just want to see their auntie. Me "protesting" by choosing not to fly does absolutely nothing. They don't care if we get shut out of society - That's literally the goal. People need to be speaking out about it and fighting whatever they can. But staying home and having a depressing Christmas on zoom sounds fucking awful and I'm not doing it. It's pointless.</p>
