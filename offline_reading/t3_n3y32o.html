    <strong>Why are we not fully reopen??</strong>
    <p><p>Do you remember when they claimed life will be back to normal, oh, once we have the vaccines?</p>
<p>Now the elderly and vulnerable population is largely vaccinated (talking mostly about US/UK/EU). The hospitals are far from being overwhelmed. It's spring and we know from last year (and historically) that the virus is seasonal. Cases and deaths are low across the board. Borders are restricted. And again... the majority of the vulnerable are vaccinated so there is no risk to overwhelm the hospitals!</p>
<p>So why the **** are we not fully reopen? Why do restaurants have to wait until June to open indoors and still with some restrictions? Why are there still any curfews at all? Why are we still putting masks on our children? Why can't we have a proper funeral? Why do we have to keep getting tested at every turn? Why is the vaccine pushed on everybody? What excuse is there to keep this charade going?? People are vaccinated, and things are far from normal. This is a never-ending war on coronaviruses. As long as we aim for zero-covid as a society we will never get our liberties and humanity back.</p>

        <p>I don't get it. I don't want the vaccines, but why aren't the vaccinated living normally now? What was the use of risking your life with that crap if it didn't even get you your life back? I guess they don't work or something.</p>

        <p>glad to hear that. Nothing like that is happening here. I've gone out to stores and a few places too, I am high risk but decided to do a few things. No one is talking to people without masks. All groups are shut down. I think about posting ads for friends like people do for dates. LOL</p>

        <p>I even went to my sister's graduation in a party town in the United States I never expected anyone there to actually play by the rules it's a college town everyone's young and having sex that's not gonna stop happening OK so I don't find it fair that people complain about that stuff yes I get it are they doing the morally right thing at I don't know but it's a college town people are still going to want to have fun it's been a year into half the USD Pharmaceutical industry is so strong and developed what it does I knew that the vaccines were gonna come out within a year anyways people keep screaming it's been developed so fast every vaccine can be developed this fast even if it's an MR and a vaccine we've never had to do it before that's the only reason it never comes out this fast</p>

        <p>This has been developed a lot faster, and it does not work like your regular vaccines. All I know is when I looked up mRNA is it FAILED for other diseases and it also brought horrific side effects in all the animal studies, and I saw no evidence of changes.</p>

        <p>I would hope it was developed faster what the fuck else are they charging $1000 for a band-aid at a hospital for that money better be at least going to our pharmaceutical research industry which is. We nailed down a variant not that there was much of a choice since we already know it was one coronavirus causing this disease not like the flu which every year The dme ologist have to guess which flu strain is most likely to be the most severe in prevalent and then they make the vaccine for that that is why sometimes the flu shot only works about 30% since what is in it might only be one out of 3 of the various flu strains floating around that year. As we advanced scientifically there will always be an increased risk of side effects severe or not the more direct we get with the human body whether that is MRNA vaccines genetic augmentation whatever it may be there will be the potential for more severe side effects since we are moving past the point of "on" simpler medicine and entering an era of advancement in science. What that means is the potential for great things to happen equally correlates to the potential for bad things to happen that is how science works there is no going around it the deeper we get an understanding of the human body and how to manipulate it the worst off things can potentially get.  However I do not understand people screaming about how the vaccine can change you or do this in that there are much better ways to do that if you are not authoritarian government. Food goes into the digestive system changing the gut microbiome water pretty much everything except a vaccine is better off at doing the things these people are scared of. Complaining about a vaccine giving you autism while simultaneously drinking tapwater in eating various types of garbage day in and day out… nonsensical.</p>

        <p>My guess is because they damned well know they are going to cause an Escape variant, that utterly obliterates the Vaxx and people who have gotten it.</p>
<p>I think they well know that 20% of the Vaxxed people are at huge risk.</p>
<p>Kind of like showing up to a firefight, ya wanna be early to set up for the hail of bullets, or be there after to ensure its over, never wanna walk in during the middle of it your survival chances dwindle dramatically.</p>
