    <strong>People are stupid and I’m sick of it</strong>
    <p><p>Well let me just say that i took COVID more seriously than anyone when I’ve first heard of it on Asian news. I was in US and at the time CDC was saying that everything was fine and there was low chance of covid landing on US soil. Then the announcement came that the first of the infected were diagnosed in Washington state. They were still recommending that only people near Covid patients wear masks. I wore mask and obtained as many n-95 supplies as i could despite no one else wearing it and making fun of me for doing so. Fast forward a few months everything shut down and the nation is in the state of panic. For the first year, i diligently wore mask and was vigilant about maintaining social distancing from people. However after being homeless for 2-3 years i realized something. I can’t do shit about it. I’ve long since ran out of mask and have been exposed to all kinds of gutter flith on the streets as homeless, NYC out of all places. Fully expecting myself to have been screwed, I’ve went to test myself multiple times to which all of it came out negative. </p>
<p>Here is my conclusion. There is no difference for me whether i get vaccinated for covid or not. But im not anti-vax. Matter of fact ive been getting tetanus shots and rabies shots voluntarily for my own health. What i dont buy is that out of all the risks ive been exposed to in my life covid is one of my least concerns. People ask me if ive been vaccinated. When i say no they go into a rant about how it is for my safety and other safety. Bullshit. No one gave a fuck about my safety when i was exposed to snowstroms or wqs starving or were getting assaulted. Now they suddenly care? And if i learned anything about illnesses, other contagious diseases such as flu have been around for ages and now theyre suddenly concerned about a single new variant when other diseases have had multiple strings of variants. Im not gonna take an undertested vaccine over a hyped disease that was said to be so contagious but have yet to show a high mortaility rate.</p></p>

        <p>Obviously I'm against the MRNA technology for various reasons.</p>
<p>I'll get a flu shot once in awhile because it's ethically made.</p>
<p>But I've had a personal conviction for a very long time about not participating in anything that involves using or testing on aborted fetal tissue.</p>

        <p>I’ve learn to not talk to people that aren’t open minded as you’ll always loose. You’ve made some very valid points. A hell of a lot about covid doesn’t make no sense at all.</p>

        <p>This is the real testimony. Virtue signalers everywhere. I guess they forgot their horrid behavior before masks. I have these people in my family. They can screech all they want. I’ve blocked them. I’m sorry you’ve had to go thru all that.</p>
