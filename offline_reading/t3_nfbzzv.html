    <strong>Natural immunity. I thought this needed its own post. Critics welcome. Will edit as needed.</strong>
    <p><p>The following very understated, self-explanatory comment is from a CDC document entitled, “Questions &amp; Answers: Vaccine Against 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus”:</p>
<p>“If you have had 2009 H1N1 flu, as confirmed by an RT-PCR test, you should have some immunity against 2009 H1N1 flu and CAN CHOOSE NOT (emphasis added) to get the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.” [1] </p>
<p>Fast forward just over a decade later, and after intensive investigation for the past 16-months, both laboratory and real world clinical data demonstrate convalescent, unvaccinated covid-19 immunity is just as robust as vaccine-acquired covid-19 immunity. Indeed multiple laboratory studies conducted by highly respected U.S. and European academic research groups have reported that convalescent mildly or severely infected SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) patients, who are unvaccinated, can have greater virus neutralizing immunity—especially more versatile, long-enduring T-cell immunity—relative to vaccinated individuals who were never infected [2,3,4,5,6,7]. An enormous real world Israeli national follow-up study of ~6.4 million individuals, demonstrated clearly that naturally-acquired covid-19 convalescence immunity was equivalent to vaccine-acquired immunity in preventing covid-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality. Faring at least as well as those vaccinated, 187,549 unvaccinated covid-19 positive persons who tested positive between June 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, and were followed through March 20, 2021, revealed 894 (0.48%) were reinfected; 38 (0.02%) were hospitalized, a mere 16 (0.008%) hospitalized with severe disease, and only 1 (one)/187,549 died—an individual over 80 years old. [8]. The Israeli investigators concluded, “Our results question the need to vaccinate previously infected individuals” [8].</p>
<p>Pooled with vaccine-acquired immunity, i.e., unvaccinated with natural immunity, plus vaccinated, Rhode Island has achieved de facto herd immunity [9] in terms of clinical covid-19 disease: covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths are at low background rates [10] consistent with a very manageable endemic disease, like seasonal influenza. [11,12] Moreover, and concordant with these reassuring data, while ~90% of Rhode Island’s covid-19 mortality has accrued among those 65+ years old, as of Friday, May 14. 2021, 92.4% of that age group had been partially vaccinated, and 86.1% fully vaccinated, against covid-19 [10]</p>
<p>Epidemic spread of covid-19, like all other respiratory viruses, again notably influenza [13], is driven by symptomatic persons; asymptomatic spread is trivial, and inconsequential: a meta-analysis of contact tracing studies published in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed asymptomatic covid-19 spread was 0.7% [14]. Accordingly, a rational, ethical true prevention model alternative to “vaccine passports” would be simple notifications, as part of formal policies, by public agencies and businesses that persons with active symptomatic, febrile (feverish) respiratory illnesses stay home from work, and refrain from patronizing businesses.</p>

        <p>You can post a thousand references based on the Disney science of virology, but natural "immunity" is nothing more then eating healthy, hydrating well, sleeping well, getting fresh air, clothing appropriately for the environment, keeping stress and fear out of your life, avoiding toxins in general, and detox. </p>
<p>Ey voila. The cure that big pharma earns nothing on, terrain theory. Hence, no promotion of it either. Viruses = $$$</p>
