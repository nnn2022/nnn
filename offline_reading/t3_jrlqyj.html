    <strong>I need some good advice if anyone can help me!</strong>
    <p><p>Im from America/PA, i live in the country but we have to go to town for necessities. People fucking suck in town! Its filled with mask nazis that literally chase you around with their masks telling u to wear them, i refused from the start and im holding to it. </p>
<p>Our governer is the real virus here. And everyone I know wants him gone, they dont wanna wear masks, they want to open up their shops. They want the corruption gone, although they're waiting on one thing - they believe Trump is going to save them ( not saying he wont, i pray someone does ðŸ¤ž). But i don't want to put my faith in one person i want to fight for my rights i want to make a statement. </p>
<p>My town is really such a force, i want to give them my energy i want to take action i want to convince them that the reason the government enforces laws and stupid mandates is bc we let them. Lets show them we're not gonna let them take advantage of us. I want to convince everyone that we need to take our country back! We want the governor out lets demand he resigns! </p>
<p>I just dont know how to convince them how bad this is and what is to come. They have total faith that trump is gonna take care of it, but they are not aware of how deep rooted this problem is. And with out sounding nuts i want to explain there are psychopathic, baby eating, blood snorting, soul sucking, globalist, lizards taking over. </p>
<p>I get banned from facebook anytime i try to write anything so i cant reach out or organize anything on there unfortunately. But i just dont know how to go about getting people to understand this isnt going away and suggest we make some kind of statement whether that be protests, a petition idk. But we need to do something i fear we're going to wait to long. And i need some ideas, cause i dont want to lose faith in my country. Our government needs to pay for what they've done and not just to us, we cant let them take our lives away bc they decide they want to. I demand my freedom back!</p></p>

        <p>Bro, with all due respect and kindness but I think you canâ€™t do anything, leave that shithole and go to another state or another country where people and authorities are not nazis / stupid doomers.</p>
