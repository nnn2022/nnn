    <strong>PCR / any COVID testing is pointless</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/who-coronavirus-world-population-intl/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/who-coronavirus-world-population-intl/index.html</a></p>
<p>WHO estimated 10% of world had IT (whatever that means) some time ago last year (October)...what is the estimate now? That was when "cases" (Whatever that means) was 35 million or so.</p>
<p>At 90 million (per worldometers)....you could say 25% of world has already got IT. I almost certainly had it in March, never tested.  And several co-workers.</p>
<p>And since "cases" are increasing very fast... in another 2 months we could say 1/3+ will have gotten IT...maybe even up to 40%.</p>
<p>There is ZERO point in testing.   Just acceptance. It's all theater and leaders following other leaders who are running around with their heads chopped off - so to speak. Trying to show that they are doing something - "being responsible."</p>
<p>Of course...75%+ of cases are fake/not clinically relevant, so maybe it hasn't spread as fast as WHO estimated. (Reminded of Slovakia's mass testing, granted with antigen - only showed 1% or what not)...and that was before Nov spike.</p>

<p>But then they'd have to admit that more forcefully (Not spreading as fast). But going by the "official" numbers/statistical ratios.</p></p>

        <p>I also think it is LATENT, so never going away...and maybe everyone already has IT, it's just activating. But that's a separate conversation.</p>
