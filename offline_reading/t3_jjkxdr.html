    <strong>Looking for volunteers</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>We are looking for a couple volunteers to work with us on an activist movement against the new normal. Our goal is simple, we want to put an end to these insane measures which are not only ineffective in the fight against the virus, but which are immensely damaging to our way of life, our economy and our mental health. Lockdowns disproportionately hurt the weak, the poor and the vulnerable. We can't allow for this to go on any longer.</p>
<p>Our action plan is to 1/ assemble a motivated team 2/ build a website to inform the public of our mission 3/ spread our message through social media campaigns 4/ organise legal protests around the world. It's important to note that this movement is not meant to be associated with any political party. Anyone is welcome to join, though we could definitely use someone with experience in social media campaign/activism or any other useful skills. </p>
<p>Please DM me if you have any interest and we can discuss further. Thank you!</p></p>
