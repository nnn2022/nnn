        <p>Might be a repost, but since I'm new here thought I would share. I am quite certain this is 100% legitimate and that the patent number is valid.</p>
<p>After reading through the somewhat indecipherable documentation, it's clear that THEY want to turn us all into individual transhuman cryptocurrency farms.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation to the introduction of nanoparticles and DNA modifying vaccinations?</p>
<p>If in future there will be a one-world-currency (clearly crypto IMO), why not monetize the remaining people?</p>
<p>Just a thought, I'm interested to know all of yours. Tell me I'm a loon and belong in a psychiatric facility..</p>

        <p>Good old patent 666. Havent seen it on here, but its known to me for a while.</p>
<p>My favorite part is this:</p>
<p>[0005] Some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may use human body activity associated with a task provided to a user as a solution to“mining” challenges in cryptocurrency systems. For example, a brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information or service provider, <strong>such as viewing advertisement</strong> or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process. Instead of massive computation work required by some conventional cryptocurrency systems, data generated based on the body activity of the user can be a proof-of-work, and therefore, a user can solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously. Accordingly, certain exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may reduce computational energy for the mining process as well as make the mining process faster.</p>

        <p>Well, the general idea is that your body will have units in it to measure your activities. If these activities are in line with whatever they want, you earn money otherwise not.</p>
<p>Basically its a form of social scoring system that is "hardwired" into your body, so no escaping.</p>
<p>If they were to ban smoking in China, atm people would still grow tobacco illegally and meet in hidden places to enjoy a smoke. That wouldnt be able anymore, because then they will inject you  a marker that scans f.e. your blood for nikotin. As soon as you smoke the cigarette it will send a report to authorities.</p>

        <p>I have a hard time imagining they will be able to shut down current decentralized blockchain networks and force a dystopian centralized network on people like this. Centralized "gov coins" haven't gone over well in the crypto space.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, but if they were able to monitor everybody's habits and activities through this patented system, they could potentially control every aspect of one's life, including the login to Pionex or Binance</p>

        <p>True, restricting access to crypto while mandating a "gov" coin would be an effective way to implement a system like this. Actually Venezuela is kind of doing this by forcing pension funds on to their gov coin called "petro". One could also argue China is doing this every time they "crackdown" on Bitcoin miners yet despite their efforts Bitcoin is still doing quite well. I guess my point is that I don't think there is anyway to stop or control the decentralized blockchains that already exist and that a "black market" of activity is always going to exist. I believe humans in general do not like others telling them what to do. However, we are also social creatures that need to feel like we are part of something bigger than ourselves so we often relinquish our autonomy in order to feel included and not alone. As authoritarianism rises the black market will become less nefarious as we head for a dystopia where books like 1984, fahrenheit 451, and brave new world are only found as PDFs on the darknet. A world where you have to use a Tor browser to access uncensored forums for the free exchange of ideas. We are heading for a world where everyone is a criminal. A world where life is "normal" until your neighbor calls the secret police to disappear you for some petty nonsense they are probably guilty of themselves!</p>

        <p>Thank you and to you as well! It's nice to be understood for a change instead of being disregarded as some lunatic. Be courageous, have conviction, keep thinking critically, and above all never lose hope in the autonomy of the human spirit, no matter how far into darkness we may fall.</p>
