        <p>wtf, someone did this to me today too. I got into an elevator with someone and without any pretense he just blurts out "I'm double vaccinated, by the way, in case you were worried."</p>
<p>Weird flex, but ok.</p>
<p>I've been working throughout this entire 'pandemic' and haven't gotten sick once, but yes, getting in an elevator with you and my biggest worry was if you had two experimental shots in you.</p>

        <p>I have a new coworker - fresh out of university - and most conversations start like this:</p>
<p>&rt; I got an appointment for the vaccine. How about you?</p>
<p>&rt; Next week I'm gonna get vaccinated. How about you?</p>
<p>&rt; I'm gonna get vaccinated tomorrow. How about you?</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not gonna come today because I'm gonna get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I swear people are addicted to COVID-related things as conversation topics now.  I have a friend who loves to randomly bring up masks into completely unrelated conversations, but who gets mad if you happen to bring up being anti-lockdown.  </p>
<p>Us:  [talking about mountain we're going to climb]</p>
<p>Her, all of a sudden:  "I wore a mask all weekend to make sure I didn't get sick before our climb."</p>
<p>Me:  "But.....I thought cloth masks only protect others, not the wearer?"  (Despite being a surgical tech she fully bought into that BS even after it came out that COVID spread via aerosols.)</p>
<p>Her:  [gives me a look]  "Let's not go down <em>that</em> road."  </p>
<p>It's "political" if you bring yours up, but not hers.  Even though the mask debate is [or should be] scientific.</p>

        <p>This is so true it hurts. My girlfriend is almost the same way. We're allowed to talk about how covid is bad and masks are great and all. But as soon as I say anything slightly anti mask or anything of the sort its now political and an issue</p>

        <p>Humans are weak and easily fooled, that does not make them evil though.  Lemmings are not evil and neither are sheep.  Puppies are often weak and easily fooled and as they grow, you can teach them to do bad things like bite people because they foolishly trust your word about what is the right kind of behavior.  But that does not make the puppers evil.  THey are doing what they were told is the right behavior and they are not savvy enough to know better. In a similar way, many humans are also easily manipulated.  But IMO, it's only a few that truly know and understand the truth but push lies that are the true evil ones.</p>

        <p>The tv tells them that to follow the tv means they are good and righteous and it's easier to follow the tv and the crowd than to argue with it.  In the end, most humans are pack animals.  It's a dilemma because if we were not, if we were more like cats or something, then we may not have accomplished as much because we'd each insist totally on doing our own thing and could not work on group endeavors or follow rules at all.  If you try to order a cat around, most of them will only do it if they see an immediate benefit for them personally, they won't follow many standard behaviors just for the sake of others or for the concept of being a good cat.  In fact, a lot of them will do the opposite just for the thrill of it!  If you told a bunch of cats to please don't stomp on the flowers, most of them would probably immediately slaughter all the flowers.  ;-P  Not saying obedience is perfect either obviously but our ability to work as a group/pack may (along with opposable thumbs) well be why we evolved to take over the earth first and cats didn't.  But on the flip side, it leaves us exposed to group think dumbness if someone learns how to use our instincts against us.</p>

        <p>How can you go into a "scientific field" and not have even a vague comprehension of aerosol, fluid dynamics, or pressure differential?   </p>
<p>How is it possible that this wasn't the first concept that crossed every humans mind the moment they realized that masking might become a thing?  I am fucking baffled by this entire thing.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A year and a half in, and still I have not seen a single discussion on the topic in corporate media that doesn't fully ignore aerosolization and pretend that large droplets in ballistic trajectory are the only thing expelled.  Oral fecal transmission isn't discussed either.  I understand why but I can't wrap my head around nobody even stumbling into this clear and obvious thought process by accident.  Dammit I get worked up when think about this.</p>

<p>I genuinely believe that the mass panic response to the fear porn was more intense than even the media and gov'ts expected.  Putting on my tinfoil hat, I think they knew there would be economic fallout from it, so they pushed droplet spread as the main threat and pushed cloth masks as the solution so the public could feel like they had some measure of personal control.  Masks convinced the public to leave home and go back to spending more money.  Forcing masks on those working "essential" jobs was the government's excuse to not shut down our country's infrastructure.  "See?  There's a way to keep them safe!  There's no need for them to stop work while you continue to cower in your homes with your laptops."  A panicked population causes supply shortages, and stops spending money on non-essentials.  Creating an artificial unemployment boom forces the gov't to spend insane amounts of money, then print more.  Masks and droplet spread as the main focus were the easy, cheap way out for governments everywhere.</p>

        <p>That's sad. Try and ask them about something else and steer the topic away from vaccines. It's hopefully just nervousness on their part. Like talk about stuff completely unrelated to COVID. Ask him what his master's/final year project was maybe. Recent graduates don't always have a lot of workplace experience. Some new graduates never had jobs previous to their degrees so have no idea how to shoot the shit at work.</p>

        <p>If the average person was truly the way that you are hallucinating them to be, we would live in a much, much different world right now.  </p>
<p>You need to learn how to observe the world that you live in. Ask yourself how do commercials work? Become self-aware.. Try to figure out how genocides happen? How wars happen? How does propaganda work?   </p>
<p>Then stop pretending you live in a world full of loving rulers and caring tyrants..</p>

        <p>I never meant to imply that the world we live it is perfect. It’s far from it. Even then it’s quite a different circumstance and still isn’t reasoning for how you can assume the worst of someone’s intentions.</p>

        <p>That's assuming the employer believes the vaccine could cause a stroke. Personally, I think the employer was unimpressed simply from a "Well duh, of course you're vaccinated! Who wouldn't be?" standpoint.</p>

<p>The best employee is one that can problem solve and know when to ask and when to figure it out on their own using common sense (a type of sense that is sadly not so common).</p>

        <p>Agreed, most of us opened businesses so we don’t have to work all the time, if my staff is making me work more than I have to, then they gotta go lol.
If they can’t do it properly and do their own thinking; I end up doing it, then it’s a waste of money having them</p>

        <p>The minute someone told me they had been vaccinated by an mRNA vaccine in an attempt to get a job, I would know they were not a good fit for my company (and yes, I own one).</p>
<p>I hire people who think for themselves, question authority and don't believe everything the news media screams at them. Because how on earth would hiring someone who behaves like a sheep possibly benefit me or my employees?</p>

        <p>I would argue that, if I’m hiring people for my business, then yes, it is my business. And if it is not, then other people should not be allowed to force me to wear a mask at their own business, because then that is none of their business either.</p>

        <p><em>"Are you vaccinated"?</em> Not in your jurisdiction to ask, unless  you are a health practice where this is important.</p>
<p>Personally if I'm asked this at an interview (if i should go that way, I'm self-employed), I'm just going to get up and walk out. I've done it on a few occasions in the past when the interviewer went outside decency, or I decided from their attitude or mannerisms that there was no way in hell I would work for them.</p>
<p><em>"Did you get benefits during the Covid19 pandemic"?</em> Is not  your jurisdiction at all morally or objectively or legally.</p>
<p>A business can't force you to wear a Mask at their business, unless you agreed to it as a term of employment, or continued employment.</p>
<p>They can't force a customer to wear a Mask either (outside of an emergency mandate) , they can only ask you to leave the property.</p>

        <p>I’m allowed to ask, and you’re allowed to refuse to respond. Of course I really don’t want to ask anyway, and wouldn’t, but my point is that we arnt the ones doing the asking of this, it’s the left/establishment types doing so, and using their own weapons against them might be one of  the few social tools we have. I hope they get asked that, and I hope they get offended - maybe that will make them stop and think for a split second. Maybe.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’m allowed to ask,</p>
<p>As far as an interview as you as an employer, there are actually guidelines about what you can ask and what you can't - usually questions that would allow the employer to possibly make decisions based on discrimination or preference.</p>
<p>"What religion are  you?" , "Are you married?", "Did you vote for Biden or Trump?", "What are your views on abortion", etc.</p>
<p>I've had interviewers break these rules, and I believe a marriage vs single question was out of line, and they were clearly wanting to hire a married person over a single and I felt a discrimination of sorts. so clearly it was out of line and NOT even related to the job in question.</p>
<p>I don't really want to debate about this, as maybe it varies from country to country and state to state.. </p>
<p>My main goal in talking about this, is to encourage and empower people to simply not enter into , or feel obliged to, answering questions regarding their medical. This is not a precedent we want to set, nor do we want to enable or encourage employers to do this..</p>
<p>As it is leading to a 'no vax, no job' society., that should not happen.</p>

        <p>Yes, that would include any information regarding their medical status.It is simply out of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Of course, if the employee divulges such information, or participates - then the employer can establish medical authority over them out of their compliance.</p>

Everyone in their own communities of maybe a few hundred folks each, generally minding their own damn business, but open enough for a bit of trade and to prevent inbreeding.

<p>Imagine someone in an interview telling you all about how they haven't worked in 18 months because they're "been in quarantine" but hey you should totally hire them because they got the shot. 🙄</p>

        <p>Just to play devil's advocate, as a hiring manager you could also see this as a positive.  They probably wouldn't be the type to push for a raise, nor would they question when you're piling on tasks that aren't in the job description...they'd just gladly accept what the boss tells them and do it.</p>

        <p>they would definitely complain about extra tasks. But more importantly this isnt the type of person capable of getting something done unless there is a very clear set of instructions written by someone else that they can follow.

        <p>Questions about private medical information should never be brought up during interviews. It's a good way to open yourself up to litigation. Voluntarily divulging such information is also fucking stupid, because it can sway a prospective employer's decision, but since they didn't ask, you can't do shit about it.</p>

        <p>Maybe advertising that one is a dumbf*ck sheep and will do whatever one's told is good for slaves working in an exploitative gig economy type thing. It might also be good to advertise that one is a spike-protein shedder so that intelligent people can avoid the danger: both physical and psychological.</p>

        <p>Every time i sit close to people they proclaim they've been vaccinated or had both shots,  and that just makes me think, 
1 you're a fucking idiot 
2 i obvioisly haven't got covid so fuck off telling me that
3 if i did have covid you're still gonna get it 
4 you're not a fucking saint, you did as you were told by the most corrupt self serving pieces of shit on the planet for your own "safety". </p>
