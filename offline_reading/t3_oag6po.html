        <p>"They can tell me what I don't have"</p>
<p>Seems to be the common theme among those who have been injured by these vaccines. No one understands what they do have though. But they're still pushing these vaccines as safe. How can you tell me they are safe, especially in the long term, when you don't even understand what's causing these short term reactions(that very well may be life long)??</p>

<p>Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, and all of the other big tech industries that threw billions into this or outright censored any negative information concerning it are the ones to blame.</p>
<p>Trump never forced anyone to take the vaccine.  Businesses, media, and the democratic party in office right now are to blame for shaming, coercing, and firing those who don't take it are to blame.</p>

        <p>When you guys apologize for Trump it makes you just as bad as the people who make excuses for Biden. </p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>2019 Sep 19</strong></p>
<p>Trump Executive Order 13887, "modernizing vaccines" &amp; Influenza Task Force [DOD, DOJ, DOA, DHS, USFDA, CDC, NIH, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)] -- we would later know this as the "Covid-19 Task Force"</p>
<p>This executive order paved the way for accelerated production of experimental vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health</a></p>
<p><strong>2020 May 15</strong></p>
<p>Operation Warp Speed</p>
<p>White House announced Operation Warp Speed to accelerate development, production, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Operation-Warp-Speed/">https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Operation-Warp-Speed/</a></p>
<p>But... </p>
<p>At least Trump fired Fauci. Oh wait, he didn't.</p>
<p>At least he intervened and held accountable the governors that sent recoving Covid-19 patients into nursing homes. Oh wait, he didn't.</p>
<p>At least he came out and told the American people what was REALLY happening.</p>
<p>OH WAIT. HE DIDN'T.</p>
<p>He was complicit in this whole operation. He played along as the media turned him into the biggest boogeyman of all time, and then they used the hate against him to trick people into wearing masks and taking these experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>All they had to do was make Americans hate Republicans and then tell them: "Republicans don't like masks, and they're anti-vaxxers!"</p>
<p>And that drove them in the opposite direction. It was a simple reverse psychology operation, and most Republicans including Trump went along with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed these people never come out and tell things like they are?  It's because they're part of it.</p>
<p>They trade power back and forth, and things just keep getting worse for us over time. What a surprise.</p>
<p>HINT: They don't represent you, and they don't represent me. Neither party. And until people realize that we are doomed to be controlled by both forever.</p>

        <p>I just keep thanking trump on warp speed everytime i hear of the fallout!!  It pisses his cult off bad but theyre deluded.  I think alot of people are waking up from the cognitive dissonance occurring.  </p>
<p>You love trump and hate his vaccines he partnered the public and private sector to rush experiments onto the public with.... riiiiiiight</p>
<p>I enjoy it.  I enjoy the downvotes.  People are backing me up more and more.</p>
<p>I would support trump if he was righteous- but hes not.  Hes like mafia jesuit master of deception.  Making fools of his followers in plain sight.</p>
<p>Of course the whole system is riddled with bad actors not just trump.  But to overlook his promotions of poison and continue to support him.  It takes a special kind of stupid.</p>

<p>Stop with the condescending nonsense. But you thought Trump was in office to represent you, so I don't know why I'm either bothering with this conversation.</p>
<p>Any normal person who thinks the Democratic OR Republican party represents them is incredibly naive.</p>
<p>I don't mean that insultingly, I mean literally there's an unawareness of how these parties represent corporations and concentrated wealth -- and no one else.</p>
<p>Trump was not an "outsider" or "different" any more than Obama was.</p>
<p>Until people realize this we are doomed to be on the same trajectory forever.</p>

        <p>Okay, the democrats locked everyone down and kept them locked down for as long as possible.  They signed executive orders preventing nursing homes in several blue states from sending their sick to hospitals which caused an estimated 20,000-30,000 deaths.  They are controlling the media so that people continue to be afraid of a virus that ended over a year ago.  And they are censoring and and all information through bribes to big tech to keep anyone from speaking out about their lies.</p>
<p>And you're blaming Trump for all of this? </p>
<p>He did none of these things.  He didn't murder tens of thousands of senior citizens.  </p>
<p>Look- hate Trump if you want to hate him, but please give credit where credit is due.  Hate the democrats for the horrific part they are continuing to play in all of this.   Trump sent a hospital ship to New York, built emergency medical facilities with 2,500 beds, and sent 1,400 ventilators to New York and the democratic governor of New York sent all of it back completely unused because he didn't want to use anything Trump gave him.   This in addition to all of the seniors he killed with his nursing home orders.</p>
<p>Hate Trump if you want, but this was the Democrats who botched Covid.</p>

        <p><strong>Oh, I totally agree with you re: Democrats. 100%.</strong></p>
<p>The problem is - I know it sounds crazy, but what happened in 2019/20 was planned long before. More and more proof is coming out.</p>
<p>If you have any doubt, check this out:</p>
<p><strong>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health - Center for Health Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPARS Pandemic Scenario 2025-2028 (Date completed: October 2017)</strong></p>
<p>Opens with fictional <strong>President J.B. not running for second term due to health issues</strong> (who do you think that is?) VP steps in after a <strong>pandemic doesn't kill as many as expected</strong> - but the <strong>vaccines have widespread severe effects 18 months later.</strong> Ends with President thanking Americans for their bravery &amp; patriotism in taking the experimental vaccines in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Even I had a hard time believing this was written in 2017. I figured SURELY this must have been updated in 2020, right? I mean... It's just TOO ACCURATE. Moreso than Event 201, even, which was more widely publicized.</p>
<p>But this came from the same people and it predated Event 201.  Really think about it -- they pretty much magically guessed Joe Biden would be president --- in 2017. How could they know that? Remember, he was at the BOTTOM of popularity with all the Democrats running... Now couple this with the incredibly questionable election results. Very suspicious. Really, read the document:<br>
<a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html</a></p>
<p>But sure, updated in 2020, right? NO. The PAGE location was updated in 2020, perhaps to justify this information... But document link remains in <a href="https://Archive.org">Archive.org</a> going back to March of 2018!</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20180330033845/https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2017/spars-pandemic-scenario.pdf </p>
<p>Look at that! To me that's incriminating.</p>
<p>But that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There's also the WEF selling "World Pandemic Bonds" followed by partnership with WHO 6 months later. This was $500 million in bonds -- oversubscribed by 200%. ($1 billion?) And in their own promo material, it explains how they'll use "complex financial instruments and derivatives" -- so it's even more signficant. </p>
<p>The bonds had a very specific set of conditions in which they would not pay out. But... You guessed it. WHO declared a pandemic just before the money was to be returned to the investors. But they needed more deaths to justify a pandemic. So..... Enter the 5 Democratic governors who ordered recovering Covid-19 patients into nursing homes. Many deaths ensued, as you know.</p>
<p>But did you know some of the governors explicitly forbade the nursing homes from testing these incoming patients for Covid-19??? Wrap your head around that one -- it's real. It happened. It's on record.</p>
<p>But there's more...</p>
<p>In August 2019 BlackRock published a plan for the fed about how to handle the next downturn (which anyone in financial markets knows was already happening.) The plan called for TRILLIONS to be transferred to corporations and individuals.</p>
<p>You remember the controversy around \~2008's 700 billion bailout, right. For TRILLIONS they needed an emergency to justify this kind of transfer. </p>
<p>Then, the Fed began intervention in the markets on September 17, 2019 -- this was the start of execution of BlackRock's plan.</p>
<p>Two days later? Look at this:</p>
<p><strong>2019 Sep 19</strong></p>
<p>Trump Executive Order 13887, "modernizing vaccines" &amp; Influenza Task Force [DOD, DOJ, DOA, DHS, USFDA, CDC, NIH, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)] -- we would later know this as the "Covid-19 Task Force"</p>
<p>This executive order paved the way for accelerated production of experimental vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/24/2019-20804/modernizing-influenza-vaccines-in-the-united-states-to-promote-national-security-and-public-health</a> </p>
<p>And then, of course, we had Event 201 which was on October 18, 2019.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p><strong>2019 Dec 12</strong></p>
<p>Moderna-NIH Vaccine Was Completed by December 12, 2019 ("mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates developed and jointly owned by NIAID and Moderna") -- Signed by Ralph Baric</p>
<p>https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295-NIH-Moderna-Confidential-Agreements.html#document/p105/a568569 (PAGE 105)</p>
<p>Hmm. How is this possible? And yet -- there it is.</p>
<p>OH! And then:</p>
<p><strong>2019 Dec 19</strong></p>
<p>Bill Gates tweeted: "What's next for our foundation? I'm particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines."</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/billgates/status/1207681997612748801">https://twitter.com/billgates/status/1207681997612748801</a> </p>
<p>What an interesting coincidence...</p>
<p>And then by March of 2020 the world was changed and Covid-19 was all we ever heard about ever again.</p>
<p>But my point is -- Trump played the role of "incompetent Government administrator that failed to take action on Covid-19." You like him, so you make excuses for him, but if you go back you see it was a setup from the very first time he said the phrase, "FAKE NEWWWWZ."</p>
<p>That "fake news" was a setup for what would later become a government-corporate partnership (to bypass law) for systemwide censorship, to silence dissent, hide known valid treatments for Covid-19, and now to cover up the side effects and deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The way you know that Trump is lying to you is -- he isn't forthright with any of this. He was President of the United States, and contrary to what most people believe, he's not an idiot. Idiots don't rise to the top of national power. </p>
<p>How is it possible that I know more about Covid-19 than he does?  Answer -- it's not possible. What you see is a front. He's not honest with you. He's part of this. They all are.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyhow, here's a Pastebin of my timeline. It's still missing a ton, but it is updated over time:</p>
<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/QixZX44H">https://pastebin.com/QixZX44H</a></p>
<p>This entire situation was set up in advance, and I believe it was triggered sooner than expected due to the global financial crisis of 2019.</p>
<p>We're facing a fundamental change to our entire system and possibly a population reduction event.</p>
<p>And everyone high up knows what's going on but isn't talking about it. If someone isn't forthright about this stuff you can't trust them on anything -- and that includes so called alternative reporters like Glenn Greenwald. He won't touch this topic.</p>
<p>We have Tucker Carlson, however he plays a role in this too --- he brings forward information in a way that gets it consider a "right wing conspiracy theory" by most.</p>
<p>That's the problem with politicization.</p>
<p>The Democrats are unable to see the wrongdoing of their party just like you are unable to see the wrongdoing of the Republicans &amp; Trump.</p>
<p>They're all on the same team... And guess what, it's not our team.</p>
