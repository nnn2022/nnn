    <strong>On Malaysia's C-19 vaccination program.</strong>
    <p><p>Malaysia's C-19 vaccination program began on Feb 24, and to date more than 8 million, or one in four of my fellow countrymen have been jabbed. 16.7 million people, slightly more than half of my country's total population, have signed-up.</p>
<p>Our govt chose Pfizer, AZ and the CCP's SinoVac. They have also ordered J&amp;J and the Russians' Sputnik V but none have arrived to date.</p>
<p>There are complaints that people that have signed up in February have yet to receive their "shot" until now. As a matter of fact, the govt have designated 3 phases for the vax program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase One: <em>frontliners</em> (doctors, healthcare workers, military, police)</li>
<li>Phase Two: senior citizens, and those who have chronic diseases (supposedly high-risk)</li>
<li>Phase Three: the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccination is voluntary, but our govt has made several threats in the past to mandate vaccination. From personal observation, "anti-vax" sentiment is highest among my country's Muslim majority, while the ethnic Chinese are generally more receptive to the jab. </p>
<p>Signing up for the vax is done through either the govt's official contact tracing app or a specially set up online portal (<a href="https://www.vaksincovid.gov.my"><code>www.vaksincovid.gov.my</code></a>). People are not allowed to choose the vaccine brand. In early May, AZ was spun-off from the main vax program and became a separate program, due to fears of blood clots. For a short while people were able to choose which brand they want to roll their dice with; those on the main program will still have to bet between Pfizer and SinoVac. But three weeks later AZ was reintegrated to the main program, in order to not "slow down" the program.</p>
<p>Before vaccination, a consent form is given to the person, in which the government waives itself of all liability, shall any adverse reaction occur, because supposedly, the benefits outweigh the risks. I will share more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine adverse events and deaths:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the government's denial and the silence from the MSM, I can tell you that there are cases of people dying after receiving the experimental C-19 jab in Malaysia as well. As in the case of many countries in the world, the "vaccines" have only received <em>Emergency Use Authorization</em> from the authorities here. </p>
<p>Unlike the US' VAERS, the government here has not maintained a publicly-accessible AEFI database since the vax program began. The people could only rely on a private Telegram group (<a href="https://t.me/AEFICOVIDVAX"><code>https://t.me/AEFICOVIDVAX</code></a>) for information; to date 40 deaths were recorded post-vax. </p>
<p>In May, on the second day of Eid, Haziq Kamaruddin, our national archer, who represented Malaysia at the 2016 Brazil Olympics, died, about 2 weeks after receiving the jab. He was 28. The govt and MSM were quick to deny that his death was related to the jab, within hours of his death!</p>
<p>But the damage was done; in the several days after the archer's death, the daily sign-up rate for the jabs slowed down, from 127K sign-ups a day at the beginning of May, to 119K sign-ups a day by late-May. It was never publicly discussed, but many knew that the fallout of the archer's death have an impact on the vax program. If it could kill an Olympic athlete, imagine what could the jab do to average people. The other 30+ cases? Not even mentioned in the media.</p>
<p>That was when case numbers increased "magically". By the last week of May, daily infections rose to 7,000, then 8,000 and 9,000, accompanied by an increase in C-19 deaths, thus breaking all records held since the beginning of the year. Coupled with social media trolls sharing stories about supposed "deaths-on-arrival" at hospitals, and ICUs supposedly "filled-to-the-brim", the fear campaign <em>worked</em>. Sign-up rates for the jab increased to 130K. </p>
<p>Our govt waxed lyrical about issuing 200,000 doses a day, but daily new cases remained above 5,000 for nearly a month now. Weren't the vaccines supposed to help stop infections? Was it antibody-dependent effect (ADE)? </p>
<p>To the point that some of us are starting to harbor suspicions that the so-called "new infections" and "Delta variant" may be vaccine adverse reactions, disguised by the MSM as C-19 infections.</p>
<p>There is this one question that some were asking, but might never have the answer to:</p>
<p><em>How many of the new infections and/or deaths were previously vaccinated?</em></p></p>
