    <p><p>The nonsense rules so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're standing up or sitting down at a restaurant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're in a restaurant before a curfew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're in a store before a curfew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows the difference from a handshake and a fist bump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccinated can still spread, contract and carry similar viral loads. So what the fuck is the point of a vaccine passport aside from segregation??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Super spreader" when protesting something politically incorrect, but apparently takes a vacation when you protest for the right cause. It's (D)ifferent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Peaceful" protests allowed, yet do other daily activities and the boogeyman Coronavirus comes out to exterminate you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must quarantine for some countries upon arrival even if vaccinated, yet all the world leaders broke their own covid rules 100% during the G7 Summit, but social distanced when the camera was on them, then went back to normal when the cameras were off. So it knows who are the rich and who are the plebs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus where a vaccine has to be 100% effective or else its unacceptable even if its 80-90%... nevermind the flu vaccine which ranges around 40-60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus smart enough to rewrite the past and have every symptom as "long covid", ministry of truth style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows when its lunch time, now you can take your masks off or any earlier would've ended up in a ventilator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cold/flu? what's that? I heard its only the delta variant now. Flu is so 2010s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus that managed to successfully and completely kill off common sense, even the more deadly ones failed at this. Brains over brawn!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each variant conveniently arrives as countries plan to reopen or when politicians get exposed. Corona to the rescue!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curfews can be set differently in different areas or different countries... huh? So man-made rules are what dictates the pattern of this particular virus in each respective area?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>President Biden talking about door-to-door vaccines... holy shit imagine if President Trump said this, they would be ripping him to shreds for forcing an experimental vaccine on your neighbors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something doesn't work... so they decide to... double down on it? ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last decade when you got sick, you'd stay home or take some medications and let the world continue. Nah, this decade if anyone got sick, lockdown the fucking country/state again because sickness is completely unacceptable now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh fuck, I can't believe this isn't a fucking sitcom. </p>
<p>What an absolute joke, in fact, if this was a fictional movie it would be ripped to shreds by critics for being unrealistic.</p>
<p>They've successfully destroyed the world, but the fact that so many people fell for the greatest scam of all time, shows that a Great Reset IS necessary, just not in the way the evil globalists intend to.</p></p>

        <p>Its not just that it ignore "peaceful protests", they actually published that they reduced the spread.</p>

        <p>Gosh, if only anti-lockdown protesters had remembered to say "BLM protests" instead of "anti lockdown protests" they might've actually gotten their way.</p>
