    <strong>My university is requiring students to get the covid vaccine before returning to class. When will this nightmare ever end?</strong>
    <p><p>My school just officially released a letter from the president’s office stating that they are requiring all students and faculty to receive one of the “approved” corona “vaccines” to return to campus in the fall. This is happening not long after our governor stated that he was not in favor of the vaccine passport. </p>
<p>So, despite these being state-run institutions and our governor claiming this, the letter says “The presidents of nine state institutions unanimously decided to require undergraduate and graduate students who are attending in-person classes... are to be fully vaccinated prior to the start of the academic year... or their arrival on campus.” </p>
<p>They go on to gush about “the safety of our community” and how it’s imperative we vax-up so we can “return to close to a pre-COVID environment” and add links to the state gov site propagating how safe these vaccines are for all the non-believers in the $cience out there. </p>
<p>Can they legally do this, being a state-run institution? Can they force people to be lab rats in this “vaccine” that has already produced troubling side effects and has even resulted in several deaths? One of them was even pulled after several blood clot related deaths, but then it was put back out there and cleared and they cited how there are only a few dozen to a couple hundred of people that could die from it based on the statistics they’ve shown thus far. The whole “even if it saves one life” rhetoric falls short when you’re willing to sacrifice scores of people to save grandma. </p>
<p>I am beyond frustrated with the state of affairs surrounding this “pandemic” that has been completely blown out of proportion. They shut down society for a year. Now, I have to sit here, a year away from earning a bachelor of science degree, having accumulated massive debt, and I face the prospect of not being able to return to school to finish my degree. </p>
<p>They are holding people’s futures hostage now if they refuse to comply. This is authoritarianism in effect. This is exactly the sort of talk that would have been dubbed “conspiracy theory” back a few months ago, but has now become the norm. And those who would have rejected this theory shift further into denial and just tell you that you should just go along with it so we can “get back to normal”. That’s not normal.</p>
<p>My hopes are that people will protest this as they did when the state tried to force people to get the flu vaccine last semester. We can’t allow them to keep pushing against us with no pushback. Many of us have stayed silent offline because we aren’t willing to ruffle feathers or are concerned about what others may think of us. There are many other folks on their side who are just toeing the line on the other side but are on the fence about these issues philosophically. We need to be vocal, but rational as we explain our side because some of these people are beginning to be swayed. We can’t come off aggressively as the media already portrays us all to be loonie bins. </p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who had the patience to sit through my rant. If nothing else, it’s nice to have this outlet to let off a little steam.</p>
<p>On a side note, I’m hoping to slip by the school issue as they claim to offer exemptions on religious or medical grounds. I’m looking into the religious aspect, as I am increasingly growing religious from a previously non-religious background. Any tips or advice on where to look for sources in the Old Testament would be appreciated. </p>
<p>I’d also like to add that the school also said about exemptions, “[we] will work with students who choose not to be vaccinated to try to meet with their needs and enable them to continue their education at [school] in pursuit of their degree.” Does this mean they will be respectful, or that they’ll try to ~~bully~~ convince you into getting it (which seems illegal), or merely impose some asinine restrictions on you like you? Curious for insight.</p></p>

        <p>I'd tell them thank you for the offer but you are a young healthy individual and trust your immune system to continue to carry you through this pandemic as it has already with ease. </p>
<p>I'd perhaps offer to take the vaccine tho to placate them under one condition.  Since the vaccine makers themselves are immune from all liability associated with the vaccine. That the school assume any and all liability should anything adverse occur to you as a result of receiving the vaccine. And by assuming all liability they also will assume all responsibility for any medical costs incurred as well as additional damages should you miss work/family aspects etc. Maybe even an insurance policy on death. </p>
<p>Just a simple agreement on their part and sure you'll get the vaccine. If they believe in it as strongly and surely as they do whats the harm in signing a little piece of paper agreeing to that?</p>

        <p>As nervous about the vaccine as I am, I’d be willing to say that because I know there’s no way they’d call my bluff and agree to that. This is actually an interesting angle to pursue if other avenues fail.</p>

        <p>Thats why I said to offer it. There's ZERO chance they'd sign that but then you can call them out for not believing in it as strongly as they say and question them further.</p>

        <p>That’s an option, too. But unfortunately for me, my major isn’t offered at many other schools around me. I could always change my major, but I also worry about my massive and growing debt lol. I think there might be some relative fields I could consider but I’ll have to do a lot of research to see what could be my best option with the shortest time to graduate.</p>

        <p>Sadly, probably not for all the classes I need to finish considering my major isn’t a huge portion of the school and usually only offers one class time and not always for both semesters. I feel like I’ve been put in a really difficult situation where I either have to change schools which will require me to change majors, or desperately trying to circumvent the whole thing.</p>
<p>Even if I am to beat it, I’m still mad for all the other kids and young adults who are going to be put in the same position. This can’t be allowed to pass because of the precedent it will set.</p>

        <p>Also, using the Old Testament for religious exemption isn’t likely as those rules are to be followed by the Israelites, and idk if you’ve seen Israel, but they’ve been vaxxing it up. Maybe if you grow a beard and claim you’re converting to Islam. Also, some states are already taking away the ability to have religious exemptions so it may not even matter by the time school starts back.</p>

        <p>While that’s true, there’s also a fair argument that the state of Israel isn’t a theocracy and many of the people who live there don’t truly follow Judaism. I’ve seen a documentary on a religious sect over there that is very orthodox that gets out of Israel’s mandatory military service on their claims that it violates their beliefs. </p>
<p>Also, going on hearsay, but I heard that Tel Aviv has the 2nd biggest gay pride parade next to San Francisco. I don’t doubt it from some of the things I’ve heard. So it can be argued that they don’t really follow the Torah very strictly. The folks who live there are nothing like the ones who live in Jerusalem and other areas. I feel like there has to be a case in there about this.</p>

        <p>While true. It falls flat when trying to explain it as someone who is supposed to be a follower of that religion, and not knowing much concrete background info. Especially if the person you are explaining this to for your exemption is in fact, Jewish. Lol.</p>

        <p>True, but just as with the other religions, there are many different sects with different interpretations.</p>
<p>There are some sects of Judaism that strongly encourage vaccination. I’ve been reading some past objections though, including that some vaccines include material from pigs and/or gelatin as well as others containing material from human fetuses. So I do think there are grounds for both religious and ethical concerns there.</p>

        <p>I think most universities are going to transition permanently into a hybrid model of learning where they offer a combination of in-person and remote learning.  OP should talk to the university about finishing their degree through remote learning.</p>

        <p>STEM majors aren’t always so easy to transition to remote, as most STEM majors require labs which are 1 credit classes connected to a 3 or 4 credit class. You can take them simultaneously, or in separate semesters or years, but the lab must come after the lecture class. These labs are always in person and require you to do experiments, etc. I did my last quarter of University remotely in spring of ‘20 and people still had to go to labs on campus to finish their degree on time. Some had to delay their graduation times because they couldn’t get into lab classes or were allowed to graduate but have to come back in the fall of 2021 to take the lab credit class. Some classes even did in person labs while the whole university was on remote learning because it was “necessary” the students went to labs of no more than 6 people per and they had to wear masks and perform the experiments and tasks as individuals instead of groups like usual. They had to do this just to not fall behind as these labs are offered every semester and people already have to come back for a fifth year to complete them for their degree. It’s ridiculous. I doubt they change or make exceptions as people that think like us are in the minute minority of today’s society.</p>

        <p>I know, but it depends on the University, as since they are so close to finishing the University basically has them by the throat. That’s another hurdle of the “just go along with it” attack. There’s a lot of younger people I know getting vaxxed because they have to for school, something they are 6-12 months from being finished with. They’d just rather get vaxxed and finish on time than to throw a wrench in their future schedule, especially after the last year we’ve had.</p>

        <p>You don't have to provide a reason to not take it, and you don't have to prove your religion to them. All you have to do is claim a religious exemption, and if they push you threaten them with a lawsuit for violating your 1st amendment rights by infringing on a practice of your religion, the practice of not taking vaccines made using stem cells (which mostly come from aborted fetuses).</p>

        <p>I think you'd have a better chance if you could find some medical reason why you cannot be vaccinated.  Go read through the medical literature surrounding COVID vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson) and maybe you will find something that can exempt you.  Maybe lookup "COVID vaccine medical exemptions" in Duck-Duck-Go.</p>

        <p>So far, religious exemption searches in duck duck go have led to a lot of articles trying to sway people away from religious exemption, but I did pick up a couple leads to follow.

        <p>At this point, show them you're any random religion and act religious. And, ask like a priest or something to give like a quote in the bible were it says, its immoral to inject yourself with all this nonsense.</p>

        <p>I agree, I want no part of this and will explore all avenues to get around it. But at the same time I’m mad about it and I don’t think anybody should be coerced like this into getting it. Institutions are banding together to shun people like us from society.</p>

        <p>You should ask them to specify what they mean by approved. If they say FDA approved then you don’t have to get any shot because none are FDA approved. </p>
<p>Not sure if that will actually fend off the university but it’s worth a shot.</p>
<p>You could also try and get a letter from the governor, though that’s a Hail Mary.</p>

        <p>I doubt that line of reasoning will work considering the mainstream narrative are that these vaccines are “totally safe” and “FDA approved” even though the FDA part is a total lie and they stare at you incredulously when you tell them that.</p>
<p>The writing the governor part is an enticing angle, but I also don’t particularly like him either, but it’s a chance. I will say that even though he claims to oppose the vaccine passports, he was one of the earliest to shut our state down. I’m not sure how sympathetic he would be to this injustice.</p>

        <p>If it is a state run institution they cannot force you to take the vaccine, they cannot force you for follow “mask mandates” if your state doesn’t actually have them either. I am graduating but if I were continuing in the fall I would transfer honestly I’m not going to be forced into medical procedures. All colleges are pretty much the same anyway.</p>

        <p>That’s what I thought, too. I’m hoping this gets overturned because they tried to do the last thing with flu vaccines last semester but it ended up being struck down due largely to protests. </p>
<p>My state does however push the mask mandate narrative, the vaccine mandate is surprisingly where they decided to draw the line. So 9 state schools all got together on their own and decided to force it, which seems both morally and legally incorrect considering the state itself isn’t pushing for this (currently).</p>

        <p>That’s why I’ve taken it upon myself to be more vocal in my opposition and to try and have conversations with the opposite side. It feels like a losing fight, but keeping quiet about it has only hurt us and we need to try and persuade our peers that even if they don’t support us, they should be morally obligated to support the freedom of choice to not subject ourselves to this without being shunned from society for refusing. In a nutshell, it’s coercion and bullying.</p>

        <p>When you say "state-run institution" that means it's a public school, right? If it's a public school, then it is illegal for them to require vaccinations. At least that's how it is in my state (NC).</p>
<p>If worse comes to worse, some people have managed to get religious exemptions from the vaccine, so you could always try that.</p>

        <p>I hope so. As far as I can tell they haven’t said anything about enforcement. Just a general blanket statement that we need to be “fully vaccinated” by the fall semester or whenever we arrive on campus. It seems that this applies to commuters like me just as much as it applies to residents. I’m still leaning to sidestep it, but I would like to actively engage in protests during the summer to try and combat this before it catches on and other states start trying to emulate this bad behavior.</p>

        <p>I would reference medical exemptions. You have serious concerns about a potential allergic reaction. Use that, as well as the liability angle. They could easily be combined. Something along the lines of "as the vaccine has not completed it's testing and I have serious concerns about a potential allergic reaction, I will not take the vaccine. If forced, I expect the University to accept liability in the case they an allergic reaction occurs."</p>

Idk, it’s one of those you have to be the one to fight it to the top and have the money to make a difference, seeing as the majority want us all vaccinated and the ones who are on our side with money (Mike Lindell, Elon Musk, etc) are either canceled, or made out a fool so they probably wouldn’t bother or have the outreach to cause enough of a stink to make everyone see how insane all of this is. You would need a Breonna Taylor/George Floyd type of coverage on mainstream and all the elites on your side for the Supreme Court to even think about it as a civil rights case or for the general public to be on your side. Sucks. This isn’t the “freedom” I fought for.</p>

        <p>It’s sad, but you’re absolutely right, and I’m in no position to hire a lawyer to fight against this. This is definitely the sort of case that should be looked at by the Supreme Court if someone ever did take up that fight. I’m hoping that at some point over the next few months this gets turned down, but at the same time I don’t expect anything good coming from the state level here. </p>
<p>Thank you for fighting for our freedoms and more importantly for knowing what freedom is. I definitely appreciate that.</p>
