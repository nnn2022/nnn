    <strong>IM NOT A SHEEP....üêëüêëüêë</strong>
    <p><p>Compliance is achieved through means of fear more than force. The ruling caste and the pharmaceutical industrial complex claim we must voluntarily give up our freedom in exchange for safety. It‚Äôs for our own good! You want to save lives, don‚Äôt you?</p>
<p>The lever pushers at the top of the pyramid are using "science" to keep people Obedient. We must do as we‚Äôre told because they claim to have the logical and scientific high ground. We must take their experimental jabs to prove we‚Äôre good humans who care about others. Doing so doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be more lockdowns and social distancing. Masks have become permanent even though their own science shows masks do more harm then good. You see, they suspend science in cases such as mask wearing,, and the number of genders. A man can become a woman and vice versa just because they say it‚Äôs science instead of what it really is‚Äîinsanity. Their experimental gene therapy jabs and vaccines are safe even though thousands experience severe side effects and death. The ruling class says they‚Äôre safe and effective, so most of the public ignores hard evidence to the contrary. Too many people are not in touch with reality and fear-ignorance is what  makes sheep mentality possible. #ImNotASheep</p></p>

        <p>Even saying "trust the science" makes no sense. First, the scientific method is based on explicitly NOT trusting science. That's what peer review is supposed to be for, not taking someone's word and verifying or disproving whatever hypothesis.</p>
<p>But science has a big crisis where most experiments can't be replicated. So yeah, science itself has become suspect as crazy as that sounds.</p>

<p>Side note, stop calling people sheep. It makes the "sheep" and "non-sheep" fight amongst ourselves when we need to direct our energy upwards. Try to wake up as many as you can and leave the ones who actively want to stay ignorant in their ignorance-is-bliss state. If they come around way later, welcome them. Many never will but more people have their eyes open than ever before.</p>

        <p>Not transphobic at all.....I just believe their are 2 genders
If a man wears a dress that's absolutely fine; however according to science and biology hes still a biological man.... That's not transphobic it's just objective reality</p>

        <p>Science has evidence that sexual identity and orientation is based on brain structure. This is a psychological difference, not a biological difference. So while someone may be biologically male, they may psychologically consider themselves to be a female or to become a female. They don't make this decision, it is purely the result of genetics. You are right in thinking that most people will be heterosexual and non-trans, however there is a minority that isn't and that is where this conflict begins.</p>
<p>Bottom line, calling trans people or people who want to be trans "insane" is not okay and is classified as transphobia.</p>

        <p>Gender dysphoria is infact a mental illness I agree with you on that premise; however I don't meet the definition of an individual who's transphobic because I Love evreyone and <strong>don't discriminate</strong> based on superficial identity politics.
