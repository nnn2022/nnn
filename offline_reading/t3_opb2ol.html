    <strong>Swiss rant with stats</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, I wanted to rant about the ridiculous measures in place and current public discourse in Switzerland. Before I start tho let me state one thing: I don't believe in the fact that they want control. I believe politicians are following mob mentality (cause they wanna be re-elected ofc) and are old, selfish, and incompetent.  </p>
<p>Anyway let's look at the real numbers shall we, here is the recent "Dangerous" spike of covid infections over the past 28 days:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mqaylctfkqc71.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d89fbfe7724655e866f63fc51444811caf38fc99">Cases</a></p>
<p>Wow look at this, people have the virus, no shit. Also mainly people under 49 years old have it, damn I never would have believed that active adults have social relations, crazy right? That many infections is sure to lead to many hospitalisations and deaths. Lets check those numbers now (past 28 days):  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/m9yt8szflqc71.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803eed7670da350384100d9341b95dff1ef539b8">Hospitalisations</a></p>
<p>Hmmm, strange, mostly old people get hospitalised. Never would have seen it coming eh? But if the younger population doesn't get into the hospital maybe they straight up die? Lets look at stats... (past 28 days)  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hcjb7hndmqc71.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4715e24aa4e2cb28214b5b3c581a57bd007e0573">Deaths</a></p>
<p>..... A true pandemic, with the entire population at risk. Yes. Now maybe its because the young are fully vaccinated and the elderly are stubborn and don't want to, again, let the graphs talk:  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/oaks4lqwmqc71.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b32ccb6f4baee068327e7d52c4bc92721a38fd2">Vaccine any&#37; speedrun</a></p>
<p>I will be honest and say this: The vaccine may very well help the elderly. Maybe all hospitalised old fucks are unvaccinated. But I can't fucking wrap my mind around the fact that they are denying entry into nightclubs, NIGHTCLUBS if you don't have the vaccine. Sure, 67 years old go clubbing all the time, yeah that's gonna protect them. Oh and all festivals require COVID-passports too, you know these places where you go with your grandma, like tomorrowland. The fact that they are pushing the vaccine onto younger and younger people is disgusting.  </p>
<p>I'm fucking fuming. With the uptick in cases they are thinking about extending their passports to restaurants and bars... Men wtf. Can we let the young (&lt;50 ) live their fucking lives? At this point I am anti old people, this past years has changed me to have no mercy regarding the elderly. Oh you poor poor creature with 10 years left to live, fuck off and die. Let me free.</p>

<p>Not sure in non-swiss IP's can see these pages but those who really want to fact check me, worst case buy a 5 dollar vpn.</p>
<p>tl:dr COVID does nothing to young (&lt;50yo) people. Measures are dumb.</p></p>
