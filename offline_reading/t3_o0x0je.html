    <strong>It seems to me there are two types of “No new normal” advocates. What one are you?</strong>
    <p><p>During some boredom whilst I quarantine to get into Australia (one of the countries which is more or less back to normal) I’ve been realising that broadly there are two types of people who reject the “new normal” on this sub.  </p>
<p>They are actually vastly different in nature and I will give an outline of them here. It’s of course a scale and not every point will apply to everyone. </p>
<p>1.) <strong>Covid Denialists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broadly doesn’t believe in science apart from in certain circumstances. They believe there are “real” doctors out there but they’re being silenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believes masks and vaccines are oppressive measures by governments to gain control over people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best solution to a pandemic is to pretend it doesn’t exist and just go about our lives. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid-19 is part of a conspiracy, not clear why or how, many different theories, zero evidence. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2.) <strong>Covid Realists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Believes in science, understands that science evolves and that scientists can be wrong about things although they will usually correct themselves in the long term. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows that masks and vaccines work and that their use will hasted the return to normal life. Zero objection to vaccines in particular as their use has been proven to be a lot safer than not being vaccinated and vaccines are nothing new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has serious concerns about the negative impact lockdowns are having on people and children’s development. Wonders whether current restrictions are worth it. Will the benefits of the lockdowns be outweighed by the side effects? Believes schools wherever possible should stay open. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinks that once everyone has been offered a free vaccine (or two) to prevent serious disease, the mask mandates should end and life should go back to normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has concerns governments might use the pandemic as an excuse to overreach with privacy including collecting data they normally wouldn’t. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are you more of a Covid realist or a Covid denialist?</strong></p></p>

        <p>Your categories are too reductionist, I think. Most of us believe COVID is a virus, but that it’s not any more dangerous than a cold.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>Surgical masks block droplets, basically particles larger than about 80 microns.  Covid is contained in aerodolized particles smaller than 60 microns.  It takes at least an N95 to block the inhalation of those particles.  No mask blocks the exhalation of those particles.</p>
<p>Therefore, paper and cloth masks don't reduce Covid spread.  They do work for other respiratory viruses like the flu though.  Masks were never the way back to normal.  The only way is for people to gain immunity.  That is best done by vaccinating the highest risk groups and allowing everyone else to contract the disease and fight it off.  This would have saved the most lives.  The actual response did more harm than good.</p>

        <p>No, she won't.  Droplets go about 5 feet if a cough or sneeze is uncovered.  That's the point of social distancing.  Aerosolized particles, like in Covid, go in excess of 28 feet and can be carried on HVAC currents even greater distances.  Besides, sneezing is a symptom of illness.  The mask mandates made well people in the community wear masks, which no legitimate science backs as being beneficial.</p>
<p>&rt;Anyone who has been following the science understands that a smaller viral load leads a milder disease or no disease at all.</p>
<p>Well, tell me what is the actual number of virus particles required for infection?</p>
<p>While you're pondering that, you should realize severe Covid happens due to production of faulty antibodies.  The amount of virus inhaled is largely irrelevant.  The viral load can determine if you're immune system mounts a response, but I've already shown masks don't reduce the exhalation of aerosols.  They go right through the mask material.</p>
<p>That's what the science actually says.  You're still following the MSM.</p>

        <p>Well, if you say it, then it must be true.  Those journal articles and CDC sources are there, but people like you seem to have selective blindness.  I'm tired of catering to that.  If this was really about health, then you'd follow all of these precautions, and wouldn't need to justify it to anyone.  Like the other doomers, you need people to validate your behavior.</p>

        <p>Here's some science for you brother.</p>
<p>&rt;It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections. On the contrary, a 50% decrease has been reported after omitting face masks. The present study was designed to reveal any 30% or greater difference in general surgery wound infection rates by using face masks or not. During 115 weeks, a total of 3,088 patients were included in the study. Weeks were denoted as "masked" or "unmasked" according to a random list. After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact tha the numerical difference was a statistically "missed" difference. These results indicated that the use of face masks might be reconsidered. Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a healthy operating team.</p>

<p>Let me just give you an example of this. I read <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Virus-Mania-COVID-19-Hepatitis-Billion-Dollar/dp/3752629789">Dr. Sam Bailey's book</a>. She also has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD52JnQnXkLe5HGm4IArHw">YouTube channel</a>. She has to be extremely careful about precisely what she says on that channel, even though absolutely everything she says is, not only her opinion as a physician, but also backed-up, documented, published, and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>If she simply told the truth on YouTube, her channel would be deleted. If she has something to say on YouTube that will result in this, she signposts you to another platform (I must confess that I can't even remember the name of it), where she will tell the whole truth.</p>
<p>Naturally, Dr. Bailey receives zero media coverage. I did a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dr+sam+bailey&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01b-gOy75rUJGaqTiYRkXDWnGSnOw:1623820996484&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjD87HNtJvxAhWL3eAKHcOGAQYQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=625">Google search</a> for her name, and found literally nothing. Whereas other doctors who are favourable to the Covid agenda of the authorities are, coincidentally, given massive platforms and treated like the unquestionable messiah.</p>
<p>This has been going on for quite some time, across multiple areas. This is normal.</p>

        <p>I think this is a false dichotomy - we humans have this really bad habit of thinking everything fits into some kind of binary box - case in point: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>covid is real - but not as scary as is being produced by the fear machine that is the main stream media (that IS a conspiracy, albeit a partially disorganized one - they knowingly use FUD (fear uncertainty doubt) to sell their crap articles and are very aware of it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers ARE being silenced, Luc Montagnier, nobel prize winning virologist stated there was evidence demonstrating the virus came from a lab and was nearly "canceled" completely, he had his research funding pulled, and was generally defamed - and here we are today - stating theres evidence it came from a lab. Same nobel prize winner has also stated that he is very concerned about Vaccine Enhanced Disease as a result of the vaccine, and refuses to get the vaccine. But yea, prominent scientists are in fact being silenced and others wouldn't dare risk themselves in the same way when they have seen others treated so harshly. Its shameful really that none of them have the bravery - at least we have the GBD https://gbdeclaration.org/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mask effectiveness is marginal at best and is completely nullified by mitigating factors (such as allowing dining out) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951820/ - masks do a better job of making people <em>feel</em> safe, like a security blanket </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fecal/oral route is also highly thought to be a major source of spread - tons of ace2 receptors in the intestines and covid has been demonstrated to be present in feces - if we were really serious we would have completely banned ordering food - but well you know - security theater</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the best solution to a pandemic according to epidemiologists is enhanced protection protocols where we protect the most vulnerable and allow the most resilient to build herd immunity - this isn't even controversial - we just threw away the entire playbook due to hysteria</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt; believes in science</p>
<p>Science isn't a belief system - its a pragmatic approach to analyzing the world around us - and everyone demonstrates different levels of scientific literacy, its not binary and its not a belief system. But its been treated like this lately and its quite sickening - because people who say "believe in the science" really mean - "trust the news articles I read" - that are at best a poor understanding of the referenced work or at worst twisting the research to fit some narrative the journalist wants to write - science reporting today is absolutely appalling </p>
<p>anyway - I think its important to realize things don't always fit nicely into distinct groups</p>

        <p>I'm a covid realist, I believe it's a dangerous virus but also think many people have over reacted while others have under reacted. </p>
<p>I think it's pretty obvious from this comment section alone that this sub is almost all "covid denialists," with top voted comments saying things like "it's just a cold" and conflating co-morbidities with covid being "not that bad"</p>
<p>Also if you look around, this sub casually throws around various other far right conspiracy theories and ideas</p>

        <p>I believe I am the person to whom you are referring, since I am the only one at the time of this writing who was mentioned COVID being about as bad as a cold. If you actually read my whole comment and go through my sources, you would realize that those statements you are pooh-poohing are actually quite accurate.</p>
<p>None of what I said is a conspiracy theory, unless by “conspiracy theory,” you mean any idea you and the msm don’t agree with, regardless of the amount of evidence for it. As for “far right”—when did I ever mention politics in any of that? I personally don’t think right or left wing politics are involved at all. Politics—Democrats and Republicans in the states, Tories and Labour in the UK, and whatever you have if you live elsewhere—are just theatre. The “liberals” tend to push the ideas the technocrats want, and the “conservatives” are merely controlled opposition.</p>

        <p>It’s not a “rambling wall of drivel,” and it’s pretty illogical to judge it so harshly before even reading it.</p>
<p>Go do your research <em>before</em> just swallowing what the msm says, and get informed about both sides. </p>
<p>Also, in the kindest way possible, I really don’t think this sub is the place for you, should you choose to continue in your opinions regarding the virus. Nobody on here thinks that. But I do think it’s worth finding out why, rather than proverbially sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming “la la la I can’t hear you.”</p>

        <p>You know, there’s a reason why an ad hominem attack is a fallacy. It’s because it’s not related to the subject matter, and your opponent’s character doesn’t affect the validity of their statements.</p>
<p>I will admit I do look for articles that support my view—simply because I don’t need to do much looking to find articles that support yours. They practically grow on trees, and they all say approximately the same thing. </p>
<p>However, that is not to say they are correct; prevalence of a view point is not necessarily indicative of its correctness. If that were true, then the earth would certainly be flat because most people in the Middle Ages thought so, and plenty of other, equally ridiculous things would be true besides.</p>
<p>If you want to be well-informed, you have to extensively research both sides of the debate, so you fully understand what is going on from an unbiased perspective, and then you can make your decision on who is correct.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read what I wrote, as well as my sources. If I am indeed as crazy as you seem to think, it should be child’s play to debunk.</p>
