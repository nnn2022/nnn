    <strong>Is it really so hard to fathom?</strong>
    <p><p>Is it really that hard to realise a select club, run the world. Literally.... Fuck them and the bullshit that comes from them. Im bored of this "pandemic", its bullshit. I dont really have anything to do otherwise i would be outside right now but what the fuuuuuuuuck. Revert revert, whos head do i have to put a bullet in to stop all this madness.</p>
<p>Now, that weve forgotten about this so called "pandemic" and i can see, you reading this right now, are indeed a fellow, critical thinker. You are awake and conscious and not being manipulated by anything (including me and my words) Would you like to join me? shall we make a discord? or something better? </p>
<p>I wants answers for bohemian grove, esptiens island, child satanic ritual abuse (do no mock me, i have seen testimonies from a few girls, one as young as 9. </p>
<p>I am truly, truly, truly appalled that we as a global society even allow these things to happen... oh yes thats right i remember now... before i was "woke". I was a slave to my phone, my job, my friends....materialistic items and many more things. These days i dont really care, i just want to see some justice. i want to see ghislane live on TV, begging for mercy as to why we shouldn't kill her, i want assange free. I want trump infront of a camera "draining the swamp" (i dont think this is going to happen (but not for the same reason you may think)). </p>
<p>Alex jones said on inforwars that "Q" was a psyop. Let me tell you this, when Trump left office, they wanted the Q movement to die with his departure, hence why he never "drained". Trump has been photographed with Epstein for fuck sake! hes in the sick little club!</p>
<p>They thought if they waited long enough, got us confused enough, got us all into one little movement = "Q" that when it fails we all give up. But we must remember what made us believe Q in the first place.... our instinct. And that my friends, doesn't lie. </p>
<p>Never forget the elite exist and do not have to work a minute a day. They have alot of free time too ;)</p>
<p>Whilst you work your 9-5 job... busy, occupied, distracted. What is bill gates doing? what is ghislaine doing? Trump? biden? harris? clintons? etc etc etc</p></p>
