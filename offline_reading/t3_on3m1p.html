    <strong>There was a time when I used to be able to read disaster and dystopian novels and enjoy them</strong>
    <p><p>I would feel the emotions of the characters as I read the story - the sadness and the pain and the grief and the hopelessness - and then take comfort in the fact that none of it was real, and that <em>I</em> myself did not have to feel this way.</p>
<p>But I recently finished re-reading the novel <em>One Second After</em> (in which an EMP hits the U.S. and the majority of the population dies) for the first time in three years, and instead of finishing the book and slowly leaving this state of sadness with a sigh of relief that <em>thank heavens</em> <em>I’m living in my own life and not the life of the main character and so don’t have to feel like they do,</em> the feeling hasn’t gone away. I haven’t gone away. Because real life <em>is</em> like the book.</p>
<p>For a few minutes after finishing, and while I was engrossed in the story, I could almost pretend that all the emotions I was feeling would end with the book, and that after, I’d be able to breathe easily knowing that <em>my</em> life is happy, and <em>safe</em>, and devoid of any certain major threats to my future and survival. I almost forgot that it isn’t.</p>
<p>The reality of the situation is hitting me hard, again. You’d think I’d have already moved past that stage. I thought I had. I keep telling people I have, that I’ve done my grieving and have moved on to focus only on continuing to live my life as well as possible without letting them win – without letting it drag me down. And I guess I have. I <em>have</em> been trying! I’ve been trying to take it just day by day, been trying to enjoy the little things, been trying not to panic or get angry or be sad for too long.</p>
<p>But I guess all of those things are just distractions. Good distractions. Necessary distractions. Distractions that are able to keep away any real sadness and hopelessness for days at a time. But at the end of the day, just distractions, and I will never be able to fully let it all go.</p>
<p>I will never be able to stop feeling sad about this, because it’s <em>everywhere.</em> And as much as I focus on all the good, as much as I focus on my own life and just chugging along as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening, as if I’m still living in 2019 with hopes for a good future, these aren’t things I can just <em>forget</em>, or push aside for more than a moment. I can’t just run away and hide from The Great Reset/NWO! I can’t just refuse to take the vaccine and continue to live my normal life, travelling and doing what I want! I can’t just pretend nothing is happening until it magically goes away! It doesn’t work like that! And <em>yes</em>, I’ve now shifted to focusing on my immediate future (days, weeks, months) and living the best life I can to the best of my abilities while I still have it, but reality doesn’t just vanish. You know this, I know this. It doesn’t matter how many times people tell me the above – which again, is what I’m <em>trying to do!</em> – it doesn’t change what’s going on around me. It doesn’t change all the ways this is impacting my life. It doesn’t change how fucking <em>bleak</em> the future is going to be, if I even get to fucking live through it in the first place. Do you get what I mean?! Yes, it’s all well and good to do all of this, and don’t get me wrong, it really is, and of course it makes things better to deal with, but it doesn’t really solve anything. I know it’s what’s right for me, for my mental and physical health, for my own sanity, for my enjoyment, but it doesn’t change reality.</p>
<p>I’m not like this all the time. While I never <em>forget</em>, I do distract myself heaps and I’m still enjoying my life. It’s just been a little difficult over the last few days, especially now that I’ve finished re-reading the book. When I first read it at 15 (I’m 19 now), I was able to put it down and feel the relief of knowing that my real life was nothing like that; that I wasn’t facing TEOTWAKI (the end of the world as we know it) in any real way, shape or form. But today I put the book down knowing that I <em>am</em> facing TEOTWAKI, and are, in many ways, already in it.</p>
<p>Almost every day I’m fighting so much to just <em>stop thinking</em>, fighting to not let it take over, trying to turn my thoughts around and be positive and hopeful and say things like ‘well at least I’ll live an interesting life’ and really <em>believe</em> it, but it’s difficult. Especially because I’m so susceptible to other people’s feelings and thoughts, so when I read a comment on here that talks about how bleak everything is, or see a bit of news that reminds me of the world I'm now in, the dam breaks, and all the thoughts I’d been able to temporarily keep at bay with distractions come flooding back in. They no longer sweep me away, as they did back when I was first realising the truth about all of this (almost a year ago), but they certainly knock me over, and if I’m not careful, I choke or half-drown for a bit (for a few hours to a few days). Like right now, I guess.</p>
<p>When I read a hopeful or positive comment about the situation, I <em>do</em> feel that rush of hope and optimism, but of course there’s more negative. It’s a fucking shitty reality we’re facing (and already living in), and I’m trying, but it’s just so <em>difficult</em> to fight against all the hopelessness and despair! And the water never goes away. It doesn’t matter how many times I distract myself, or for how long. I never stop standing in the way of it, watching as the cracks start to form on the concrete of the dam, and knowing that it’s only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down again.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I can no longer make any plans more than a month in advance, and even that is too much, as everything I look forward to in the short-term ends up getting cancelled because of lockdowns or restrictions (I'm in Melbourne). Long-term plans are practically non-existent. I can't travel, and will never be able to again. There's no point in going to Uni and/or getting a job, as it's only a matter of time now (probably before the end of the year) before we get hit by a "cyber pandemic" that renders any savings we might have in the bank obsolete, and forces 'survival' into being the number one priority. I probably won't live to see the end of this decade - and that's if I'm lucky enough to even make it that far - but even if I do, the world will be so different and horrible that I won't be able to achieve any of my hopes and dreams anyway. So what's the point? The only thing I can do is live through each day on its own.</p>

        <p>You guys got it so hard it really pains me. I mean I'm in the US in one of the most totalitarian States but overall I've been able to survive by ignoring the mask mandates unless absolutely necessary and I never felt government personally coming down at me for being outside my home. However as a result of this lockdown and grief I've decided to continue with acceptance and commitment therapy as well as individual counseling. What has been heartbreaking to me is that my mother and I haven't spent more time together we were separated and the powers that be didn't allow us to be together. And she died very unexpectedly last year so absolutely heartbreaking.</p>

        <p>I really resonate with this; thank you for taking the time to post. Dystopian novels/movies have always been my favorite, even as far back as middle school (I’m mid-30s now).  I don’t know how to feel anymore.</p>
<p>I have always been a happy person, never depressed or sad. 2020 REALLY took it out of me. I started 2021 by removing almost all social media, only staying on when I felt I could benefit from it (seeing my son’s daycare updated on FB, keeping up with my local mom’s group, etc.).  I cleared out my inbox and set myself up to only receive one newsletter with that days headlines. I tried to step away from here a lot and generally just practice being more present, not taking things for granted, and being in control when and where I could.  These past few weeks have knocked be back a bit again. First the news in France, then the news about masks in Los Angeles, and today, seeing half a dozen different children in masks at my local grocery store. I literally teared up in the produce section thinking about these children.  </p>
<p>I have a second son due in October and am constantly battling the guilt I feel bringing him into this world and not feeling confident for his or my other son’s future.</p>

        <p>I wanted to have more children, but there's no way I can choose to do so now without divine intervention taking the choice from me. I have nightmares where I'm running from something but can only hold my two kids, how could I hold a third and not be left behind?</p>

        <p>Thank you. It took several months to grieve over the idea of not having more children, so I am more at peace now. I decided to focus more on raising my two that are here to be as open minded and as knowledgeable as possible. </p>
<p>I wish you a peaceful birth with your little one soon to arrive. Cocoon yourself into the newborn stage and enjoy every little moment you can (even the sleepless newborn nights, lol).</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading. Dystopian and disaster stories have always been my favourite as well. I'm sorry the world is such a rocky place to bring kids into at the moment. I don't know what I'd do if I had kids to take care of on top of everything. Hope everything goes as well as it can for you and your family, and here's hoping that sometime in the future we will be free from all of this, however long it may take.</p>

        <p>Firstly, DS9 episode- homefront. I can't watch that ever again without drawing parallels between whats going on right now in the world.</p>
<p>Secondly, have you ever read much about the philosophy of stoicism? It's easier read than practiced I know but still may be helpful to you.
I guess our virtues are our greatest strengths now.</p>
