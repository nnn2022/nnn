        <p>Ya this was nuts, and even worse, every time we see these interactions the cops almost always end up taking down their muzzles too! Come the fuck on already people! You know damn well this has moved past science and most definitely is about signs of obedience. I spit on your forced compliance!</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely, my family and I like to talk about all the homeless people who haven’t died from corona and not wearing masks. Maybe they have super immune systems even despite some doing hard drugs. Just the overwhelming ridiculousness of it all is astounding. </p>
<p>The people still arguing for it have to be either incapable of critical thinking, willfully following the agenda for whatever change they want to happen(I believe the global agenda) or too insecure to speak out against the experts for some reason, like embarrassment because of course people in their fields can never be wrong and we must never question them.</p>

        <p>No one seems to mention the homeless people.  Before they had fast food restaurants, libraries etc to be in but now they fend for themselves.  I think there were shelters but many ads I saw were saying they were locked down so I’m unsure if new people could come</p>

        <p>Ya I heard a lot of shelters were closed or taking a lot fewer people. Mostly I’m talking about the massive homeless in Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, places like that. I’ve seen videos where people filming had either asked them(homeless) to slap on a mask or the person filming was masked and like no homeless people were, and as far as I know they aren’t dropping like flies from covid.</p>

        <p>My MIL said because one cop here was suspected to have died of Covid, it's apparently raging through PDs. There's a reason you haven't seen widespread police deaths (as far as the virus is concerned, violence is another story.)</p>

        <p>This is terrifying and very upsetting. It’s either okay to be violent with people or it isn’t . The double standerds s for different authority figures is disgusting. Why is it okay to get in someone’s physical space if they don’t respect authority the way you want them to? Fuck, I really hate this.</p>

        <p>The police were there responding to reports that the man had coughed on other passengers. In the UK, you can be arrested for assault if you do that. He then refused to comply with the police officer. I think the police officer could have handled the situation better but this man was in the wrong here.</p>

        <p>Yeah he was a prick, apparently was purposefully coughing on other passengers and smug about it. As gross as spitting at someone, I don't mean during covid times I mean always. Anyone there can claim an exemption for masks it's very lax. It was about his behaviour not the mask.</p>
