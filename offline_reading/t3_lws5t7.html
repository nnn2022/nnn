    <strong>What's in your 'vaccine'?</strong>
    <p><p>Last night somebody posted a pic of this information sheet on another sub so I commented on it before realising it wasn't in here, then realised I was involved in an argument with several people, explaining to me how great the covid 'vaccines' are. So this morning I asked my mum for the info they gave her after her first jab and thought you guys would like to see it.</p>
<p>Anyone for a chimpanzee adenovirus, with a little GMO chaser?</p>
<p>The covid vaccines are great btw..... /s</p>

        <p>Yes.  I am doing my best to instill these things.
From my perspective, I saw the potential of this the moment they announced the 2 week lockdown.  It was either going to not be necessary if they were wrong about the transmissibility and it wasn't necessary or the more likely scenario, two weeks wouldn't make a dent in the spread and sure enough, we are more or less 1 year and counting.
So many of the other "conspiracy theory" predictions have also become true such as vaccine passports, and other erosion of civil liberties.<br>
A lot of the even more paranoid sounding stuff I was skeptical about before looking into myself such as the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">WEF's Great Reset agenda</a>.  I think it's natural to be skeptical/curious about what happens at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos">Davos</a>.
I am not familiar with /collapse so I can't comment on that but in my experience with this, the predictions that I have been wrong on are the optimistic ones.  My best example of that was that people would see Tom Hanks recover just fine and the hysteria would subside, haha.  There are a number of reasons why I now realize that didn't happen but I don't need to get into that but the bottom line is that we all were initially sold the image of something so terrifyingly deadly, it seemed like societal collapse was imminent but even after the reality was shown to be much different than that, the narrative has evolved to perpetuate the situation.</p>
<p>For example, it was originally framed as an existential threat to all of us but when the statistics did not indicate a significant fatal risk across all ages, it turned into "but what about the long term damages?"</p>
<p>Fast forward to where we are now, and we have a vaccine that works but people aren't happy with that.  Now the focus/goal is on pressuring everyone to take it.  But even if everyone did, it's likely that strain mutations will require a new version next year as I have finally been hearing doctors admit.</p>
<p>Circling back to this original post...  I don't think it's wrong for people to be skeptical about putting newly rushed technology/medicine into their body, especially when there are things such as  "chimpanzee adenovirus" "Produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells" or "Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene."</p>
<p>I know that the mantra is trust/believe the science but you don't have to take anything from me on this, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635613/">here</a> is an academic book review published in 2012 that outlines many good reasons that people shouldn't have blind faith in pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<p>Isn't that <em>exactly</em> what this sub is doing?</p>
<p>&rt; I don't think it's wrong for people to be skeptical about putting newly rushed technology/medicine into their body</p>
<p>Skeptical means following the evidence. Not rejecting it. While these vaccines were expedited, they still followed all of the usual safety protocols. </p>
<p>&rt;especially when there are things such as "chimpanzee adenovirus" "Produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells" or "Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene."</p>
<p>Which is why we should discourage people from posting things without context whose only goal is to scare others. </p>
<p>&rt; here is an academic book review published in 2012 that outlines many good reasons that people shouldn't have blind faith in pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>What blind faith are you referring to? That's the straw man that will lead this sub right to promoting lies. Let me quote from that link.</p>
<p>&rt;Of more than stylistic concern is Goldacre's frequent recourse to the kind of journalistic hyperbole familiar from the red-top press. The first sentence in the book is exactly such a mindless attention grabber: ‘Medicine is broken’. How can a practising doctor possibly make such an assertion? Little concern, evidently, for the harm to patients – his mantra throughout the book – that this foolish remark could cause if anyone believed it. The fact is that medicine is one of the most successful and valued enterprises in the civilised world and, as Goldacre himself acknowledges, it owes a great deal to medicines developed in the last few decades, despite the flaws in the process. A little further on, he speaks of ‘a murderous disaster’ resulting from these flaws. Does he really believe that murder, i.e. deliberate killing, has happened? Of course not, but in this forum, impact matters more than meaning.</p>
<p>You can be technically correct and still be doing harm to your cause.</p>

        <p>For me, this all comes down to the core foundation of what a government and society of free peoples is founded on:
"The First Amendment protects several basic freedoms in the United States including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government. It was part of the Bill of Rights that was added to the Constitution on December 15, 1791."</p>
<p>Corona has caused a practically all of the principles of the First Amendment to be superseded because of a society gripped in fear.  We saw the beginning of this after 9/11 where as a society people were willing to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/top-ten-abuses-power-911">give up more power to the government</a> in exchange for safety.  But even then, none of that was in such direct conflict with core foundation of a government by the people for the people.  You can't just temporarily suspend such fundamental rights and hope to get them back some day because there will always be another crisis that causes us to question them.</p>

        <p>Okay.  I gave you my 2 cents and upvotes but that is all I have to give I guess.  I think you have made your position pretty clear and we have a fundamental disagreement on our position in society on how its relationship to authority.</p>

<p>And I might as well address your other comment here. Why does it matter what other subs do? You're a mod here. You should be pushing to help inform. Not spread fear.</p>

        <p>You were criticizing some individual comment trying to say that one person's thought is representative of the entire subreddit and I'm just saying that's an unfair double standard on the other subs where nobody argues that any bad apples spoil the whole bunch.</p>

        <p>Yes it is a proof that they are not in the open market since 1906. What argument are you trying to raise against history?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry</a></p>
<p><em>The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs.</em></p>
<p>Any paper you bring in as a proof for those secret serums, cannot be independently analyzed, it cannot be independently tested, it cannot be independently verified, it cannot be traded in the open market. It's that simple.</p>

        <p>Prions are misfolded proteins that, when in contact with other proteins, misfolds those causing a cascade of degenerative protein decay. The uptake of mRNA back into the genome via reverse transcriptase can cause weird mutations in an amino acid sequence if integrated. One potential consequence of that are prions, especially if it is a repeated sequence. </p>

        <p>I’m going off of things I’ve learned in college and my job. It has been theorized that prions come from a combination of viral genes and host genes. I can’t find the specific study right now, but here’s the scientific American article that got me thinking about it. </p>

        <p>I don’t think they have considered this. Especially since many of the side effects that we’re being told not to worry about are autoimmune in nature. I don’t believe it’s much of a jump to logically assume that this can happen. Especially in the speed at which they implemented several different vaccines. </p>
<p>In fact I think it’s asinine to assume it won’t happen. Murphy’s Law and such. I know from my background in genetics that messing with the central dogma of protein production never leads to desirable outcomes.</p>

<p>Based on what? </p>

<p>And what exactly is your training and job? Because that kind of matters.</p>

<p>Well that's a scientific argument.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe they considered this due to the rapid pace at which they developed and implemented the vaccine. The polio vaccine took almost 3 decades to actually get approved for use. The first trial of the vaccine went live in 1936 and was approved by the FDA in 1961. The corona vaccine was put through in less than three months on a platform that is not really studied. </p>
<p>I work as a lab tech at a start up company developing cancer research and treatment equipment. Not sure why that matters. This is Reddit and everything is taken at face value anyway. </p>
<p>Murphy’s law applies very well to genetics because of the random nature of gene integrations and mutations. You never can 100% identify where a gene will splice into DNA or how the resulting protein will interact with the cell or other proteins, hence my theory that this could result in a prion further down the road. It’s logical.</p>

<p>So no one thought of this thing you know. </p>
<p>&rt;The first trial of the vaccine went live in 1936 and was approved by the FDA in 1961</p>
<p>Gee. Do you think medicine has advanced since then?</p>
<p>&rt;The corona vaccine was put through in less than three months on a platform that is not really studied. </p>
<p>Why do you say that?</p>
<p>&rt;I work as a lab tech</p>
<p>So you don't actually understand this. You're essentially a burger flipper for a more advanced industry.</p>
<p>It matters a lot. Because a little knowledge is dangerous. You have some information but not enough to understand when your understanding is incorrect. </p>
<p>&rt;Murphy’s law applies very well to genetics because of the random nature of gene integrations and mutations</p>
<p>Because you say so?</p>
<p>&rt;hence my theory that this could result in a prion further down the road.</p>
<p>Hold on. Are you saying that this theory is yours alone? That you came up with it? Go ask your bosses tomorrow. See what they say. Report back.</p>

        <p>What do you think a character attack is? You are presenting your personal education and work as evidence. Challenging that isn't attacking your character. </p>
<p>Is anyone credible raising the same concerns? Is it considered reasonable by people who actually understand this field?</p>
