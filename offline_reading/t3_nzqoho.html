<title>New Normal in Germany, Part 27/x: A suspension bridge has been closed with NATO wire. It is considered an "amusement park-like facility" and that is why there must be distance requirements, mask requirements and visitor documentation 24/7.</title>

<p>How absurd can it get? Yes. In Germany the satirists become unemployed because they are overtaken by reality.</p>
<p>The bridge was classified by the Rhein-Hunsrück district as an "amusement park-like facility", which people can only enter if the corresponding Corona rules are observed. The Geierlay (name of the bridge) is part of a hiking trail and does not resemble an amusement park. The village of Mörsdorf (\~700 inhabitants) is of course not able to control all distance rules, mask rules and record all addresses, as in amusement parks. The police then cordoned off the bridge with NATO wire.</p>
<p>There are no cash registers, gates and fences at the bridge. Because, well, it is a bridge. Not an "amusement park-like facility" The Mayor was stating: "Maybe we will come to the conclusion that we are scrapping the thing." </p>
<p>According to the tourist information office in Kastellaun, people "ignored the Corona measures before the closure. On the bridge, people hardly kept their distance, people took off their masks for selfies. The bridge had to be closed."</p>
