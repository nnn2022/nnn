    <strong>Why can't we vote on public places being open?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm against doing an overall vote on lockdown vs no-lockdown because of how misinformed most people are (average person thinks death rate is 2-3%), but if we directly voted on the opening of schools and libraries, the popular vote would almost certainly swing towards opening. I live in a 99% liberal city, and 89% of parents voted for schools to be at least partially open, but apparently we don't like democracy here in Mass so that didn't happen.</p></p>

        <p>The idea that the government is beholden to the people has fallen to the wayside, and that was long before than pandemic occurred. In my liberal city, a report came out showing that most of the schools met the enhanced ventilation standards needed to get through the pandemic, but the teachers union won’t budge, and wants ALL of the schools to meet this new high standard before instruction resumes. With the district having hundreds of schools, having at least some of the students return is feasible. On top of that, they’re against a very limited return to instruction for pre-K and special Ed students.</p>
