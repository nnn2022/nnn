    <strong>Some Assertions from Medical Professionals in my Family</strong>
    <p><p>Hey! I know this can't be used as evidence to the same extent that actual statistics can, but I thought I'd share some things that medical professionals actually on the "front lines" have said about this virus.</p>
<p>I have a close family friend that is a nurse who said that, in my state, the death rate has been flat since MAY. Despite the surge after the protests, our cases are still nowhere near the peak and the virus has effectively begun to burn itself out in the state...though my lovely governor is threatening to shut down again despite the fact that people are no longer dying.</p>
<p>A more unsettling take from a more distant relative that I saw at a party (I know, lock me up) said that people getting tested, if they tested positive, were being added to the data base every single time they were tested as a new case. This will obviously inflate the numbers to an extent and will completely throw off the case count and death rate, as one person could've died but since the same person was reported as having multiple cases, it could result in added deaths being reported. That is terrifyingly fucked up. </p>
<p>Also, before I get into the last experience, I also wanted to say that my state (Michigan, if you couldn't already tell by how bitter and dejected I sound) will average at about 2 deaths per day, but will randomly have days of 15 and 17, which sends people into a frenzy. If you look at the fine print, however, it will state that 13/15 or 15/17, etc. were deaths either associated with the virus or were deaths added from the past few months that "haven't been counted." On top of that, Whitmer keeps threatening for us to move backwards in her little plan if cases keep rising, though few of the cases have been serious so hospital beds aren't being taken up and it doesn't matter if people are getting it, as long as they aren't dying.</p>
<p>Anyways, the last thing I wanted to mention was that my close friend's sibling went to college with someone who was looking at treatments for Coronavirus and, unfortunately I can't remember the medication, but I believe it was Hydrocloroquine, it was tested on a floor of patients. Apparently the entire floor was cleared within a few weeks and people were back to their normal selves. It definitely makes you think, especially knowing that hydrochloroquine is a very cheap and readily available drug to use that could get us back to normal much sooner, much like many other medications being tested right now, unlike vaccines, which cost a hell of a lot, and take longer. Gross stuff.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah that drug has been used for over half a century with amazing results and is still in use today- until Trump said positive things about it. After that several countries went bat-shit crazy on the media about how the drug will kill you and France even pulled the drug and put it on their toxic list. </p>
<p>My roommate was a pharmacist tech at Walgreens and told me that the drug was so commonly used that it had a dedicated dispenser for quick prescription filling. </p>
<p>But big pharma has can't let a crisis go to waste and wants to sell expensive vaccines. That's why YouTube, Facebook, and Google will ban all text and videos on hydroxichloriquin.</p>

        <p>I totally misspelled that name hahah, but I definitely agree that its a money and power scheme since having an effective cure already would lose money and support of lockdown/government overreach</p>

<p>I feel for you.  I am a Buckeye.  I have nothing but sympathy for you people in That State Up North.   Ohio's response was over the top.  Yours is just Wackadoodle. </p>
<p>On the other topic</p>
<p>*hydroxychloroquine   response is just flooring me.  First two studies find it harmful.  Both are later  <strong>*withdrawn</strong> from publication.   The clinical studies done were on people in ICU when it was never intended for critical patients but as a prophylactic.    Plus no one seems to have used the HCQ and zinc and antibiotic protocol that seems to have worked.</p>
<p>Except in Turkey.  And Brazil and 15 other countries that are using it to apparent good effect.  I highly recommend looking up Dr. Vladimir Zelenko.  He speaks very plainly about his results on 2400 patients.  And insists that timing is critical.  If there are symptoms, start treatment now, test later.</p>

        <p>I went to Ohio a few weeks ago and it was very overwhelming, but it felt like a break compared to Michigan. I don't know how that's even possible because before the virus, Michigan was a very calm place to live.</p>
<p>I've heard the name before, but I don't know much about Dr. Zelenko. I'll have to look into it, but that makes total sense. It's almost like things that solve problems a little faster and cost less are being repressed so people are dependent on the government for instruction longer.</p>

        <p>Essentially this is the guy that first turned the Evil Orange Man onto HCQ.   A family practitioner in upstate NY.   In very short as a GP he was seeing a lot of sick people.  It didn't make any sense to him to wait for a CV-19 test, which at that point was taking over 3 days in NY, so he started treatment immediately on presentation with a protocol that seemed reasonable and better than nothing. </p>
<p>He kept records and seems to have a survival rate several times higher than most any other treatment.   But it wasn't a double blind randomized study.</p>

<p>Actually chart out deaths by the date they happened and it becomes abundantly clear that not only is the pandemic over, it's been over for months.</p>

        <p>Literally l, its absolutely insane. It's a manipulation of information that isn't "technically" wrong, because it hasn't been disproved or fully looked into, to keep the fear alive in people when the numbers are realistically low. Every time there's a spike in deaths in Michigan, my family looks at the actual report and has both a good laugh and terrified conversation because it's always old deaths.</p>
