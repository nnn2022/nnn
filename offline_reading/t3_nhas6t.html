    <p><p>My school has constantly changed entrance requirements. For weeks after reopening they let me in with a temp check and saying I don't have covid. They then wanted documentation so I brought in a negative test. They then tried to set up an application with a qr code. The application did not function properly. I let them know this each time I entered school. They kept making me show them that their tech didn't work. They kept saying they fixed it but it didn't work for weeks. I showed them over and over that their tech didn't work. </p>
<p>I showed up to school yesterday and the security woman called administration and would not look at my paper or scan me in. She called administration on her radio to come deal with me. It quickly went from me and two security people to like 10 people in a flash. I started recording and I ended up yelling. I don't normally do that but every day for weeks they have been making my life difficult because their tech didn't work properly. I have been covid negative the whole time. They have let us on campus the whole time. It is them creating a shit show from nothing. </p>
<p>This morning the security guard walked up to me in my car and called me by name. She said that she felt disrespected by what I was yelling. She said she is just trying to do her job. I told her the people that waged the Holocaust tried to say they were just doing their job too. Just following orders is not acceptable. She didn't know what to say to that. </p>
<p>I'm not usually an asshole but they have been hounding me for weeks.</p></p>

        <p>Don't apologize. The fact that she tried to call you out the next day (when this issue should have been buried and forgotten) shows that she has been seething and stewing over the fact that she got called out.</p>
