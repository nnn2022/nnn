    <strong>Losing All Connections</strong>
    <p><p>I've lost about 95% of my social connections this year, and at least 80% of them are not coming back. I don't want to be friends with someone who decides to exclude me from their "pod" when they know I live alone and have no family nearby.</p>
<p>I don't want to associate with people who become so terrified that they go WAY beyond CDC recommendations and completely isolate themselves (except a few select friends, of course) while blaming others for causing deaths. I've even see people arguing in all seriousness that anyone who wasn't in hard isolation for the last 9 months should be <em>denied medical treatment</em> if they get sick. </p>
<p>My faith in humanity has been broken, and my trust in people as well. I'm now very cautious about who I spend my time with, who I permit to see my true self. </p>
<p>I'm afraid this will have serious consequences for our culture. The city where I live was once an open and free place, where entrepreneurs and artists others got together and did interesting things. There was a plurality of thinking and free exchange of ideas. Now I think it will be permanently closed off, suspicious, and the "witch trial" mentality will continue but this time applied to "anti-racism" or "green" initiatives. I consider myself left leaning, probably far more than the average Democrat, but I'm also staunchly anti-authoritarian and want free expression to be how discourse is handled.</p>
<p>I'm considering moving somewhere more remote to live in a small town. There would be nothing to do, but I would be at least free from the feeling of oppression and control.</p></p>

        <p>You're not alone. I absolutely hate the way people I love just turned from having a healthy distrust of authority to being complete mind slaves. Whenever the "pandemic" comes up in conversations they just seem to not be able to go outside of their programming. Like npcs in a video game.
It's disgusting.
I can only imagine it will get worse too and eventually when there are stricter laws I expect being betrayed by the people I once called friends and family. Doing everything I can to try to instill a little bit of scepticism but one moment they can understand it then the day after they exclaim: "xxxx got covid omg it's getting real bad now!"</p>
<p>Only the thing keeping me going is the knowledge that I am in control of myself. I imagine a grim future.</p>

        <p>I have little joke recently that in the movie of life, I am Liesl and my sister is Rolf.</p>
<p>She used to be my best friend, but now I am pretty sure she would turn me in. It's the weirdest realization, but I've been seeing glimmers of this potentiality in her, and I'm not taking any chances.</p>

        <p>I can relate to this too. People I have known a decade or longer have completely turtled and cut themselves off from any critically thinking person. It’s all Fauci and CDC or you’re literally killing people. They’ve also lost interest in typical and now safe activities. They won’t leave their homes for anything but the grocery store and seldom see close relations. It’s awful. This is ruining lives and many don’t even realize it.</p>

        <p>The wildest thing to me is that they go WAY BEYOND what the CDC says to do! The mask and distancing thing was ALWAYS presented as a preventative measure to <em>slow the spread</em> of a disease. They never say that a mask prevents the disease or that distancing would cure Covid.</p>
<p>The CDC definitely never said, "harass your friends online for going to visit their family they haven't seen in almost a year."</p>

        <p>I feel you. I have been asked to distance in photos that take about 10 seconds to take because I wasn’t wearing a mask, but the two girls that were could stand together and link arms. Since when is taking a quick picture a massive COVID risk? These aren’t photo shoots with hair and makeup artists and such. It’s a quick shot for a Facebook page. </p>
<p>I’ve lost friends for suggesting they might want to relax their hysteria a little bit. When they’re not even high risk (or caring for someone who is) or working “on the front lines”. They were just virtue signaling about their 90-day self isolation. That’s not to mention the disagreements I’ve had about mask mandates with people who practically worship masks. I lost some friends early on who accuser d me of saying their life doesn’t matter or the life of their immune compromised father doesn’t matter. But that’s never what I said. I just suggested this is overblown in a status and they got hurt about it. One of the girls was flipping out about going to work in a bank and complaining what people were buying at CVS. So why does that make her so much better than me? </p>
<p>I also unfriended someone else who was angry at people having Easter gatherings because she believed she was doing the right thing by not seeing her mother and she was upset that others didn’t make that choice. </p>
<p>I don’t have room for people like this. I’m sure they have done things like hoard groceries that prove they don’t care about other people the way they claim.</p>

        <p>I lost a bunch of friends and quit some after I predicted the lockdown crap would continue well into November. That was called "misinformation" and I think someone reported me. Well here we are!</p>
<p>I agree that the attitude during this has really made it easy to pick out the people that I don't want to be friends with. I have friends that have different views from me, but we can hangout and get along without immediately bringing politics / virtue signaling to the forefront.</p>
<p>But then there are some who cannot. These are ALL people who bugged me before Covid but since March they have becoming intolerable. So I have cut them off.</p>

<p>I know I have become intolerable to those I know - but only because I disagree and refuse to believe. I've lost friends too, it depresses me most because I thought they were intelligent, but I see now they were not.</p>

<p>Nobody understands that I need to feel like a person, not a diseased murderer. Heaven for me is seeing people out living their lives with their whole faces visible.</p>
<p>I panic and I can't stop seeing everything as the beginning of the end. Everyone assures me that this has to end soon because people don't like it. Except, people actually do like the lockdowns and rules and masks, they all are only looking at the positives of the situation and completely ignoring how all this has started the collapse.</p>

<p>The day of 9/11 everyone was in awe. I personally called it all bullshit as soon as building 7 fell. A couple years later, 10 percent of people did not believe the official story. Now it's over 50 percent of the people do not believe the official story. Keep pushing ahead. </p>
<p>They are in a fog, much like someone in a relationship with an abuser, they can't see the abuse when they are in the thick of it. </p>

        <p>I don't actually care about convincing people Covid is a scam. I personally believe the virus does exist, but it's been hijacked by politicians and people in power to manipulate the population  into accepting more control of their lives. My goal is more to get people to question the government, question why an authority would be better able to decide how to live  your life than you are, use independent thinking, keep some skepticism and never be more than 90% certain of  any view  you hold, etc.</p>
<p>I often feel like I'm the only sane person left. However, when I talk to individuals in private, they often express skepticism or dislike certain parts of the official rhetoric, etc. – but they are too afraid to speak out at the risk of being attacked.</p>

        <p>Convincing them Covid is a scam is a means to your end. Virus or not, the narrative is bullshit. </p>
<p>You need examples in real time to convince them of the truth. You cant just say, "don't trust the Govt."  </p>
<p>There is no bigger power grab so far in your lifetime, it's bigger than 9/11. Use the examples that Covid provides to get the results you're stating you wish for. </p>
<p>&rt;However, when I talk to individuals in private, they often express skepticism or dislike certain parts of the official rhetoric, etc. – but they are too afraid to speak out at the risk of being attacked.</p>
<p>There is no fix for this. You're either scared of ridicule or you are not. The ones that are will lead themselves to their own demise, and deserve everything they get.</p>

        <p>I think couching it as "a scam" is counter-productive as it immediately sounds like a conspiracy theory. I think the better argument is against the non-scientific basis for lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Well then you're perpetuating the use of the term conspiracy theory as a pejorative term to make someone sound crazy. </p>
<p>It is a conspiracy. The largest one you've ever known. </p>
<p>But, I do understand what you are saying. </p>
<p>Science is a religion, you're arguing with cultists. You can't use the tools they use against you, against them. That would be like telling a devout Christian that the bible is bullshit. </p>
<p>Help me if I'm missing something here, but all the lockdowns are based on their "science". How do you plan on telling them their religion is bullshit without sounding like a conspiracy theorist? </p>
<p>Listen, it won't really matter what you say or do, it's mostly futile. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try though. Even if you push them along a little bit to make their own conclusions, it's a win.</p>

        <p>I don't think it is a conspiracy. I mean, I don't believe there is some group that planned out the events of 2020 in detail. I think the virus was probably released as an accident but was likely created in a lab in China. But once it got out, the Chinese clearly didn't do anything to contain it to just China. And once it got to the West, governments realized it wasn't such a deadly virus but it could be used to advance some  efforts that our governments wanted to do. There is, of course, business interests between the powerful elite in the West and China . Someone described it better as a "concatenation of interests."</p>

        <p>So you're in agreeance that govt. capitalizes on chaos, doesn't let a crisis go to waste, but yet doesn't create the crisis? </p>
<p>So, they wait patiently for people who can't fly planes to fly them into targets, and wait for someone to just "oopsie my bad" a virus into the public to put forth power grabs they always had planned in the first place..ie Agenda 201(Covid) and the Project for a New American Century(9/11)? </p>

        <p>I think there are a lot that are trying to  capitalize  on the panic surrounding Covid on both sides. I'm hesitant to say whether it's a real thing or just another "think tank" overstating its power.</p>
<p>I think the best bet is that neoliberals want things to get back to "normal" and have trade with China resume so they can keep making money. For a big "reset" scenario, I have to ask, who would profit? If it's run by the power elite I doubt there will be big changes. The more likely scenario is that the powerful would want things to return to pre-Covid things as soon as possible so they can rake in profits.</p>

        <p>As you can tell by reading the comments in this thread, you're clearly not alone. I currently live in California city that is hopelessly brainwashed. I only have two co-workers, both of whom are women of an advanced age, and they're absolutely insufferable to listen to during staff meetings. One of them claims to be knowledgeable about medicine and yet she's frothing at the mouth at the opportunity to get the vaccine ASAP despite the lack of long-term safety testing. There's no convincing these zombies of anything. They've already subscribed to the church of Gates &amp; Fauci. I'm planning on moving my family to Florida next year, and hopefully next year isn't too late. I fear all state-to-state travel will be banned soon. Hang in there.</p>

        <p>The state to state travel ban is my fear too. I may just go back to live with family in Illinois before that happens if they announce that they are going to do that. I have been waiting for them to close the highways or something. If they announce that or even start discusssing it, I will break my lease and put everything in storage, and drive back home at 100 MPH. No way am I letting some corrupt government prevent me from seeing my own fucking family.</p>

        <p>I understand completely...</p>
<p>I am alienated from my family and they choose not to have me around because I don't wear a mask.</p>
<p>I'm single and no kids and I have always been a loner any way. My work life was where I was getting most of my emotional and social needs met. Sounds pathetic, I know, but it worked for me because the nature of my work was very personal and fostered human connection. Now I work from home and am alone all day and night, except for my online connections and occasional check-ins with neighbors. This is hands down THE loneliest time of my life.</p>
<p>Thank god for my two cats, one of whom is a kitten. They kind of save me some days.</p>
<p>My aloneness is existential too, like it is for many of us. The road narrows a lot when you reject the "New Normal."</p>

<p>I've told a lot of people that all this is so much more difficult to handle when you know that we are being lied to.  All this makes no sense if we are to believe what we are told.</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I have a constant level of anger/outrage to deal with, while also working full-time in a very people-oriented job where I have to be smiling and upbeat. And I truly cannot give one more ounce of energy to people who willfully blind themselves (out of fear, I'm sure) to what is being perpetrated on citizens all over the world. I need to keep my sanity..</p>

<p>I think it helps to stay connected to other sane people. Taking care of our health as best we can (which is a huge challenge if you're depressed), stepping away from the news. Things like that..</p>

        <p>I'm with you man. I don't want friends who are pussies. That's another way to put it. I understand if people have conditions that put them at risk. But other than that, friends who buy into the hysteria don't deserve my time and focus. I have no respect for that.</p>

        <p>Right there with you. Very sad, hurt, scared and bitter from the selfishness and aggression that this has brought out in people. I’m more of a misanthrope than ever after watching all this go down. People will defend ideology that never even existed a few months ago, over their own so called “friends”. Cult like is right.</p>

        <p>I can relate. It’s hard realizing so many friends are basically morons. </p>
<p>I’ve kept my close friends, even the ones that went overboard. It’s mostly my list of casual friends that had been trimmed way down.</p>

        <p>Oh god I feel this so much. I wish we lived in the same city so we could hang out. Speaking of which, I think we need anti-lockdown support groups in various cities so that people like us can connect with each other and create our own, new tribe of supportive friends. I wish I knew how to make that happen.</p>

        <p>I actually really do think this is going to have a permanent effect on our culture, but not in the way that the government seems to think. I don't think it's completely lost on people that governors have seized control and are unilaterally making policy for their own political advantage. I also doubt it's lost on business owners that these governors really didn't give a crap about causing their years of hard work to collapse in front of their eyes. </p>
<p>I think trust in the government is going to be permanently damaged as a result when this thing finally ends. I also think that people lost of a lot of respect for the legitimacy of the Court system, where courts took months and months to hear these claims at all, and a lot of the time voted in a purely partisan manner when deciding the constitutional issues.</p>
