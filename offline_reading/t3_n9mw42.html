    <strong>How do we fight back?</strong>
    <p><p>Someone in another sub asked this question. My answer: Exactly what you are doing. Speak out. Question authority. Publicly. Join the call to action. Reach out to family and friends. Ask them to question what's right. Learn more. Ask them if they understand. There's truth in both sides. Find ways of sowing seeds of doubt. Taking care of your own health and lead others to do the same. Believe in yourself. ... There's no right answer. But I've always found it's easier to teach someone to change than it is to force someone to change. If you show them that changes are coming and the have a choice in what that change looks like... Perhaps they'll choose a better world. 
How do you believe we should fight back (non-violently of course)?</p></p>

<p>Fight back? What a joke. Not even your family will have your back.</p>
