    <strong>Why are small businesses defining to stay closed? Same reason Iraqi soldiers surrendered by the thousands in the gulf war.</strong>
    <p><p>In case you don’t know Iraq he soldiers surrendered by the thousands in the gulf war. American military also expected 30,000 casualties on the first day after we crossed from Saudi Arabia into Iraq. Now as for the surrendering Iraqis they were probably thinking “The American bombing campaign destroyed our military. So if we stay and fight we’ll just get slaughtered so what’s the point”. The small business owners are now thinking “if we decide to open what’s the worse the government can do shut us down? we’re on the verge of shutting down anyway so what’s the point“ and just like American military planners suspected we would receive 30,000 casualties on the first day in reality we only lost 219 people throughout the gulf war. Now we were expecting 2 million covid death spike ball and look what happened. aren’t even at 2 million yet.</p></p>
