    <strong>Does anyone know the death rate of gastro enteritis?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been looking for this number for days. In some website it's 800 000 deaths per year, in some other it's not even 20 000.
I'm asking because that would be a solid argument against covid maniacs and their fear for this shitty virus. Plus kids actually dies from gastro.</p></p>

        <p>I had it at 6 months old, needed a blood transfusion (had in my kidneys) but other than that I recovered quickly, and that was a country with a poor health system. I'd say today the survivability would be very high in anywhere but the most backward of countries.</p>

        <p>I think gastroenteritis isn't as easy to test for, so the data probably isn't as good. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms being prevalent in the community - since there are some viruses that cause gastroenteritis that don't have a widely available test. Not to rely too much on the CDC, but they say that GE related deaths in the USA were around 17,000 in 2007, and more than doubled in 7 years. Also, the CDC estimates around 50,000 child deaths per year worldwide are attributed to rotavirus, which is one of the main causes of GE.</p>

        <p>There are different viruses and bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis, and your health and strength matter a lot with most of them. If something nasty spreads through young, malnourished kids in a part of the world with poor sanitation and little access to doctors, it can be dangerous. If you're a healthy adult in the developed world you'll probably just feel awful for a little while and it's easy to treat if you do need treatment.</p>
