<p>Whenever Joe Glickman heads out for groceries, he places an N95 mask over his face and tugs a cloth mask on top of it. He then pulls on a pair of goggles.</p>
<p>He has used this safety protocol for the past 14 months. It did not change after he contracted the coronavirus in November. It did not budge when, earlier this month, he became fully vaccinated. And even though President Joe Biden said on Thursday that fully vaccinated people do not have to wear a mask, Glickman said he planned to stay the course.</p>
<p>In fact, he said, he plans to do his grocery run double-masked and goggled for at least the next five years.</p></p>

        <p>Well, their choice. Doesn’t effect me as long as I don’t have to and am not expected to.</p>
<p>If the “new normal” is just going to be that some people choose to wear masks and it’s socially acceptable like previously in parts of Asia, I couldn’t care less about that.</p>
<p>It’s similar to this - It doesn’t bother me at all if I see someone wearing a religious head covering like a hijab, etc. that’s their right and I support their right to wear it 100%. I used to live in a really culturally diverse area (before all the international students got kicked out or left due to travel restrictions, which makes me sad) and I never treated anyone differently because of how they were dressed.</p>
<p>Just don’t expect me to and we’re all good.</p>
