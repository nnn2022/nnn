    <strong>Mom doing distance learning, AMA</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know how many other ppl here are doing distance learning with their kids. I see on my local subreddit many aghast doomers who can't fathom why parents would ever choose to send their kids back in a Global Pandemic. My kids are very smart and they've gone down at least a grade level each in the last few months. Their social skills have suffered and my older son (10yo) cries which is a big fucking deal, he cannot cry when he eventually goes back.</p>
<p>They used to be active social kids and I had so much hope for their futures until this. They will never not be smart but I can see them turning into sad husks of their former selves after this atrocity.</p>
<p>Anyway I get the impression that a lot of you are older with adult kids, or you are young single individuals. I don't see many moms here. I thought I could provide some insight! so please ask me anything about online school and how much it sucks.</p></p>
