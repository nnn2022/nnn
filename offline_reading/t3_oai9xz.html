    <strong>Want the Vaccine? Please get it! (I've stopped caring)</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: </p>
<p>This rant is long</p>
<p>I get real petty and vindictive, but I'm beyond caring at this point </p>
<p>I do not hold this view over any person who has been forced to get the vaccine for any reason. This is purely about the 'healthy' people who voluntarily get the vaccine. </p>
<p>Start of Rant:</p>
<p>So I came to a realisation today.</p>
<p>I've been trying to educate and open the eyes of people who fell for all the Covid bull crap. All the contradictory regulations, all the over-zealous money printing, all the conflicting information on masks and social distancing, all the backpeddaling and gaslighting done by the government. All of that I've been trying to point out to people. </p>
<p>I've been meticulous in being reasonable, rational, and backing up my objections with facts, logic, and scepticism. All to show them that it's not just crazies who are against all of this, but sane and logical people too. All to show them that there are actually reasonable justifications for being against it and that just blindly following is actually the dumb move here.</p>
<p>And despite that, they still don't listen. They still follow the lies and deciet. I can't even understand why. Is it the free money? Is it the mob-mentality? Is it just because its easier to let the government control everything because then not only can you shrug off any responsibility, but you can also do so while feeling superior to those who don't? Probably all of the above and more.</p>
<p>So I've given up. I don't care anymore. Go ahead and cower in fear. Go ahead and get the vaccine. In fact, I WANT you to get the vaccine. I actively and enthusiastically encourage it now.</p>
<p>Because I think it will make any kind of difference?
Hahahahahahahahahaha no.</p>
<p>I pray for them to get the vaccine now because:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you've been fed stories about rising against power and fighting authoritarian regimes your whole life (as another popular post here pointed out today) yet you still fall for this then you don't deserve salvation. If you at any point in your life read 1984 or even just know the story, yet you're okay with all of this, then you don't deserve salvation. If my 19 year old high school dropout brother with Aspergers can see through the bullshit, but you with your degree at age 30 can't, then you don't deserve salvation.</li>
</ol>
<p>You deserve only the life you've chosen for yourself. You made your bed, now lie in it and embrace the consequences.</p>
<p>Oh you have adverse reactions to the vaccine yet you voluntarily went and got it?
Hahahahahahaha tough titties.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to get the vaccine because while I'm not anti-vaxx, I am against getting an untested, experimental drug for a disease with a 99.9% survival rate. I'm not putting shit in my body that has no record of its long term effects and that's still technically in its trial phase. But I am all for it if the sheeple want to take that shot for the team.</li>
</ol>
<p>By all means go and get the vaccine. Please do. I'd love nothing more than for this vaccine to get its proper testing done. So while I don't want to play Guinea-pig for the government, I fully support your right to do so. Please take the risk so that I don't have to.</p>
<p>If all goes well then that's awesome because nobody got hurt and we can get our lives back to normal again. But if the vaccines do cause harm then let me just say: better you than me!</p>
<p>I get to see the vaccine's efficacy and potential side-effects while taking none of the risk? Gee willikers Batman that seems like a great fucking deal to me!</p>
<p>I am all for people playing Darwin's lottery here. Maybe the gene pool needs a bit of cleansing anyway </p>
<p>So yeah, I don't care anymore. Let them get it if they want. I'm done trying to convince people.</p>
<p>If it works out, then great.
If not, sucks to be them.</p>
<p>Double the sentiment for those who get the vaccine purely for convenience or because every one else is doing it. You're willingly selling your freedom for no good reason. I have even less sympathy for you (and I basically had none to begin with).</p>
<p>Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>It has to be cognitive dissonance. It’s too scary to think this side is reality. I always wonder about the 2 outcomes. Say the people in this sub are wrong and life just goes back to normal <em>bam</em> overnight as soon as the whole population is vaccinated. Everyone’s fine! I have no problem apologizing to anyone and everyone I offended and I will admit I was wrong!! But if the people in this sub are right? Well then..........</p>

        <p>Are you a Christian?</p>
<p>Jesus instructed his disciples to enter a town and give them the truth. If they accept it, awesome. If they refuse to accept the truth, "wipe the dust off your feet" and proceed to the next town.</p>
<p>He never said "try to convince them".</p>
<p>I feel like the same thing applies here - you can tell people the truth about what's going on here with the "vaccines", Great Reset, and all the other clear-as-day corruption we're seeing. Some people will accept it - most will continue in their ignorance and experience the pain of regret later on.</p>

        <p>I think they dont like the truth and therefore they refuse to see or hear the truth. It's like they have taken optimism to a new level.  I think a part of them subconsciously knows something is wrong and there are holes in their " logic" that is why they lash out angrily at us. Because we wont play along with their delusions.  The sad thing is you cant hope, will or deny the truth Away.  A year ago I felt fear but instead of running away I confronted my fears probably like most of you. I feel better being informed but they are the opposite.  They are too afraid to confront their fears and face the truth. Fear is the most powerful motivation that ever existed.</p>

        <p>Two rants I’ve read in a sitting tonight and they were enlightening. Glad to feel the anger in posts. Not morbid glad however it shows passion, passion breeds change and resistance. I enjoy reading what this community shares and I hope you keep it up. Quite frankly I wasn’t to thrilled with the course we were on prior to Covid and that just solidified my stance. I’m surrounded by lemmings. Then I came across NNN. Keep the fires burning my friends.✌🏻</p>

        <p>My only concern is I worry their target % is an <em>economic</em> issue. Consider this:</p>
<p>Say they really do get 70% of people poisoned with the experimental mRNA gene therapy...</p>
<p>Now consider the way our government is partnering with business in order to sidestep the law. (They did this with BigTech to have systemwide censorship.)</p>
<p>My point is ---</p>
<p>Once the vast majority of people have been injected by the jabs, they'll be able to get business to sign on to more restrictions.</p>
<p>Employee vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>Next thing you know -- if you want to get a job, you have to be jabbed. No jab? You're homeless. Meanwhile, these terrible people will say, "It's NOT mandatory."</p>
<p>So that's the problem if too many get the shots. Right now business doesn't want to restrict potential employees too much, and they don't want to block unvaccinated from entry because they want their $.</p>
<p>But once the unpoisoned is a small percent? <strong>They're going to squeeze us really hard.</strong></p>

        <p>That's not going to happen because the juice isn't worth the "squeeze". </p>
<p>Can't you see? The talk of vaccine passports, IDs, mandates etc are a scare tactic to intimidate people into getting vaccinated. These policies will either never come to fruition, or they will be implemented for a few short months. How many vaccinated people got the jab out of fear they couldn't travel? Out of fear they would not be able to attend school, not be able to get employment. </p>
<p>The truth is that these IDs, passports, and mandates are going to be scrapped after 70-80% of the population is fully vaccinated. Israel, Denmark, and the UK recently all scrapped the vax passports by surprise after they reached vaccination targets. The government isn't going to care either way about the remaining few un vaccinated hold outs who weathered the storm. The goal is depopulation if you've followed any of this...after 70-80% are fully vaxxed this dystopian nightmare will end, which is why the variants were invented to prop up fear until they reach their vaccine numbers.</p>

        <p>God I hope you're right...</p>
<p>I get it, regarding depopulation. I've read Kissinger's Security Memorandum Study 200, declassified in 1989. I've seen Parker Crutchfields lobbying docs on our own government website, advocating for "covert moral bioenhancement."</p>
<p>I watched all of Event 201, and to my horror today I finally found proof that the SPARS Pandemic 2025-2028 document really was finished in 2017 (even though it makes reference to a fictional female president J.B. not running for a second term, for health reasons, and the VP is elected in his place.)</p>
<p>That latter document is about a pandemic that didn't kill as many as expected -- but the vaccine side effects are rampant and severe. It ends with the president apologizing to the American people and thanking those who took the experimental vaccines for their patriotic bravery when America was in crisis.</p>
<p>You've seen that, right? <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html</a> </p>
<p>It even makes reference to what I believe is prion disease, which is very curious considering just at the end of May, Biden warned, "If we don't act NOW, EVERY hospital bed in America will be filled with alzheimer's patients in 15 years."</p>
<p>Then a couple weeks ago? The first alzheimers drug in 18 years was approved. 3 of the FDA panel stepped down after protest, and it turned out ALL of them voted against approval. (10 said no, and 1 was unsure.)</p>
<p>Alzheimers is a prion disease. </p>
<p>The coincidences there are pretty incredible, and all of this is right out in the open. It feels like a slow-burn extinguishing event, targeted at people who too dumb, too brainwashed to see what's right in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>I mean -- they put it right out there. They say TAKE THE VACCINE! And then they show us, "Here are the terrible side effects if you do."</p>
<p>It's almost like they made this event voluntary... And it is consistent with their eugenics background that if they're going to cull the gene pool it would be the less intelligent.</p>
<p>That said, the squeeze is real. People really are losing their jobs around it.</p>
<p>I hope you're right though. It could be that it's fully planned that Republicans will take office in 2022. They'll be just as sold out to corporations as Democrats, of course, but it might be the "story" that is played  out. That's a year and half away, though. </p>
<p>That is my assessment of one possible future.</p>
<p>I would be curious to hear yours, as it feels like you've put a lot of thought into it. (Though it's possible we've talked before - I don't pay as much attention to usernames as maybe I should.)</p>

        <p>I know how you feel. I did my best to convince my family and their kids. Didn't work. My wife did the same with her family and their kids. Didn't work. My wife and I are the only people we know not vaccinated. I no longer argue with people about anything. I tell them to look it up themselves and that's it. Nothing more.

        <p>Watch (or read) Invasion of the Body Snatchers. (The 1978 version filmed in San Francisco is particularly good.)</p>
<p>Sadly, it really does feel like we're in that movie.</p>
<p>But there are more of us than the system would have you believe!!! Lets see what happens in 2022.</p>
<p>SWEEPING change in the midterm elections may happen, as the real voice of America speaks out. That voice exists. It exists so much that YouTube had to change their votes because the White House was CONSTANTLY downvoted by tens of thousands. Also -- remember that Republicans make it to the polls in midterm elections a lot more.</p>
<p>Democrats might even be on board with this happening, because it gives them their age old excuse to not do anything for their constituents. (Don't point the finger too much - Republicans do the same thing. These parties both represent corporations long before us.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, we might see vote manipulation/fraud even worse than 2019...</p>
<p>I do believe there's a good chance for change in the midterm elections though. People are PISSED and we've been silenced. Our voices aren't heard. We get banned everywhere we do. Social media algorithms push us down and our opponents up.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not even a Republican... But if they speak toward our interests on these issues I will damn sure vote for them and I think a lot of ex-Democrats will.</p>
<p>In fact, by 2022 --- the side effects of these vaccines will be widely known, and the people will resent those who silenced every voice of dissent.</p>
<p>And my Republican friends -- that's how you will tell if your party is "real." We're going through the greatest controversy of our lives.</p>
<p>If no one is held accountable? Then you'll know Ross Perot and Ralph Nader were right, once and for all.</p>

        <p>I don’t care if people get the vaccine. They can go ahead. I’m not forcing anybody to not get it, so i would appreciate if people would stop trying to force me to get it. </p>
<p>A majority of people last year still had their doubts on if the vaccines would actually be safe and effective. I also had doubts. A lot of those same people flipped on their stance once Biden won which was just ridiculous. I’m not making my stance on the vaccine based on whatever fuckface takes office.</p>

        <p>I agree. Heard of the concept of 1984 and watched the movie. Incredibly fascinating. People on average are uncultured and just don't see propaganda. </p>
<p>Also, I don't watch tv alot so when I turned CNN on during the pandemic and they covered it day and night for a year even though there was pretty much no change sometimes it hit me </p>
<p>And now the same thing with the vax propaganda campaign. </p>
<p>If you can't see it, you don't deserve salvation, cuz it means you're too intellectually challenged to even try to understand it. </p>
<p>And when it comes to this, that's not excusable.</p>

        <p>It's come to a point where a cognitive individual must really want to put in the time &amp; effort to research everything about these so-called "vaccines" as well as be able to see both sides in order to make an informative decision. Which is probably likely why we all are here in this sub.</p>
<p>The ones who love getting spoon fed &amp; eating everything up by any of the alphabet gangs are too far gone.</p>
<p>The only ones that may be worth persuading are the ones on the fence of getting them and questioning the "vaccines." Them being able to question, is a good thing.</p>

        <p>Trust me. Whenever I feel bad about being ostracized by the psychos, I remember that there is a high likelihood these folks wont be on the planet much longer or at a minimum, won't be able to procreate. Our world MIGHT just be saved. All of the positions of power will be left in need of replacements and the only people left will be those smart enough to not get the jab. Again--I am in the same camp. I spent so much effort trying to save people, only to be mocked and ridiculed. I've gotten to the point where I feel like Noah and his ark. Noah told people for a long time about the flood and was called nuts, then the flood came. SO yeah. Sorry, I guess my dark side is showing.</p>

        <p>As a reasonable person you should look into the criticisms of germ theory and vaccines in general. They have been using the same playbook for over a century. It's always been about manipulating statistics and changing disease classifications. You can also read reviews for "Bechamp or Pasteur", published in the 20s, and they read incredibly similarly to the "fact checks" of today.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way and have for a while. I really don't care what people do anymore and I'd like for them to stop caring about what I do. </p>
<p>Your point about reading 1984 though is very fucking true. It was mandatory reading in high school for me along with other similar novels (Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tail, Brave New World, etc). I am absolutely shocked that although many of us had to read these books and thereby thoroughly explore themes such as censorship, propaganda and corruption in our English classes...people are falling for every bit of whatever narrative is being fed to them. These novels and the classes I received alongside them were instrumental in helping me as a teenager develop critical thinking skills...not paranoia or a feeling of distrust toward the establishment, but just the fucking power of thinking for myself. </p>
<p>And supposedly thinking for yourself has become a radical act. Posing questions is a form of extremism. It brings with it negative labels and unwarranted accusations. The mere act of questioning brings into question my credibility as a professional and as a person.</p>

        <p>I tried to convince a good friend of mine and she still went and got it, despite being exposed to all the information and cobtradictions. She's like "OK it I have any symptoms I'll keep you posted". </p>
<p>At that point I didn't even care anymore. I've spent a dozen conversations with her educating her on the silliness of the whole covid theater. I thought she was getting it. But I guess not, and now its she who had to live with the choice. I also don't care anymore and am only mildly curious about how it will play out for her in the future (i.e. fertility).</p>

        <p>"I've been trying to educate and open the eyes of people who fell for all the Covid bull crap. All the contradictory regulations, all the over-zealous money printing, all the conflicting information on masks and social distancing, all the backpeddaling and gaslighting done by the government. All of that I've been trying to point out to people.</p>
<p>I've been meticulous in being reasonable, rational, and backing up my objections with facts, logic, and scepticism. All to show them that it's not just crazies who are against all of this, but sane and logical people too. All to show them that there are actually reasonable justifications for being against it and that just blindly following is actually the dumb move here.</p>
<p>And despite that, they still don't listen. They still follow the lies and deciet. I can't even understand why. Is it the free money? Is it the mob-mentality? Is it just because its easier to let the government control everything because then not only can you shrug off any responsibility, but you can also do so while feeling superior to those who don't? Probably all of the above and more."</p>
<p>Y'know, having been pro-mask myself until recently, these people we wanna educate think the very same things about us.</p>

        <p>You sound like a sociopathic libertarian.</p>
<p>The newest generation getting mRNA vaccines and the resulting protein shedding is not good for anyone, including themselves as well as non vaccinated people. Can you imagine in 10 years trying to find a partner to start a family with that did not get the vaccine, particularly the mRNA version? You think you'll be ok with everyone shedding proteins around you?</p>
<p>This attitude of yours has led to the degradation of society and, frankly, the situation we find ourselves in in the West. Drag queen story hour wouldn't be a thing if nihilism and moral relativism weren't so rampant. Neither would vaccination passports, gender reassignment surgery, mass legal and illegal immigration, Tinder, teens dancing sexily on Tiktok, etc. And, yes, all of those are linked, and I'm bundling them up, because they're being pushed by the same people that fundamentally hate life, morals, and God.</p>
<p>Freedom is only so good as when you live a moral life with a higher purpose. The point of freedom is not to have "bAsEd" gay couples with marijuana plants on their homestead.</p>

        <p>I hear you, but I don't plan on ever settling down and having a family nor do I believe in God. I don't subscribe to your moral principles though I respect your right to have them.</p>
<p>Western civilisation is fucked and I no longer care. I'm just enjoying the decline during my short existence. Let it burn is what I say.</p>
<p>If you want to save it then I wish you all the best since I think it will be great if that can be achieved. But I hold no hope for that outcome coming to pass and I refuse to expend any further energy in this futile fight. Best of luck and for the sake of everyone else I hope you and your kind succeed, but hope is all it is to me. Nothing more.</p>

        <p>You're right. I'm dumb. I'm not rational. I'm a crazy conspiracy nut and anti-vaxxer. In fact, this whole sub is. You should really just look down on me and everyone here and get your vaccine. We've all been brainwashed and we're making all the wrong moves.</p>
<p>Please get your vaccine and stay away from us crazy people. It's for the best that we don't get the vaccine like you since we're clearly the poor dregs of society that somehow decided to go against the science that's been pushed from the government. You'd actually be teaching us a lesson by getting your vaccine.</p>
<p>Good on you for being morally superior. In fact, you should get your whole family vaccinated. That'll show us.</p>
