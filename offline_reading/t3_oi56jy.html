    <strong>Probably going to have to postpone my wedding again. The wedding industry is FUCKED.</strong>
    <p><p>The Welsh government is refusing to budge on mask and social distancing laws and the current wedding rules (unless they change soon) are so fucking pathetic that it would just ruin the day anyway. 6 people to a table, 60 guests, masked up unless eating or drinking, no live music and you can't sing or dance: WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT.</p>
<p>We got legally married at the start of this year so this would just be a celebration with our friends and family but it's looking more and more likely that we'll have to postpone AGAIN, and to be honest I doubt the fucking wedding venue or those involved will survive another year without business. Even if it does go ahead it's going to be a fucking mad dash to get everything organized. We've both lost enthusiasm for it and it's so fucking frustrating being kept on tenderhooks all the time.</p>
<p>I can already hear the doomers scoffing, saying that this is an incredibly selfish and petty reason to be mad at the lockdowns and restrictions, but this is just one of many reasons and I have a right to be fucking pissed off and frustrated. I'm sick of being told to be patient. Barely anyone has fucking died in Wales WITH this virus (just over 5,000 in over a year, FUCKING PATHETIC), it's the 31st leading cause of death here, and most people have had the cunting vaccine now so we should be opening back up but NOPE. As per the BBC today, masks will still be required BY LAW in most places for the foreseeable future. GET FUCKED!</p>
<p>The uncertainty is fucking killing me and I am not prepared for if and when we tell them the wedding is postponed again to have people shrug like they don't give a fuck or act shocked because they're pig ignorant to the fact that maybe, just fucking maybe we don't want to look back on our wedding day as some socially distanced event where people are afraid to speak to each other and our wedding photos are just a mass of masked NPCs clustered together, crinkled eyes peeking over their fucking face-diapers and stood six feet apart like a fucking staged photo op at the G7 Summit.</p>
<p>10 million pounds is being spent A WEEK on the restrictions. WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM!? The economy is so fucked, I swear to God. Another lockdown will kill off the few remaining small businesses and that includes the wedding industry. Guess what, if the economy fails, you can expect a fuck load more people to die but not WITH Covid. It'll be absolute chaos.</p></p>

        <p>u dont even need a lot of people to do it. u dont need 30, 50, 80% of the population. I think it only takes about 7-13% of a population to have a successful revolution. Cant remember the source but it was calculated from previous successful ones.</p>

        <p>Yes, events and related businesses I'm involved with and work with on a regular basis - which makes up a large chunk of my annual income, have been utterly destroyed from lockdowns over 2020 and 2021 so far. 2022 looks bleak, even if they are hopeful things will turn around.</p>
<p>But now we have a rising war between vaccinated and unvaccinated, causing customers to have further issues whether they should carry out events in 2022 and many regular contracts have simply not been renewed, or they cannot or are unwilling to commit.</p>
<p>This means a ton of income will be lost across the board, and many many jobs.</p>
<p>Looks like Canadians are fine with this in general. They deny that any destruction of their economy is taking place. If they're not personally affected they simply don't care. If they're making $90k a year in a government job, sitting around pushing paper - they're completely recession and covid19 lockdown proof.</p>

        <p>My business was already annihilated. You're lucky to have been able to hold on. Personally I think if you yanked the pay away from everyone in government and all these "healthcare" professionals for the duration of the restrictions, you'd see a change in their attitude real fucking fast.</p>

        <p>We decided to skip on our reception. We have the same restrictions but the main reason we decided to not have the reception is because I couldn’t stand the thought of a happy day being wrecked by people obsessing and talking nonstop about covid and vaccines, and pictures being ruined by people wearing masks. </p>
<p>Our elopement was magical and it’s all we needed.</p>

        <p>Me and my wife were married in 2016, we said "fuck you" to the wedding industry anyway.</p>
<p>To be honest, if the wedding industry all died due to the pandemic, I would consider that an even trade.</p>

        <p>My daughter got married last Oct in Washington State which had similar rules.  Was able to have the ceremony in a chapel, masks optional.  Had the reception on private property, masks optional.   </p>
<p>One of the state rules, was no dancing, and even the married couple if dancing had to wear masks!      </p>
<p>Anyhow, it was a wonderful day, and life goes on.   (no one got sick from the day).</p>

        <p>Ouch. Hate to say this now but you could have just driven to the peninsula. Have friends' families that have thrown full size weddings in the last year. Grandma doesn't need to come, leave the elderly and fat home or have it outside. The alternative is eloping or waiting four years.</p>

        <p>You don't need industry or government for a wedding. The wedding is about the marriage and lifelong commitment. It isn't about the size of the celebration.  </p>
<p>I know these things are important and the ritual matters. I empathize with your frustration, but don't lose sight of WHY you want to get married. You don't have to wait on anyone or anything for that.</p>

        <p>A wedding is no more than a huge party you are throwing for yourself.
Use that $30,000 more wisely.</p>
<p>Or, just use it to take a month long Honeymoon.</p>

        <p>"As per the BBC today, masks will still be required BY LAW in most places for the foreseeable future. GET FUCKED!"  </p>
<p>I don't believe this to be true, I think you're still required to wear them at hospitals and airports, but pubs/hospitality etc are saying they will have their staff wear them as well as "encouraging" customers, but it won't be legally enforceable from July 19th.</p>

        <p>I’m in the us, I’m actually kinda disappointed we’ve opened up so much because I’m planning a wedding and I hate people. My family expects this huge wedding when in reality I just wanna use covid as an excuse To do a micro destination wedding or something. </p>
<p>But seeing your situation, that you want more socialization I feel for ya man. Stuff is nuts right now and it seems your government is holding out. we would make a great episode or trading spaces.</p>
