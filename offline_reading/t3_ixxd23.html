    <strong>Increased surveillance society and a different perspective on masks</strong>
    <p><p>Like you, I'm about at the end of my rope quarantine wise. I've hardly seen another person for 6 months and my world has shrunk to the size of my one bedroom apartment where I work from home. My remaining few local friends had to move away when they lost their jobs to the pandemic in the spring.</p>
<p>At first I was afraid of the unknown, but never obsessed with sanitizing things and I believe in a healthy amount of germs for a good immune system. I don't travel, and I mostly stay home since my social circle is long distance now. I still wear a mask when I go to the store or on public transit, for others' comfort, but even more so because I'm disturbed by the rising culture of no privacy in public places. Every day we see new viral videos of the "Karen" du jour.</p>
<p>Often we see clips that start in the middle of an altercation with no context, and people's ugly moments become their public face to the rest of the world, permanently. Of course I agree people should be polite and considerate, but we all have bad days and the out of character bad behavior that sometimes accompanies that. I'm unsettled by the way social media at large has been so eager and vicious in response to these videos. It's like our Two Minutes' Hate and the target doesn't matter to them as long as they get a socially validated outlet for their rage.</p>
<p>We've totally normalized constant surveillance in our everyday lives. Everywhere we go, there are either security cameras or a hundred phones eager and ready to be whipped out for Twitter clout. Or you can become an unwitting character in a stranger's TikTok or vlog with no knowledge until you see yourself in a viral meme. The popularity of these videos encourages people to escalate situations for drama. THAT is the "new normal" that really disturbs me, especially as tensions rise.</p>
<p>So I don't mind continuing to wear a mask, because I have no idea if a crazy person out there is waiting to broadcast my life to the whole internet over some imagined slight or a thoughtless social misstep on my part. I mean shit, I've accidentally cut in line multiple times because I can't tell where it ends with the 6 feet distancing. And even videos in a positive light lead to negative outcomes for their subjects, like the situation with that cute kid who worked at Target. It feels safer to hide my face with the rise of this behavior.</p>
<p>I know this is different kind of post since I'm not anti-mask but I thought this subscriber base might have some interesting thoughts on the topic.</p>
<p>TL;DR - I still wear a mask to protect myself from a society teeming with keyboard warriors armed with iPhones and a twisted thirst for public shaming and overnight fame. Thoughts on this "new normal", and do you think it's a coincidence this behavior has increased so much during this pandemic?</p></p>

        <p>I had this discussion with my partner. She doesn’t want to wear one, but I said to her you never know if some psycho mask wearing vigilante is going to beat the shit out of you or throw acid in your face or whatever. I know it’s extreme but we currently live in a brainwashed, mentally unstable society and fuck knows what might happen.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean. I live in a violent and politically volatile city; my neighborhood was destroyed in the first weekend of protests. Every day I'm just trying to get by until Europe allows Americans back in, then I'm moving. Being in limbo is driving me mad.</p>

        <p>The chance of coming across a maskhole with a phone is pretty small. Should that actually happen, ignore them. Continue doing your business and say nothing; you don't want to give them ammunition. I've been half a dozen times now and each time is easier than the last. If it helps, and you're able, do your shopping during off hours and not when most people are out.</p>

        <p>The surveillance technology can identify you with a mask, so your mask doesn't protect you there. Seeing faces is vital for humans, enjoy your faceless life I guess. You're letting those people with phones filming others win. The chance of being filmed and having it go viral is so minimal it's ridiculous to think covering your face is worth it. Sounds cowardly tbh... and a bit like those who are exaggerating the risk of this virus, you're exaggerating the risk of a video of you going about your life going viral and mattering.</p>
