    <strong>Economics of post-pandemic better than before?</strong>
    <p><p>This stems from a video I saw from Thunderf00t on YouTube. He said if a certain number of people die in a pandemic, the economy of that society is permanently stunted due to less people being alive to contribute to the economy via spending and earning money. Which is the logic he uses to defend a hard lockdown to stop the spread of COVID(this was in early 2020). However...</p>
<p>That’s assuming the money that those people were earning and spending just evaporates per se. But in reality, that money goes somewhere.
Theoretically, if the same amount of money remains in the society, then that means the total sum of money is divided among fewer people, thereby increasing each person’s potential buying power and earning potential.</p>
<p>Obviously this wouldn’t happen immediately. It takes time for affairs to be sorted and to distribute remaining wealth to next of kin after death and so forth. But theoretically, eventually, that money gets put back into the remaining population.</p>
<p>This is assuming certain greedy folks don’t absorb that money with all manners of financial book cooking to leave the remaining people with the same or less money among the normal folk as before the pandemic. Which would be expected to occur at least to some degree. But would it be enough to offset the potential gain to the pandemic survivors? Kind of like how Europe had more resources per-person after the Black Death, which lead to an era of prosperity. Let me know what you think.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah better for Bill Gates. The money stays within the families; well the amount that isn't ransacked by fascist governments. And, dying is expensive so all the money will ultimately end up with the elites. No wonder Bill is so eager to depopulate the planet.</p>
