    <strong>What is the best evidence currently existing that the COVID-19 vaccine shouldn't be taken? Give me cited sources, studies, statements by vaccine companies, GOOD sources.</strong>
    <p><p>I think if we're going to encourage discussion on the pros and cons of the vaccine, we should be able to back up our claims with verifiable information. I'd like to compile the info into easy to digest facts. </p>
<p>You can even PM me your best info if you don't want to comment.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm noticing some downvotage. So let me clarify - a close loved one of mine may be in the position where they have to give this vaccine soon. My dear loved one wants to make sure they're not giving a vaccine that they know causes complications. My loved one doesn't want to partake in inadvertently hurting people (or partake in culling the population if we're going full tinfoil hat mode).</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for the good sources! </p>
<p>Please don't take offense but here's where I begin playing devil's advocate. Just trying to isolate the best research available. If you feel I'm missing any greater points of the research you provided, please correct me. </p>
<p>Many of your cited studies found that creating a dead whole virus vaccine was difficult because the immunity it created caused the body to be totally blind to the virus, which then led to the body uptaking coronaviruses into sensitive places of the body, overall causing damage to the body. I agree this is a great argument against a dead whole virus vaccine, but doesn't this support the narrative that the vaccine must be an MRNA vaccine to be safer and more effective? Theoretically, the MRNA would provide instructions to the body to fight the virus, rather than allow the body to become blind to it. </p>
<p>The study you linked that referred to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines specifically was in essence a review of the vaccines' mechanisms of action. The author then hypothesized that if the MRNA vaccine is causing a release of zinc into the body, then the zinc may cause prionism as zinc is found in the plaques of the brain when people die of prionism and neurodegenerative diseases. Don't get me wrong; I've heard this theory before. I've also heard that the reason zinc amasses in these people's brains is actually because the zinc is neuroprotective, and this is actually the body's response to foreign substances in the brain. So I think you'd agree that this article is valuable, but the conclusion he's reaching is a stretch and unproven. </p>
<p>Besides the one I just discussed, do you know of any articles that specifically address the possible dangers of the Moderna, Pfizer, or J&amp;J vaccines or the concept of a MRNA vaccine in general?</p>

<p>How can there be? There's never been an mRNA vax for any disease prior to 2020. Humans are the living experiment that will be used as future research (assuming the species isn't utterly decimated). There hasn't been enough time since the jabs were rolled out to have any quality data.</p>

        <p>Right - the trials were expedited and we have no long term data. I was just hoping we'd have some hard, tangible research out there showing what kind of damage these vaccines could possibly cause. Regardless, thanks for your help. The studies you found definitely highlight so e criticisms of coronavirus vaccines in general.</p>

        <p>Here is the thing. You are not going to find a bunch of information, since it was rushed to market there are no long term studies.</p>
<p>You can still work using what's missing versus what is there. </p>
<p>Examples. </p>
<p>They skipped animal trials. This has never been done before.</p>
<p>It was rushed to market. So obviously there is no long term data regards to risk, injury, deaths.</p>
<p>A mRNA vaccine has never been given to a large number of people, let alone on a global scale </p>
<p>These, despite what everyone wants you to think, are not FDA approved. They have an emergency exemption and are still under trials </p>
<p>I have had people try to convince me to get the vaccine. I have had COVID, my body has the antibodies, I am not old and not fat. Makes zero sense to take an experimental gene therapy shot versus not when I already have COVID anti bodies, have had them since April last year. I donate blood to the red cross and they check for it everytime.</p>
<p>My go to is asking for the long term risk and injury data and how did the animal trials go?</p>

        <p>Right; I agree. The vaccines offer cellular immunity and not humoral immunity meaning we can pass it but we theoretically won't get as sick. I agree that for a good portion of people in their youth who already take vitamins C, D, and zinc, the vaccine may be too risky. </p>
<p>I'm just looking for evidence that specifically details how these vaccines are dangerous.</p>

        <p>I’m not against taking it once a sufficient trial followup period has been completed. We don’t have time data to tell exactly what’s going to happen to a lot of people who take it next time they come into contact with a virus. The trials completed on animals led to the conclusion that people are going to get extremely sick once their immune system is challenged. In many instances they halted the animal trials because it was going to delay the vaccine rollout. Below is a video with more information than I can fit in writing. </p>
