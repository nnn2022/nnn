    <strong>What happened to comedy?</strong>
    <p><p>In a sane world, comedians would be making an absolute killing during this 'crisis'.</p>
<p>The huge logic gaps and lunacy obvious most covid theatre should be giving them loads of material.</p>
<p>However we remain in a position where no dissent is allowed......</p></p>

        <p>Can’t risk offending anyone any more. Comedy has always been an outlet for people to hear someone take tough topics and present them in a way that adds some levity. Nowadays, you just get canceled for making any jokes that are possibly offensive. </p>
<p>It’s why late night people are so boring now. Imagine sitting around the table writing the bits and how many ideas are squashed because they might offend 0.001% of the population. Lame jokes abound.</p>

        <p>that 0.001% isn't exclusive to comedy.  A lot of large and small companies are still forcing masks and vax's on their employees so they can tell that 0.001% of the population that they're 100% 'safe'.  God forbid possibly not making that sale because Covid Karen might shop somewhere else.</p>

        <p>When Cult of the Mask outnumbers perfectly healthy People in the store, the store itself switches over to mandated masks..</p>
<p>they don't care about anyone's rights.. they'll switch if they make the most $$$.</p>
<p>Before any mask mandates, I saw my favourite store grow and grow more Masks... until I was the only one left.. then the next time i went, it was No Mask no food.</p>

        <p>Oh that's not covid. This might explain it:</p>
<p>"the infantilization of the American undergraduate, and this character’s evolving status in the world of higher learning—less a student than a consumer, someone whose whims and affectations (political, sexual, pseudo-intellectual) must be constantly supported and championed. To understand this change, it helps to think of college not as an institution of scholarly pursuit but as the all-inclusive resort that it has in recent years become"</p>
<p>From https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/399335/?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16271314884947&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fmagazine%2Farchive%2F2015%2F09%2Fthats-not-funny%2F399335%2F</p>
<p>This was from 2015. So these students are now adults who are rapidly populating the demographic who would pay to see comedians. These same people are now outraged that Friends was all white, The Office had racial and gay jokes. Outrage not laughter is their drug of choice.</p>

        <p>Check out Tim Dillon and Andrew Schulz. They still have some balls. </p>
<p>I lost a lot of respect for Bill Burr this past year. He used to say it like it is, but then went all hollywood...</p>
