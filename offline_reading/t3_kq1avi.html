    <strong>How do you cope when everything reminds you of what you’ve just lost?</strong>
    <p><p>My thoughts are torturing me &amp; making me struggle to fall asleep. Girls I found attractive/had crushes on? Thoughts of them now painfully remind me of the fact that I’ve lost my opportunity to ever find love. Watching old sports highlights &amp; concerts (like even from early last year) &amp; seeing full stadiums, as well as watching party videos, makes me cry. My classmates from high school &amp; university? Painful reminders of what could’ve been in terms of friendships. All I can think about is “this is how it used to be, it ain’t coming back, &amp; these motherfuckers are complicit.” I feel both bitterness &amp; desperation towards these people, like, “Please love me, but I hate you for going along with this, &amp; I know you hate me too because I’m a free thinker.” I feel like crying every time I hear a crowd cheer because I know that ain’t coming back.</p>
<p>Masturbating doesn’t even feel right anymore because I know I’m likely masturbating to thoughts of people who will probably be trying to kill me in a couple of years’ time &amp; won’t even blink an eye or will cheer if I die because I’m a dissenter, &amp; they have disgust towards me because they went along with the narrative, &amp; thus, I am emotionally disgusted by even though I physically am attracted, but sex is an impossibility for me to get also because of these bastards.</p>
<p>How can I cope with grief this multi layered, overwhelming, &amp; complex?</p></p>

        <p>25 years ago people still had excuses for why they couldn’t get laid. I haven’t had sex in a year but that’s my problem and I know I could have in 2020 if I had really tried.</p>

        <p>Lol you'll still be able to get laid. Always remember that everybody is still bending the covid rules as they see fit. While they pretend that they aren't. It's all a choose your own adventure game at this point, or an RPG, where covid is both an excuse for not doing something and also a reason for carrying out a certain course of action. Eventually people will make exceptions, and there's plenty of horny women out there who will make an exception for you. </p>
<p>As for confronting covid shit... </p>
<p>Make up everything as you go along. Lie to every covidian you need to lie to, make shit up. Because they're all doing it too. This is the world we are in. I'm currently also struggling to sleep but due to gastro intestinal problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, I am having trouble sleeping and am being kept awake with troubling thoughts.</p>

        <p>Yea it's possible they aren't bending the rueks because your opinion is different. So actually what you are experiencing is more akin to being a social outcast. Accused of wrongthink, your covid opinions as they are, not your behaviour, are what's actually causing them to selectively apply the rules to you, and not other people, because witg you they believee rightly or wrongly that you're a virus liability.</p>
<p>It's all utter nonsense and hopefully one day they'll realize their stupidity</p>

        <p>Yea so how do I deal with being a social outcast? As it stands my parents &amp; even my little brother allow themselves to have people over, but I’m NOT allowed, as an example. The one guy that did hang out with me before COVID is a hardcore doomer now.</p>
<p>How do I beat being a social outcast in this climate &amp; stop feeling so lonely? If it’s truly impossible, I want to at least ease the pain &amp; make it so I don’t suffer.</p>
<p>I’m both socially &amp; sexually outcast with seemingly no opportunities for escaping either. Protests might be my best hope but I don’t seem to be good at making friends interested in keeping up conversations with me &amp; maintaining conversations... people all seem polite, but icy &amp; standoffish &amp; aloof.</p>

        <p>Just tell them you've seen the light and that covid IS dangerous and you thank God you don't have it so you wash your hands and practice social distancing . That way you can regain social harmony. The trick my friend is to be dishonest to your closest friends and family because they are all experiencing a form of collective psychosis and these are the lies you must tell them in order to just live exactly the way they are (breaking rules, making exceptions, etc)</p>

        <p>So for the normies, I basically just have to signal that im playing the game &amp; I have a better chance of getting let in? With all the popular buzzwords &amp; shit? That also means I may have to not get caught at protests, mask up all the time, not hug, kiss, or have sex (then again I don’t necessarily know if this is true). Like I basically have to reorient my whole life just to get something that won’t even fill my social needs. I tried that once in high school... didn’t work out so well. Ended up dealing with mental burnout from basically acting like a completely different person in high school than I actually was &amp; lying all the time.</p>
<p>The friends I do have aren’t making exceptions for anyone. The rest just don’t see me as important. I need to make new friends. I need to go out &amp; meet new women. I’m pretty isolated, &amp; during lockdowns, I really have no idea how to do this, other than protests and/or Tinder (don’t have good pics for Tinder). But I think lying about my beliefs might work with my family, even if they know my true beliefs. I mean I did it before &amp; got to see a friend, but that was back in the summer.</p>
<p>OMG as warped as this is, thanks for your help.</p>

        <p>Dude just look at it for what you know it is: bullshit. Don't make sense of nonsense, just try to enjoy the twisted carnival circus that you're stuck in. When you go for a hug, turn your head sideways and make it look like you're bracing for impact like a hug is a huge fucking deal when in reality, unless you're sick, probably isn't a huge fucking deal unless you're hugging tons of ppl or are in large groups?</p>
<p>Idk man.. This is all a crazy misunderstood mental illness spiraling out of control for a lot of people, socially, at this point. Be strong do some pushups and crack a beer on a balcony or something. Find pleasure in things YOU like to do. The people will come when they see you having fun. If anyone wants to be unreasonable? Let them have their little covid tantrum and watch as they contradict themselves and, within their own narration, come to terms with what you've already figured out. Be gentle with people.</p>

        <p>Yeah the people ain’t come yet, &amp; my sense of humour towards clown world is gone.

        <p>Nah man he's basically having trouble coping with the extreme psycho gaslighting fucked up social world we are now in and it's no surprise. A lot of people are struggling and they need support walking thru this minefield. When you are labeled and accused of wrongthink in a 1984 digital slave landscape you need allies. Ever play the game half life? We are fucking living it bro.</p>

        <p>Oh yea, and avoid covid talks like the plague and jsut refocus your mind on things that are important such as ways to make killer money. Seek out silos of knowledge that are powerful. Covid debates are largely useless and a waste of fucking time. Plenty of good books out there that will allow you to have leverage over employers because of your knowledge. Fuck covid, and fuck arguing with people who are misled or less intelligent than you. It's a waste of time dude. Don't pay too much attention. Believe in yourself and walk towards the light. I tell myself this, because I have no choice. If I don't, I will sink into the chaos and end up romping around with angry mobs of people throwing bricks thru windows--misplaced rage.</p>
