    <strong>Had a crazy dream last night.</strong>
    <p><p>I had this crazy dream last night... I was at a press conference, where the Governor of New York announced their plans to evacuate the entire city of New York in order to "stop the spread." It was absolutely insane! People started screaming in protest and authorities grabbed them and dragged them away. I was so pissed off, but all I could do was give the middle finger.</p>
<p>I know this was just a crazy dream, but I wonder if they'll actually start "evacuating" communities next for this bullshit. Maybe not cities -- since they want to herd all the slaves into smart cities like factory chickens -- but maybe they'll start evacuating rural folks from certain "zones." Just a thought. Hopefully this was just a dream and not a premonition of a greater living nightmare.</p></p>

        <p>I have a lot of premonition dreams and they're worth listening to if they feel like the dream is significant and not random. Be aware though, that everything (nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs) in the dream world is a symbol or a metaphor. For example, dreaming about being in a boat that goes over a waterfall has more to do with rapid and violent transitions than actual boats or waterfalls. Try not to get too attached to knowing exactly what everything means, and trust that this is a way to run through a sort of simulation of things before they happen in real life</p>

        <p>Yeah, dreams are crazy like that. I think I had a dream premonition of the whole "pandemic" a few months prior around Yule 2019, but it was all so metaphorical, I never would've guessed the specifics. I was in a boat, on a great river, drifting toward darkness and shadow on the horizon. Not a whole lot you can do with that information, but it's pretty neat to see these glitches in the matrix.</p>

        <p>that cool! In 2010 I saw basically my life from 2017-2020 and then I come in this cave and everyone I'd ever known standing around this sword coming out of a rock but too scared to touch it, and I walked up to it and cut myself on it on purpose. It was such a crazy dream it felt like the most important myth I'd ever heard at the time I was shook for weeks after. How you feel when you wake up is always a reflection on the significance of what you saw, I think</p>

        <p>I had an odd one myself not too long ago, a few months maybe. I dreamt I was in the woods, at somebody’s cabin (fully furnished, had power, etc), I heard something outside, so I investigated. A mountain lion ripped past me, and I turned around to see a large black panther staring back at me. I ran into the cabin, grabbed a shotgun, and went to work. The weird part is, the shotgun did absolutely shit even being loaded with 00 buckshot less than 5 yards away, it bit my thigh, and I woke up. This was while I was taking Chantix to aid in quitting smoking, that’s known for giving you weird dreams.</p>

        <p>I had like 2 crazy dreams that felt like concepts for a movie, The first dream i pissed someone off in a cabin in an abandoned resort and he turned into a werewolf! He then proceeded to hunt me down across the country and i had to escape him with my friends, We went to the police but they were wiped out  and in the end me and my friends stay in hiding in the abandoned resort because it would be the last place the werewolf would look, In my other dream i was in a large indoor pool and it felt like watching a movie, I saw a woman and a man in the pool kissing and they were going to get out of the pool when the man was electrocuted but the woman escaped, There were a bunch of guys missing arms and legs and they were all bloodied up, Some died from blood loss and some fell into the pool and got shocked, The woman lost her head and all of her limbs, 2 Detectives arrived and are trying to figure out what happened, And then a flash back happened and i was at a relatively small carnival, I was in a brown bear costume, Oddly specific, and i saw a stand with a woman in a pink bear costume, Also oddly specific and there was a small group of intimidating men with her, She had this weird game where she had to align toys from the ceiling with a target thing and if it was aligned then some random kid would get the toy, It was a game where you litrelly had to do nothing and hope that the woman aligns the toys perfectly, idk why but the men got angry and took the woman into their car and drove off, I got into my car and i followed them to a huge cliff, The men threatened to throw the woman off and then well, The rest felt like a videogame, I was playing as the woman and i kept running away from the men but they kept shooting at me so after several deaths i just walk up to the men and noticed they had a woman captive, Poof! Woke up after that. What do you guys make of it? Werewolves, Bear costumes, Guys with missing limbs. And theres more where that came from</p>
