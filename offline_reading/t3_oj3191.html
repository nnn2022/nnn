    <strong>My Evil stepmother...and the jab</strong>
    <p><p>I used to love my stepmother.  My dad married her when I was an adult so she didn't raise me. But I swear the antichrist spirit emerged from her and it's taken me by surprise.  She, my dad, myself and my brother all voted for Trump so I thought we were on the same page. Last year around this time I called my dad and she was on the other end of the phone when I told him I thought we were in "biblical times". I think it caught them off guard.  I wanted to see him but she kept posting on Fakebook how scared she was of the virus because she has an autoimmune disorder.  I honestly thought in the beginning the virus was deadly so I just thought I'd give her time and she would chill out. Last xmas I did not get to see my dad for the holidays because she canceled xmas and kept posting on Fakebook about how scared she was of Covid. She convinced my dad to get the jab and cancel xmas AND move 4+ hours away to a different city so she could see a particular grandchild of hers. I had a big fight with my dad around xmas and didn't speak with him for 6 months. I didnt want to regret that and I hoped because of my silence he would be more willing to listen to me. (Btw he coached me in sports and we would fight alot because he pushed me alot and had high expectations for me but I was the apple of his eye growing up). But it seems she separated him from me and has brainwashed him.  I was surprised she convinced him to get the jab. I found out from my brother (my dad still hasn't told me) that my dad has prostate cancer. That 1 private phone call I had with him I warned him the jab caused cancer in reproductive areas. A month later he was diagnosed.  Then today another family member showed me a Fakebook post of my stepmother saying she had Covid. Her rationale was because she had an autoimmune disorder the vaccine may not work as well for her and she blamed it on unvaccinated people not wearing masks.....people like ME!!! I'm terrified that she would turn me into a concentration camp. I guess I'm lucky now that she lives 4 hours away.  I have this fear of my father dying in the next 3 years and not being able to hug him and say goodbye.  I said that to him outloud in the phone call but it's weird he just seems different.  His mind is different.  I dont know if he processed what I said and he is a smart man. He is a chemist he should be able to understand how bad the vaccine is.  My brother says he is against the vax but he is married to a liberal lunatic.  My secret nickname for her was the Skank. I hope he stays strong but like my father it's hard to talk to him privately.  I guess if you have comforting words or similar situation please feel free to comment.</p></p>
