    <strong>Short and Sweet 'sourced proof'(i hope) that the PCR test is bunk</strong>
    <p><p>Below is a message I have been using to confront people who are unwilling to accept that the PCR test\cases are almost certainly up to 90% false positives. I thought this might be useful to others here.</p>
<p>If anyone else has any short and sweet, sourced arguments like this, I would love to see them!</p>

<p>Look bro. This is proof for you. Every single slide has some element of proof that Ct being used is commonly over 40.</p>
<p>Here at this link, pg 4, fig 1 is very strong evidence that anything over 38 is pure noise: <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en">https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en</a></p>
<p>You are now backed into a corner. All you can do is demand more sources to verify Ct count, which WHO\CDC conspired NOT to collect outside special samples like we see in the two articles above, or refuse to accept what I have shown you. You have no rhetorical or scientific or logical escape from this.</p></p>

<p><strong>Infectious Diseases Society of America:</strong> ‘Cycle threshold above 35 drops PCR test accuracy to &lt;3%’</p>

<p><strong>European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases:</strong> PCR test only 12% accurate at Ct values of 33</p>
<p>“It is of paramount importance to define when a treated patient can be considered as no longer contagious. Correlation between successful isolation of virus in cell culture and Ct value of quantitative RT-PCR targeting E gene suggests that patients with Ct above 33–34 using our RT-PCR system are not contagious and thus can be discharged from hospital care or strict confinement for non-hospitalized patients.”</p>
<p>“Samples with Ct values of 13–17 all led to positive culture. Culture positivity rate then decreased progressively according to Ct values to reach 12% at 33 Ct. No culture was obtained from samples with Ct &rt; 34.”</p>

<p><strong>Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford University:</strong> </p>
<p>“Data are sparse on how the PCR results relate to viral culture results. There is some evidence of a relationship between the time from collection of a specimen to test, symptom severity and the chances that someone is infectious.”</p>
<p>“PCR detection of viruses is helpful so long as its limitations are understood; while it detects RNA in minute quantities, caution needs to be applied to the results as it often does not detect infectious virus.”</p>

<p><strong>The Lancet:</strong></p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that, although patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection might have prolonged RNA shedding of up to 83 days in upper respiratory tract infection, no live virus was isolated from culture beyond day 9 of symptoms despite persistently high viral RNA loads.”</p>
<p>“Our study shows that despite evidence of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples, viable virus appears to be short-lived. Therefore, RNA detection cannot be used to infer infectiousness.”</p>

<p><strong>Cornell University Preprint:</strong> </p>
<p>“Unlike previous epidemics, in addressing COVID-19 nearly all international health organizations and national health ministries have treated a single positive result from a PCR-based test as confirmation of infection, even in asymptomatic persons without any history of exposure. This is based on a widespread belief that positive results in these tests are highly reliable. However, data on PCR-based tests for similar viruses show that PCR-based testing produces enough false positive results to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of real-world scenarios. <em>This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates.</em> Steps should be taken to raise awareness of false positives, reduce their frequency, and mitigate their effects. In the interim, positive results in asymptomatic individuals that haven't been confirmed by a second test should be considered suspect.”</p>

<p><strong>Oxford University Study:</strong></p>
<p>“Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. <em>A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health</em>.”</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Center for Disease Control:</strong> Public Health Guidance for Community-Level Preparedness and Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 2004 [report]</p>
<p>“To decrease the possibility of a false-positive result, testing should be limited to patients with a high index of suspicion for having SARS-CoV disease.”</p>
<p>“In addition, any positive specimen should be retested in a reference laboratory to confirm that the specimen is positive. To be confident that a positive PCR specimen indicates that the patient is infected with SARS-CoV, a second specimen should also be confirmed positive. Finally, all laboratory results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical and epidemiologic information available for the patient.”</p>

<p><strong>World Health Organization:</strong> </p>
<p>“The design principle of RT-PCR means that for patients with high levels of circulating virus (viral load), relatively few cycles will be needed to detect virus and so the Ct value will be low. Conversely, when specimens return a high Ct value, it means that many cycles were required to detect virus. In some circumstances, the distinction between background noise and actual presence of the target virus is difficult to ascertain. Thus, the IFU will state how to interpret specimens at or near the limit for PCR positivity. In some cases, the IFU will state that the cut-off should be manually adjusted to ensure that specimens with high Ct values are not incorrectly assigned SARS-CoV-2 detected due to background noise.”</p>

        <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I have had a counter argument that the lower PCR cycles are only for some special separate attempt to (finally?!) actually isolate covid, and the vaxxed and unvaxxed are still being run at the same Ct normally?</p>
<p>I have had multiple people counter-argue this. Any knowledge of this argument?</p>
