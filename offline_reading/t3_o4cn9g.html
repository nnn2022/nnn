    <strong>I would like to talk some Christians against the vaxx, do you know any websites, groups, etc online?</strong>
    <p><p>I deconverted but who knows where I am at spiritually but I would like to talk to some Christians online who see through the vaxx and are discerning it is evil. [NWO aware Christians basically] That Revelations of Jesus Christ 6 hour video got to me. I am having thoughts and feelings I can't describe to others. My religious beliefs may be different but I want to talk to some.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not against vaccines. I'm against authoritarian politicans, shills, the government telling me that I need to comply or else I lose my job, be vilified, guilted, etc .We live in America, I still have the right to volunteer to be a guinea pig for pharma or choose not to take an experimental shot into my body.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why this is difficult for some people to understand?</p>

        <p>I took most vaccines just against this one, but yes all those other things you have listed are massive problems. We have severe authoritarianism now, and people being forced out of jobs or told they will lose them is unconscionable. Yes the loss of freedom is as big of a problem as the poison vaxx they are trying to push on people.</p>

        <p>Yes, one reason I deconverted, and I know why is I had no real fellowship. I was NWO aware and they were all bootlicking war mongers, I walked out of the last fundie church because they praised and said they wanted war with Iran. There's not going to be any fellowship here among allies, think I am figuring that out, not for me anyway. I am in shock in circles I am in there, was no pro-nature holistic people against this garbage either. All the Christians I know, lined up, there may be a few from the first IFB I was in that I had to move away from that didn't but all the religious people around here have lined up. Yes they will all comply and this is like 1930s Germany again.</p>

        <p>It has a history of ignoring ‚Äúmajor‚Äù cultural trends, which given time, turn out to be quite minor. I looked in my YouTube history and couldn‚Äôt find what I was looking for initially, but this video popped up and does the job just as well (though it is a bit longer).</p>

        <p>I studied the bible HEAVY, when I was a Christian fundamentalist. I still remember a lot of it. The FIRST DAY I read how the mRNA vaxx work, I though oh no and thought of transhumanism and the altering humans to be something else. I thought of it being where a human being would become basically "patented" by other humans. Like an ownership there, also against the bible. Messing with the DNA is an abomination. I agree totally with the Revelations of Jesus Christ guy, whatever our religious differences, that it is an ABOMINATION, against nature, etc etc.</p>

        <p>My advice to you (I did my degree in Theology and served numerous denominations over the years): be careful what you read/watch online, especially when it comes to eschatology (end times).</p>
<p>There is so much garbage online.</p>
<p>Remember 9/11? All these end times wackos saying that George Bush was the antichrist, seeing demons in the smoke of the twin towers, etc. It was hysterical nonsense motivated by fear, but they made a fortune selling their books and courses.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation was written to Christians in the Roman empire, about Rome and Caesar, and what they were experiencing at that time. It was never meant to be 'deciphered' or interpreted 2000 years later.</p>
<p>Christ lives and reigns, and there is nothing new under the sun. Empires rise and fall. Man tries to build himself up to be his own god (think Fauci, Gates, etc.), and God frustrates their plans. It will continue this way again and again until Christ returns.</p>

        <p>I studied eschatology, know the difference between amillennialism, pretrib, post trib, the meaning of preterism. Some non-clergy fundamentalists go deep. When I deconverted, I even worried about the spiral bible prophecy had taken me and it's obviously abused.</p>
<p>I agree with you there are tons of false theories out there. With some of this stuff, I am watching and waiting. I don't want to be deceived but this stuff is so extreme. Some believe Revelation is cyclical, repeating, in a way. Fauci and Gates are trying to build themselves up to be gods, we agree there.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the nuttiest of nutty trees. I‚Äôm hesitant about this newest vaccine because we don‚Äôt truly know if it is safe but I know some christians that have really gone off the deep end on this one.

        <p>I understand, you see I deconverted and left that world only a few years ago. I still believed in some conspiracy but walked away from the conspiracy world too, I wanted to be "rational" LOL, but then this all happened. I don't think this vaccine is safe and there's too much evidence they are up to no good. I also feel "warned" inside. I don't want to go back to the abuses of evangelical and fundamentalist Christian churches. I've seen too much, had an abusive "deliverance minister", I am being cautious. Even taking all religion out of it, the liberal world of "science and rationality" utterly failed me [again], and well, I had left extreme religion behind before too, never became an atheist but went into liberal religion and well seeing all these bible prophecies come true is a bit scary.</p>
