        <p>If someone needs info about these fibers, I have posted a lot about them, check my comment history if interested. I dont want to copy the same comment everywhere because that would be spamming.</p>
<p>To everyone who thinks these are just textile fibers... 1) I have videos of these things moving inside closed packaging, so the contamination comes from the producer. 2) I have videos showing these things contract in length, wiggle, turn around and spin, even seconds after the person breathed into the mask. 3) I have been researching this technology since 2018 and there are multiple versions of these fibers around, I found them in anti-depressants, skin care products, make-up and more</p>

        <p>TL;DR: People are being tortured with this technology, probably a few million sufferers worldwide</p>
<p>I try my best to explain it in simple terms, because the entire thing is overwhelmingly complex. Also this is... kind of advanced conspiracy so everyone not able to believe it please just ignore.</p>
<p>You ingest these fibers from various sources, these connect to an artificial microbe network in your body (that has been installed since 1998 in every living being that can breath and btw. I was able to prove that plants have these filament networks inside them too) and collect information. What products did you use, did you wear masks, did you get tested all the time, did you use drugs. Depending on how many fibers you take in and from which source exactly it is then decided if you are stupid, evil or both. I dont know the criteria exactly because I didnt invent this insane program, but if you use an excessive amount of make-up or skin-care products because you are vain, someone might decide "ok fk this person, lets give him Morgellons". Your skin goes to hell and your health is declining, no doctor takes you serious, everyone thinks you are nuts when you tell people fibers are growing out of your body.</p>
<p>If you take in too many fibers from tainted illegal drugs (yes these fibers have been found in illegal drugs, what does that tell you about where they come from?) and maybe you eat too much red meat and you are have some character flaws, they will enter you into their insane mind control program. Same as with morgellons, you are being tortured, no one believes you, most people who experience this kill themselves after a few years. Its all done remotely and automated. <a href="https://www.dataasylum.com">www.dataasylum.com</a> 99% of the information on that page is true.</p>
<p>I dont expect anyone to believe me with this but the least I can do is to post this information</p>

        <p>What if, these are not nano technology, but simply a parasite. Diphyllobothrium for instance, a small worm like parasite that sneak in under your skin from anywhere in your body and eat cells, then lay eggs to reproduce. After a long time with the parasite in your body most people die.</p>
<p>Death certificate will say covid and people will be surprised "<em>but but, he where so compliant, always worse his mask...</em>". Just consider the fact that hospitals are essentially empty by now, they only take in "covid patients" while every other treatment is stopped, particularly treatments against parasites, which is really sad because there are ways to know if you have this parasite in you and medicine to force it out.</p>
<p>It's genius, nobody will ever suspect the parasite because no one is looking for it. And government won't need to waste billions of dollars on expensive nano technology on people they wanna kill anyway.</p>

        <p>I been researching these and found them on almost every face mask I own. They were even on high quality Japanese made face mask in packages. Today I will be doing test to remove them and put them in hot water and alcohol to see if they move.</p>
