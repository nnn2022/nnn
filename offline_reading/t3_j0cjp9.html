    <strong>Is anyone else delaying "fun" until all this over?</strong>
    <p><p>I still go out to eat and things like that, but I haven't been to a mall or any retail store since March and have put off trips to the beach or other events until all this over. I just don't want any of these experiences hindered by ridiculous mask mandates or social distancing rules. As long as this has already drug on, I'm prepared to continue delaying these things even into next year if we're not back to normal by then. Anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>Until the mask bollocks crept its way into pubs and cafes, you used to be able to get away without them in shops and other such places, and despite all the floor stickers and plexiglass, going out was still bearable, dare I say enjoyable. Now you see them outdoors much more and it really seems to me they've double down on this crap. Supermarkets are now boasting in ads about how they've got hectoring marshals on the door, and about all they're doing to keep us 'safe'. </p>
<p>Why are we pandering to these Mary Anns? If you want to stay at home, that's your right. No one's holding a gun to your head to go the pub. But don't make life a misery for the rest of us. I swear, some people aren't happy until they're telling somebody else what to do.</p>
<p>There needs to be less plexiglass and more perspective!</p>

        <p>Yes. I‚Äôm only doing the bare minimum and that is excruciating. No masked movies, not wasting money on this nonsense. I don‚Äôt consider most things ‚Äú open‚Äù if they demand masks and it‚Äôs harder than it was in February. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm never going to do recreational things ever again. The new normal doesn‚Äôt include me.</p>

        <p>I feel the same.</p>
<p>I am honestly baffled when people say things like, "Oh, life is pretty normal for me <strong>except for the mask...</strong></p>
<p>If the activity involves looking at people in masks, or having to wear one, I will not do it, with the exception of going grocery shopping late at night.</p>
<p>It is the masks that are affecting my mental and emotional health. Nothing is even remotely normal to me while people are still wearing them...</p>

        <p>I actually did go to the movies with my gf recently. I'm sure we were "supposed" to wear masks the whole time but we only wore them on our way in. No one said anything. I guess it depends on the theater.</p>

        <p>sincerely terrified that new normal will effectively cancel extroverts, and i'm the most extroverted person of all time, lol.</p>
<p>i've been reeling from this since March... feels like every day extroverts are doing something else wrong...</p>
<p>like you all, i'm just choosing to not partake in most activities (well the ones that haven't been outright cancelled). i don't talk to pro-new normal friends anymore, including my best girlfriends from college. we do go out to eat, but dining is really hit or miss. like today we visited our favorite beer garden in our old neighborhood, and it felt like we were in East Germany, pre-1989. my husband has been depressed all day, it's tragic!</p>
<p>from here on out, unless we know the restaurant will be normal (like our favorite local Mexican place and Italian place), we're doing take out and delivery. my husband goes to the grocery store every couple of weeks, and everything else can be bought online. we hang out with our chill neighbors and a couple other friends. i'm so thankful that my husband and i are on the same side of the lockdown, and i'm blessed that he is such a tolerant, adaptive person. i'm Tinkerbell, i need attention to live, i know i'm not easy to live/deal with.</p>
<p>i'm stupid depressed about group yoga being cancelled until there's a vaccine and everyone takes it. my commuter bus is being cancelled.</p>
<p>on the bright side, at least work is 100% back to normal, and i'm blessed to work with an amazing group of humans who hate this dystopia and genuinely want to make the future a better place. work is the only place that feels normal - at least i have that going for me five days a week.</p>
<p>it's not just you, kay and cats... we're all struggling with this, especially as the moratorium on fun drags into next spring... </p>
<p>how we get through this election and holiday season without parties, concerts, sports, movies, shopping, dating, dining, and in-person edu, i have no flipping idea. human beings are ultimately still very social creatures. this is a whole new dangerous experiment.</p>

        <p>I definitely have stopped fun until this is over.  I usually go to all the festivals and outdoor events but they're either cancelled or made so unpalatable to me with restrictions that I just haven't gone.  Tried to go to the farmer's market once, which used to be awesome and I would go every week, but it was such a drag I just won't go anymore. I really need a vacation and want to travel somewhere but same thing, I won't go and spend a bunch of money to have a half-assed vacation.</p>
<p>So yeah, you're not the only one.</p>

        <p>I know, right?  I used to walk to the town square every weekend to enjoy the nice sunshine on my walk and the awesome vendors when I got there, shopping and lunch on the square.  Now like you said, prison vibes.  One way lanes, people taking temperatures before you go in, masks, social distancing.  It's just unpleasant now.  I know I should patronize local farmers and businesses but the rules and regulations make me just avoid the hassle.</p>

        <p>Mostly I‚Äôm delaying shopping. I hope that others are doing the same and that malls eventually realize that COVID-19 protocols are ruining their business and start pushing back. Hopefully, they don‚Äôt draw the opposite conclusion: that it‚Äôs fear keeping people home. Pushing back against the fear would be positive too, though, so maybe people like me are making a small difference.</p>

        <p>it's weird but i keep hearing the pro-mask folks keep saying that if we would all just wear a mask for 3-4 weeks all the time in public, we could all get back out and get the economy going again!</p>
<p>but i think there are a lot of us who simply won't go out in public - indoor or outdoor - so long as a mask is required. we just don't want to, and they can't make us. i'd easily say that for the 25% of the population who are true-mask-believers, there are 25% of the population who are sincerly-anti-mask. so now 50% of people won't go out - some because they're afraid of the 'rona, some because we hate the new normal.</p>
<p>plus there are the vast majority of people who are just wearing the mask to virtue signal (25%) and the people who are just wearing them to avoid a public stoning (25%).</p>
<p>anyway, that means a lot of our money isn't going into local businesses and the economy, which is holding everyone back. if the new covid-19 restrictions, regulations, and standards don't kill the economy, the fear, loathing, and hatred will.</p>

<p>Can you believe a jet ski rental put on their website you have to wear a mask to get your jet ski AT A MARINA. You had to wear one to even get in the park. So guess where I got a waverunner? Somewhere else.</p>

        <p>I'm avoiding some things because of masks and contact tracing, like eating indoors in restaurants. In Ontario, Canada at least one member of your party has to provide contact details so they can get ahold of you if there's an "outbreak." </p>
<p>I avoided a Walk Against Domestic Violence and a local Black Lives Matter protest due to mandatory masks (funny that the marches were against other kinds of oppression, but demanded masks). I'm also avoiding exercise classes that ask for masks anywhere in the building. Yeah, OK, force me to go into the grocery store with one on, but don't expect me to pay for a gym and then wear one.</p>

        <p>Here in Wisconsin, there is a state-wide mask mandate, but no one in bars follows it. I go out nearly every weekend and bar hop with friends. Life is regular in there, dancing and drinking, and lots of socializing. I completely forget about the "pandemic" for a few hours. It's a bonus because I've found that everyone else that is out and about, maskless, more or less has the same viewpoints/values as myself. It's kinda awesome in that way.</p>

        <p>This is me too. I made sure to still have a summer and try to make the most of it--seeing friends, a couple of parties/gatherings, hiking, kayaking, camping, going out to eat at as many restaurants as I can support/afford, local bars when it's an option, even traveling a bit--a few trips to the city, a family road trip... AND I recently made the big move back up north from the south. Ironically, I've travelled quite a bit in the past six months. No way am I going to let them ever take that away from me. I'm a complete nomad and wanderlust at heart.</p>
<p>I'm a huge music/festival/concert fly, and not having the option at all has made me try to find other things to do even more.</p>
<p>Basically anything I can do that's enjoyable and doesn't require wearing a mask, I am doing. Been pushing boundaries since the beginning and feel it's even more important and crucial now. Can I also just say how freaking happy I am that I found this sub??? Seriously, it's kind of saved my life these past few months. Y'all are great. Thank you &lt;3</p>

        <p>Yeah I‚Äôve had to learn this the hard way to avoid normally fun activities like shopping and traveling because hygiene theater has gutted the joy from many of them. For instance, I used to love trips to ikea, but the last time we went they had a queue out front that rivaled a Disneyland ride. It was hot and smoky out from the CA fires, and we waited in line with a bunch of masked NPCs for over an hour. We get to the door to discover that they‚Äôve taken the social distancing to such an extreme that they were letting groups of 20 people in and the warehouse was practically empty. We get in to discover that the item that we wanted was no longer in stock (bought while we were in line no less) so we had wasted almost two hours of our lives and inhaled smoke to go home empty handed. I won‚Äôt be shopping there again till this is over.</p>

        <p>lol same... sort of... except for the smoke torture... and not Ikea...</p>
<p>i stopped going to the grocery store in May right before Memorial Day, when Northam started his mandatory mask crap.</p>
<p>it was 6 am, it was raining and chilly, and i was sitting on the ground outside of our Wegmans, and i was in the middle of the line, thanks to social distancing requirements. (they were limiting the number of people in the store at any given time.) i wasn't wearing a mask and this older woman in line started asking me what my problem was, and i told her that she was, in Russian. plugged in my headphones and blasted some European techno, because i wanted to get the real East German experience. </p>
<p>finally get in the store and i got maybe 50% of the stuff on my list - like, meat, produce, cleaning supplies, paper products - everything was out of stock and backordered, stuff was still being rationed per customer.  it was so depressing walking down aisle after aisle with empty shelves and sad people without smiles or noses.</p>
<p>(also, i haven't been able to find regular refried beans since March - plenty of vegan refried beans, but no regular. you know, the kind made with lard. v troubling. also i am totally fine going to a Latin market if that's where they might be hiding, and open to brand recommendations.)</p>
<p>fucking miserable with the arrows on the floor and the constant reminders piped in over the speakers reminding us to wear a mask! keep our distance! mind the arrows! frequently hand sanitize! no coughing! limit your conversations! people giving everyone every dirty look in the book, everyone was antsy and upset and nervous and squirrelly. the deli counter was still closed. couldn't find any tpons in my size.</p>
<p>it took me twice as long to shop, and i didn't even get half the items on my fairly basic list. plus, my receipt was 20% higher than it had been back in February. so i was like, well, i have wine, i have white claw, we got bread, milk, eggs, cheese, and bacon. fuck this, i'm never coming back.</p>
<p>too disappointing. too dystopian. too depressing.  i'd like to cancel my free trial of socialism now.</p>
<p>and it's like, for comparison, i've lived in Russia - Russia is actually a pretty nice, continental European place in the major cities. my babushka told me how awful WWII was (her family survived the siege of Leningrad), and how awful the Soviet Union was (forgotten people, that phrase haunts my subconsciousness these days). she was like, well, of course Russia isn't perfect, Putin isn't a super hero, but everything today (late 2000s) is so much better than it was twenty years ago.</p>
<p>came home, told my husband i wasn't fucking going to the grocery store until this shit is all fucking over with, and i haven't gone back to Wegmans since. they lost a loyal customer.</p>
<p>now if i need to run into Safeway or Giant or Hmart after work, i pick up a few items, and i'm in and out in 15 min on the way home. the mask sucks, but i can do it for small bits of time. </p>
<p>(also people aren't such huge assholes at the Asian grocery stores and the selection/price is actually pretty good, but YMMV. only in Northern Virginia will you hear people in the store screaming at each other in Chinese, and then get out of the store, and start screaming at each other with thick southern accents as they load up the pick-up truck, lol.)</p>
<p>my husband does all the big grocery shopping now and he's doing a great job, but he also contends that it fucking sucks. however, when he wears his mask wrong, he's a big 6'4" Midwestern dude, so no one confronts him or fucks with him. i'm a 5'3" lady and literally everyone picks on me. fuck them. </p>
<p>so pickleoodles, i'm sorry your adventure at Ikea was depressing and disappointing and dystopian, and you came our empty handed. fuck them and fuck this. and i am so so sorry about the forest fires, and i'm going to blame that on the corona-lunatics too, because if they hadn't fucking panicked and cancelled routine forest maintenance and controlled burnings, maybe we could have avoided some of these massive wildfires.</p>

        <p>No, not at all. Aren't you going crazy? But "fun" for me is going to the park, youth sports, going to the beach, that sort of thing. We don't go out to eat or drink anyway and I would never consider wearing a mask outside at the beach. </p>
<p>I'm bummed that all the local festivities have been cancelled like 4th of July, a big craft fair I like, and some other parades and fairs. If they had gone ahead with these and required masks I'd go. It's more important for me to be out in the world than holed away. </p>
<p>We have a mask mandate here but people are pretty half assed about it and no one cares.</p>

        <p>I started going out again around June. Of course have to wear a mask in stores but in my area there's no mandate so most outdoor farmers markets and stuff are mask free.</p>
<p>Sometimes though I do want to just avoid stores so I don't have to deal with masks, but it seems like they're getting more and more lax about enforcing it and now we're back to where a number of people don't even wear them there.</p>
<p>I've only been to eat in a restaurant once since this started though. I really hope things are more back to normal by next spring, since I want to do something for my birthday since we were locked down for it this year. Other than the masks though we basically are anyway, as long as we don't get a mask mandate or lockdowns from federal level next year.</p>

        <p>I still go figure skating even though it‚Äôs masks required, because &amp; really do enjoy it otherwise and my coach is still hands on. (High fives at the end of lessons, willing to use physical contact to help with positioning and movements if needed.)    But I don‚Äôt shop nearly as much for leisure anymore because of the chance I may have to wait in line to get in, plus the mask rules, the one way aisles some stores are clinging to, etc. And of course the limited registers for ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù where you have to crowd together for longer anyway. And why would I go clothes shopping when you can‚Äôt try anything on? </p>
<p>I‚Äôm also not going to any minor league hockey games here until all the restrictions in PA are lifted. The tickets are pricey for minor league hockey and I‚Äôm not paying to have to wear a mask and sit in ‚Äúsocially distanced‚Äù seating.</p>

        <p>Masks are about to become mandatory for all indoor public spaces where I live for at least four weeks (probably more knowing them) and indoor/outdoor gatherings limited to 10. The restrictions weren't this bad earlier (masks weren't required most places and I could still have fun) and now they're increasing them. Now I don't really want to go out much either.

        <p>Last I bothered, I was looking for Fourth of July fireworks. Instead of that, the closest town to me was having a train go through town, stopping at different parks, and screening digital fireworks. People were invited to pick their favorite park, mask up, and social distance. The concept depressed the hell out of me, and I stayed home.</p>
<p>The restaurants where I am do not require masks and few people wear them, so I still go out to eat a lot, but that's about it.</p>
