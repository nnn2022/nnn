    <strong>I finally know someone close who tested positive for covid and is actually sick, but I still don't know anything about covid.</strong>
    <p><p>Individual is around 45, fit but overweight (fit/fat type). Long story short; tested +, got a cold, cold developed into pneumonia, went to dr for something to treat a dry cough that wouldn't go away, hospitol checks oxygen levels, says he's around 86, that sounds ok to me but they're worried, he's received different treatment suggestions from everyone that has examined him. Current Dr is continuing to test for other etiology (which is good) but is treating for covid and wants to intubate early rather than later. Doc also says don't worry about getting vaccinated, there are lots of those sick here too. His wife and kids are + too but not sick at all. That's one element that sounds fishy to me. It happens a lot, one getting sick while everyone else is symptom free. I had pneumonia in high school such that my lips were literally turning blue and I was hallucinating  on deaths door and no one mentioned intubation as a course of treatment. My primary curiosity is this; if this man had shown up with cv19 symptoms in early 2019, would doctors have suspected anything other than some variety of pneumonia? Is cv19 dominating the medical thought process such that Drs can't see past it, or does it genuinely present itself as unique? Please, if you are a med professional, clue me in.</p></p>

        <p>The FLCCC's Math+ hospital treatment protocol can inform those treating him:</p>
<p>https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/math-plus-protocol/</p>
<p>Notable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid early intubation that is based solely on oxygen requirements. Allow “permissive hypoxemia” as tolerated.</li>
<li>Intubate only if patient demonstrates excessive work of breathing.</li>
<li>Utilize “prone positioning” to help improve oxygen saturation.</li>

        <p>86% oxygen is not good but I've definitely seen worse. If he was 86% on room air then there is no reason to jump from that right to intubation. Maybe if he is still at that level after you have gone from nasal cannula to mask to a bag mask, but I expect someone who was walking around at 86% would respond well to 2-3 Lpm and a regular nasal cannula.</p>

        <p>Thanks, the doctor provided his rational based on his field experience and felt that healthy individuals were responding well to early intubation (just relaying what he said). Would 86% warrant possible intubation with pre covid pneumonia symptoms? I'm just trying to get a bead on how distinct cv19 is.</p>
