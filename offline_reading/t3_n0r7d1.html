    <strong>You Are Risking NOTHING And EVERYTHING By Complying</strong>
    <p><p>I bet this past year has just been a nice little cozy Covid catastrophe for you, hasn't it? All the vicarious thrill of a disaster movie but from the comfort of your couch. You stayed home, wore a mask, socially distanced, got dosed daily with fear porn and propaganda, masked up your Reddit avatar, participated in group wanks over Zoom, sent death threats to dissenters and barked at anti-maskers on the street, complied like a good citizen, and got vaccinated when your time came. You did your part, you fought the battle, and lost NOTHING...</p>
<p>Except your freedom, bodily autonomy, trust in other human beings, mental health, credibility, normality, and a year of your life. You shed your morals and adopted new media and government-approved guidelines in their place, fed to you in bite-sized slogans and repetitive rhetoric out of a Fauci-headed pez dispenser. "My body, my choice" became "WEAR A MASK AND GET THE VACCINE, BIGOT!" in nothing flat. "Covid" has become your entire life and personality, its grown inside you like a fucking parasite, and now you're so paranoid and distrustful normal life is but a distant and scary sepia-tinged polaroid of a memory. You have lost EVERYTHING and you don't even realize it.</p>
<p>At least we're actually fighting for something, and if we're wrong, well, we go back to normal, which is what we want anyway, and it's a nice slice of humble pie and crow for dinner. Except we're not wrong. The things we stand for - personal freedom, bodily autonomy, choice, consent, freedom of speech, and, you know what, fucking HUMANITY - those things matter and they SHOULD NOT have been forcibly taken from us. It is immoral and evil, what these utter, utter CUNTS have perpetrated, nothing will change that. The suffering and aftermath of lockdowns will be felt for DECADES to come.</p>
<p>Freedom should not be mocked and given up so easily. What a fucking slap in the face of anyone and everyone that ever had to fight for their freedom. Imagine sneering "MUH FREEDUMBS" in the face of an nineteenth century African-American slave or a concentration camp prisoner, because that's what you might as well be doing every time you mock, belittle and shit on the freedom you take for fucking granted. Good luck getting it back, by the way. They fucking KNOW they can do this whenever they like now and you better fucking believe they'll do it again.</p>
<p>There's a fucking reason this pandemic is perhaps the most divisive and obsessed over issue in human history. Ask yourself why that is.</p></p>

        <p>Most politicians, technocrats, globalist, and the old banking families that seem to be working together to destroy our freedoms, liberties, and even lives through their nwo/great reset agenda that will grant them control of the world and those who are left in it, after their depopulation programs. Such as endless wars, medical schemes, legal and illegal drug abuse, forced vaccines, false flags events, and etc. Almost every celebrity you are aware is also apart of this organization, they are used to distract, and then endorse ideologies to further certain parts of the agenda in the public eye. It's not hard to spot them, they often use their symbolism to identify themselves. The people just aren't paying attention. I recommend you do a little digging. What you'll find will surprise you.</p>

        <p>“Ability to live free” </p>
<p>Do you think people are fucking slaves because they need to wear a god damn mask? How stupid are you? </p>
<p>How about the people that died because a quarter of the population decided they didn’t want to take it seriously? Where are their free, normal lives? India has over twice the population of the U.S. and less than half the deaths and they barely took it more seriously. </p>
<p>For some reason because the orders to wear a mask came from the federal government (even under a republican presidency?) nobody wants to listen because “gUbeRnMenT bAd”. Who would the orders had to have come from for you people to listen? The local news? Local hospitals? Your high school gym teacher? Your favorite Horoscope YouTube channel? On the god damn bottom of a Snapple lid? </p>
<p>There are tons of legitimate reasons to be angry at the federal government for overstepping their boundaries. The Patriot act, literally all 9/11 countermeasures, shit, even the corporate bailouts from the recent stimulus bills. </p>
<p>But no, the mask is the thing you choose to latch onto. </p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>

        <p>I live in a state that forced gyms to shut down for 6 fucking months. Imagine closing gyms for 6 months in a country where heart disease is the leading cause of death, and justifying that as a necessary sacrifice made for public health. These people need to be held accountable for what they've done.</p>

        <p>I was just watching a YouTube ad (I was fascinated by a new commercial where people were happy and maskless and I was wondering "Is this the day I have to remember when people started looking happy and not associating that happy with masks or COVID in any way?"), and it ended with "The Vaccine Confidence Project".</p>
<p>Fuckers.  The hell do you need to build confidence in the vaccines for if your normal human being saw any reason to get it?  </p>
<p>Because here's the thing: I think most people are afraid to say that they see how fucky all of this has been, and that their only choice to get back to "normal" is through a vaccine.  </p>
<p>That's why "they" need you to be "confident" in the vaccine.  It's one big gaslight against the situation TPTB caused: the government breaking your legs and then giving you crutch and telling you that without the government, you wouldn't be able to walk.</p>

        <p>and now they are taking a second year of life away.
I wish I knew a few people locally who were against this but I don't. It's scary and I am in a high lock down place. They are already wanting to ban the unvaccinated from a ton of my groups. I protested in email to one, never got a response. I don't feel the same about people anymore. It's hard to explain.</p>

        <p>I deliver mail in a very liberal very pro mask/restriction area. Basically a few days ago I’ve had enough and stopped wearing a mask. Almost everyone who wants a vaccine has gotten it. Basically nobody has said  anything about it. Many many people don’t really care anymore but they go along with it because everyone else does. Show people that this thing is over and it will spread. It may be tougher in corporate businesses but in small businesses most people don’t care. Trust me, they aren’t wearing masks if nobody is in their store. They do it to appease people</p>

        <p>Glad people don't care. I have wondered if the epidemic is really over whatever there was of one beyond the fake PCR tests and they have dragged this shit out. I guess all this showed how vaccous my "social life" is and true nature of my isolation if nothing else. I will go buy food from farmers if I have to, kind of know how to do that, but yeah, I hope most people return to normal.</p>

        <p>No, I see that nothing ever really went back to "normal" after 9/11 and the same is likely to happen with COVID. But when the heat is turned up to high, I suppose it's only natural to sigh with relief when the heat is turned back down to medium-high.</p>

        <p>Well fucking said. I keep telling my friends do you think I care if I’m wrong about the conspiracy theory parts? They’ve ALREADY taken our freedoms and divided the country with propaganda. In the best case scenario that the government truly works for the people, they already overreached by an arm and a half.</p>

        <p>It’s crazy to me that people actually believe all this nonsense is acceptable. Within one short year, wearing a face diaper is totally normal(even outside on a hike), constant propaganda forced down our throats are every turn about a still experimental “vaccine”, and the fact most people have just laid down and accepted all this is the worst part. They destroyed countless small businesses and restaurants, meanwhile bullion-dollar corporations raked in more money than ever. All with no evidence of a lockdown even preventing spread.</p>

<p>We don't need to have 80% get a shot to reach herd immunity. Millions have had Covid and/or been exposed to Covid. Those folks count toward herd immunity, too. The "experts" just don't want to admit that.</p>
<p>And some ask: then why are cases still going up?</p>
<p>Well that's easy because their testing more people, of course cases will go up.</p>

        <p>&rt;Freedom should not be mocked and given up so easily. What a fucking slap in the face of anyone and everyone that ever had to fight for their freedom. Imagine sneering "MUH FREEDUMBS" in the face of an nineteenth century African-American slave or a concentration camp prisoner, because that's what you might as well be doing every time you mock, belittle and shit on the freedom you take for fucking granted.</p>

        <p>Hi! Differing opinion here. Posting on my main so you guys stay mad.</p>
<p>I've had to cut off my uncle because of you fear mongers. Why, you may ask? Refusing to wear a mask around my immunocompromised ass. Thinking it's 'just a cold' when 'just a cold' could very well fucking kill me.</p>
<p>You guys are all for your freedoms. I get that. We all deserve to be free. But that includes my freedom to live in a world that won't kill me. Wearing a mask to prevent the deaths of others is only an inconvenience for you. For me, it's a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Please, don't blindly scroll over this and instead read what I have to say. I want things to go back to normal. But there's no way that happens when we have keyboard warriors doing 10 minutes of 'research' to 'disprove' the life work of actual scientists.</p>

        <p>What is the end goal of getting everyone vaccinated and wearing mask if it is a big conspiracy theory? Yall tards on here cant even agree on one point other than mUh FREedOms.</p>
<p>You all are taking health advice from a guy who got paid to have people drink horse cum on TV rather than doctors, i don't understand how you dont see how ridiculous anti vaxxers anti maskers sound.</p>
<p>It's one thing to be skeptical and want to wait a while on the vaccine, even if its been tested and approved. But to say covid doesnt exist and its a deep state plot to get you to wear a mask is crazy.</p>

        <p>I don’t see anyone saying Covid isn’t real, yes it’s real but it’s being exploited. “Never let a good crisis go to waste” right? None of what there doing makes sense! Have you ever seen what a 5 year olds mask looks like at the end of the day? Covered in dirt and snot? Yea that’s healthy. Forcing kids to wear a mask for a virus that they are at very low risk from is INSANE! I’ll bet you wear a mask (or 2) while driving alone in you car or walking outside. And you think we are ridiculous?</p>

        <p>A few things with your response:
-I generalized the sub because I've seen more than a few claim it is not real, fair that wasn't mentioned here.
-Yes, a mask gets dirty when you wear it, but that is why you wash or replace it. That would be the equivalent of saying "look how sweaty my shirt gets when I wear it all day, and kids shirts get even dirtier! Therefore, they should not wear shirts!" There is no evidence that breathing in a mask during the day will get you sick, that is failed argument. Also, they might not be a high risk, but the idea is that they can be carrying and spreading COVID to others when not wearing a mask.
-You reverted to useless ad hominem attacks at the end of your response, which dont proove a point. I actually don't do either, unless I don't feel like taking the mask off in my car. I think a lot of anti maskers believe people wear masks in their cars because they are afraid of the virus, when in reality its just being lazy.</p>

        <p>Do you really think a 5 year old changes masks or washes them when it gets dirty? And there is plenty of evidence that says breathing in a mask all day is unhealthy especially for children. Show me the evidence that kids transmit Covid, it's extremely low risk so the "idea" is just that, an idea. The exploitation is locking us down when the science says we are safer outside, it's wearing a mask to walk into a restaurant but okay to take off once your seated, it's okay to shop at big box stores owned by large corporations but not at small privately owned business's, it's closing schools when again kids are at low risk, it's the daily bombardment of how many people have died from Covid when really that number is how many died with Covid. I can go on and on. What is happening is not okay.</p>

        <p>If you're wrong, lots more people die.  We are fighting for something too.  A return to normal through vaccination with fewer deaths and less suffering from the virus.</p>
<p>It has not been a cozy year.  It's been a year of finding new ways to enjoy life and family and friends as everything was taken away.  And learning to accept that you can't make people face reality and do the right thing.  You can only do the best you can.  Which has absolutely nothing to with obedience.  My kids could tell you that I don't believe in obedience.  </p>
<p>I don't want vaccine mandates, except for healthcare and nursing home employers and things like cruise lines that cater to seniors and use it as a marketing tool.  I just want people to make decisions based on facts, not on lies that the virus isn't that bad or the vaccines are going to do terrible things to people.</p>

        <p>How would my not getting vaccinated mean more people die (assuming that's what you're referring to by me being wrong)? Those who are at risk from the virus will have had the vaccine and therefore should have ample protection against it (also I could still spread and catch the virus even if I was fully vaccinated).</p>

        <p>I was referring to being wrong about the virus and the vaccines, but right now the important thing in many countries like the U.S.  and UK is vaccination.</p>
<p>Your risks of catching and spreading the virus are much less if you are vaccinated.  First, I really don't want anyone to die of Covid unnecessarily because someone convinced them the vaccine was unsafe.  And, we need herd immunity.   The vaccines are very effective, but not 100% effective, which means that a vaccinated person could potentially get the virus.  And, there are many people who can't get vaccinated or wouldn't retain immunity from vaccines.  Right now, that includes everyone under 16.  The risk of dying from the virus for kids is extremely low, but I can't help thinking of pediatric cancer patients, for personal reasons.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity is achieved through vaccination AND infection. </p>
<p>As for people that are at risk and can't get vaccinated: of course their safety should be prioritized, as they should have been this entire time instead of dragging everyone else into it, but lockdowns and face masks aren't the way to do it. The amount of money and effort spent on lockdowns and propaganda could have been better spent constructing a system that could benefit those who are at risk from the virus, e.g. staying home with food deliveries and personal carers. Lockdowns were a VERY lazy solution.</p>

        <p>“Seemingly well reasoned.”
So you mean.. well reasoned?</p>
<p>All they’re saying is that ignoring the protocols could have more damage than following them and getting life back to normal, maskless.
By not wearing masks, it’s contributing to how long these rules stay in place. 
If you got the vaccine and are immune, you can still carry it, and possibly give it to a grandparent who hasn’t had the vaccination yet, or an immunocompromised child. By wanting to say “I don’t need to wear a mask, they’re stupid” is risking many people’s lives, and possibly taking away their freedom by making them go on bed rest and not be able to go out because you caused them to get sick.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you know anybody who’s immunocompromised, but as someone who is; it’s scary. Knowing that even if I’m young, I could die from this because my immune system isn’t working, and I absolutely appreciate when people do their part to protect and help people like me.</p>
<p>I realize you may be stubborn like me, and I may not change your opinion, but I would appreciate if you tried to look in the perspective of people who can truly suffer if they get sick.</p>

        <p>1/3 of Europe (25 million) died due to a pandemic, 500 million in the Spanish Flu, 300 million to smallpox (smallpox went down as this was the first invention of the vaccine, and is now almost completely eradicated). 
How did people survive? A lot didn’t. 
People <em>died</em> before this. People quarantined during the Spanish flu, and now it’s not around, Europe didn’t know how diseases spread, so many died, smallpox was only completely eradicated when a man found out about immunity due to milkmaids being immune after having cowpox. Then the number for smallpox dwindled.</p>
<p>And mortality rate does depend on country and location. In the US, it’s 1.8%, but places like Mexico, it’s 9.2%<em>. Which is </em>a lot* if you think about it.</p>
<p>What are the long term effects of any other vaccine besides a couple days of maybe feeling ill? They remake the flu vaccine every year, who’s to say what long term affects that new flu vaccine may have?
Companies would lose money if their vaccine did not work.</p>
<p>And mind if I ask what you mean by “work in groups”? I don’t fully understand that statement to make a comment on it.</p>
<p>I also ask that you please direct me to the website that says places without mask mandates are healthier, I would like to see where you get your information from, and maybe my opinion may change depending on the credibility.</p>
<p>*These numbers are subject to change as cases fluctuate and as vaccines roll out</p>

        <p>I have repeatedly stated the 19% increase in total deaths in 2020 in the U.S., with a 40% increase in December, according to the CDC provisional death totals.  Along with the data that about 2% of confirmed cases end in death.  It is impossible to know exactly how many unconfirmed cases there were to determine the IFR, but since about .2% of the entire population of the U.S. has died of Covid, and clearly not everyone has had it, the IFR is obviously well above that number.<br>
The vaccines have been shown to have a 90-95% efficacy rate.  The claims of risk beyond mild side effects need supporting evidence, when the studies have found the vaccines to be safe.  The way the vaccines work has zero ability to affect DNA and I can't see how it could cause infertility.</p>
