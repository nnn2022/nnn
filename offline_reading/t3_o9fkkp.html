    <strong>The propaganda is blatant and obvious with major social media networks conforming to the narrative for their own profit.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's Google: "vaers reports spiking" </p>
<p>First link on Google - a "fact-check" by Reuters. The first few links are manipulated to make it seem like it's not that bad. This is easily done with "search engine optimization," though I suspect that Reuters has some agreement with Google to put all of their trash articles as #1 for the search term. </p>
<p>Now search "vaers reports spiking" on DuckDuckGo. </p>
<p>The first link is titled "We made a big mistake" and details just how experimental and unsafe the "totally safe experimental vaccine" is. </p>
<p>The second link is titled "CDC Vaers database paints a different picture on COVID shots." </p>
<p>The "fact-check" Reuters article is much lower. Thankfully. </p>
<hr>
<p>Now let's Google "did BLM spread Covid." </p>
<p>The first link's headline says "Black Lives Matter Didn't Contribute To Covid-19..." </p>
<p>Hmmm. Now before we move onto duckduckgo, it should take anyone with a half-working brain to put two and two together that if celebrating Thanksgiving with 6 family members is the event to kill grandma, then surely large-scale protests would end the world, right? </p>
<p>Nope. According to the System, you are allowed to support Approved Protests that don't spread covid according to The Science(TM). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same search term "Did blm spread covid" on DuckDuckGO has a lot of propaganda up top. However, as a whole the front page is a lot more reasonable. </p>
<p>There is something called "search engine optimization (SEO)" and it's a job for many people. It's all about making YOUR article go to the top of any search engine. So the first link is always not truthful. </p>
<hr>
<p>As a whole, I'm beginning to think that the truth about anything Reuters writes an article about is the opposite. It is abundantly clear that these "fact-checking" sites are nothing but pure propaganda. </p>
<p>Watch this: </p>
<p>Google "America didn't go to the moon." Or "the earth is flat." </p>
<p>Note how there are NO Reuters article on the front page of Google! </p>
<p>Why aren't they "fact-checking" this? We all know the Earth is round, right? </p>
<p>hint: it's because there's profit to be made if you believe in the narrative(TM) and The Science (TM). </p>
<p>There's no political agenda and no profit to be made if you believe in the Earth being round or that we went to the Moon. So why would they waste their time writing fact-checking articles for it? </p>
<p>Reuters and other "fact-checking" sites CLAIM to be the arbitrators of truth, but that's a bull-shit catch-phrase that they use promote their own political agenda. </p>
<p>It's for this reason I am beginning to believe that anything Reuters "fact-checks" is in fact the opposite of what they say. Obviously you shouldn't blindly think like that. Verify. Research. Discuss. </p>
<p>In Communist China, they fact-check the Tiananmen Square Massacre. That is 'fact-checked.' </p>
<p>I stand 100% AGAINST fact-checking sites. Yes the internet has a ton of misinformation. Yes there is ridiculous stuff out there. But everyone needs to put on their big-boy and big-girl pants and deal with it rather than sitting around being spoon-fed the "truth." </p>
<p>These things always start with good intentions, but end up turning into Tyrannical hells. First they fact-check basic political stuff, next thing you know Reuters will be fact-checking massacres against their political opponents... </p>
<p>I hope we don't come to that. The West stands at a dangerous cross-road right now.</p></p>

        <p>They been at this bullshit from the start.  Ratings and revenue is their god.  Some people on the internet made it sound scary so that got some clicks and TV saw it and made it sound scarier and that gets viewers, ratings and revenue.  If this had happened before the internet it would have been written off as a bad flu season most of the human race would have lived through withiut even noticing.  But here we are.  And here we'll stay.  </p>
<p>Like the man said, it's all bullshit and it's bad for you.</p>

        <p>It's so obvious isn't it.  I only use DDG search for political stuff and covid because i can't trust google to give me the true organic results.  As soon as I see a 'fact check' at the top of the search results I know the truth is the opposite of what the fact check concludes</p>
