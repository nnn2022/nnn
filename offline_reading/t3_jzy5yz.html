    <strong>Things seem to get worse...</strong>
    <p><p>At work, a lot of people to me seemed skeptical of this whole thing for the first several months. I had people telling me I was worrying too much. I knew this crap was going to go on all year but it seems like people thought it wouldn't last long. Like I told one person in April/May I wasn't going to wait to take time off because this was still going to be going on in December and even in 2021 and they seemed shocked that I thought such a thing.</p>
<p>I even knew one person who wouldn't wear a mask at the gym when they required them. Now the last two months he's started wearing a mask all day and he keeps his door shut and put up a sign that says no one is allowed in without a mask. And he keeps spraying everything with Lysol, and keeps the door shut even when he's not in.</p>
<p>I heard him telling someone a few months ago that it's so sad this happened and that he didn't think anyone would ever go out again because they're all scared. And that if he knew this was going to happen he would have done a lot more in life when things were normal. He also refuses to believe people who had it and tell him it's just like the flu because he doesn't know what it'll be like, and he's not really in a risk group that I can see.</p>
<p>He used to be at the gym every day for years and had huge muscles yet has not been in probably six months even once. I started going again this month and I feel like some sort of biohazard for doing it.</p>
<p>I heard a while back people saying they thought the government was going to make us wear masks forever. It seems like even people who weren't so crazy about this are now all on for it.</p>
<p>It's just so sad how people have been willing to give up all of their interests and hobbies like fitness and bodybuilding over this, and why have they gotten even MORE scared and restrictive when they weren't even seemingly over concerned for the first few months. I feel like part of this is a mental illness or something.</p></p>
