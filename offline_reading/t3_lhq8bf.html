        <p>I’ve been one since I was 14 and it was probably 3 or 4 years after 9/11. My Fiancé on the other hand was all in on Covid Fear for a few months then just started joining the dots she was excellent at it so I gave her a hot slice of Pizza Gate &amp; wayfair happened now she’s surpassed me almost. She’s a great researcher takes offence to being called a conspiracy theorist even though I wear it as a badge of honour always have.</p>

        <p>I'm not a conspiracy theorist at all. I don't think the Earth is flat or that the government is hiding aliens from us. I don't see how just disagreeing with the government and thinking people are overreacting is a conspiracy theory. It's just sanity.</p>

        <p>I’ve been aware that we weren’t being told the whole truth for 20 years. It first occurred to me when I was in high school history class and we were being taught about world war 1, and the events that supposedly led to it. I got a distinct feeling that my teacher was leaving out some very important information. That turned me into a skeptic. Then shortly after that, 9/11 turned a whole lot of other people in my generation into skeptics. But it was actually the “financial crisis” and bailout of 2008 that made me decide that we had a real problem and I couldn’t just ignore it and party. It was around that time that people started labeling me a conspiracy theorist. But I don’t concern myself with aliens, Bigfoot, flat earth etc. The only dragon I want to slay is the pervasive mind control, because once people aren’t afraid to think, most of them will just figure everything else out for themselves.</p>

        <p>I have been super-sceptical of anything the governments said after I was traumatised as a pre-teen during the 2002/3 SARS outbreak. When no-one I knew died, I never trusted any government again. I even recall complaining to my parents in 2003 that they would never find WMDs in Iraq. I am not a conspiracy theorist and detest that label. I am someone who thinks critically and knows how depraved some people can be. I don't care about things like aliens, Mandela effect, Loch Ness, lizard people, etc.</p>
