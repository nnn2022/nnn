    <p><p>Someone made a post about travel restrictions, and most of the comments were negative toward the restrictions. It was very surprising and opposite the last time I checked it out a few months ago. People are finally waking up and are fed up!</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify I’m talking about <em>local</em> and interprovincial travel restrictions.</p></p>

        <p>Most of the original people that would be in a city sub have been permabanned for having a moderate opinion by propaganda mods. Also there are tons of bots pushing a narrative.  And the rest are generic brainwashed covid hipsters. If these covid hipsters start questioning things.  They will be permabanned too.  Keep making the pool smaller for the narrative.  </p>
<p>What the propaganda mods don't seem to understand is when you ban someone for questioning things that instantly triggers them and wakes them up quicker.  Reddit mods are one of the reasons I never took blm or covid seriously.  They were clearly their to enforce a narrative and it woke me up quick.</p>

        <p>Just had a reddit admin mod give the local propaganda mod top mod spot on an abandoned local sub so he could shadow ban the sub. The propaganda mod always pretended it was reddit that did the shadow banning, but the proof is in the mod log. They literally slobber over vaccines in the local sub 24/7.</p>
