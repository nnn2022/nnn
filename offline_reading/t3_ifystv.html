    <strong>The " New Normal " Isn't Compatible With Democracy, How Does It End ?</strong>
    <p><p>Democracy and the new normal aren't compatible... Small and private businesses aren't compatible with the new normal hoax, why are countries like New Zealand/Australia going full on tyrant with quarantine facilities and passing laws allowing the government to remove kids from families for a virus with an IFR of 0.04 % under 70.</p>
<p>We all know in this sub it's about the great reset agenda, and a bunch of other bullshit but what I really don't understand is how politicians across the world in almost every country are willing to fuck absolutely everything up in their society and wreck havoc on their people to follow the global deep state ? Are they that scared of the propaganda networks and " online outrage " aimed at their twitter accounts if they don't follow the lockdown hoax ? </p>
<p>Why is almost every government except Sweden and Japan going along with this bullshit ? In Canada it's pretty relax except in Quebec where they went full on tyrant mode but certain countries/areas are draconian as fuck. </p>
<p>I really don't understand how politicians are killing their careers and countrymen for a pat on the back and maybe a UN seat down the road ? Does it end with them going barbaric using lethal force for compliance, killing/imprisoning millions across the world or they try to keep finessing the agenda until society literally breaks down and mass revolt against government start.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm too young, but I can't remember anytime in modern history where there has been THIS much hate and distrust against governments and the institution of government.</p></p>

        <p>To me the most wild part of this is how governments seem to not realize or think there isn’t a breaking point for humans and their mental health in this. People are still mostly hanging on but it won’t last forever. You take away absolutely every form of joy or thing to work towards and basically everything people live for and give them no end date to get it back and eventually people will realize they have nothing left to lose by revolting. I don’t think these governments understand what happens when people have nothing left to lose because there’s never been a time when billions were stripped of all reason to live.</p>

        <p>The government does realise, they just don't care. For example, people in Victoria have reached their breaking point and hospitals were <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-08/young-people-self-harming-end-up-in-hospital-emergency-rooms/12532040">overwhelmed by self-harm patients</a> </p>
<p>Deaths caused by poor mental health (suicide, alcohol, drugs) are far outnumbering virus deaths. The government absolutely understands this. They just DO NOT CARE.</p>

        <p>Can I just say, I’m so glad I found this sub today. I was quite literally about to add to that suicide statistic til I found reasonable people. For me it’s the fear of others screaming/yelling/videotaping/doxxing me. Makes my PTSD 700,000x worse and makes me hate anyone who so much as looks at me weird. If some lunatic shoved their phone in my face in public I’d probably off myself right in front of their eyes out of spite.</p>

        <p>I'm going to place the blame at the feet of Social Media.  Human beings were never meant to be this connected, all the time.  We also seem to have a problem with proportionality of the problem.  People hear about all these deaths but don't put it into the bigger context of a country or the world.</p>
<p>Back to social media, with us being constantly connected we are constantly exposed to the propaganda of different groups of people.  Propaganda doesn't work without repetition.  It is with that repetition that people are constantly bombarded with that they start to think that this is the way the world really is, even contrary to their actual real life experiences.</p>
<p>That is just my layman guess anyways.</p>

        <p>We all know social media has become a massive propaganda operation, it used to be corporate and sometimes political propaganda but it never was propaganda for tyranny and world destruction, and never 24/7 on this level. If it's free you're the product.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is how does it end, what's the deep state plan if people collectively refuse vaccines ? Are they going to go United Soviet Socialist Republic on us, imprison and beat those who refuse vaccines? Are they going to take away children from parents who refuse covid vaccines and other useless vaccines or they will try to finesse there scheme until mass revolt across many countries and then they quit their effort.</p>
<p>I don't think the global deep state is gonna back down, and it really doesn't seem like most of the global population will go along with this. Societies are breaking down bad man, not just in North America but everywhere you read about or talk to people with, shit is really really bad, from the economy to quality of life.</p>
<p>This mass chaos can't keep jugging along, their comes a breaking point. Is the deep state gonna get governments to use deadly force or fold when push comes to shove ? Will governments go along with the agenda when it becomes painfully sinister a la USSR style ?</p>

<p>This result about social media being the cause of something like this was inevitable.  Individuals do not take personal responsibility for what they post, while governments and proto-militaries pay for intense propaganda.</p>
<p>What we see is growing pains from humanity, and hopefully a deep lesson that we have to be more aware of the impacts of all of our singular actions and thoughts on global humanity as a whole.  We are interconnected more than ever before, and this will only increase.  Privacy will be gone for everyone one day, and we have to be more responsible as both individuals, leaders and governments.</p>

        <p>I hate the people who say, "Yes lockdown is bad for mental health, but it would be even worse for our mental health if our friends and families died!" The way we cope with grief over losing a relative is by living our own lives to the fullest - taking part in other activities to distract ourselves from the loss, participating in social activities (because a relative dying reduces the amount of human connection in our lives, it's important to strengthen old relationships and make new ones) and doing what we enjoy in life or what gives us a sense of purpose and satisfaction, because we realise that life is finite so it's important to make the best of what you've got. If the pandemic did actually kill off loads of family members, sure people would be sad, but for the most part they would get over it. And you have to realise, your family will die eventually. Fucking get over it already. You can't spend your whole life worrying about it and forget to live. </p>
<p>Allowing pandemic deaths would result in largely temporary mental health problems for some portion of the population. Lockdown is causing significant mental health problems for everyone. I'm sick and tired of people using mental health (ie grief over death) as a justification for the new normal.</p>

        <p>I have been around the sick and dying regularly for as long as I can remember. They would ask their visitors news about their lives and activities, I'm assuming because they liked to know that life is still going on. Not one of them would have wanted their families to basically sit Shiva for even a week for them (my grandpa: "have a party and be done with it") let alone for months on end. </p>
<p>I also have lost many family members very young. It is not worse than indefinite isolation emotionally.</p>

        <p>That's a very good perspective. I think that the current panic over death could also have significant consequences for kids today. When I was very young and my relatives died, my mother explained how death was a natural part of life. She explained how people in society are like cells in your body - just like cells die all the time and your body makes new ones, people die too, but society is still there and life moves on. Children today are learning that death is to be feared and dying is unnatural and impossible to deal with. It simply isn't healthy to take that attitude, and the longer this goes on for, the harder it will be to help them adjust.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I really don't get it. Teaching children how to adjust to death is, imo, one of the most important parenting duties. I and a close friend of mine have a lot of problems because we had sadness over death "fixed" with material things instead of having an actual rational conversation. </p>
<p>I had to talk myself to a balanced view. Why on earth would you choose this for your child?</p>

        <p>I am 61 and currently "processing" stacks of family photos from the 1850s-1960s. Clearly back then people were more entranced by material wealth thus the explosion of copying the one percent back then. </p>
<p>The clothes, homes, cars, everybody wanted to at least smell rich. My Seventh Day Adventist relatives starved their own kids to maintain their con games. They wore haute couture silk and ate mystery loaf.</p>
<p>Everybody in the region were climbing over each other's heads before the crash of 29, so the Mr Haneys who made it through the depression raised the Uber Haneys we then elected into office, or became Uber Haneys in old age. </p>
<p>Survival seemed to require it. (Spiritual?) Hunger from previous famines manifests itself as hoarding. </p>
<p>Junk at the lowest kevel. Private islands at the highest. </p>
<p>We ARE going to get a new pecking order. It is up to us not to be pecked to death.</p>
