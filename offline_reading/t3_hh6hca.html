        <p>The end date for you is the day you stop obeying.  The end date for society is when enough people stop obeying that the order is no longer able to be considered legitimate.</p>

        <p>Or find a way to defeat it legally, like what happened in Wisconsin. Or pressure the governorship to the point they have to at least roll back on restrictions, like Michigan.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what needs to happen, but the question is will enough people take a stand?    I live in LA and one of our grocery stores, Vons, had these ridiculous one-way aisles.  Pretty much everyone was ignoring the stupid stickers on the floor.  When I went in the other day, the stickers were gone.  Non-compliance works and I wish more people would start ignoring the rules and going about life normally.  The sooner that happens, the sooner we can get our lives back.</p>

        <p>When Safeway first put the one-way stickers in the aisles, I was about to reluctantly obey when I saw a man ignore it and walk the "wrong" way. Seeing that one guy disobey the stupid rule made me feel safe to do the same. Luckily, it seems like just about everyone has been ignoring the stickers since the beginning. It will be a happy day when Safeway removes them and stops playing the recording every 5 minutes asking everyone to obey the one way stickers.</p>
<p>Every time I go out without a mask, I hope to empower someone who sees me to consider not wearing a mask next time. Sometimes at a new place I'll feel nervous about not wearing a mask, and if I see someone else not wearing one, I'm so thankful. I live in the Bay Area, California, where there is a county and state order to wear masks.</p>

        <p>I, too, had initially thought about following the stickers and then I was like, nope, can't bring myself to do it.  I started walking the "wrong way" and was happy to see others doing the same.</p>
<p>In LA, we are also required to wear masks outside the house, but in stores, I'm half-assing the mask.  I have semi-sheer scarf that I keep fully under my nose.  When I'm walking in a park or at the beach, I have no mask on.  I'm hoping little things like this that we can do will give other people the push they need.</p>

        <p>I was at the gas station yesterday and the clerk was masked up, but no one else in the store was wearing one, not even his coworker.  I said to the masked clerk, "Didn't you hear? The pandemic is over."  He tore his mask off and declared how much he hated wearing it.</p>
<p>All it takes sometimes is a small nudge.</p>

<p>Easy! Nope. It would have already happened. It's over. The fact that masks are even a debate and not cause for uprising is proof.</p>

        <p>Yep, this is why I've been so anxious the past few weeks.  Our fate lies in the hands of others being on board and it doesn't look like that's going to happen.  It's made me feel hopeless and helpless about this entire situation.</p>

        <p>Kind of hard to defy the restrictions and go to gym when the gyms aren't allowed to be open.  Or to go to a festival when they've all been cancelled.  Or book that trip to whichever country when the borders are closed.  I do what I can and do go out every day, but this "just do what you want, restrictions be damned" reply I see all the time just isn't possible in some cases.  I *really* wanted to go the music festival but it doesn't exist.  So how exactly can I do that?</p>

        <p>More states need to do what Wisconsin did and sue the fuck out of their administrations to end the restrictions. The only way you are gonna get rid of these restrictions and the “new normal” is to kill it, hard and fast so it instantly drops and you can be sure it’s dead.</p>
<p>Start writing your district representatives and start gathering support for legal action against the restrictions. Get the ball for a lawsuit going be it acted by state congress or class action. Take it to the Supreme Court if you have to.</p>
