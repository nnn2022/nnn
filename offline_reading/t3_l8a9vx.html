    <p><p>The NHS was given 5 BILLION to fund a covid response</p>
<p>.<a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/-/media/Confederation/Files/Public-Affairs/Budget_2020_21_WEB.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0ews3kOUYTOPzoIHZfAmQQfvUIlkqTWKWH_8WAVykcDbVPhXIEgO_Jbdc">https://www.nhsconfed.org/.../Publ.../Budget_2020_21_WEB.pdf</a></p>
<p>Private sector bussiness was given a budget of 22 BILLION for a test and trace system that literally never worked and was obselete within weeks.</p>

<p>22 Billion to the NHS would have easily ensured that we were able to manage covid aswell as the usual winter pressures.Then theres the billions in contracts awarded to front bench tory friends and family.Don't like covid stop you scrutinising the government.  They are taking advantage of the situation to create an oligarchy and want to see it extended.</p>
<p>Similar things are happening all over the world.  The crisis is being manufactured.</p></p>

        <p>Ditto with old folk's homes.</p>
<p>Governments have known that most of them have been shitholes for years, with the (mostly Chinese) shell companies running them making bank off of Grandma's misery (and her pension checks).</p>
<p>There was a brief period of pearl clutching early on when the Scam-Demic revealed how bad things were. But the Canadian media decided "Orange Man Bad" and fellating Justin Trudeau was more important.</p>
<p>So Grandma sits locked down in her room, with no family visits. It's OK to die of neglect, bedsores, and loneliness, but not from WuFlu...</p>

        <p>You’re right on the money! If the funds that went to pay people to say home were diverted to long term care homes and hospitals, wouldn’t they have been able to put COVID-19 measures in place that are actually effective? They could have paid for rapid testing or isolation wings or whatever would have helped. Instead, in Canada, we just tossed money around to the general population who could easily be contributing to the economy as usual if it wasn’t shut down.</p>
