    <strong>I Still Don't Know A Single Person That's Died From Covid</strong>
    <p><p>That's a pretty wide net, too. Family, friends, aquaintances, colleagues... no one has died from this shit and some of them you'd honestly expect to due to their age or health condition. Going further, no one THEY know has died from this shit, unless they're keeping very quiet about it. But you know how people are these days: everything has to be put on social media, so it seems unlikely they wouldn't milk the death of a loved one, specifically a Covid death, for attention and sympathy. In fact, only just over 5,000 people have died altogether WITH this fucking shite where I live in over a year. Yet we still have to wear masks inside, socially distance and treat each other like we're fucking plague-carriers.</p>
<p>HOW FUCKING PATHETIC.</p>
<p>Oh, and guess fucking what? Since the vaccine roll-out, more and more people around me are starting to lose loved ones all of a sudden to mysterious circumstances. Now, a lot of this could be coincidence, but I fucking doubt it. My best friend, who's worked throughout this entire "pandemic" yet has managed to come out the other side unscathed, keeps telling me about how everyone that's had the vaccine calls in sick to work the next day, and I'm sure many of you have similar stories.</p>
<p>The fallout of this shit is going to be massive.</p></p>

        <p>I don't, either... same goes for all my friends and family... they don't know anyone who has died from "the virus".</p>
<p>I do have an Aunt who was forced to get tested, though... one test was negative, one was positive.  And guess what?  She was told she was sick...  LMAO.  This was on a visit to a specialist about her knee.  </p>
<p>She's old...  she was like, "Never before have I been told I was sick even though I wasn't...  what the hell is happening in this world?".</p>

        <p>I don't know anyone that died from C19 either.  Pretty much everyone I know had it.  I do know a 100% healthy marathon runner who died from a heart attack in his 40s not long after the jab.  Coincidence is what they say.</p>

        <p>Can't generalize off your scope. World is much bigger than either of us. If you do the math, there would be 7 million hospitalizations and over 1 million vaccination deaths in America if the covid vaccine MATCHED the danger of the covid virus. (And that's measured with PROJECTED infections, not known infections which would be a higher mortality rate)</p>

        <p>Honestly, they were my first big red pill moment on the whole scam. Both my parents are doctors, so I grew up knowing a fair bit more than the layman about a lot of medical stuff. Including the fact that, overall, if you put someone on a ventilator, there is an 80% chance they die on it. By and large, they're used to buy enough time for the family to say goodbye.</p>

        <p>Ventilators are a last resort tool for someone getting so low oxygen their brain is being starved.</p>
<p>The issue is the lungs are full of mucous and fluid, so all the ventilator does is expand the lungs too much as the liquid can't be displaced and just ruptures the cells etc. The idea is to get more oxygen into alveoli but the reality is the lungs are fucked at that point. </p>
<p>It's just extension of life as a "better than death" option. Most people never come off a ventilator. Those who do have permanent lung damage.</p>

        <p>Eh - not really a source for just "best practice" in medicine.</p>
<p>When O2 stats reach critially low - ventilators are used to force oxygen into the lungs.</p>
<p>Water doesn't compress, so when the tidal volume on the machine is set to their usual lung capacity but half is uncompressable liquid, you get burst lungs.</p>
<p>Take a water balloon, it can take X amount of air before popping.</p>
<p>Now take another, fill it to 0.5X, then add X amount of air - will it rupture?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumothorax/symptoms-causes/syc-20350367</p>
<p>"Mechanical ventilation. A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely."</p>
<p>This was why govts were not keen on just mass purchasing ventilarors in March 2020. They are end of life systems and if you add wrong volumes - bang bang go the lungs.</p>
<p>The issue is these ventilators are used for many reasons, sometimes the lung is empty and can take X air, sometimes it is filled with fluid.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked in or near the medical field knows trained people still fuck up all the time.</p>
<p>I bet a lot of vent deaths are shitty numbers plugged in.</p>

        <p>He was just a statistical outlier. High risk, but it was definitely the coof that put him down for a few days. He'd have been fine if they gave him some HCQ or anything else that was already known to have worked, but they decided to intubate him instead.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying already. But I don't believe that the virus doesn't exist. It definitely does, and I caught it myself back last January. It's just even more manageable than the flu. The pandemic is what is manufactured.</p>

        <p>My roommate is a trucker and he had to get tested early on to continue working. He got tested for the virus and for past infection. He was told he tested negative for the virus and positive for past infection. This was in like april of last year. So some time prior to that my roommate, and obviously me as well due to the fact that we share a one bathroom home and thus use the same toilet, shower, sinks, doors, laundry, etc. both had covid and recovered without knowing it.</p>

        <p>Flip side of this is that they may not have had it at all and tested positive due to how sensitive the tests were. The actual virus is very contagious but I think a lot of these "asymptomatic" cases were false positives.</p>

        <p>OP, same thing, I still do not know any one who has had it BUT I do hear a lot of people telling me this, "yeah, my friend's friend whose cousin's friend was perfectly healthy got CV-19, and was hospitalized and nearly died." And I ask, "what was their name?" Mysteriously, they can't tell me or don't know.</p>
<p>The best one is, some one will tell me, "oh yeah, my friend's cousin, their friend, whose been smoking for the last 10 years, a pack a day, never exercises and is morbidly fat, got CV-19 'mysteriously' and is in the hospital fighting for their life." And I would wonder, could it be because the fat slob never exercised, ate healthy and bothered to lay off them cigarettes?! But. . . .I digress. . .</p>

        <p>This was my best friend. She was all “we know YOUNG PEOPLE who have DIED.” Like multiple? Really?</p>
<p>Never was able to elaborate. I guarantee it was grapevine stories. Nobody she knew personally. </p>
<p>Having said that, I do know of people who died. Not anybody close to me, but an aunt/sister of two people I work with, and two people in my industry where you’d see each other and chat and then suddenly they were not there.</p>

        <p>My grandfather died <em>with</em> covid. Both he and my grandmother, that lived in assisted living, developed pneumonia, tested positive, we’re hospitalized, <em>in separate rooms</em>. Both had the exact same thing, were in the exact same state. Married over 70 years. Ten children. They couldn’t be together as he lay dying, and only 1/10 children were with him when he passed. </p>
<p>This is one of many reasons I’m ready to go scorched. motherfucking. earth.</p>

        <p>I know two people that died from "covid".  First was 96 years old and supposedly got it.   There was never a positive test but she was coughing and had fluid in her lungs.   Second had COPD and had been on oxygen for years.   No positive test here either but ruled as covid death.   My kids and I all had it according to the tests.  We had a slight fever for a few days and congestion.   It was over in less than a week.</p>

        <p>My entire family only knows one person who was an friend’s brother. While he was under 40, he was obese and diabetic. </p>
<p>I believe there may have been some colleagues that were retired and over 80. The only person under 40 was the person I mentioned. </p>
<p>Also telling is that while I am remote most days, no one from my firm has mentioned needing time off for a funeral. When that happens, there is always a collection for flowers going around, even from other departments. Haven’t had a single flower request all year. Weird since everyone should know someone who died from covid based on what Reddit seems to be saying.</p>

<p>On a related topic, It's said that some people are just naturally resistant to hypnosis, and some people are very susceptible to it.  Apparently intelligence doesn't correlate with either of those these tendencies.  I suspect that's what's going on in the larger populace.</p>

        <p>What do you mean by biometric implant? Biometrics establish identity by measuring features of your body. There's no need to implant anything. It'd be like having a fingerprint implant. Biometric OR implanted ID I can see, but why both? What's the implant even measuring? Why not just use RFID?</p>

        <p>DARPA researched implants that measure the body's physiological changes and even moods, thoughts, dreams. Very specific things. And they are compatible with the hydrogel used in these shots. Microscopic in size.</p>

        <p>My co-worker said his 95 year old grandmother died of covid and that's the only 2nd hand account I know of. Many of my co-workers have received the injection and some said they noticed nothing, a few were tired with a sore arm, and one woman said she has been having terrible headaches for two weeks. This whole thing makes no sense to me and I'm tired of it.</p>

        <p>Everyone seems terrified of 'cases' and whatnot, guess they can't take a step back look at the numbers and realize there's very little danger. Think fear shuts down peoples ability to think critically plus the endless propaganda. I admit I was kinda freaked out too for the first few months then started questioning it around this time last year.</p>

        <p>You're correct about fear shutting down people's minds. As a former flight attendant we had emergency procedures drilled into our brains for training so that in the case of an actual emergency, our bodies would act out of muscle memory rather than fear or adrenalin.</p>

        <p>That's the problem, people see the "500,000" figure and absolutely shit themselves. They have zero perspective. That's actually a very low number, especially when you take into account the size of the USA, the fact that it took an entire year just to reach that figure, and that most of those deaths had four comorbidities or were just flat-out fake.</p>

        <p>I know quite a few people who’ve had it. There was an entire branch of my extended family that came down with it. Total of 18 people. All experienced mild symptoms and recovered without incident. I think my mom had it, but can’t be sure. She was in the ICU in late November/early December of 2019, and all they could tell us was that it was a ‘respiratory virus’. They couldn’t identify what respiratory virus she had. </p>
<p>Of my family members that have gotten the vaccine, my grandma had a heart attack, three cousins had blood clots, and my one of my aunts had AION shortly after receiving their second dose.</p>

Most definitely a “died with covid” not “died of covid” case.</p>

        <p>When you see the government talk about the number of tests, I think it's safe to assume it's the same people getting tested again and again. Most people don't get tested. The people who do get tested are in an environment that requires constant testing, such as health care. So when you see a number like 35,017,704 tests performed, it's the same people getting tested over and over.</p>

        <p>Doctors have far more training on how to deny that a malady is related to vaccines than they do in recognizing maladies that are caused by vaccines.  Their job is as much to protect vaccines as it is to protect their patients.  But patients don't buy them lunch, and don't give kickbacks for high levels of vaccination among their patient-base.  Your daughter's reaction is not from the antibiotics, it's from the vaccine.  I hope it all works out, and you can find a doctor who will respect what you tell them after seeing things with your own eyes.</p>

        <p>Yes, I think certain kinds of people just lied about things like this to others.</p>
<p>I noticed that lying as well. I saw a video where a guy went into a store maskless, and this one masked guy started freaking out and calling him a "Trump supporter blah blah" and then he started yelling that his "mother had died of covid".</p>
<p>But you could look at his eyes and his tone, and you could tell that he was just lying, probably in an attempt to shame the maskless person.</p>
<p>These kinds of people tend to lie about a lot. "Social appearance" is more important to them, then just telling the truth.</p>
<p>I think it's what makes them easier to control (sheep analogy, lemming analogy, etc). If the government/corporations tell them that "this is the "socially acceptable" thing to do", then they will rush out to do it at light speed.</p>
<p>It's why you see those kinds of people tend to rush out at light speed to get blood clot injected as well. Everything is "social" for them, "truth and reality be damned."</p>

        <p>My uncle died from “covid”. They used experimental drugs on him, never let anyone visit and then threw him on a ventilator til he died. Pretty sure he didn’t die because of covid.</p>

        <p>I don't know a single person who died from it or got sick. That is a huuuuge net of people alongside my partners family and employees. Not one single person.</p>
<p>I have a friend who will lie when someone brings up something that goes against the narrative and she will pull this "my cousin died of Covid" and she doesn't have a cousin that died of covid as I know her very well. </p>
<p>The same girl who lies about the cousin dying got the vaccine and has had terrible side effects including a period that's lasted for over a month and a lump in her breast that she refuses to get checked because she was told it would be negative for cancer by someone giving out the shots or on the TV I can't remember. She has also had a headache for 2 weeks straight and won't see a doctor. </p>
<p>So. Fucking. Stupid.</p>

<p>I just told my story like everyone else is. Yes, my friend lies a lot when it comes to covid because she's brainwashed. She neglects her health because she's brainwashed. I'm guessing you think that's funny or something because it's not, it's a really sad and serious situation. Don't gaslight me and your intolerance is showing.</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a friend who lies a lot</li>
<li>You can confirm her lying behavior based on a lie she told about her cousin dying </li>
<li>Yet you believe the covid vaccine gave her a two week long headache, a month long period and a lump in her breast...because your liar of a friend told you this</li>

        <p>That's not what I said and you're still gaslighting me. I never said she was a pathological liar, I never said she lies all of the time. I said she lies about things that go against her narrative and unfortunately she is so deep into this that she has severely neglected her health. Stop derailing people, stop making fallacious arguments, stop pulling stuff out of your ass. If you don't have anything of value to contribute to this community then you're just a shill or someone who is  clinging on to the exact same narrative that could possibly kill my friend. </p>

        <p>I know many people that tested positive and only one was seriously ill. Others had no or minor symptoms or were a bit poorly for a couple of days. The NHS helpline admits that most people with covid will have no or mild symptoms.</p>
<p>With the vaccine, almost everyone I know has felt awful because of it, with symptoms ranging from non-stop headaches, dizzyness, vomitting, flu symptoms (and nasty too), and one person that woke up having lost sensation in their legs (which were covered in bruises). This resulted in a hospital trip. The kicker is that many of these people had already tested positive for covid.</p>
<p>This lie will now be part of our lives forever. Expensive testing at airports will be here to stay.</p>
<p>I've lost the little faith and trust I had left in humanity. Government, media, scientists, doctors, business leaders, anyone in a position of authority. Liars and cowards them all.</p>

        <p>I don’t either. I supposedly got COVID around Christmas time. I was around my entire family, including grandparents and pregnant wife, without any precautionary measures and didn’t pass it to a single person.</p>
<p>Either the test was a false positive and I had the flu — possible as wife was flu vaccinated and I wasn’t — or it’s not as contagious or deadly as the purported data say it is. It made me highly skeptical of this whole thing.</p>

        <p>Me too. I have seen 2 bad ridden person (I want to say "vegetable" but it might be inappropriate) got corona from their care givers and recovered without hospitalization, they were both 65+ by the way. My aunt who is also 65+, recovered in a week without hospitalization. My close friends father who is over weight and has diabetes recovered in 4 days no hospital. His wife who has chronic asthma also same. My friends who are under 30 didn't even have fever. These are what I personally whitnessed. Of course we know they got corona from pcr test which means almost nothing but anyways. Do you know what I also witnessed, my friends dad had a stroke from blood cloth after 2nd shot of pfizer. My another friends grandma who has some kind of a blood disease but nothing that serious. She was on medication and fine and it was a chronic thing not recent, after a week from 2nd pfizer shot she got some kind of leukemia and on chemo and can't live without blood transfusion every 2 weeks right now.</p>

<p>Just cause fruadci and gates are out doesn't mean the war is over.  It has only just begun.</p>
<p>The people you see that get the vax and still wear masks are your enemy.  they will be the ones to turn you in when the death wave hits in the fall.</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves...you think food, gas, and energy shortages were bad since this all started.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Death wave his they shut it all down even tighter this time with contact tracers coming to inspect you and your homes. Digital vax ID's its all coming.</p>

        <p>I know 1 person who died from “covid”. 35 year old female in great health. She was having some trouble breathing and for some reason they immediately rushed to put her on the ventilator even though she was only having mild-moderate breathing troubles. She was on it for a few days and they took her off and she died a day later. I fully believe she would be here today if they didn’t immediately resort to the vent.</p>

<p>We are supposedly in a global pandemic, but I do not know a single person who has died from it. I know roughly 3 or 4 people who have tested positive, but were never hospitalized. So where the fuck is the pandemic?</p>

        <p>I live in a densely populated city (London) and know quite a few elderly people and I still don't know anyone who died of covid lol. </p>
<p>All I know are elderly who died of other causes (hip infection being one), did not have covid, but were still put down as covid deaths. </p>
<p>Also, everyone I know doesn't know anyone who died of covid. One friend claims he and his family had it and recovered after 2 weeks, but people also get the flu for 2 weeks, so that means nothing to me. </p>
<p>I had the worst case of flu 2 years ago and I had a persistent cough for months after even though I am young and healthy. Had it been this covid shit then, I'm sure they would've claimed I had covid but it was just a bad flu that popped up after people around me were getting the flu mist which sheds heavily. </p>
<p>I have also been in Africa in densely populated and very poor areas for over 6 months during this plandemic, and everyone was as healthy as can be!</p>

        <p>I know one person who I'm told died of covid. A friend of mine from the local VFW that I would still go bowling with from time to time. She was in her mid-70s.</p>
<p>Of course thanks to the lockdowns that protected her, I didn't see her at all before she died, or even know she had died until I heard it through the grapevine. So that was awesome.</p>

        <p>I have 2 friends whose grandparents (in their 90s) died "from" Covid. 1 was in a nursing home with dementia, not sure about the other. Lost my father-in-law in May 2020 from a stroke, he was quite outgoing and he was quarantining and miserable from doing it. My dad passed away from a stroke also 7 days after his 2nd injection. Also know of a friends uncle who died 1 day after the injection. Other than that I know 1 guy who was the same age as my father-in-law and dad (early 70s) who was hospitalized for 1 day from Covid but was just fine. Know many people who had it with mild symptoms. Deaths of people who are in their 90s are sad, but not a tragedy!</p>

<p>Your theory doesn't deserve the power of influence it is trying to acquire since its negative impacts (if any) cannot be proven. That which can be asserted without evidence can also be dismisswd without evidence.</p>

        <p>Consider yourself lucky. It’s easy to hold this opinion if you didn’t lose anybody to covid. I myself didn’t get it but I have friends and family who passed. Part of me wished I did get it so I could understand it better, I’m young so I’m confident my immune system would have fought it.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure I had something in around January of last year.. I went out for a couple drinks one night and the next couple days it just felt like my hangover wasn't going away and I started developing a cough so I went to the hospital. "There's definitely something there" the doctor said but he couldn't tell me what it was exactly. All he said afterwards was to go home and get rest and take advil and Tylenol.</p>

        <p>Almost everyone I know who has gotten the vaccine has reported experiencing some degree of reaction or illness bad enough for them to call in sick or disrupt their day.</p>
<p>Every single person I know who has experienced a death in their family over the past year, it has ultimately died from something else. Only a couple of them managed to get covid slapped on as a factor in their death. Cancer, heart disease, alzheimers, parkinson's, and old age all remain the biggest killers for those hospitalized.</p>
<p>It should be clear as day to those who experience it what is going on here, but I'm the crazy one for questioning anything in relation to it!</p>

<p>Some of my co-workers (I don't remember who) lost a parent or two. They all had poor health or the co-workers are old so their parents were likely on death's door already. </p>
<p>My Dad has 2-3 co-morbidities, got it and sailed right through. Then for some as(s)inine reason he got the vccne and got even sicker than when he got the actual illnes. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty disappointed that he went full sheep and got the shots. </p>

        <p>We're sure my husband had Covid (never went to the doctor though) but he has had long lasting taste and smell loss. He says everything tastes like bleach and sometimes he can faintly remember what something used to taste like, but he can't enjoy it because he can't "taste" it. It's just his brain telling him "you're eating pizza. You kind of remember what pizza tastes like". We don't know anyone who's died, but we do have friends and family who haven't gotten their taste and smell completely back.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's crazy, I don't know anyone who has died from covid, and neither Cancer, none of my family or friends has had cancer, therefore it's not real or maybe a big conspiracy to inject people with poison (chemo they call it). Now that I think of it, I also have never seen a person die of HIV either.</p>

        <p>I know one (1) person.  Lovely man, always a kind word. But he was 94 years old (!), ambulatory, but several comorbidities.  I'm pretty sure he got sick from covid, and while the comorbidities weren't helping, the disease was the banana peel which slipped him into the grave.</p>
<p>Fair enough. But it gets better: his 93-year-old wife was with him the whole time, at home and in the hospital. She got sick. AND SHE SURVIVED.  She's still alive today, 10 months later.  Yeah also their 64-year-old daughter, she got sick too.</p>
<p>A neighbor's 27 yo daughter got it, it laid her flat on her back for 4 days, weak for another 5 days.  She recovered.  She got easily winded for another two months, but she's back to running her usual 4 mile loop in the park every morning.</p>
<p>My son got it as the disease was getting less virulent.  A miserable weekend, took off work for a few days after that because he was still contagious. Fine since then.</p>
<p>All of the above happened before the "vaccine" was released.</p>
<p>So, one 94 yo... that's it.</p>

<p>My mother got it pretty bad, didn't need a respirator, but still was ill for several weeks.</p>
<p>I got infected in February 2020 (WashingtonState), got an antibody test to prove it. Mild symptoms for about a week. Had to switch from vape to chew.</p>

        <p>I was in florida when the whole pandemic craze started to go down. Went to Disneyland. I have a habit of biting my nails so my hands were constantly in mouth. Gross I know. I also never washed my hands unless I went to the bathroom which was maybe twice. My parents both got it when we were there. There were 7 of us all staying in a house together. I always drank out of my parents water bottles by accident when they were sick thinking it was mine. Never had any symptoms. Never tested positive. Let me recap. Disneyland. Hands in mouth all the time. Never washed hands. Parents had COVID. Drank their water multiple times. At this point I couldn't catch COVID if I licked a hospital railing. So either I have the immune system of a friggin god or maybe it's not as contagious as we have been programmed to believe.</p>

        <p>The number of people dying from heart attacks is not high enough to lock down the world though.</p>
<p>But the number of people dying from Covid is so high that it is.  Apparently.</p>
<p>As for me, I also dont know any covid deaths.  Nor do any of my friends.</p>
<p>I do know a bunch of people who tested positive.  </p>
<p>They were all fine. A few got really sick. Most didnt.</p>
<p>I know one suicide of despair, though.</p>

        <p>I still don’t know a single person who’s died from 9/11,</p>
<p>That’s a pretty wide net too. Family, friends, acquaintances, colleagues no one has died from this shit, and some of them you’d honestly expect due to them going into buildings. Going further, no one aThey Know has died from this shit, unless they’re keeping real quiet about it, but you know how people are these days, everything has to be put on social media, so it seems unlikely they wouldn’t milk the death of a loved one, specifically a plane death, for attention and sympathy. In fact, 0 people have died from 9/11 in my area in over a year! Yet we still have to be checked at airports, taking off our shoes, and not being water bottles and treat each other like we are about to blow up the airport, like a terrorist</p>
