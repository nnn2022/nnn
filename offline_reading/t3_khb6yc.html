    <strong>Usage of the term "Doomer" in relation to corruption and freedom revocation</strong>
    <p><p>Good evening fellow fresh-air-breathers,</p>
<p>I'd like to start a conversation about the usage of the adjective "Doomer" in relation to Covid1984 and the resulting destructive consequences imparted on us which we collectively refer to as "New Normal".</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago have I noticed the term doomer being used rather frequently to describe the psychopathic and brainwashed NPC's helping these infringements and abuses continue and even worsen. </p>
<p>From what I've gathered, and the little bit of online browsing I've done about doomers even before ConVid (as well as boomers, bloomers, coomers, etc. lol).</p>
<p>I do consider myself as having most personality traits of a doomer in the traditional ways:</p>
<p>- I'm pretty damn pessimistic about life in general, and the world at large in particular, with sprinkled bouts of hope and optimism every now and then. I do feel as though this world, with all of its injustices and untold suffering, is corrupt and not really worth the ride. I yearn for death while I'm simultaneously petrified of it.</p>
<p>- I do not want children (although once upon a time I did) and this is for a variety of reasons. I also do not want a significant other in any way shape or form, again for a variety of personal reasons, most of which revolve around me being a dysfunctional mess and not wanting to answer to anyone about anything, ever. <strong>SIDENOTE:</strong> Despite my disposition, I believe <strong>everyone</strong> has a fundamental right to do as they please or see fit, short of infringing upon the rights of another; I am utterly <strong><em>against</em></strong> anyone pushing their views onto another, or worse yet, trying to control or impede the will of any other human (again, short of stopping or preventing an infringement on the rights of another). While I don't want to bring children into this world, I wholeheartedly defend, and deep-down even encourage the rights of other human beings to procreate, even amidst an utterly corrupt shithole world (imho).</p>
<p>- I tend to wallow in a lot of self-pity and I also am self-loathing in general. I'm lazy, mostly unmotivated, and have some form of mood disorder so I can be a dick and an asshole sometimes, usually when I'm suffering from the swings. I'm also terribly apathetic most of the time, about nearly everything. However, I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> project my issues and insecurities on others with healthy self-esteem and optimism, in fact I admire and am lovingly jealous of their dispositions, and I tend to feel better when around these types rather than a big group of other "doomers".</p>
<p>- I do believe in a higher power, and even though I sometimes question the intentions of said higher power, as well as question and doubt its existence often, I do believe that no amount of humanism and science/technology/pharmacology can fix this world on its own. Things can get better, of course, and have over the centuries, but root problems and core issues will not, imho, be remedied through these means; I also admit I don't know how they would if not by said means.</p>
<p>I say all of that (sorry it was long, there's more to it but you get the picture) to say this: While I am pretty much the quintessential doomer, I do still have compassion and passion within me; </p>
<p><strong>Compassion</strong>: towards all individual living creatures, and their well-being and suffering. A weird paradox considering my view of myself as an individual, along with my complete lack of faith both in the world at large and humanity as a whole. But the individual, whether it be a person, a dog, a cat, a rat, a pine tree, or a tomato, I have compassion for to the point that I would probably be labelled a little extreme (a compliment imo). I fucking hate zoos, animals should be free, and enslaving them for human entertainment is grotesque. I don't eat meat, simply because I love animals - but I fully support the rights of others to consume meat (and as much as they want, unlike the "rare occasinal delicacies" that monster Schwab wants it to be). I hate bullies, and when the strong pick on and exploit the weak, or when the many gather against the single or few over beliefs or practices that they don't approve of (unless, of course, those practices infringe on another's freedoms). I firmly believe in doing charitable works, of many varieties, from donating money to the needy and good causes, volunteering to feed and help the homeless, all the way to consciously trying to park in a way that leaves room for the next man to fit, putting the shopping cart in its proper place after use to make that employee's life a little easier, and even just a smile or encouraging word, an ear to listen and absorb someone else's pain. This is innate in me, regardless of the fact that I feel humanity as a whole is rather cancerous on the world (and fyi, that in no way justifies trying to control someone else's reproductive rights or playing god and deciding who should live or how many there should be on earth - that is psychopathy and downright evil, not to mention a violation of innate right to exist and thrive).</p>
<p><strong>Passion</strong>: Related to the individual life form compassion, one of the few raging-fire passions within me are motivated by and directed toward the well-being, safety, and happiness of said individual, and an equal, if not more powerful fire <strong><em>against</em></strong> the mistreatment, abuse, sadness, injustice, sadness, pain, and - possibly most poignant - any external force seeking to exercise control over, or restrict <strong><em>any</em></strong> natural-born, inalienable freedom of any individual (again, of course, except when that violation is being perpetrated onto another and are thus infringing on another's freedom...Have I said that often enough yet? Honestly I think maybe the only illegal and prosecutable law should be, and only be, the infringement of someone else's natural-born right to pursue happiness, including personal ownership). So, even though I've kind of been a shut-in for many years now, and segregate myself to a degree, willingly, from society - When I hear the word "lockdown", or I see a billboard sign or advertisement saying "stay home", or look at the notice on a business's front door reminding me yet again that I need to wear a shame muzzle in order to buy cat food so my baby doesn't have to die or purchase groceries so myself and family can quench hunger pangs and continue to be alive...every sticker on the floor reminding me to stay apart from others or "walk this way", every plexiglass enclosure in classrooms and restaurants - These things ignite a flame within the very core of my essence, a seething flare of indignation so palpable that I dread going outside to a degree I didn't think was imaginable before March of 2020.</p>
<p>Whew, that was a lot - way more than I planned or anticipated writing. Thank you if you've read up to this point, and thank you if I haven't annoyed the shit out of you, and I'm sorry if I have. </p>
<p>So, I do want to get a conversation started, and any and all points of view and perspectives on the correlation between "Doomerism" and buying into/actively supporting the draconian and torturous crimes taking place as we speak. How was the connection initially made? How do they synthesize? Lemme know what you think! Even if you hold separate ideas - especially then :)</p></p>
