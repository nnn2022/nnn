    <strong>I went on a weekend get away with my family and it was glorious!</strong>
    <p><p>I took my family on a weekend getaway to a huge resort. My state is open besides a mask mandate and I think gyms might still be closed. Well I think more people are waking up because I would say mybe10% of people were masking and 0% distancing.  This place has 4 indoor Waterparks so you don't have to wear a mask while in the water, so this just trickled on through the whole resort. It was the first time doing something in a year that felt normal. The bad thing, we will all be dead in two weeks.</p></p>
