    <strong>Introducing: Mandatory lie detector tests for billionaires and politicians</strong>
    <p><p>After the horrifying Epstein episode, it became abundantly clear that we're facing an epidemic of child abuse in the Western world, committed by powerful wealthy individuals.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that billionaires and politicians, who happen to be high risk demographics when it comes to the risk of committing child abuse, should be forced to attend weekly lie detector tests administered by conspiracy theorists, who happen to be uniquely qualified when it comes to recognizing when a politician or a billionaire can not be trusted. When they are in possession of a valid lie detector certificate, they will be allowed within a two mile radius of elementary schools.</p>
<p>Because the billionaires and politicians form a danger to us all that we never asked for, it's not fair if tax paying citizens have to pay for these weekly lie detector tests. Rather, the politicians and billionaires will have to pay out of pocket and will have to pay whatever the conspiracy theorists decide to charge them for this public service they provide. </p>
<p>The burgeoning pedo-test industry has apparently hired lobbyists, who have advised us that weekly tests are unreliable and politicians and billionaires should from now on be administered daily lie detection tests. We will be taking this proposal into consideration. The pedo-test industry has succeeded in creating massive new employment opportunities. To deliver further safety to the public and generate new employment opportunities, we will consider implementing the same measures for Hollywood celebrities. </p>
<p>There are of course alternative options. Politicians and billionaires could just decide to practice social distancing, by staying alone at home and ordering food to their homes. Alternatively, they could sign up for chemical castration. Finally, we have developed a new technology known as the guillotine, that has so far proved 100% effective at solving this new epidemic that began on Epstein's island and rapidly spread around the world. This remains our official recommendation, but sadly guillotine-hesitance among the high risk demographics remains high.</p>
<p>A handful of pedo-test skeptics insist that forcing politicians and billionaires through constant tests and other invasive procedures is dehumanizing. That's all very unfortunate, but you know what's worse than having to do a lie detector test? Being raped by some creepy old ghoul. Your right to privacy does not override other people's right to a safe childhood.</p>
<p>As the Epstein debacle revealed, it has proven particularly dangerous to allow politicians and billionaires to be together in the absence of members of the general public. Lie detector tests are less effective than we thought two months ago, but they're still an essential part of solving this epidemic. That's why even after implementing these new measures and expanding them to Hollywood celebrities, some degree of social distancing will remain necessary for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>From now on, it won't be allowed anymore for groups of three or more politicians and billionaires to meet together in the absence of cameras and members of the general public. For this reason Davos, the Bilderberg conference, the Trilateral commission, private birthday parties and other gatherings will have to be put on hold until this epidemic is under control. These measures will remain in place until we have reached the point of #zerochildabuse. Remember: We're all in this together!</p></p>

        <p>Nothing is more than 2 miles away from elementary schools. When they even try setting the distance at 2500 feet, it means that the convicted pedos have to live under bridges, their "punishment" for reoffending is getting a roof over their head, and some politicians inexplicably insist this makes people safer.</p>
