    <strong>You’re all cancer to society</strong>
    <p><p>If you’re going to reject science, go all the way. Live in the woods, throw out your phone, stop seeing a doctor, stop everything that has involved centuries of research and funding to get us where we are today. None of you deserve anything that modern medicine has to offer.</p></p>

        <p>The media does not determine what is "science". There are many scientific papers now which find that none of the measures instituted by governments in Europe and North America correlate positivley with mortality outcomes. </p>

        <p>Do you realize how stupid you sound? I’m a scientist, engineer to be exact. Science gives us facts, it doesn’t give us public policy. The fact is if we all stopped driving cars or dropped speed limits nationally to 10mph we’d stop almost all traffic deaths. That doesn’t mean we blindly say “the science says so! So let’s ban driving” because there are more factors at play than just “if it saves even one life”.</p>
<p>Very few people here don’t think covid is real, most even acknowledge it’s deadlier than the flu -including myself. It still has a 99.7% survival rate and the odds are even better than that for most on here as Reddit skews younger. We simply don’t believe a virus like that is worth destroying mental health, individual liberties, businesses, livelihoods, going into more national debt, etc. </p>
<p>For the most part it’s taking out people already on their last legs, which while sad if they’re your grandparent, isn’t worth shutting down society over. And yes, a handful of healthy 30-50 year olds have died, but it’s an extremely small number and that’s at some point just part of life. Before, during, and after the pandemic there is some risk of death for everyone every time they walk out the door. For some reason we’re acting like any risk of death no matter how small is too much, which is maddening to many of us here.</p>

<p>I had to tell multiple people that we couldn’t save their loved one. They died due to complications from Covid. This is my new normal. Dealing with death every day. It’s the new normal for all of us in the medical field. And you fuckers think this is all a game, that we like killing out patients.

        <p>TIL this sub is toxic because we question the media and government's overblown response to a virus that has an extremely low mortality rate for most people (check with the CDC) and are more concerned with the unintended consequences of said overblown response such as mental health, suicide rates, a destroyed economy, the rise of a fascist police state, the loss of humanity and the division created by having to wear a mask that doesn't do anything, and the further erosion of civil liberties.  Yeah that's pretty toxic.</p>

        <p>Finally an argument, ok let’s debunk this one at a time.</p>
<p>Low mortality rate is arbitrary, people are dying, and we can prevent people dying. So why not try to prevent people dying? Sounds like a good cause, right?</p>
<p>Mental health is always a concern, for everyone. And the longer we are in this mess, the longer we are all going to suffer. I think the people dealing with death the most are suffering the most, such as nurses, doctors, EMS personnel. </p>
<p>The economy is not my department,  it we have seen crashes like this before and it’s nothing we can’t recover from. It’s already on it’s way back up reaching ATHs.</p>
<p>There’s nothing caviar about our police, no one has declared martial law, no one has confiscated your weapons. BUT if you break the rules, you deal with consequences, if you don’t like it, try a new country where there are no laws and criminals run the place, I’d be curious to see how long you last. </p>
<p>The division comes from the uneducated people and their lack of understanding on how a mask works. It’s prevents your saliva and droplets from spreading. Your mask is not to protect you, YOUR mask protects ME, and MY mask protects YOU. That’s how it works. Not the other way around, the mask is a simple courtesy of “I see we are in close proximity, just in case I’m contagious with a possible life threatening virus, I would not like to pass it on to you by accident, because that would be irresponsible.” The mask is a courtesy, and if you fail to see it that way, you clearly cannot work together for the greater good.</p>

        <p>You just made a post to call us all a cancer on society and one of your grievances was that we complain about wearing a "simple mask". So flu is down because we are wearing masks and social distancing but covid is up because aren't wearing masks or social distancing? Which is it doctor? You can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>

        <p>Ok so a shot which doesn't prevent you from getting it or spreading it and may or may not even be effective for the strain you get infected with is the reason why cases are so far down from last year? The flu shot has been around for 70 years and a lot of people choose not to get it. Are you suggesting more people got flu shots this year? Oh no what you said is it's because we're wearing masks and social distancing. You admit we are in fact doing that. Remove my question about the flu and you still admit we are taking those measures so you really can't use that can you. So why exactly do you find the need to come here and spew your verbal diarrhea that we have heard a million times before? You think going on an unhinged rant is going to sway people to your side? Nobody takes people like you seriously. It's quite concerning if you are actually in the medical field. You seem to be a loose cannon. You use covid as an excuse but you should really be able to control yourself.</p>

        <p>you better be wearing a mask for the rest of your life or you'll be murdering people with the flu, it's a small inconvenience for you and it can save lives. Actually you're already a murderer for not using masks before 2020. How can you live with yourself??</p>

        <p>Remember we only started caring about people dying from a virus this year. They keep saying its worth it to <em>wear the damn mask</em> even if it saves one life yet they were out spreading who knows what to who knows who's grandma for years without care. The mental gymnastics these people do to justify their draconian beliefs <em>now</em> is astounding.</p>

        <p>The science is always changing. Fauci and the WHO have just changed their definition of herd immunity. In the beginning they told us masks were not effective and now they are encouraging them. Science is always changing especially with a virus that was discovered one year ago, so I take everything scientists and the MSM are saying with a grain of salt. Most of it is honestly just used to fearmonger and control society with an iron fist.</p>
