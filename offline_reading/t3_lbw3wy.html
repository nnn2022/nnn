    <strong>UK lockdown and politics - quick question?</strong>
    <p><p>Apologies about bringing up politics here, but AskUK does not welcome any political discussion, and U.K. politics sub is just... what it is. So, are there any politicians from major parties that oppose the continuous lockdown and current measures? Anyone worth observing or supporting? I have read about Libertarian party but they don't seem to have much support - would there be any chance of them gaining the traction, or is it always gonna be just a choice between the "we will take away your money and your rights - in blue" and "we will take away your money and your rights - but in red", and of course not to forget about parties from Scotland, NI and Wales who have their very unique colours. To summarise - is there any political movement that is focused on our liberty and basic human rights (I'm talking freedom of speech etc, not "Im entitled to free housing" basic rights) in the U.K. to watch or support?</p></p>

        <p>British libertarian here: The Conservative party has been infiltrated by a cabal of people who are essentially union-flag-waving socialists, just look at their economic policy. Labour were always socialists, but now they're waving union flags to appeal to the same constituency. The two parties have joined up in an unofficial, unbeatable alliance which will never be out of power. Libertarianism won't ever take hold in Britain because we're obsessed with the NHS, to the point of worshipping it with ritualistic behaviour. It's not authoritarianism pushed from the top down, it's from the bottom up. The politicians gain consent for taking away our rights by using Ofcom to regulate the media into scaring people shitless that their rights need to be taken to protect their safety. We're fucked, it's that simple.</p>
