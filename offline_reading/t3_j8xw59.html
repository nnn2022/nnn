    <strong>Got shadow banned from my city's subreddit for posting anti-lockdown comments</strong>
    <p><p>A post in that subreddit literally asked if we should have more restrictions in place. I replied with the following comment, which I'm posting here because apparently that subreddit does not allow a dissenting opinion:</p>
<p>No. We shouldn't. For the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns are not correlated with virus elimination, and have not been scientifically proven to work. Sweden (a control group in the ongoing natural experiment) did not lockdown and was not hit particularly badly. In contrast, Peru had an extremely strict lockdown and was hard hit. While correlation does not imply causation, if lockdowns were in fact effective, we would see more of a difference between jurisdictions that did lockdown vs those that didn't. Florida (minimal lockdown, lower death rate) vs. New York (strict lockdown, higher death rate) is another example. Lockdowns are an extreme measure, that, to justify being imposed, require an equally extreme effect on the virus. We aren't seeing such an effect. At all. Rather we are seeing the opposite (little to no effect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government does not have the right to impose these types of restrictions. We should let people make their own choices, in accordance with their own risk profile. Freedom to gather peacefully is an essential human right. (UN Declaration of Human Rights 20(1) and 27(1), Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 2(c)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A policy of extended lockdown to attempt to stop a virus is unprecedented. We didn't lock down for the pandemics of 2009, 1968, or 1957. Lockdowns in 1918 were short-lived and highly localized, not broad measures like we are seeing currently. Woodstock occurred during the 1968 flu pandemic, which killed a greater percentage of the world population than Covid has and will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns cause very negative long term effects. The UN has estimated than 130 million people will starve due to the economic devastation caused by the lockdown. Likewise, locking down again will cause a sharp increase in unemployment in our own province, which will disproportionately affect those already struggling. The negative mental health impacts due to another lockdown will directly cause more drug overdoses and suicides, not to mention more depression and anxiety. The lives of people living with mental health issues matter too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is becoming more and more clear that this disease was worldwide by December 2019. We lived 3 months as normal before locking down. We were fine. We can do it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the endgame for lockdowns? 0 cases? That is unrealistic and unsustainable. How many cases are acceptable? What is the end plan for a lockdown to be lifted? Without clear guidelines, the public is unable to hold elected leaders accountable for a plan to reopen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While it may be unfortunate to say, we make trade offs for deaths all the time. We allow people to drive, which causes death, both due to vehicle accidents and air pollution. We do this for convenience. We allow people to consume alcohol, which has negative impacts on the individual (eg. liver damage), as well as others (eg. domestic violence). We do this because we know that the effects of alcohol prohibition are even worse. Even if you believe that lockdowns are effective at stopping the virus, they are a bad trade off to save lives, given the numerous negative effects of a lockdown policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientists remain more divided on the issue of lockdowns than might be initially obvious. Several top scientists have signed the Great Barrington Declaration, agreeing that lockdowns are a bad policy.</p>
</li>

        <p>It's absolutely ridiculous. People were screaming for mask mandates and more restrictions. No one allowed to disagree. </p>
<p>Was wondering why I was only seeing one viewpoint about lockdowns and masks on that subreddit. This explains why. </p>
<p>Might write a letter to the Freep about why more lockdowns are a bad idea. Won't get published, but at least it would make me feel like I've done what I can.</p>

        <p>The mask mandate isn't working obviously but that subreddit will call for more lockdowns and closures which would kill alot of good small businesses and restaurants this city loves. Then they will cry about it when this is over.</p>

        <p>No doubt. It was never going to work. Just like all of the piles of scientific literature from [dawn of time] to March 2020 said. </p>
<p>Vulnerable people already had a choice to shop at Superstore and Walmart which mandated masks. Or to get groceries delivered.</p>
<p>I shopped at Safeway because I don't like to wear an uncomfortable, ineffective, piece of security theatre. </p>
<p>I'm no fan of Pallister, but thought he was doing a decent job with keeping things open, until he announced this dumb mask mandate and bars closing at 10pm. I really hope they don't put in more restrictions. </p>
<p>Time to move to South Dakota if they do.</p>

        <p>City governments are the biggest mockeries of democracy going. They are nothing more than a collection of ideologues catering to the loudest (not most numerous) constituencies.</p>
<p>Pre-Corona case in point:</p>
<p>The city I lived in previously went whole hog on the "Vision Zero" nonsense, and began to install "traffic calming" measures everywhere - curb extensions, narrowing streets, cobblestones, speed bumps.</p>
<p>What was the "voting and consultation" process to enable this?</p>
<p>- Hold "public meetings" at inconvenient places and times, and pack them with sock puppets.</p>
<p>- 35 percent of a neighbourhood voting was considered a quorum.</p>
<p>- 75  percent of the 35 percent had to vote in favour.</p>
<p><em>So less than 25 percent approval shoved the measures through!</em> </p>
<p>They are playing the same type of game with the 'Rona, claiming a vocal coterie of paranoid Karens somehow constitutes a "majority"...</p>

<p>It's one thing to be hysterical and allow others to disagree. At least then you've heard both sides and have chosen to be hysterical. </p>
<p>Quite another to not let the other side make their case, by literally citing trusted authorities. I could maybe understand banning actual fake news or conspiracy nuts, but my comments didn't fall into those categories.</p>

        <p>Shadow banning is supposed to be only used for spammers and bots. It's to keep them from knowing they've been banned, so they won't make a new account. Your city's subreddit is probably breaking the rules by shadow banning you for your comment. If your comment broke their rules, they should have deleted it and notified you, or outright banned you and notified you. But they didn't do that because they're cowards and they don't want to give you an explanation for how your comment violated the rules.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Because my comments DIDN'T violate the rules.</p>
<p>I sent an extremely polite message to the mods, explaining (nicely) why my comments should be reinstated, as is was important that people hear both sides of the argument. </p>
<p>The response I got back "nah"</p>
<p>I then asked if they were shadow banning everyone who posted anti-lockdown comments. </p>
<p>Got "muted" for 3 days. </p>
<p>How fragile does your position have to be to ban people whose opinions you don't like? That's NEVER the sign of a strong argument. </p>
<p>I like r/lockdownskepticism because people are allowed to post pro-lockdown information if they wish. No one gets banned for expressing a "wrong" opinion</p>

        <p>Here's something that we can take comfort in. While I'm very optimistic that this irrational lockdown shit will end soon, even if it doesn't, history will work itself out. </p>
<p>I can't imagine a future, however distant, where those that signed the Great Barrington Declaration aren't held in high regard. Almost certainly the tide will turn within our lifetimes, but, if not, at some point after that. </p>

        <p>&rt; History has never been kind to those that abuse power.</p>
<p>History is written by the victors.</p>
<p>&rt; Almost certainly the tide will turn within our lifetimes</p>
<p>You know, I used to say this about the trend to authoritarianism in the '70s,  My lifetime is not the same timespan as it used to be.</p>

        <p>True, immediately after the events, history is written by the victors. </p>
<p>Long term, the victors no longer exist and ideas are able to be explored without bias.</p>
