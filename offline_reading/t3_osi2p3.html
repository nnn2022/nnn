    <strong>Did you vote for this horrific administration?</strong>
    <p><p>I didn’t vote in the last political election.  First time in my life.  I couldn’t tell which person was more evil.</p>
<p>Honestly did you vote for this administration?
Feeling any remorse yet?</p>
<p>I hear a lot of complaining, but who voted for Dementia Joe?  Who voted for these horrible people?</p></p>

        <p>I voted for him too. He's definitely has problems. Particularly with 4th Amendment issues. But he's by far the lesser of 2 evils. It did kind of piss me off that he mentioned being suspicious of the MMR vaccine. Fast forward 5 yrs, he's got Operation Warp Speed. Maybe he didn't know enough about the issue to have a strong opinion. I would vote for him again. The fact the the establishment hates him so much, that does mean something. Things have gotten worse under Biden for sure.</p>

        <p>At the very least he's anti vaccine-mandate, I think he's overly proud of producing what's been touted as an "effective vaccine for the big bad COVID-19" in an extremely short amount of time to the point where he doesn't want to question whether it's harmful. I don't think he browses any internet discussion communities at all, he gets all his information from peers, family, associates, and maybe some FOX News these days (and some talk radio).</p>

        <p>I agree. He is very prideful. I thought that would be a good thing in the beginning because I thought he would want to be looked at as someone who did a good job. But it has worked against him with being too prideful to admit this is vaccine program is bad news  A lot of these presidents are ok with being the fall guy. Trump isn't. On the other hand, I can see why he wouldn't come out and say "I made a mistake", since we are not dealing with a normal situation. The media will attack and it will make him appear weak. </p>
<p>If there comes a time when the establishment knows not one more person will take the vax, and we have a mass die off that is so obviously the vax and can't be blamed on a variant, I think they will blame Trump. But they aren't there yet because they want people to take it.  They will probably start to admit to the catastrophe around the 2024 election.</p>

        <p>I voted for Biden and I hate myself for it. Watching old Trump videos makes me kinda emotional. Like damn, the media really did poison my mind to make me think he was a really bad guy, but now I’m realizing maybe he really wasn’t. I used to think his treatment of news reporters and other politicians was rude and unprofessional…now I realize it’s the ballsiest thing a presidents ever done because he knows how these people work. It took everything that’s happening now for me to realize all this.</p>

        <p>You blame the people? As much as I don’t like people, individuals aren’t that bad they’ve just been brainwashed by their public school, the media, cronyism, and their peers. It takes a little bit of courage to think for yourself. Many people don’t have that courage, they just want to belong.</p>

        <p>Trump fought the mask mandate and shutdowns as well it was fauchi who pushed that shit. Even then he left it up to states liberals wanted a federal mask mandate which they are going to start to push for our best interest. Make no mistake this dictator in chief now will mandate vaccines here. He is going to have your employer do it or a school or some third party so he can’t be blamed. This whole thing seems fishy with midterms coming up. Time to make some more fake mail in ballots joe.</p>

        <p>Hell no. I was in this subreddit before the election and you’d be hard pressed to find a Biden voter because we’re against the new normal, so voting for him would’ve been counterintuitive to our ethos. </p>
<p>Biden talked about continued masks and lockdowns, so anyone who voted for him that was against this shit either wasn’t paying attention, gave into peer pressure, or voted for him because they hated trump. Their hatred for trump must’ve been stronger than their desire to get back to normal, which is sad because the effects of lockdowns and masks are much more devastating. </p>
<p>I believed if Biden “won”, it’s because he fit the agenda better. Voting is an illusion of choice but I agree with you. I’d feel like shit for tying my name to this hell scape.</p>

        <p>Background: in 2006 I watched loose change. This answered some unasked questions about 9/11. 2008 I was 19. Time came to vote &amp; I didn't get the papers to do so. Would have voted Obama. </p>
<p>2012 was registered &amp; didnt vote. I had zero trust for any politician. Same for 2016. But back then I thought trump would never win. </p>
<p>FF to 2020 I had a few close people pressure me into voting biden (<em>but but but he's better than trump!</em>). I caved &amp; voted for the first time. I now regret giving into the guilt trip. Have since cut those people outta my life &amp; wished I'd let the lack of transparency on 9/11 keep me from voting as it did for 12+ years.</p>

        <p>the system is rigged, but voting still matters.</p>
<p>just look at states that voted for biden and democrat senstors but have red local legislature (michigan, arizona, pennsylvania, georgia, new hampshire, etc).</p>
<p>they definitely rig the election for federal positions but prob doesnt have the resources needed to rig every local race.</p>

I skipped the bullshit 1996 election. I voted for Ross Perot in 1992. I skipped the 1988 election because I was probably very high. I voted for Reagan in 1984 which was my first time eligible to vote.</p>

        <p>Trump didnt “appoint” fauci - he has been in his position in the NIH since the 80s. He is in his position so that presidents can bring him forward. He has been in his seat since AIDS started. Take some time to educate yourself on this point.</p>
