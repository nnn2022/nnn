    <strong>Now that “Vaxxed” People can live a “Normal” life again..what’s next if you won’t get shot up</strong>
    <p><p>So since the control structure is allowing stuck people to mask down, how are they going to start targeting us anti-fRaNKenRoNA vaxers?</p>
<p>I think vaccine passports will still come into play after another magical “hotspot surge” in cases happens. </p>
<p>We could get by for a bit just telling people we’re vaxed but the media will ignite the sheep into asking for “your papers” like nazi Germany did to jews. </p>
<p>The Fbi today just announced felony federal charges for anyone carrying a forged vax card with the CDC seal. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I think this liberty will be a short lived thing.</p></p>

        <p>I would discourage anyone from faking any papers. Not only is it illegal but any imprisonment would likely increase your chances of receiving  a mandatory vaccination. And, you would be showing you are complicit every time you’d use it. We need boycott any business requiring it. We shouldn’t give them our money. We need to stand United and say no! We are free!</p>
