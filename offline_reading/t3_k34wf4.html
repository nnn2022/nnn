    <strong>Genuine question to the doomers that brigade this sub - how do you reconcile the hypocrisy of the politicians that put these restrictions in place?</strong>
    <p><p>I get the “follow the science” arguments, but the people supposedly with the best access to science, and making the rules, don’t follow their own rules.  Examples are endless - Newsom dining with a large group, Garceti/De Blasio etc. marching with BlM, Lori Lightfoot marching for Biden’s win, wholesale refusal to ask Biden supporters, BlM protestors etc. to stay home, Illinois Gov travelling for thanksgiving while asking everyone else not to, Denver’s mayor doing the same thing.  The list is endless of thought leaders you guys supposedly look up to not following their own rules, but you dutifully insist everyone else does</p></p>

        <p>They reconcile it by ignoring it. It’s not about the politicians. It’s about feeling good. Being told that you’re responsible and compassionate, without having to actually do anything or help anyone. The same mindset that justifies whimsically confiscating someone’s wealth with the threat of jail or worse, so that you can give it to someone else (and usually yourself).</p>

        <p>Not to mention the only thing they remember is what they've heard recently from the MSM. If they'd been paying attention the moving of the goal post would have been incredibly obvious and this would be over. My head spins at how many times the narrative has contradicted itself the last 10 months.</p>

        <p>This is the crux of the matter.  Let's take Hancock, mayor of Denver.  If he truly, actually believed that isolation was the best thing for everyone he would not fly to Mississippi for Thanksgiving.  If he worried for his health he would not.</p>
<p>He doesn't.  It isn't.</p>

        <p>! rant alert !</p>
<p>That is, in my opinion, is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set to the population.</p>
<p>You can make valid arguments for restrictions not working. For example, damage to mental health caused by prolonged isolation, damage to the economy caused by forced inactivity, people finding a way around restrictions anyway, etc. etc. You are probably way more familiar with these arguments than I am, so you know what I'm talking about. But a part of these arguments is that the damage caused by a lockdown is not worth the positive benefits that it brings, either because the damage is too large to justify, or the danger that is being fought against isn't large enough to fight against at all, and that's where my problem is.</p>
<p>Because the danger is very much there. Just yesterday, 151K more people got the virus in the United States - cumulatively that's almost 13 million people - and worldwide there was an increase of 441K cases - over 61 million cumulatively. Out of those, 1.1K more people died in the US, and 9.3K more died world wide, over 266K and 1.4 million cumulatively, respectively (that sounds a bit weird, but you get the point). To put that into perspective, the equivalent of 9/11 (which killed around 2.9K people in a one-off event) happened three times over (in worldwide numbers) just yesterday.</p>
<p>When 9/11 happened, the entire country was mourning, not just in the short aftermath, but months and even years afterwards. Heck, the US even went to war over it. And yet, when the threat is at a magnitude three times as great, happening almost every single day at this point, there are people like you saying that it's "not that dangerous" (I don't mean to point you out specifically, because you were technically quoting a person, but many people on this subreddit that I've encountered have said stuff like this)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it isn't just impacting the lives of people with covid, because the amount of hospitalizations resulting from the sheer amount of cases of this coronavirus is occupying ICU beds to almost full capacity in many hospitals in many states all across the country (and in many countries all across the world), and in some cases that capacity has already been exceeded, which means that people with unrelated illnesses can't be treated for their potentially life-threatening conditions. And of course, full ICUs means that other covid patients also can't get treated, meaning that the death toll from covid also increases along with those from said unrelated illnesses.</p>
<p>Which is exactly the point of wearing a mask and distancing/staying home, because instead of an overwhelming surge of cases (like we are seeing now) leading to hospital demand exceeding capacity leading to higher death rates for everyone, the healthcare system would be able to cope with a smaller trickle of cases, which increases the quality of care and treatment for everyone. And yes, while it does mean that the pandemic will last longer, leading to longer periods of unpleasant isolation, which we can all agree is damaging to both individual health and economic wellbeing, in my eyes, it's worth it. You can recover an economy, you can recover your mental health, you can exercise to regain all of the muscles that have atrophied over the course of this shitty year, and it's going to be really hard, and will take a really long time, but at least it <em>is</em> recoverable, because human lives aren't.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if you've already heard everything that I've said, but I wanted to make sure my opinion was clear. Also, thank you for being civilized and making your argument without cussing me out like some other people have.</p>

        <p>My problem is that cases don’t mean you’re deathly ill or even symptomatic. The PCR test is wack and should not be used for diagnosis. The inventor even says so haha The basis for these numbers is a best guess that can easily be misinterpreted. I think they purposefully chose this pcr test so they can distort the language and pull out these huge numbers that seem scary. </p>
<p>The hypocrisy of the politicians is telling. Maybe if one of them messed up then sure, just a mistake. But to me it looks like they’re in a club that plays with everyone else’s lives while they get to do whatever tf they want. </p>

<p>Well thank <em>you</em> for your calm contribution, if those are the right words for it!</p>
<p>&rt;My problem is that cases don’t mean you’re deathly ill or even symptomatic. </p>
<p>In my opinion, that makes it even more of a danger, because plenty of healthy and/or young people could be spreading it to those with weaker immune systems without even knowing. Isn't it worth it to stay a little distance away from people or wear a simple cloth over your face (which is effective, by the way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y47t9qLc9I4">This video</a> from minutephysics explains how they work, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tp0zB904Mc">this video</a> from It's Okay To Be Smart demonstrates this visually) to protect those more vulnerable? I hear a lot of people say that they wouldn't halt the economy to protect some rando's 90-year old-relative (I agree that overuse of lockdowns is harmful, by the way, but it can be a last resort measure for out-of-control situations), but I have a hunch that it would be a different story if it were <em>their</em> 90-year-old relative.</p>

<p>Yes! Tests aren't going to be 100% reliable all of the time, and nor will the numbers. That's why there are multiple types of tests, so that different diagnosis methods can be used in order to find some overlap between their false positives/false negatives. While it can be unreliable at times, I doubt that the scientific/medical community would go as far as to allow a test that doesn't work 50% of the time to continue to be used to battle a pandemic, because that just harms everyone, whether you like more restrictions or not.</p>

<p>I don't like it either. Yeah, that's all I have to say.</p>

<p>I honestly don't even know. OP asks a "geniune question," I give a genuine answer. Guess people aren't satisfied that they can't use my moral inconsistency to attack everyone else.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely right-you responded very appropriately to OP’s post.  Unfortunately the vast majority of Reddit doesn’t care that the downvote function is supposed to be used to minimize comments that <strong>detract from the conversation</strong>  instead of being a big “I DONT LIKE THAT REEE” button.</p>
<p>Maybe if we could get together and actually have conversation we might be able to better meet in the middle...</p>
