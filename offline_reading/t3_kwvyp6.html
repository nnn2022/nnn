        <p>&rt; Here's how his idea works: Everyone who gets vaccinated would be eligible for a $1,000 payment from the federal government. You'd get $200 for taking both vaccine shots. And then an additional $800 once the country reaches herd immunity. </p>
<p>Let me put this another way - the plan is to pit the people who get the vaccine against those who do not. We can then demonize those who don’t get the vaccine for not only health reasons, but financial reasons as well. Imagine someone who is destitute (because of what the government has done with the draconian measures) is now waiting on a <strong><em>payday</em></strong> for others to get the vaccine. You think people hate ~~anti-maskers~~ free thinkers now?  <em>Just wait...</em></p>
<p><a href="https://holocaustatlas.com/the-holocaust-the-second-world-war/the-stages-of-genocide-the-holocaust/">I think were getting to the polarization stage of genocide, personally </a>. The fact that so many people want to those who don’t believe that <strong>a piece of cloth that has existed for thousands of years protects your from a virus with a 99.993% survival rate if you’re under 50</strong> to <strong><em>DIE</em></strong> just shows you how far the rabbit hole we’ve gone.  Don’t even get me started on New York...they’re already starting the “preparation” phase IMO. </p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight, folks.</p>

        <p>Well, unlike masks, angry random strangers will have no way to know who has it and who doesn’t.  But, you are right about the demonization of people who have doubts about the vaccine.</p>

        <p>i have been thinking the same but do you really think people would kill to save the life (including of those, who they kill)</p>
<p>does that not seem hypocritical?</p>
<p>lets assume they get 70% vaccinated and pit them against the free thinkers, what reason (other than the 1k $$$) would they have, to genocide the 30%?</p>
<p>because the 70% are already immune?!? their lives are not at risk at that point, so they would not be acting out of fear for their life (therefore, irrationally).</p>
<p>i dont think just 1k could incentivize people, regardless of how desperate they are, to turn to genocide, given that the fear of death is gone, due to the vaccine™</p>

        <p>1k could incentivize a lot of people...if they were getting it within our lifetimes. But this isn't an offer of 1k, it's an offer of $200, plus $800 once the government decides we reached herd immunity. Which will probably be in "2 weeks" ie at least a year. I'm guessing the only people interested will be the extremely poor and desperate people for whom an extra $200 means the ability to make rent...hmmm.</p>

        <p>&rt;”Payments may indeed encourage some people to get the vaccine," says Cynthia Cryder, an associate professor of marketing at Washington University's Olin Business School. "But it may also deter people from getting the vaccine. Because payments signal that the vaccine is risky." </p>
<p>I don’t understand why these idiots don’t understand this. It does look suspicious.  Either trying to coerce people or bribing people will make a lot of people think there is something wrong with it. It’s so stupid.</p>
