    <strong>What is the point of going on?</strong>
    <p><p>I never thought I'd get to the point mentally where i'd have to make a post like this. But here goes.</p>
<p>What is the point of going on if life is going to continue this way? All the things that the lockdowns have ruined seem so unlikely to come back. I got laid off from a job that I really liked; my dating life's snowballed into an epic fail; friends barely want to meet up, and can't meet with new people because events shut down/no job; my relations with family have become strained due to the stress of it all. What's the point of going on if life will continue like this, everyone constrained in their homes, with masks and restrictions abound and no respite of normality to get away from things? When did we lose our humanity and sense of being. All I can bring myself to do most days is look for work somedays because everything else seems hopeless and futile. I have no money to travel and escape this madness. I barely have enough money from unemployment to support my basic needs. Someone please provide me with some hope. I need to know that somehow, there is a point to living in this disastrous world.</p></p>

        <p>For the fight. When all seems lost, when everyone is a sheep heading to slaughter, when even I'm doubting my own ability to persevere against what feels like the entire earth against me, I remind myself that there IS still a shred of hope for us to win. We may not be rewarded in this world for it, but our souls will know we died fighting.</p>

        <p>Millions of people have the exact same sediment.. it is all a part of this grand scheme that is being played upon the people of the world. </p>
<p>I am going to say "don't be demoralized" "if the situation was hopeless, the propaganda wouldn't be necessary." </p>
<p>But I feel the same as well, just as many people here do as well. </p>
<p>The only thing we can do is continue on and hope that the future is a brighter and more reasonable then then where we are today. </p>
<p>I feel for you and I am sorry that the world is devolving into this dystopian hellscape of incompetent sheep.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But please make sure you are taking care of yourself and moving and exercising. Also make sure you take a break from the lunacy that is engulfing every media that is available. </p>
<p>I wish you all the best.</p>

        <p>Fight back! Meet up with anti-lockdown groups and protests. Donâ€™t wear a mask. Speak at local meetings. If for no other reason than what do you have to lose?</p>

        <p>Dont give up! You or OP. You are not as alone as you feel right now. There are lots of us out here, and we need strength in numbers to stand up against this bullshit. I think more people are waking up, at least i hope so.</p>
