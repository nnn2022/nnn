    <strong>Revolution against the government couldn't even happen because the majority of our youth is so pussified.</strong>
    <p><p>They say tough times make tough people, tough people make soft times, soft times make soft people. </p>
<p>I just can't see youth of today ever making a stand. People have no discipline, no convictions, no ability to delay gratification. Weaklings. </p>
<p>How is this going to end? </p>
<p>Also, what's the incentives the government has to keep lockdowns? The economy is trashed so surely that affects them? I heard that it's deals with online retailers that lines the pockets of these politicals</p></p>

        <p>It’s really odd being 21 years old in a time like this. Most people around my age have no problem giving up their rights and bending over for their government leaders. I’m just glad I work in a trade and can associate with normal people on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Young people have an easier time giving up their rights because most of them never had full freedom and rights in the first place (living under parents roof, under 18 years old, etc.). Older people understand freedom, dignity, and rights, and so they can feel the pain from this loss.</p>

        <p>I'm in my early 30's and I've been thinking about this a lot. Most older generations dislike the younger generation and vice versa. I didn't want to fall into that trap, but there's something seriously different about these young little shits.</p>
<p>They don't rebel, they conform.</p>
<p>Their bodies don't develop right because they sat on their asses instead of playing outside. Look at your average early 20's weirdo. They have sloping shoulders. They have anterior pelvic tilt so their butt sticks out like Donald Duck. Their neck is pointed forward. They don't have muscle tone.</p>
<p>Their personalities are best described as a combination of narcissism and anxiousness - the most obnoxious personality type ever. They're scared to talk on the phone to a customer service rep but they aren't afraid to burn a Walgreens if Cardi B says it OK.</p>
<p>A lot of these little shits are going to die in the coming months when shit escalates.</p>

        <p>I remember going to a car meet last year and these younger guys who probably were no older than 18 had the same car as me (miata) so I tried striking a friendly convo and they legit didn't say a word and stared at me like I was some kind of alien. </p>
<p>That wasn't the first time that has happened either but a lot of them do have some type of autism or some shit. It was fucking bizarre when that happened.</p>

        <p><em>generally speaking</em> I mean a lot of my boys (I can count like a dozen off my head) that can put up 225lbs on bench and some can push 315lbs. We've all played contact sports including hockey and football. I'm not saying we're the toughest around. Not even close lol there's dudes our age that would make us look soft.  But we sure ain't Donald duck pp was lmao. I mean I'm sitting here 5ft11 215lbs 15% bf lol. So I feel like your statement is attached to your overall view of what you've seen. Our general population I mean yeah they're soft and they conform but a lot of us also question the authority wondering why they're doing what they're doing what  does it benefit, etc... also lots of dudes at the gym putting up big numbers that older folks dreamed of being able to put up when they were younger. I will give you this though and what does tend to happen is that people are entitled because there parents never said no to them.  That does exist and create narcissistic behavior.</p>

        <p>Also is a result of the indoctrination through education systems, and throw social media on top of that. If you protest against this now, your face and name will be plastered all over Twitter being blasted and doxxed by radicals. We‘ve even seen how these people contact the schools/uni’s of people they don’t agree with and get them kicked out. Today, dissidence has horrible consequences, and the youth of today basically download their opinions off of Twitter, which tells them to fear this virus and be a granny saver. We’re fucked.</p>

        <p>thats a debate to be had though, what efficiencies are there really with central planning.  dollar for dollar, isnt something executed through a high vantage point more likely to
miss realities on the ground (more costs) and more likely to run through more hands to get to the level of application (more costs) and slower to change when realities on the ground change (more costs) - to me this whole experience has solidified my position that smaller jurisdictions are better and national governments should be there for borders, enforcement of major human and civil rights, and maybe some wide scale infrastructure, but schools, agriculture, pandemic response and others are much more nimble and reflective of the reality on the ground when they are planned and executed by members of the community.</p>

        <p>When I mentioned efficiency the first thing I thought of was the LA to Sf high speed rail and the comparisons to similar projects in China that were in the media. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to live in a country where the government isn’t even slightly hesitant to exercise eminent domain, and it’s probably for the better IMO that the west coast rail won’t happen at least as initially planned, but obviously there would be benefits of having such infrastructure even though a lot of people would be displaced and probably unhappy even with appropriate compensation</p>

        <p>true, and good example of when central planning could work.  i just think there are 100-to-1 examples of when smaller, more localized decisions are better - such as covid, and the craziness that was the demand for a unilateral national lockdown after the bug already was showing up in basically all states.</p>

        <p>I’m part of gen z and I don’t understand why people in my generation are so ignorant and naive. I feel like millennials have created this pussified society and most of us after them just accepted it. Also like you say “soft times make soft people”, I’ve personally had a rough childhood. I don’t mean I was “sad bro” I mean I almost died multiple times from health problems, grew up in a single parent household, grew up mostly poor, seen some bad disturbing things. So I’ve been hardened, sometimes I think too much. But everyone else around my age cries about meaningless petty shit. I guess you could say a lot of them are weak. What happened to young people being rebels?</p>

        <p>They burnt the population out on riots/protests during 2020. Tons of youth were rioting basically because of propaganda spewed to them by the main. And most of the older population were going to work like normal.</p>
<p>Shit is actually nearing the point where the middle age and older working class could riot, protests are already happening in some places. But again people are burnt out from riots and have jobs/families to work on. Also the youth wouldn't know a legit reason to riot if it slapped them in the face and since Cardi B isn't posting on her instagram about how many people have lost their jobs and how many people are in food lines this year they probably think their previous round of rioting was successful bc Biden is pres now.</p>
<p>It's almost like it was planned: fatigue the population from rioting from fake reasons so they won't want to riot even when real reasons surface.</p>

        <p>I agree. It’s going to take the 25+ year olds to make change for the majority. Today’s youth is a product of the parenting and schooling. There are good kids out there still. Even the ones that are too scared to do anything are good, just misguided.</p>

        <p>The hard times will create strong men again. Just like the easy times created weak men now. It might take a generation or more for us to gain our footing again. Just look at how Soviet communism played out in Russia. It was absolutely horrible for about 70 years, then it was OK, and now its normal. </p>
<p>I wouldnt count the US out 100%. I agree the situation appears horrible. But just think of the Civil War, WW1, WW2, each time we came back stronger. Not to say there wont be a big fight and dramatic loss of life. But it was never easy to get where we are today. Only difference is now we are more decadent and soft cuz of our prosperity. And that is likely going to change in the very near future.</p>

        <p>The end of prosperity and decadence could shift the thinking of a lot of people. </p>
<p>I think we've been living off of the hardwork and achievements of those who have come before us. This is why there is little to no consequence for adopting destructive and anti-thetical ideologies nowadays. But soon there is going to be a consequence for living and shaping our societies like we did in the post-modern era. </p>
<p>Consequences usually have a way of waking some people up but hardening others.</p>

        <p>Thats only a temporary measure to essentially pay people off to keep quiet and distracted during the transition phase. Giving out money is not sustainable in the long term. </p>

        <p>The impending economic downturn will drive millions into poverty. The suicide and crime rate will climb exponentially. On top of large scale civil unrest and another war (maybe). Add to this forced lockdowns, mandatory innoculations, and other forms of tyranny. </p>
<p>Those in this generation who are soft/weak will not survive, either mentally, physically or morally. The ones who manage to reproduce in cohesive family units create a new stronger generation with nothing to lose and everything to gain, having grown up hearing of stories of a "golden era" of the nation. </p>
<p>IMO, this is the essentially how the hardtimes/strongmen paradigm works.</p>

        <p>This is a bleak picture but I partly agree. Maybe it won't be as bad as you say, but for sure it will be much harder than it used to be. Despite the moaning of millennials - that they've had a hard life due to 2008 - which wasn't easy, they've also been hugely pampered by their parents. Ok, some can't get on the housing ladder, but they've also been sheltered from a lot of things and uber, deliveroo, netflix etc means they are very used to conveniences. This will change a lot of people. And think about the kids - early teens. They will know at some level this is unfair. They will not be trusting governments. They will get to early 20s and be like "The government lied to me and psychologically tried to break me". THIS will create a gen of rebels who won't care about the consequences. And I can't wait. I'm an older millennial, but I've had enough of my generation (and Gen Z's) lameness and passivity which is now actually affecting everyone's lives as they judge and blame online.  It's now turning into a dangerous situation and they need this shock to be honest.</p>

        <p>Definetly. I wrote a doomsday scenario but I still have hope it could go either way. Even now I hear this new generation is vastly more conservative than the previous. Ironically, it seems they are rebelling against progressive degeneracy, which is turning them into maverick traditionalists. </p>
<p>The US was founded upon revolution and our consitution assumes revolution might be necessary in the future. They cant take that away from the US, just like they can never take away Islam from Afghanistan. For better or for worse. There will always be traditionalists/radicals who resist even when they are a pronounced minority.</p>

        <p>Admittedly, I been having thoughts about attempting to do SOMETHING. Like tearing down some posters, daring to step into a store without a mask, or at least something like that to start. But there's these...invisible forces. One's peer pressure, the other's wanting to stick to my comforts, I think. They're both really, really strong, and they prevent me from doing much alongside anxiety.</p>
<p>I mean, I can walk downtown. But the mere sight of Mask-encouragement(I might post a photo of one later), causes the invisible forces to wrench me away. I don't slap a mask on, but I've managed to move past that crap at least. But still...</p>

<p>That’s going to be the downfall of humanity (and it’s universal). Life is still relatively good and we just want to get along and have things be calm and happy ... so we tolerate. We tolerate two weeks becoming 4 weeks, then 4 months, then a year. We tolerate businesses closing permanently. We tolerate children regressing developmentally and becoming depressed. We tolerate our grandparents being tortured to death with isolation. </p>
<p>We tolerate it all, while hoping things will turn around - because the cost of doing something is still perceived as too high. And we’ll continue tolerating it so long as that remains true, which means we’ll tolerate it until it’s far too late to save our lives and futures.</p>

<p>But here's the thing about me: I'm pretty useless(currently). When it comes to skill, talent, and whatnot, I think I'm barely exceptionally in writing. Writing is also one of my comforts. And writing is what I want to start making money from(aside from hopefully finding a job). I can't give that up. </p>
<p>As for the rest, like family and video-gaming, maybe- I don't know. Family's always been important to me, and video-gaming helps exercise my brain cells.</p>

        <p>Definitely feels like I'm living in the last waning days of America as a great and free country. Look to Europe for what our future probably looks like when the leadership turns over in another 20 years: Massively expanded government power, police weaponized to enforce woke culture, mass immigration destroying national identity, vastly decreased national sovereignty, perpetual economic doldrums due to red tape culture stifling innovation, etc.</p>

        <p>The problem is social media. One wrong step and your life can come crashing down. You have to assume you are being recorded at all times of the day. There is no such thing as anonymity nor redemption. You are now defined by your past mistakes (or beliefs that go against the grain) and that history will always come back to haunt you and your family.</p>

        <p>&rt; Also, what's the incentives the government has to keep lockdowns? The economy is trashed so surely that affects them?</p>
<p>Part of the plan. They have zero worries about money and already secured their own places long before this started.</p>
<p>The plan is to give everyone a basic income (by the end of this year); just enough to survive.</p>
<p>The vaccines are part of the plan too and used to modify people's DNA. Also take a look at what Elon Musk is doing with his Neuralink company and try to connect the dots.</p>

        <p>As a youth of today in my senior year, a lot of my peers simply fall for it. They're not seeing the entire picture with the COVID thing or the world and are still fighting over the trivial issues such as race or gender when they don't see that it's a trap. These people want us divided and distracted and they're falling for it. </p>
<p>There are a few who seem to get it though. That is welcoming at least. I just wish more were. I fear that many of them won't be ready when shit hits the fan with everything these elite have been talking about. They're so stuck in the Matrix that when they're out of it, they're naked and unsure of what to do next for their survival.</p>
