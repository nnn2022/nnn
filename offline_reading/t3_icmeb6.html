    <strong>Supermarket sales in Great Britain slowed after face-covering rule</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; Data shows 2 million fewer supermarket visits shortly after measure was introduced </p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/18/supermarket-sales-great-britain-slowed-face-covering-rule">The Guardian UK: Supermarket sales in Great Britain slowed after face covering mandate</a></p>
<p>I wonder what this would look like in the U.S.; overall, it seems like the Brits in general are far more opposed to indoor mask mandates than Americans. I'm surprised that so many Americans are willingly going along with the face masks. I'd love to see some analysis from the U.S. as well as other parts of Europe to see what happened to in-store foot traffic after face mask rules came into effect and the impact on sales.</p></p>

        <p>There’s a few subcultures in America driving it:</p>
<p>There’s the overweight, ugly people who want to hide their face. People who want to hide age, wrinkles, bad teeth, chins, noses, cold sores etc are in this group. </p>
<p>There’s the socially inept/anxious who use it as a defense mechanism to go unrecognized and not have talk to people. </p>
<p>There’s the people who are benefiting from the virus, who want a visual reminder that it is still happening lest they no longer get benefits, wfh, or whatever it is they’re getting out of it.</p>
<p>Similarly, there’s the zombie movie doomers who relish the disruption because they hated their old life.</p>
<p>There’s the power-hungry politicians who follow-suit after one does it and love to see their opposition literally muzzled.</p>
<p>There are those who politically do whatever they believe their party wants them to do.</p>
<p>There’s people who do and believe whatever the tv tells them—within this group you have those who are genuinely scared because tv told them to be.</p>
<p>There’s those with a strong authoritarian complex who love enforcing the rules and sanctimoniously out-grouping those who don’t.</p>
<p>There are fetishists who get off on it.</p>
<p>And the largest subgroup, the ones who are afraid of the judgement from any of the above listed groups, the ones who don’t want to rock the boat and would rather just do it to be polite than exert the energy to counter it, even if deep down they don’t like it and don’t think it’s really necessary.</p>

        <p>fuckin' nailed it.</p>
<p>the best part is, most of these groups overlap, and i'd love to see someone make a Venn diagram of these subcultures.</p>
<p>i do think the largest group, the silent majority, are the ones who just wear the mask to avoid the hassle.</p>
<p>every day when i put the mask on, i ask myself, "Pipps, is this how ugly people feel all the time?"</p>

<p>That reminds me of <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/why-do-japanese-people-wear-surgical-masks-its-not-always-for-health-reasons">an article from 2014 about Japanese people and surgical masks</a>, which comments that some people do use the masks to essentially tune out.  A person is quoted saying, about their daughter, "She puts on a mask and sticks headphones in her ears so that people won’t bother her. It makes it harder for them to start talking to her."</p>

        <p>I bet you’re a lot better off than you give yourself credit for. Just improving posture and smiling can make people look a million times better. I’ve noticed when people wear masks, they have scowly faces and they walk like they’ve been beat down.</p>

        <p>Eh. I've had people make fun of my appearance in public, including other adults. So I tend to feel awkward and embarrassed often. I guess you'd think the mask would make me feel better, but it doesn't. I hate how uncomfortable I feel in it, and I hate not seeing other people's faces.</p>

        <p>I’ve had people make fun of me too. They are always miserable people who are projecting their own issues. I’ll admit I’m a bit “goofy” looking, but even though I <em>could</em> hide with a mask, I hate them too! I think other people look scary in them, I don’t like not being able to read their expressions fully.</p>

        <p>I barely shop at all with the mask on. </p>
<p>Ever since the mask mandate was put in place in my area I've noticed I don't go to the store at all or very brief. I'm shopping less than when I had to wait in line for an hour to go in the store. </p>
<p>I don't browse at all or spend unnecessary time. I'm hoping this will be what pushes the mask mandates to go away. Retailers like Wal-mart noticing profits going down and pushing the government to back off the mandates</p>

        <p>Not surprised, I used to go in several times a week after work to pick up various things, it was always a nice little ritual, pick up some cheese and bread, maybe some wine or beer or cookies, line up and banter with the checkout person, have a laugh and ask them how their day was.</p>
<p>Now I'm funnelled to the robot checkouts and not allowed to see a human because I only have a hand basket and the human clerks are roped off for the serious eaters loading trolleys full of cakes and pies.  Also I have this piece of shit face covering and even if someone has to age verify my alcoholic purchase there's next to no interaction, not even a smile of course.</p>
<p>It's turned into an ordeal instead of an after work pleasantry so I only bother when I absolutely have to.</p>
<p>Today I saw an old guy actually in a gas mask wandering around the store - I wasn't sure if he was doing it to feel safe or mocking the face covering mandate.  I do hope it was the latter! 🤣</p>
<p>On the upside I'm saving quite a bit of cash!</p>

        <p>Yeah because who the hell wants to fuck with a mask to grab something at the store? I have a landscaping project I'm putting off because Home Depot is probably staffed with mask Nazis. I've heard rumors of them not confronting people but I'd rather not only have to go when I absolutely need something. I may test the waters with a small purchase.</p>

I live in a remote area, so we really only have 1 choice for grocery stores, but I stock up on everything I can from little shops where usually I'm the only one in there. Going into the grocery store with the mask mandate (I don't wear a mask, and a small minority here don't either) is a reminder that my neighbors are susceptible to foolish groupthink. Lately, some of the most obvious Karens have been giving me the stink eye for daring to buy food during a "pandemic" maskless, so I don't want to travel to shop in a bigger city where there's presumably a higher chance a Mazi will assault me or my kids for not playing along.</p>
<p>I used to pop into the grocery store for odds and ends to make a special recipe or something, but now I only go when we're out of one of the staples. </p>
<p>I have noticed though that the employees are pretty mask-tired and are mostly all wearing face shields now.</p>

        <p>i live in the suburbs of a large metro area and there is no escaping the face mask rule, the social distancing reminders, or the arrows on the floors in every grocery store. however, i will say that the Asian supermarkets are actually okay because no one in there will ask you to put a mask on or correct how you're wearing it; everyone minds their own business and leaves each other alone. i went a few times between March and May and stocked up on fresh produce and meat; they're well-priced and i know what i'm getting even when i can't read the labels.</p>
<p>95% of people in my area are masked to the gills; there isn't even a small minority indoors willing to risk the ire and judgment of the Mazis. outdoors i'd say 75% of people are masked; it's fucking absurd.</p>
<p>like you, i used to go grocery shopping at least once a week and sometimes more for special items. i have not set foot in a grocery store since Memorial Day weekend, right before our state mask mandate. since then, my husband goes every two weeks and only buys the basics/staples. we've stopped going to restaurants but we do take out/delivery a few times a week because i've frankly lost interest in cooking, and i've sort of lost interest in eating. everything tastes the same now, so why bother putting any effort into it? i can literally eat a bagel every day, doesn't matter if i enjoy it or not. my husband, however, does need to eat and doesn't like to cook, so take away it is.</p>
<p>i'm grateful that my husband will go grocery shopping for us, and everything we don't buy in the store, i can order online.</p>
<p>i'm definitely getting a sense of mask fatigue but everyone is too tired and afraid of public shaming that we just keep going along with it. haven't seen many face shields here, but my husband says he's seen more people wearing masks and gloves and goggles lately, lol. it's summer and it's hot and humid and muggy and swampy and i don't understand how people can physically stand to wear the damn things, it's fucking torture.</p>
<p>and good on you for not traumatizing your children! you're raising your kids properly, and they're lucky to have a sane, thoughtful mom.</p>

        <p>Thank you, that's nice of you to say. I would recommend a little flouting of diktats. Even though it is risky, do it for the children who have no choice or advocate from these monkeys. Start by walking the wrong way down the bread aisle, or sticking a nose out, I beg you. Maybe work up a sweat outdoors in a public park. We need freedom fighters on the ground, and since it's our free will they are after, it's our free will we should indulge. Who knows, really, how long we may still have it. Enjoy it while you can.</p>

        <p>I agree with all....nothing is pleasurable anymore for me..  I live vicariously through my young adult adventurous sons that defy all rules and live their lives.  Both are and have been on the frontlines thru this shitstorm. They work very hard and I say more power to u both for enjoying the little things...traveling to those places where u don’t need to quarantine for a million days and seeing friends and loved ones. We as a society have been essentially robbed having fathers absent from witnessing the births of their children, family and loved ones not being able to comfort the ill and dying in hospitals, not able to celebrate weddings , graduations, proms, milestone celebrations etc. Now, the future of our children’s educations are in jeopardy along with any chance of them being able to enjoy extra curricular activities , play dates etc. All for a 3 % mortality rate?  Sorry no disrespect to those we have lost but to sacrifice the “REMAINING” 97% just seems unthinkable. I can’t even imagine what this winter will be like and the holidays. It’s a proven fact that the suicide rate increases around holidays in a normal world. What will be this year? I for one am not suicidal but know people who struggle every day due to anxiety ...isolationism and fear.  Guess what? I can’t even comfort them because of these “rules and guidelines” dumped on us. Gone is the hug or kiss for fear of killing someone with Covid. Gone is the smile I can no longer share with others because of the mask I wear and the new concern is that I’m having a hard time understanding people under the mask and vice versa. We are becoming complacent , predictable, passive and affable. All the things you would find in the Stepford World and we know what they really were.  My advice to the young generation...live your life to the fullest., be kind to one another and don’t be afraid to challenge those who are writing the narrative.  That’s what being HUMAN is....not what we’ve become. Life is for the living and we must never forget that....I guess it’s time I take my own advice💪</p>

        <p>I shop about once a month now. I used to shop weekly if not more because my home is small and "stocking up" is an ordeal. I haven't been in my usual grocery stores since the 4th of July. I go where I can either not mask at all or be minimally compliant. I've only had one confrontation, but I have gotten stink eye a few times. For some things, my husband obtains them through the restaurant supply lines and we go in with family members to split the cost and quantity. I also order more online than I ever did, just to save the hassle of trying to figure out where to go.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that sales are lower, at least in some areas. </p>
<p>I genuinely love taking care of my home and family. Planning meals, improving things around the house, shopping...it's been hard to have to live this way. Absolutely nothing is simple anymore. If I need a certain size bolt and need to go to the hardware store, I have to figure out where I can go to do that without being hassled, if I can. Everything is a huge production now and it sucks.</p>

        <p>I knew this would happen. </p>
<p>The funny thing is the excuse for the mask mandate in UK shops was that it would give shoppers the "confidence" to go out and buy shit. They did it "for the economy" which they destroyed lol.</p>
<p>If people bought more online instead, they'll spin the narrative and say that covid is so dangerous that people are scared to come to the supermarket (and use cash especially), so we need to think about moving towards a cashless, delivery based society.</p>
