    <strong>Is it illegal for children to be forced to get the corona vaccine without consent in Florida?</strong>
    <p><p>Sprry for bad grammar Im anxious.</p>
<p>I am 13. My dad is implying he could force me into getting the COVID vaccine saying "we will go together" and when I said I have autonomy, and thst I can make my own decisions, he said "you cant make your own decisions. your a child."</p>
<p>Technically, in legal terms hes right. HOWEVER he cannot mind control me. Hes my father but I am a person, not his toy.</p>
<p>My mom lives in another house. She says the coronavirus is fake. Which is based, but I dont live with her. My grandparents? hahahahahha...they are pro-vaccine and pro-mask.</p>
<p>Everytime my grandfather makes me watch "the news" it is news about the delta variant being a threat. Or vaccines or schools. On Fox News too. I thought hed be the stanch opposite because he hates free healthcare and communism, but he wants me to get the vaccine which is free?? Would he not hate the vaccine because its free healthcare technically? I dont know his mind. My grandma says she got the vaccine to "protect me"....and she said she will still wear a mask even after getting her second shot. They can do what they want but they COULD force me into getting it..</p>
<p>I wrote the governor of florida an email out of pure impluse. I stayed professional and calm but I had some grammar mistakes. He probably wont read it, but still. I  need to do something nd fast. Any advice on how to stay away from corona vaccine areas, and any advice on how to convince my family to not force me to get it would be GREATLY appericiated.</p>
<p>And no I am not being paranoid. My dad said quote "You have no autonomy." to me. My grandma said "Its like the Swane flu(It being the coronavirus),"My grandpa wanted to have a talk on the vaccine 2 weeks ago me and him alone but I managed to dodge that. But still, if I had that talk with him...i dont think it wouldve been pretty.</p>
<p>Im really scared.</p></p>

        <p>I find it funny how dems are okay with children under 18 getting an abortion or going for hormone therapy if they feel that they were assigned the wrong set at birth without parental consent saying they should have a say in their medical care, but don't have the same right to refuse a vaccine.</p>
<p>Sorry you are going through this. I have no advice for you. But hopefully it will all work out in the end for you.</p>

        <p>Theres a reason they live in different houses. My mom and dad unoffically broke up (theyre legally married) and they get into quite the physical arguments. But I cant talk to her unless I have a telephone..i dont have a telephone. My dad regards her as delusional so idk if it could work..</p>

        <p>If he drags you to the clinic tell the doctor giving you the shot you do not consent and you are there against your will. There's no way they'd go through with it at that point.</p>

        <p>I don't advise that. What about your other grandparents, aunts, uncles, trusted neighbor, school counselor (if they have year-round schools). Unfortunately, most of the so-called authorities would be pro-vax or not want to appear anti-vax, so they might not help you. </p>
<p>I suggest showing him the reports of all the teenagers who died or got myocarditis and especially showing the parents' regret. Just remain calm and avoid getting into a shouting match. Cry if you need to!</p>

        <p>Is there a court order regarding custody?  If there are no legal restrictions on her contact with you, him isolating you from her could be considered a form of abuse.</p>
<p>Maybe try and borrow a friend, or neighbor's phone.</p>
<p>You will risk getting in trouble.  If the laws are anything like where I live, they have medical authority over you until you are 16, except of course in the case of abortion or gender related hormone therapy (go figure eh?)</p>

        <p>My uncle is also pro-vaccine. My dad has another brother, hes an author, but I have no idea about his stance.</p>
<p>The bulk of ppl in my family are pro-vaccine. Which would be fine and dandy if they didnt keep pressuring me..im scared. Im not getting the vaccine just so I can be entertained by the corporates. I tried to do research and it said nothing on florida law.</p>

        <p>Have you tried explaining to him that the death rate for people your age who get the virus is pretty much nonexistent? Then explain how there has not beenEnough time and research to guarantee its safety. In addition there may be older people that are at a higher risk that you would be taking the vaccination away from. Did he ever forced you to get a flu vaccine before? Because the death rate is the same so why would he want to force you to get this one? 
Can you go live with your Mom?</p>

        <p>Yeah i used to live with my mom and dad then they got angry at each other so my dad moved to my grandparents house with me. We’re gonna be going back soon but I have no idea how soon soon is. Idk about the flu vaccine but he probably has forced me to get it before because I was a baby I couldn’t say or do anything. I think I was a baby.</p>
<p>I’ve tried explaining and he said he’d look up the sources. I think he looked up left-wing sources because now he’s pro-vaccine as well.</p>

        <p>There's a lot of reports of various bad reactions to the vaccine for different people. One gal I know was hospitalized for a few days due to blood clots in her lungs. I am particularly worried for young boys at this point, given the rising cases of heart inflammation, specifically in that demographic. There was a 16 year old boy that got vaccinated at my local Fred Meyer and left in an ambulance due to suffering seizures immediately after injection. 
I am so glad I'm not a kid right now, but I'm also fortunate my family is perfectly sane. This is the hill I will die on, though. There is nothing you could threaten me with that would make me willing to risk my health or my life, particularly when I have absolutely 0 evidence that I am in any danger in the first place. And especially with the uncertainty surrounding fertility in women. I'm getting married in a month and, while I'm not sure if we want to start a family or not, the fact that it could potentially take that option away from me is unacceptable and anyone that blows off that concern is a soulless monster. 
I can't exactly help you, but my point is, I'd be fighting all the way until they strapped me down, if I was in your shoes. And if it went that far, I would never forgive the person that did it to me, and I would make sure they knew that going in. This isn't a teenage tantrum, it's not "omg, you're ruining my life!" because your phone got taken away. Its forcing unnecessary medical treatment with a dubious track record at best so far. Even if you don't have any reaction and are totally fine, its a risk that you are, very reasonably, concerned about and to ignore that concern is inhumane, in my opinion. 
This isn't a normal vaccine. It is not fully approved, we don't know the long term affects of it, and the worst part to me is that there has been safe and effective treatment  for Covid for quite some time, but it got squashed into oblivion because they couldn't get emergency approval if effective treatment was widely available. So I have to ask myself, if treatment has been available and they rejected it in lieu of the "medicine" they wanted, what has been the true motivator? Why did they need THIS to be the only possible solution so badly? The most obvious answer is to follow the money. It wouldn't have been profitable if there was already a treatment, in fact it would have killed the vaccine effort wholesale, as it would have been unnecessary and also taken much longer to go through a legitimate approval process. And whether it was only about the money or if there are even more sinister things going on, what you can conclude with absolute certainty, is that it was never about saving lives or public health. That in itself is enough reason to be enormously skeptical and not feel comfortable putting my life in the hands of these people.</p>

        <p>Holy fucking based. Finally another kid that isn't buying this crap. I'm 15, which is around your age. I hate this vaccine, the global superstate, the plandemic, etc.. I was forced to take the first jab by my parents, but I did give them a hard time at the very least. (screamed at them and then screamed at their parents for screaming at me for not wanting to get le daddy senpai fauci's genetic engineering therapy) I'm not taking the second, I have had a stiff neck ever since and it has been a long time, and I generally just don't trust anything about this vaccine and believe that it is being used for other purposes, given that it has been shown to be ineffective when judging by the metric of absolute risk reduction, is very dangerous, and that there are other drugs like ivermectin and HCQ that work far better, and not to mention sunlight, water, fresh air, and exercise, which we are all either being discouraged or prevented from doing.</p>
<p>Don't take the vaccine, my fren. There is something seriously up with this. This time, I will really get much more serious if they try to force me to take the second shot. Was thinking about really frightening my parents in a certain way, maybe getting physical, but that's a personal matter.</p>
<p>I was in NYC for about a year, and moved in with in-laws in Canada a couple of months ago because my parents lost their jobs, which was caused by Covid-19 restrictions. (strange how they still love this slavery and act condescendingly towards me and my opinions and seek to impose their will upon me after they have directly suffered extreme consequences from this agenda. what bitches!) So basically, I haven't been able to go to school for 1.5 years, and have been in the tight grip of le wonderful govt.'s fist for a long time. I say this to express that I can empathize with your situation of being forced to do something, and having somebody else's will imposed upon you.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking about short term consequences, think about the long term ones. Whether we win or lose, we, the correct ones, will be able to sleep at night like babies suckling on mother's milk, knowing that we were on the right side of history. Don't give in to tyranny, and if you do end up being forced to take the shot, continue and refuse to comply and conform like I have. (in case you forgot I was forced to take my first shot. jesus christ i feel fucking horrible having done that) You might be judged, screamed at, and ridiculed in the short term, but think about in the future, in a couple of years, the bullet that you <em>might</em> have dodged.</p>
<p>You have invested a lot of effort. (writing a letter to Desantis is super cute) Just keep rebelling. There is no need to be respectful. This is your body. You live in Florida, so I am sure that you are surrounded by a lot of based and redpilled people, that are concerned about your well being and would be willing to defend you, so maybe find some.</p>
<p>This may sound extreme, but google the "Nuremberg Code." You can maybe show this to your parents and also show them the fact that this vaccine is experimental. If this doesn't work, fuck it, call a professional lawyer or somebody who is willing to step up for you. It sounds ridiculous, but I guess that desperate times require desperate measures. I'm not sure I would have the guts to do such a thing though, so I'm not judging you.</p>
<p>Anyways, godspeed. Always think about the long term.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for my potentially shitty grammar. It is very late at night and I am tired and unable to think at an optimum capacity.</p>

        <p>I will try my hardest not to let my parents do it. Thank you for all the advice. I’m trying to think about the long term as you said: if I ever have children with someone else, I don’t ever want to find out I am sterile, or even worse, the children come out horrifically deformed and are forced to live a terrible life being bullied by everyone else all because of a vaccine.</p>
<p>I got physical with one of my grandparents a long time ago over a much different issue then a virus, but I don’t want to talk about that. 
Thank you for telling me about the Nuremberg code, I did look it up. I don’t have much guts but I could try my best to call an lawyer if it gets to that point, but costs could be steep. I just hope the lawyer would be merciful or something.</p>
<p>I called my mom about the vaccine issue between my dad and now she’s pro-vaccine as well because the school I used to go to when I lived with her is now requiring covid shots. (Its a middle school) so now I have no idea what to do. She’s also saying my dad is setting up a trap between me and her to cause fights and division and now she doesn’t want to talk about it with me.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing jumping jacks every day, push ups, trying to do chores physically demanding on me just to oppose this entire covid-state.
If I start screaming at my family first they will start screaming back as well. And my mom can get VERY loud when she’s furious. She used her yelling voice frequently when she was praying (yelling at something in her garage extremely loud) so if she just casually trains her yelling voice on the daily (she prays whenever a thunderstorm happens I think. Thunderstorms happen quite a lot in Florida.) and if she uses her full yelling voice on me full maximum…I think I’d go deaf. </p>
<p>she gets angry very easily, so if I start getting angry at her, she could throw me out just because of pure rage. My family has a streak for anger issues.</p>
<p>In Florida as you said there are a lot of based people but my family for some reason is in the absolute minority. All pro-vaccine. One family member I don’t know his status about (my dads other brother, the author) but I can’t contact him.</p>
<p>My grandparents did make me go to online school the entire 7th grade and it was terrible..it scarred my perception of any jobs involving technology/office jobs. Sitting and staring at a screen for hours per day is just..terrible. I can’t describe it with any other words. I didn’t even learn anything in online school..</p>
<p>Also, do not take the second. If the first made you have a stiff neck, the second could be much worse. You were forced into getting it instead of just willingly getting it, so, at least you didn’t and still don’t support the vaccine. I hope in a year or so people will just forget about the vaccine but that has a 0.1% chance of ever happening and I don’t think the media would let that happen (hysteria and fear earns them monies)</p>

        <p>NO, like every other medical decision, as a minor, your parent can legally consent to it even if you don't want it. (I mean really, what small child ever 'consents' to vaccinations, but they get them. You likely did too when you were younger)</p>

<p>This is coming from someone whose 18 and still a teen. </p>
<p>Remember the peer pressure videos from school? Now is the time to use the information they taught us. </p>
<p>This really may be ugly but honestly just say no- tell them to shove it.</p>

        <p>I remember the peer pressure videos they showed me in elementary. How to always say no when someone offers you alcohol or drugs, even if they were your friends or said you’re dumb cause you didn’t want to. But now people are peer pressuring others into getting vaccines and it’s playin out exactly like those videos..
Thank you for the advice</p>

<p>If not, simply refuse physically and do everything you can to not get it. You can’t untake it, and only you can stop yourself from getting it. What’re they gonna do? Hold you still? </p>
<p>Be creative but don’t be shitty to anyone. </p>
<p>And if you’re a fake post, eat shit.</p>
