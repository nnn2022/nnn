    <strong>If the vaccines turn out to cause problems in the long run, do you think they might use this to hurt Trump or DeSantis' election chances in 2024?</strong>
    <p><p>If you think that is a bit far fetched, it's not. CNN in September 2020 when Trump was still president, said this: https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html</p>
<p>"Past vaccine disasters show why rushing a coronavirus vaccine now would be 'colossally stupid'</p>
<p>After January 20, 2021 (president Biden's inauguration), they completely changed their tune and have begun "fact checking" any concerns about the very new vaccine and censoring any bad side effects (or if they do let the story out, add another pack of lies to it)</p>
<p>CovidVaccinated subreddit is already looking like a support group and its not even a year yet. Imagine by 2023?</p>
<p>If people forgot about CNN's initial stance on the Trump vaccine, then they will definitely forget as well that Democratic Party was the one who pushed it the hardest, and they can then say "see this is why Trump was stupid for rushing the vaccines with operation warp speed!" and reiterate all our talking points about pushing an experimental drug hardcore onto the public.</p></p>
