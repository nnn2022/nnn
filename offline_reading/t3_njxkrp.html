        <p>Yeah this whole thing about me needing to have this crap injected into me to protect some unknown person from a disease I don't have and am unlikely to get, us ridiculous. Every person needs to worry about themselves as far as I'm concerned. Concerned about a killer virus? Take some precautions yourself to protect YOU, and I'll take my own precautions to protect ME.</p>
<p>And the author of this piece really shows us that he's an idiot anyway. He's taken the new definition of herd immunity and run with it... 
Oh, btw.. ANYone who believes you NEED vaccination for herd immunity, is fkn stupid. </p>
<p>Change definitions all ya like. Things mean what things mean, and herd immunity doesn't require a vaccine.. at all...</p>

        <p>Seems to me that resistance to getting a vaccine could increase in a pandemic because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vaccines are rushed through with much less testing than other vaccines, entirely skipping some safety steps and blazing through others quickly. This could be a sensible decision if a smallpox-like illness with similar mortality was sweeping the globe. But for something with a low IFR, a lot of people make the wise decision of risking the illness over the even greater unknowns of a hastily produced vaccine. Vaccinating children with slapped-together vaccines for a disease that is, according to currently available information, very low-risk to them and that they rarely act as carriers for is also very, very concerning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exaggeration of the benefits and downplaying the risks of the rushed vaccine heightens suspicion, as do all the other mistakes the "health experts" have pushed as correct and then had to abandon. That increases more when they don't admit and explain their mistakes and don't make a reasonable attempt to be honest about the things they're unsure of. Everyone makes mistakes, but if someone is setting health policy and they don't really know for sure, they need to SAY they don't know for sure, and leave as much as possible up to the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempts to coerce people will upset a lot of them and make them even more suspicious that something nefarious or at least corrupt is going on. This goes double or triple when officials promise they won't use a particular method of coercion (ex. passports) and then turn around and do what they promised they wouldn't a few months later. I'll add ham-fisted mask policies here too - in the USA, many places refused to honor legitimate medical exemptions, and a lot of people suffered health degradation. Usually mild, but mild harm is still harm. Thought process: "I've been sick on and off for a year and suffering way more than I would with COVID because of their Public Health BS, why should I believe them <em>now</em>?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plain old bad, politically motivated science. Refusal to recognize the role of natural immunity is a big one here. Is the goal <em>immunity</em>, or <em>vaccination</em>? Why aren't people with antibodies or recovery from proven, symptomatic COVID exempted? When the goal is obviously mass vaccination and not mass immunity, the medium- and high-information members of the public are more likely to balk, because that doesn't make health sense and suggests something else is afoot. Even if it's "just" generating more money and business for Big Pharma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing definitions in defiance of common sense and being obviously manipulative. See "herd immunity" and "anti-vax." Natural immunity doesn't count because "mumble mumble reasons mumble SHUT UP"? Someone who supports all vaccines, gets all of them, and strongly encourages other people to get them is "anti-vax" just because they stop short of supporting mandates? Come on. I wasn't born yesterday.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you (you = general "you") act untrustworthy, many people stop trusting you. Can't put images in comments so just imagine there's a Shocked Pikachu JPG here. </p>
<p>The article claims to exempt people with sensible reasons to avoid the COVID vaccines from their definition of anti-vaccination but then proceeds to un-exempt them in more words. It's okay to be skeptical of the novelty, but if you're worried about the danger then you're believing half-truths and exaggeration, if you're worried about corruption you're unnecessarily anti-capitalist, if you don't believe The Approved Science you're anti-science... again, come on.</p>

        <p>This. You hit the nail on the head, great refutation. The entire article just feels like a premediated manipulation piece to me. PURE Propaganda. I dont think anybody can write something like this unwittingly - they must have written this with the active goal to antagonize.</p>

        <p>Its really hard to believe that someone would actually think like this, no? It does not sound like thats their honest opinion, it sounds like they are actively TRYING to push for more authoritarianism and pull out all the stops to manipulate the reader. I dont understand how these people can live with themselves, tbh.</p>
