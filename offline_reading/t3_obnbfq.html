    <strong>Sick Until Proven Healthy and Guilty Until Proven Innocent</strong>
    <p><p>One may have noticed this trend in the last 10 years, that throws out everything that has been taught about our human rights and the justice system in general.</p>
<p>That we are entitled to a trial by our peers before we are found guilty of a crime.</p>
<p>That we have the right to remain silent, as even if we are being honest and guilty of no crime, what we say can incriminate us in some way, or cause us issues.</p>
<p>Here we have the rise of the Court of Public Opinion, and Majority Mob Rule which seems to be determining all of our fates, and with no regards to our rights or freedoms and simply on FEAR and SUSPICION only.</p>
<p>As we have seen through this pandemic, we have turned from a country who must PROVE guilt and PROVE that someone is a danger to society (eg. a court-backed doctor's order), to just assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent, and everyone is sick until proven healthy - and as a result of it, many  many many people have had their rights and liberties and dignities trampled (and even health detriment) due to this attitude - and we don't see it stopping.</p>
<p>Guess what? Bill Cosby was let out of jail.. I guess he wasn't guilty after all.</p>
<p><em>Pennsylvania's highest court threw out Bill Cosby's sexual assault  conviction and released him from prison Wednesday in a stunning reversal  of fortune for the comedian once known as "America's Dad," ruling that  the prosecutor who brought the case was bound by his predecessor's  agreement not to charge Cosby.</em> </p>

<p>I remember in the months leading up to Cosby's trial, almost everyone I knew had decided that Cosby was guilty - only based on public opinion - and not in a court of law.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I make no claims of Cosby's guilt or innocence, just pointing it out as an example</p>
<p>When you assume someone is guilty and assume someone is sick, you are going into dark territory where people can get hurt in one way or another - and you are not living by the ideals of your civil and free society.</p>
<p>I'm amazed at the lack of people fighting for this. People just stand by and let it happen, or even participate in the 'witch hunt' themselves - and feel vindicated in doing so.</p>
<p>Now that health mandates are being lifted in certain areas of Canada, will we continue to see this 'sick until proven healthy' mentality personified by continued Mask and Vax requirements at businesses and employers? How will they continue to justify their reaction when they've been able to point to 'health mandates' and now that they're gone.. still going to consider perfectly healthy people as a threat?</p>
<p>Prove a threat. Prove someone is sick, or it's just Discrimination based on FEAR and SUSPICION, and such attitudes do not belong in our (allegedly) free and civil society.</p></p>
