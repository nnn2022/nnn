    <strong>"You're just scared of medicine".</strong>
    <p><p>Is the new catchphrase for these folks. They've run out of every argument they could come up with and this is their final attempt to be above the people who refused to believe all the hysteria.</p>
<p>This is just one of the new subtle tactics I discovered while being here. It's no more "it's to protect people" or "you're putting others at risk". Nope. It's now "you're just scared of needles, wimp."</p></p>

        <p>I am scared of medicine. I've seen what medicine does to people. 1 pill to mask symptoms, and 4 more to deal with the side effects. Not saying it doesn't have its place, but our healthcare system is totally whacked and all about profits. When my dad died last June, he was on 23 different prescriptions. ðŸ˜³</p>

        <p>Allopathic treatment of disease is rarely as safe and effective as it is made out to be. Sure, there are situations where it works, but people almost never question the risks of taking medicines/undergoing procedures. </p>
<p>They just do what the doctor says, and never question whether or not the doctor is knowledgeable about their specific condition and/or has accepted payments from Pharma companies to push products.</p>
<p>Anyone who blindly trusts "science" and allopathy had best hope that they never get a condition that is not profitable to treat or cure. </p>
<p>If you develop a rare condition, you will quickly have to become your own doctor and learn how to do your own research because oftentimes doctors have nothing to tell you besides "we just don't know what's wrong or how to fix it."</p>
<p>They will repeatedly misdiagnose you, demand that you take medication with risky side effects, and then belittle and dismiss you when you attempt to advocate for yourself. </p>
<p>If the condition is not widespread, simple to diagnose, and profitable to treat, the odds are good that you will be out of luck if you seek help.</p>
<p>The truth is that prevention is almost always better than treatment, and the root cause of a condition needs to be focused on instead of perpetually fighting off symptoms.</p>
<p>Allopathy does not focus on that. It focuses on costly consultations, perpetual medicine regimens, and expensive surgeries/rehabs that do little to fix issues in the long-term. </p>
<p>This focus on treatment of symptoms instead of educating individuals on how to live healthy lifestyles is how America has become so addled with infirmity. </p>
<p>Notice how there has not been any attempt by public health agencies to reduce obesity rates in the US (despite the fact that nearly 80% of serious COVID cases are among the fat population) during this pandemic. It's all "get the vaccine" instead of "get into shape and get healthy." </p>
<p>Allopathic medicine does not care about health, and it does not care about quality of life. It only cares about profit and keeping people as sickly as possible so that they can be perpetually dependent on medication and treatment of their unnecessary conditions.</p>
<p>So to those folks, I would say yes, I am against most types of allopathic medicine. Rarely is it the best method for maintaining health, and one should never put anything into their body without knowing what it could do. </p>
<p>If you do not take agency with regard to your health, you are depending on someone else to do so when you go in for treatment. If you knew how in-bed doctors are with Pharma companies that put profit over health, you wouldn't want to trust them.</p>
