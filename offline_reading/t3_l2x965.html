    <strong>Is life even worth living this stagnant?</strong>
    <p><p>So by now I’ve got a pretty solid daily routine going: I wake up, eat, do my core self care activities (working out, meditating, walking outside, texting friends, journaling, doing research for a book I plan to write, eating, listening to affirmations, practicing computer programming), then go to sleep, then repeat. I might even talk to someone on the street &amp; apply for a job or two. But it all feels so fucking mundane.</p>
<p>I can’t even meet up with people because they’re scared shitless, I feel like I can’t leave my neighbourhood because if I’m caught driving the cops will stop me, &amp; I feel like I can’t do anything to substantially change my life because of my parents, one of whom (my mom) is basically on consistent WFH all the time. For some perspective, I’m in a suburb of Toronto, Canada where draconian lockdown restrictions have just been enacted. Literally everyone I see outside has a mask on. In the past 11 months, I’ve only seen maybe 3 or 4 reasonably attractive girls in the wild.</p>
<p>Just like how I felt in middle school, high school, university, &amp; at work, I feel like I’ve been “capped” in terms of how much my life can grow, &amp; that this is as good as it will get for me. And I fucking hate it. This means no significant money making opportunities, no chances to meet women I click with, no chances to go out &amp; travel... just fucking waking up, coping with the fact that I’m a slave, making the best of my quasi-prison life, then going to sleep, then repeating. And what’s scary is this might be as good as it gets: things r probably going to get a lot worse when I’m inevitably diagnosed with “COVID” &amp; disappeared.</p>
<p>As it is, my whole family has gone full doomer: my dad yelled at me to wash my hands immediately after I touched his cane despite the fact that the cane was in his car the whole time (and his car is clean), my dad tried to make me wear a mask outside while alone walking but I resisted, &amp; everyone comes to my house masked. I have nowhere to run: all the world is going to be like this with Biden taking office. I’m scared. And even if I did run, I would have to quarantine “14 days” (probably indefinitely) if I came back.</p>
<p>Getting a job that pays an adequate amount to live in my dystopian city, let alone anywhere, is goddamn impossible, everyone acts like an aloof, snobbish POS... I can’t take it anymore. What’s the point of living if this is as good as it gets? Is this all my life is meant to be as a slave? And everybody is fucking cheering this on like it’s the best thing ever. If it is, why shouldn’t I kill myself? All that’s around me is ugliness. I hate my life. There’s no chance for me to grow. I want to take action against the bastards who put us in this situation but I see no way to win, let alone significantly change things.</p>
<p>Whenever I really stop to think about my life &amp; prospects for the future I end up thinking suicidal thoughts because I know it’s fucking over for me.</p>
<p>God when will people get it in their head that this isn’t about safety, it’s about control &amp; actually do something fucking tangible about it?</p></p>

        <p>I know what you mean. Life has gone from living to just existing. I have the same exact day every day. Ive missed out on an entire year of social outings, concerts, sporting events, romantic opportunities, the works. Luckily my county is doing "well" and im afforded to go more places than other parts of the country...thanks government. </p>
<p>It really is going to take just mass movements of people to get back to normal at this point. Like entire towns and cities just saying no. However, with the blind faith people have chucked at our "leaders", i just dont know if that will happen.</p>
<p>Edit: Dont give in, thats what people want. They want the world all to be exactly like minded.</p>

        <p>I feel you 100% man. I think we should form a network of sorts - imagine an app where all anti-maskers can unite. And it would notify you when other anti-maskers are in the area, so let's say you're in a convenience store of 10 and the app reflects 4 other people registered on the app are within 50 yards of you - you or them wouldn't feel nearly as afraid if not encouraged to stop wearing the mask with the confidence in numbers.</p>
<p>I don't know, I'm just thinking off the top of my head. </p>
<p>But for the suicidal thoughts trust me I can relate. But you know what? They win then. Sure, the game is rigged in the favor of these scheming globalists. But you only make it easier for them and harder for us when you quit. We have to organize. I think at this point that is our only hope.</p>

        <p>&rt; God when will people get it in their head that this isn’t about safety, it’s about control &amp; actually do something fucking tangible about it?</p>
<p>this is said with love:  So when <strong>are you</strong> going to actually do something fucking tangible about it? You mention university so I'm guessing you are an adult.  Why is it up to "people" to do something?  It's <em>your</em> life that has been taken away.  The doomers are happy eating Chipotle in the basement watching netflix.  The old people are scared spitless to leave their houses. Politicians have their own agendas.  Guess who that leaves?</p>
<p>Government should fix this.  Someone should do something.  That's the thinking that got us here. </p>
<p>I understand it's frustrating.  It's a death of thousand cuts spread over months and months.  It's being nibbled to death by ducks.  So slap on a band-aid, kick the ducks out of the way and live your life.  No one else is going to do it for you.</p>

        <p>It’s difficult when you’re surrounded by spineless idiots. Canadians are literally so weak and pathetic. I am one so I can say this. We don’t have the types of demonstrations like they do in the US over this bullshit, it’s basically like 25 people, and then it’s easy for the brainwashed idiots to ridicule those trying to stand up and even easier to get shut down and fined. </p>
<p>And I get we shouldn’t care what these brain dead fascists think but it’s hard to step out of line if you will without any support.</p>

        <p>Life is definitely worth living. I am nearly in the same situation as you however it seems like you’re keeping yourself more together than me. So honestly if I were you I see your position as a win. </p>
<p>I’m a college student who has just become an empty vessel of sorts. Everyday is the same rinse and repeat for me but I spent my days telling myself I’ll actually do something but then end up sleeping most of it and watching tv mindlessly. My phone time went from maybe 1.5 hours to 5-6 hours a day. I get motivated every now and again and do thing I used to like but for the most part just mope around. </p>
<p>I have had the same thoughts as you and have been trying to cope with it too. </p>
<p>The world definitely seems to be spirally towards insanity in many different ways. I think it’s important that there are people who see the issue on it and if they feel crazy for going against the herd. </p>
<p>Idk really know how Canada is but when this is done you’ll have the experience to shape your life around. Preventative experience for worse things in life I guess to say. </p>
<p>I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore. But I’m in your shoes man and i believe I can make it through and do can you given how much it seems your able to accomplish while having these feelings. Take this time to figure out how to set up the rest of your life. </p>
<p>This post honesty kind of gave me motivation to get better. I wish you the best man.</p>

        <p>It realllly sucks being awake instead of happily ignorant, but I’d rather still have my thoughts instead of being a dumb ass sponge ANY DAY. I try and find reasons that are still worth living like taking care of my dogs and connecting to other people through here knowing there’s still people out there that haven’t lost their minds!</p>

        <p>You’re doing all the right things but I understand nothing can make up for the actual human experience, I’ve realized this as well I’m just trying my best to be super selfish and only care about being really healthy in my own ways while these morons get sick (not from covid) as a result of the same policies and practices that they’ve claimed they’re enacting to protect their health. Then I can laugh at them and that will bring me a lot of enjoyment.</p>

        <p>Any life that still has hope is always worth living. I know it's bleak as hell, but there's still hope for society and there'd definitely hope for one being able to make a better situation for themselves if not (moving into the country, communal NNN living perhaps, etc).</p>
