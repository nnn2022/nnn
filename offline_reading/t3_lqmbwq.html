        <p>It wouldn't be within the interests of the elite to reduce the population, since this would shrink the economy thus decreasing the wealth of the ultra-wealthy whilst increasing wages for the now much smaller workforce. This happened during the Black Death.</p>

        <p>It is in their own words that they want to reduce the population, it is what they say and obsess over.  It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution now, with many jobs becoming automated, most of us won’t be needed anymore.</p>

        <p>They are hoping that the machines won't rise up against them.  I think they hate us ruining their beaches, making the roads busy etc I think they think we are a scourge on the planet.  When the irony is its them who are ruining the planet.  Stanley Johnson and his 6 kids spouting about population control is really fucking disgraceful.  No self-reflection or awareness.  He's going to hell.</p>

        <p>Boris Johnson’s father Stanley Johnson is former World Bank, and his passion is getting the world’s population down. While many may agree on that, the disturbing side is thinking about how it might he done, by what mechanism? Are they willing to sterilize the population and wait for a slow reduction, or will they kill people off faster? One thing for sure, with vaccine passports it is going to be incredibly hard to avoid the vaccine, so it seems unlikely that the vaccine would he there to help us, given the agenda requires reducing our numbers. </p>
<p>Some may find it concerning that in the early stages of the pandemic, 80yo Stanley was playing a secretive role behind the scenes, almost as if a secret group of high-level depopulation enthusiasts knew the pandemic was coming and were ready to orchestrate the agenda.</p>
