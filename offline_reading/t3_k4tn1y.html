<title>I don’t get how you can acknowledge this science (which is proven) while being pro-lockdown. We literally didn’t notice the “deadly” virus for the first four months in the US, where zero social distancing was going on. Probably because it was only killing people who were expected to die soon anyway?</title>

        <p>Yeah this didn't magically just show up in March. We were just told to start panicking in March. Then you create a death event (the infected being put in nursing homes) and its off to the races. </p>

<p>That's the second comment on that thread with 1877 points. This is the level of stupidity we're dealing with people. It's like the Simpson's episode where Lisa needs braces and Homer is having difficulties putting 2 and 2 together that if his company gets rid of his dental plan, he can't afford to get her braces. </p>
<p>They call us stupid. They call us science deniers. These people can't fucking add let alone realize the implications of such a finding. </p>

<p>Didn’t think anything like this would ever get upvoted on a main sub, but it turns out these people are literally too dumb to realize what that means. It makes them <em>more</em> scared somehow. It’s unbelievable.</p>

        <p>Actually some doctors are saying "It had not mutated to become very lethal and troublesome!" back in Summer 2019 when they think now it was first in the United States of America.</p>
<p>Little background: They have exhumed some people who died 'strange' deaths in Summer 2019 in Nevada and New Mexico and found that they had CoVid-19 or a coronavirus very very similar to it.</p>
<p>So this virus was in the United States much earlier than we thought it was without us even noticing for the most part.</p>
<p>I don't understand that honestly... we should have if it was as lethal as it is today to the elderly have realized something bad was going on.</p>

        <p>They are backdating the virus now becasue there are some people doing the math and the math doesn't add up. For their math to work they have to contradict their claims if the high infection rates of COVID to bring those rates down to a less infectious but more virulent one. Therefore, they can then explain the ridiculous claims of how Italy and NYC became the epicenters. I expect the incubation periods for COVID may change in the future too to make the sudden impact also believable. This could also be used to rationalize why COVID didn't sweep Asia like it should have. The "infected" person left Asia, perhaps only infecting one or two people prior and it's been gradually propagating throughout other countries for months without people even knowing becasue it had a much longer than though incubation period until enough of the at risk people began to succumb to what was thought as a sudden onset, but really they had been deteriorating for months becasue of the infection. This again will justify there masks and lockdowns as being infected because of the lower infection rates that they initially suspected therefore the mandates would have greatly reduced further spread....</p>
<p>Honestly they can make some bullshit excuse for anything and just keep changing their story and keep lying to match what we are seeing.</p>

        <p>I heard after COVID started that the flu season was bad, but there's a reason why I only heard that afterward. It was not a reason to panic. There are not millions of sick people and hundreds of thousands of deaths unless you classify every person as sick and every death from multiple categories into one bucket.</p>

<p>gee asshole what gave it away? the five days of fever? the sweats? the night terrors? was it when i woke you up and asked you to tell Jesus to take me to Nana? the loss of taste and smell? the loss of appetite? the week-long chest and head cold after my fever broke? wow smh what a fuckin’ mystery idk what that could have been. </p>
<p>i’m fine now, but it took 4-6 weeks to feel 100% again. i thought it was just a really bad flu. it ripped through my office in December and January. we all joked that we had the plague. strangely enough, we’ve all been back at work in-person, full time, and minimal masks since early June, and NO ONE in my office has been sick since March. it got out of our systems in February. </p>
<p>who the fuck knows really but there’s no way covid-19 wasn’t here last Thanksgiving in 2019 - we all just thought it was a one-off influenza strain. jfc.</p>

        <p>I know a nurse who said back in January, "the flu is weird this year, it's a really bad cough that isn't testing positive for influenza"</p>
<p>I had said cough/flu the previous month, in December (got it from visibly sick Chinese tourists), and spread it to at least 8 people in two states, one of whom did have to go to the hospital for steroids because he couldn't breathe. Plague rat right here lol. Called it.</p>

        <p>"Weeks" when it would be more accurately to say "months". They lie even as they say true things</p>

        <p>That means the chances are very high that I was exposed to it as a tour guide taking hundreds of people around from cruise ships. And it would've been grandmas who gave it to me.</p>

        <p>Because coronavirus has been around as long as the common cold. I doubt those shitty tests differentiate between last year’s coronavirus and this years. </p>
<p>And this article is clearly pro-China propaganda so people can’t blame them and call it the China virus anymore. </p>
<p>God Bless the United States of China!</p>

        <p>There's a research paper from Stanford about how COVID like disease was likely spreading in China months before any announcements. If it was spreading then in China, then it was likely out of the box and spreading globally before any country noticed it. That's why restricted air travel has limited results, things spread and get into your country without realising it.</p>
<p>There's other news articles claiming that it was in several European countries before December.</p>

        <p>I don’t get how you can acknowledge 99.97% of anyone under 40 survives Covid-19, yet somehow still believe it's jusified to keep entire populations locked down.</p>
<p>Indoctrination does strange things to people... especially if you keep repeating the same mantras over and over and throw in enough fear to disable people's capacity for logic.</p>
