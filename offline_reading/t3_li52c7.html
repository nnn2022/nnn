    <strong>This Cycle Has Been Happening For Awhile</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone else noticed that shit like this has been going on since forever? I think it notably got worse in the mid 90s - 00s when the internet gained popularity and the government found new ways to spy on us. The events happening today are the equivalent of another Y2K or 9/11 where the government creates fear to further control the population. For example: The Patriot Act made it mandatory for airports to have extreme security measures (or tools) so they can "fight terrorism". But in most airports, the checkpoints are past the entrance. If this is to keep us "safe", what's gonna stop a terrorist from just walking in before the checkpoints and causing mass destruction in a crowded area. </p>
<p>There will always be risk and the government knows that. They only pass these laws for more power and control. I believe the world is far gone at this point, but I know it's gonna get worse. They are dragging us away from the world as we knew it so they can implement a system that is dangerous for us and beneficial for them. It's about control, it always was, and they have no plans of stopping.</p></p>

        <p>This is perhaps the largest reason that I'm a scofflaw.  I never go out of my to harm anyone, will not steal from anyone or any place, and unless it was totally justifiable I wouldn't kill someone.  But 95% of laws out there can kiss my rebel dick.</p>

        <p>Ever heard of a social score? It‚Äôs a really terrible idea that grades you like a credit score but instead of being able to pay bills etc it‚Äôs about social things.</p>
<p>If you didn‚Äôt support BLM enough, if you didn‚Äôt be inclusive enough or your television show isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, if you‚Äôre not praising the corporate powers, you can be denied certain areas and services. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. I knew this was coming because I always felt like it could be a definite possibility. Setting up the Twitter mob with cancel culture and the idea of doxxing people is the start of it. Doxxing is posting address and real names for those who don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs a cowardly way to get back at someone because it doesn‚Äôt need much other than a computer, some IP grabbing, etc. It‚Äôs something that used to only be used for shaming pedophiles and such, now it‚Äôs used on anyone Twitter hates </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8tX9zjO698 Here‚Äôs a film version of this.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they have systems like this in China right now. Knowing how connections work and who's in bed with who, I know this idea wouldn't just stay over there. This becomes apparent when you see everything that supports a different ideology get banned because it's "dangerous" or "misinformation". They want you to see one thing, hear one thing, and believe one thing. You're not allowed to think freely.</p>

        <p>Absolutely right, every word. Let me add: Internet will turn against us, it's going to be the greatest tool for manipulation and control ever dreamed by any Empire or tyrant. If they manage to pull the economy down, (the information I have suggests that the critical date is around mid-May 2021) if they manage to collapse the economy, it will be when the physical money will be eliminated and the digital one will be presented as the only way to solve this crisis and along with that a global centralized goverment for all the nations. If they achieve this, it will be our end as a free society, definitely the new world order. If nobody does anything, if the people don't fight when the time comes, we will be doomed for real this time, it will be too late. There will be no place to run, we will not be able to protect our loved ones and there will be no safe hole where we can hide.</p>

        <p>Yep, I've seen them replace physical cash slowly over time. It started with the credit cards, then we slowly worked our way into apps on our phones that don't accept cash. These apps are becoming more and more apparent in everyday life, it's really hard for an average person to not use it. They provide necessities such as food, clothes, and other things that one needs to live. When the economy collapses and physical money is replaced, I'm afraid the population will be stupid and follow through with it. If they haven't seen anything wrong with it now, they won't see anything wrong with it in the future because they've been introduced to it already. There may be a few groups such as people like us who will not accept this change, but the government will lock us out of our money simply because we didn't go with the plan.</p>

        <p>If they manage to get the digital ID approved and implemented, all our digital money or cryptocurrency will be linked to it. If a person reveals himself against the new established order, they can simply deny you access to any service, as you stated, basic goods and needs, health care, even block your money or make it disappear, even deny you access to internet. This new digital ID will be like an IP that will be permanent, non-transferable and irreplaceable, something like a social security number or passport number, a fingerprint unique for each individual. They will also know our constant location, our consumption trends, (something similar is happening right now, but this will be even more pronounced and dramatic) they will know precisely where the money comes from and where exactly it goes and why. They will know if we are pro-system or if we show some disagreement... of course they will act accordingly to convince you otherwise. If after all they still don't convince you or make you comply with the new established order, they will nullify you and expel you out of the system, revoke your citizenship and you will become a stateless pariah, on your own, access denied to everything, back to stone age.</p>
<p>I fear for the future of the younger generations, those born when all of this becomes a tangible reality. And believe me I really hope to be wrong and all this will never happen.  but the current events point that way, more clearly every day, it's disheartening.</p>
<p>Btw!, thank you so much for the award.</p>

        <p>Np, dude! You nailed it on the head with these comments. You're right, everything is pointing towards a future where the government will know more things about you than you yourself and they'll have more control over your life. However, it does comfort me to see that there are some people out there that see it for what it is.</p>
