    <strong>Socially Distanced Seders Suck</strong>
    <p><p>Well, boy howdy. Today is the first night of Passover. Traditionally, on this holy feast, Jews gather with their families to eat, drink booze, and stuff their bowels with a clogging cracker known as matzos.</p>
<p>My fiancée wanted to do Passover with her parents this year. I want to win her hand and so I endured it, even to the point of preparing all the food, printing out the hagaddahs, etc.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention her parents are obsessively afraid of Covid19, despite the fact that both of them are vaccinated and both my fiancée and I had Covid months ago and lo, and behold, we survived.</p>
<p>We are in the Deep South. It was 82 outside today. They made us do it out in the garage, six feet apart.</p>
<p>Imagine if you can: sitting in a dank garage trying to rush through the story of The Ten Commandments. Imagine, dear reader, having to swat gadflies away from your wine while you sweat in the Dixian heat, while trying to enjoy a bowl of matzo ball soup. </p>
<p>The coup de grace was my future in laws wearing gloves and bringing their own hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Next year in Jerusalem! (If we're lucky).</p></p>

        <p>Chag Sameach! Ours was a little more normal - but weird stuff like each couple had their own Seder plates, my BIL had to zoom in (he’s vaccinated but actively working with the homeless, his unvaccinated parents don’t trust it which is probably fair).</p>
<p>But ugh, worst of all is just holding my tongue when I want to talk about how our freedoms are being compromised. The family doesn’t see it that way. And I don’t feel free, or feel like celebrating. When we told the story of when Moses decided ‘no, we will leave in the morning’ - their first act of defiance as free people, I wanted to ask how that’s so different from my wanting to reject tyrannical ‘public health’ mandates. We did talk about how when they celebrated in the 40’s, even with all of the horrors going on, some didn’t want to celebrate but others thought that is when it’s the most important: to celebrate as a free person waiting and working to be released from their oppressors. So I guess I’ll try and keep that in mind tomorrow night and hopefully have a better time. xo sorry about the garage lmao that’s horrible!</p>

        <p>I had mentioned this at the Seder.</p>
<p>Your ancestors escaped tyranny from a man who claimed to be god on earth. </p>
<p>Your ancestors attempted to keep the mitzvot of eating matzah even in the shadow of the crematoria of Auschwitz .</p>
<p>But you can't sit inside with your own daughter to eat the Passover because you are afraid of a cold.</p>

        <p>I wish my in laws could handle a conversation like this. Honestly it was the most hypocritical evening I’ve had in a long long time. Sitting there reading about being released from slavery, surrounded by people who have allowed the government to throw chains on them. Who sold their health and the health of their children out for a green passport so they can sit inside a restaurant, or worse, “be like everyone else.” My MIL is the child of a German Auschwitz survivor, yet she puts all her blind trust into the dictatorship of the Israeli government. It’s all so fucking backwards and sick. The Seder was theater, just like the rest, and the Jews in Israel have chosen their slavery this time. So insanely sad.</p>

        <p>If only more Jews on Reddit, especially in the main Judaism subreddit, were ballsy about defying this shit.</p>
<p>Despite a mask mandate that has been lifted and things opening up, our synagogue here in town has just threatened announced to continue doing zoom services. It has been over a year and rabbis still have not done services in real life, bar/bat mitzvahs, and funerals (only with small immediate families). </p>
<p>Imagine getting paid for just doing pre-recorded services and performing brachot over the internet in the most impersonal way.</p>
<p>My fiancée mentioned to the rabbi a few weeks ago that she wasn't planning on renewing her dues. When asked why she said, "Because I'm no longer getting anything out of it."</p>
