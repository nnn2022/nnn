    <strong>The Abuser/Victim Narcissistic Model</strong>
    <p><h1><a href="https://wakingireland.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/how-the-irish-people-were-psychologically-manipulated/">How the Irish were psychologically manipulated by the media</a></h1>
<p>An Irish hypnotherapist describes in detail how people can be programmed. Explaining that what you're seeing with people right now is very similar to someone who is in a narcissistic relationship (where the victim makes excuses for the abuser). The article explains this through the use of a <a href="https://mindsplain.com/narcissistic-personality/">narcissistic model</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakingireland.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/how-the-irish-people-were-psychologically-manipulated/">This article</a> is a long read and cannot simply be skimmed. I had posted this here last week but since then I've edited it more thoroughly, providing additional links to the strengthen the argument.</p>
<p>There is one particular quote from the article here that I want to highlight.</p>
<p>"<strong>The introduction of that confusion leaves you open to further suggestions"</strong></p>
<p>Up until now we have seen very little questioning of the government's actions in mainstream media. However now we are starting to see this opposition appear more and more.</p>
<p>The two examples I've noticed so far.</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-9174105/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-Dont-clean-teeth-save-NHS-look-forward-Covid-Britain-2024.html">Don't Clean your teeth - Save the NHS</a></h1>
<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/xmUhZ2Q6Ddo?t=2711">this video</a> UK column highlights that while although the article is funny, "What the journalist doesn't understand is that this <strong>crazy mixed messaging is part of the psychological attack</strong>". This is discussed in detail in the article linked at the top of this post.</p>
<h1><a href="https://brandnewtube.com/watch/scientists-cast-doubt-over-new-variants-of-covid_5JYZ1uMv6Tp1MNf.html">Sky News - Scientists Cast doubt over new strain of covid</a></h1>
<p><em>"Boris warns that the new Covid strain could be up to 30% more deadly than the original strain, which has raised</em> <strong><em>fears</em></strong> <em>that England's lockdown could go on for longer"</em></p>
<p>Now here comes the confusion...</p>
<p><em>"But top scientists have questioned the Prime Minister's warning, stating that it is too early to draw strong conclusions about increased mortality rates"</em></p>
<p>Which leaves the viewer thinking... "well is it or isn't? I'm confused..."</p>
<h1>Mainstream Media Increasing Confusion</h1>
<p>I'm anticipating that we will see an increasing amount of articles that "challenge the narrative".</p>
<p>You may be thinking "finally! there are some journalists left with some integrity that are brave enough to challenge the government's actions!". But you should be acutely aware of the underlying covert messaging of introducing increasing confusion in the public. </p>
<p>A member of this subreddit might not be confused by such an article but consider the average person who is very fearful of the virus, and what this mixed messaging will do to them... <em>"it leaves them open to further suggestions".</em></p></p>
