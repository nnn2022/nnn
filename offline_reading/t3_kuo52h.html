    <strong>Is there any subreddits to talk about being against lockdowns that aren't filled with conspiracies?</strong>
    <p><p>I find the occasional conspiracy theory fun, but I'd really like a place to discuss being anti-lockdown without all the crazy theories about Bill Gates and 5G towers and vaccines giving people Bell's Palsy. </p>
<p>Not hating on anyone here that believes this stuff, but I've been lurking for a bit, and I don't think this is the community for me, but I would like a similar place that's more grounded in actual facts.</p></p>

        <p>My problem with this sub, is they would only share news articles for quite awhile, and journalists are obviously not good at reporting what is happening and sensationalize everything. They wouldn't share news stories from conservative sources, yet they would share a story from jacobin magazine - a marxist outlet. </p>
<p>They also wouldn't let people post without giving any reason why. It was also very pro-mask for quite some time. I'm glad this sub existed in the beginning, but it has its issues.</p>

<p>It's more moderated, trying to make sure they aren't banned so they won't discuss some topics, but it's a really positive, supportive, and functional place.</p>

        <p>If you want actual facts, good luck. I'm American, so in the beginning I would go to CDC and look at the numbers of deaths vs. population, hospitalizations, etc. I don't bother anymore, because there's no point. I know how journalists and politicians have been inflating things for months. </p>
<p>If you're looking for discussion, this sub can become black and white and lack nuance. I wouldn't recommend r/lockdownskepticism as your main source - I posted my issues with them in another comment - but basically, they were pro-mask for quite awhile and wouldn't let people post without giving any reason why. They also would only share news stories from left leaning sources. I'm an independent, but I have a problem with the assumption that only left leaning news is correct. It's worth going on there, as another source, but I wouldn't make it the only one I use. </p>
<p>I haven't found many other subs. The libertarian ones are generally anti-lockdown. r/conservative is mostly anti-lockdown, but it is partisan. </p>
<p>It would be nice if people posted high quality content here. There are quite a few good posts, but there are some that are lacking. I'm very glad this sub exists, and allows people an outlet, even if some people are a little on the conspiracy side.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the subjects go hand in hand. We don't  talk about this stuff for entertainment as in "I love a good conspiracy".  This is how it is if you are willing to be honest about it, and you know info that's led us to this point.</p>

        <p>No, being anti-lockdown involves disbelieving the overwhelming majority of doctors, scientists, and basic germ theory. You don't get communities solely based on disbelieving large amounts of evidence without it devolving into conspiracies.</p>
