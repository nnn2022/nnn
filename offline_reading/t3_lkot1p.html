        <p>And most importantly, wearing a freaking mask just because a virus is out there is not sane. That amount of paranoia is just plain unhealthy and a mental condition, and people act so surprised at the "audacity" that a few people don't want to pander to their mental condition.</p>

        <p>Yep, a security blanket. If I hide under the covers, the monsters can't get me! If I wear this mask, the virus can't get me! And yes, I know the whole "It doesn't protect me, it protects you, so I'm doing you a favor!" crap, but there are some idiots who actually do believe it protects the wearer. And I can't stand the "you don't have a right not to wear a mask" like no, I have the right to wear whatever the hell I want, your fear doesn't change that. How about this? You don't have the right to make other people change against their will to make you feel better. I really don't get the people calling anti-maskers conspiracy theorists or babies. Being antimask is just the same to me as antihazmat suit; it's anti insanity. And we're the babies? They're the ones so scared of a virus they think they get to tell us what to do. It was just as crazy before people were trying to enforce it, and even crazier now. I mean, in March and April, whenever I'd see someone with a face diaper, I had to force myself not to laugh, and I still do. It's just silly.</p>

        <p>Ugh, the comments. One of the top comments literally said something along the lines of "No one is forcing you to wear a mask, you just can't go on public premises without one" As if there's a fucking difference and as if to say I guess if you don't want to comply to wearing this pathetic thing on your face, you must not want to be a part of society bad enough.</p>

        <p>Not THIS society anyway. Honestly, it's like when parents tell kids "I'm not forcing you to clean your plate, but if you don't, I won't let you leave the table." And then acting like "I guess you don't want to leave the table bad enough since you didn't clean your plate!" as if the child physically must clean their plate to leave because of some force field and not the parent who is acting like they're not the ones who caused it in the first place.</p>

        <p>What a bad troll... You know who did die from hypothermia that guy in Montreal that was kicked out of the homeless shelter because it closed at 9 by force of the bylaw and health officials.</p>
<p>This is honestly such an illogical comparison I struggle to find the words to explain it, people, 50 and under have more of a chance of dying from choking on food than a covid infection</p>

<p>Whereas hypothermia can be deadly for all ages, The way you are comparing these stats is horrible you're comparing the number of people that end up dying from hypothermia to the number of people that end up dying from covid trying to disprove the fact that the recovery rate is astounding which it is...</p>
<p>The difference is the rate for hypothermia is that low because 99% of people won't run into a situation where they get that cold in their life whereas a lot of people have had a covid infection and did not even know it...</p>

        <p>Well you can also feel a mask working. When you say it’s hard to breathe, then that’s the mask working. It’s an illusion. The mask filters out a bunch of the particulates, while allowing the oxygen in. You breath less air, but the same amount of oxygen.</p>

        <p>Still you. Don't try and tell me maskers don't act like lunatics if they see someone without a face diaper. Most people who don't agree with this crap are pretty calm, and I can even understand why they wouldn't be sometimes because this is just silliness and being forced to wear something ridiculous because you want me to is just wrong. But you people on the other hand, "Oh my God, one person without a mask, oh the audacity, they're killing me and my grandma, I hope they get covid and die, they're the lowest of the low, waaaaah!" Get a life.</p>

<p>Covid’s official survival rate (~ 97%) is only among confirmed cases. (Calculation: survivors / cases = survival rate). But there are millions of people that have gotten covid, didn’t show symptoms, and didn’t go get a test. Cases are undercounted, so Covid’s “true” survival rate is higher. I believe probably above 99%. </p>
<p>The hypothermia survival rate calculation would be the same. Survivors / cases = survival rate. How do you define a case of hypothermia? How accurate is the data? I don’t have time to google those. But I can tell you that walking outside with a jacket doesn’t make you a case of hypothermia.</p>
