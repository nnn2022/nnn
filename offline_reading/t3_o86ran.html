        <p>Fucking-A! When this shit first started, I had, what I felt was, a healthy fear of this thing. I thought we'd see an absolute massacre in SF and LA (I'm in the SF Bay Area and see the homeless everywhere) in the tent cities.</p>
<p>When that didn't happen, a piece of that fear dropped.</p>
<p>When I heard of more and more people surviving the plague, another piece of that fear dropped.</p>
<p>When Trump got it (Trump being overweight and old) and survived just fine, another piece of that fear dropped.</p>
<p>When I saw TX and FL open up and see no major spikes, another piece of that fear dropped.</p>
<p>Basically, as I watched this "extinction level event" fizzle out into being nothing more than a regular flu season, I knew it was all bullshit.</p>

        <p>People need to understand that those who control the money of the world think they are superior, the same way the pharaos did, the same way kings and queens did.</p>
<p>FFS we have some rich or famous people doing it, now imagine someone who lost the concept of money given the amount their family possess...</p>
