        <p>Here's the problem with the idea of wearing a mask to keep "someone else" safe.</p>
<p>What you are doing is capitulating your rights to someone else's fears, which are unquantifiable and immeasurable.  That goalpost can shift at any time and for any reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we institute the idea that your rights can be taken away because someone else is afraid, then anyone, at any time, can, upon the precedent of knowing they are able to do so, control you with the idea that if they are afraid, you must cease and desist from about <em>anything</em> because of it.</p>
<p>That is why individual liberty must be preserved.  So that someone else's feelings can't move the baseline away from the freedoms that everyone else has.  If you can do that, the next precedent you set is that exemptions can be made for YOUR freedoms, too.  </p>
<p>And yes, that allows jerks to run rampant, but that's the problem with rights.  </p>
<p>Rights are for everyone, including people we don't like.</p>
<p>So when you say, "you don't have the right to get me sick", you are correct.  What that does not and should not imply, however, is that you have now commandeered the space for yourself and anyone you see unfit should follow your rules.  </p>
<p>Private businesses, sure.  </p>
<p>Some random Karen that's not a representative of that property?  No.</p>
<p>Thus, individual liberty.  You control yourself.  Do not presume that you can control the whole rest of the world because you've decided you have the high ground.</p>

        <p>Yeah, there's a pretty elegant solution here. It's called property rights. If you want to require that all visitors to your home wear a mask, go for it. If you want to shop only at stores that require masks (of their own volition, not because of government coercion), then feel free to do so.  Meanwhile, I can choose to patronize only businesses and venues that don't impose such a requirement.</p>

        <p>Sadly, that is becoming less of an option in states with the mask mandates now which affects every business in those states. The gov's of these states are basically just issuing mandates and restrictions based off what "safety measures" CDC or Dr. Fauci are suggesting, without any democratic process of these policies going through the state legislator, essentially what I think is giving the CDC or Dr. Fauci power over those peoples' lives.</p>

        <p>So what happens when every business bands together to force people to wear masks, even to buy food? Or collectively decides to ban or censor people from their privately-owned public commons, denying people the right to free speech?</p>
<p>We've seen clearly that businesses will willingly collaborate with tyrannical governments to oppress entire populations. That shit can't be allowed. We have the right to regulate businesses and this shit most certainly should be illegal.</p>

<p>I have to say that I'm lucky in that I have a grocery delivery service that has been bang-on reliable this whole time.</p>
<p>However, I know people aren't that lucky.</p>
<p>That said, my strategy for places like that are writing the management directly and saying that you'll be looking for businesses that deliver.  Feel free to even use the bigger names that are their direct competition and are seriously threatening to put them out of business.</p>

        <p>Our rights are not to be infringed upon unless we are convicted of a crime. With COVID-19, our rights are removed not by evidence, but by association. Because some other people who live in my general area have a disease that might kill someone, my rights and the rights of my neighbors are infringed upon. </p>
<p>This is like denying me the ability to drive because I could have a stroke and die behind the wheel and endanger others. I have no history of stroke, but since there's a statistical possibility, it would be safer for others if I didn't drive.</p>

        <p>Indeed.  I have told people demanding that I wear a mask means you assume that I have CV.  If you can prove it, feel free; I can't imagine that any street-corner Karen has a reliable CV test, so I'm not sure I'd trust the result, but the point remains: it's not a good place that society is in when you can just demand people capitulate on the presumption that they may - whether or not they themselves are aware of it - spread a virus when at no point in human history have we ever tried to enforce such a set of rules to prevent this.  </p>
<p>Because - and here's the logical conclusion, not an absurd one - we all have the potential to harbor germs of all kinds at all times.  Therefore, it sets a precedent for wearing masks at all times.</p>
<p>And I've said it before, I'll say it again: your medical condition is and always will be <em>nobody else's business.</em>  We've (the US) passed laws regarding that you can't just walk up to someone and demand they tell you about their medical conditions for no reason.  So self-righteous douchecanoes are curbed from appointing themselves the local hall monitor.  As it should be.</p>

        <p>that's a fantastic example of the slippery slope fallacy lol. Wearing a mask is the most minor of inconveniences. If you think your slight discomfort at wearing one is more important than the potential health of other people, you have a very twisted notion of liberty. Sometimes I'm in a hurry and don't want to stop at a traffic light but I still do it because even if it's unlikely that I hurt anyone, there's no reason to take that chance. boohoo muh freedom</p>

        <p>We’re in a health crisis and all you’re being asked to do is wear a mask when you go outside until this subsides. It’s kind of insane that I even have to spell this out but you do realize that all societies have tons of rules right? What is brainwashing you into thinking this one is so egregious? If you really think this is even remotely comparable to the policies like the forced registration and ghettoization of particular ethnic groups in the 30s then you’re insane.</p>

        <p>Lol no they don’t care. The people who need to hear this don’t like their own country. They want everything to fall apart just so they can say “see? America BAD” just because the government won’t “save lives” by shutting everything down again and giving everyone UBI. They are just as selfish as they claim we are.</p>

<p>If you read about the "microchips" that Gates is involved with, you will understand the intent is for the third world where medical records are largely nonexistent and/or inaccurate.  The "microchip" (nano dot tattoo, not powered), allows clinicians in third world countries to not accidentally twice-dose a vaccine or discover allergies in an unconscious patient.  </p>

        <p>I’m dubious about it honestly. And Walmart has started only allowing cards at selfcheck out. The they will only open 2 registers for the cash ppl. Which is quite a few. And they serve the ppl w big carts that can’t do self checkout. So even if I have 4 gallons of water and that’s it I have to stand in line for 30 mins to pay for it bc I use cash. In fact right now I CANT use a card bc my card got hacked and I had to deal with a bunch of shit and my new card isn’t here yet. </p>
<p>That Walmart I’m talking about is the largest Walmart in a 50 mile radius. For a while it was the largest in the country. And they open 2 lanes, 3 if they’re feeling squirrelly I guess. It feels like there punishing ppl for not using their cards honestly. </p>
<p>A cashless society is the WORST idea and I can’t believe ppl are getting behind it.</p>
<p>They claim it’s bc they shut down the mints bc of coronavirus. I’m dubious that they had to do that. Considering plenty of important places stayed open and I would consider the fucking US mint as important. I feel like this is purposeful, whether cashless is the goal or not, the shutting down of the mints was purposeful.</p>

        <p>It’s problematic for a number of reasons but one I would imagine the self-righteous, humanitarian grandma savers would be considerate of is the classism implications. How will low income and the homeless pay for anything? How will minimum wage workers at an ice cream shop or pizza shop get tips? Or non profit organizations that put buckets out to collect donations? A lot of people do not have bank accounts. Going cashless will be devastating for so many.</p>

        <p>Yes it will. It really will. Our family could function cashless but we don’t want to. There’s a reason we only use our checking account for direct deposit and to pay bills. I’m sorry, no one but me should be able to say “nah you can’t spend money on that”. </p>
<p>I mean we move cashless, what’s to stop them from putting a hold on your money for any number of reasons? Will bill collectors just be able to take it out of your account without consent? There are just too many probable issues for this to be realistic. </p>
<p>Though anyone who would trust the government and banks to be honest about their “digital” money and what all being cashless includes that are nuts.</p>

        <p>Precisely. </p>
<p>Gates has a long history of doing this. Our politicians are so corrupt that they will accept money in exchange for all manner of abuses against our poorest people. There is a reason they always go to remote poverty stricken areas, and it's not really because they want to help these people. It's also because poor people with no education don't have the ability to fight back when shit goes awry. Some coronavirus vaccine trials are being conducted in the "third world" partly for this reason.</p>

<p>More white imperialism, but this time it's difference it has a liberal face to it. Sure it might start as voluntary but it won't last. Enough slippery slopes have been slid down that there is no chance this doesn't get abused or stay voluntary for long. Might not be a gun to the head but coercion will come into effect.</p>

<p>Not every opinion is equal -- yes, I laugh in the face of people who create scandal and drama around "microchipping".  It's creating division and argument just to argue.  You likely used a cell phone to respond to my post.  Don't pretend like you believe a "microchip" (unpowered nano dot tattoo, no broadcast, can only be read by a device inches from the skin) -- is more invasive and more of a threat to society than your cell phone.
