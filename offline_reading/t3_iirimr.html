<p>Hundreds of coronavirus deniers have gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square to protest against lockdowns and vaccination programmes.</p>
<p>The ‘Unite for Freedom’ rally started at noon and calls for an ‘end to Government lies’ and the restoration of all freedoms. Early images from the demonstration show a sizeable crowd gathered in the square, holding signs warning that coronavirus is a ‘scam’ and a ‘hoax.’</p>
<p>One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled ‘no to mandatory vaccines.’”</p>
<p>Love this last ’damning’ paragraph:</p>
<p>It comes as countries around the world continue to battle with thousands of new infections and deaths a day.“</p></p>

<p>Plenty of MSM talk in recent days about Extinction Rebellion and BLM marches, but somehow little mention until today about the anti-lockdown/ vaccine protests...</p>

        <p>I mean, I am here. To be honest, it's not entirely biased, you had speakers like David Icke and a lot of signs about 5G rubbish, #savethechildren pedophile / 'pizzagate' stuff etc.  David Icke's talk was actually quite good but you know that just him being there automatically associates the whole thing with 'tinfoil hats' in the minds of most people.  The woman hosting it between speakers kept pointing at a nearby 5G mast and saying 'they'll soon turn that on and make us all sick' which I found really cringy but a significant portion of the crowd were cheering.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of really good signs and cool people there though, a nurse in scrubs who I chatted to for a bit, lots of kids, good atmosphere.  Some of the speakers were good.  I guess around 5k people. Just maybe wish we could stick to the main message and not get sidetracked off into the whackier conspiracy theories that are out there that make it even easier for the media to write shit like this about us.  I guess in the end it doesn't matter since they are going to smear you no matter what and no matter for what reason you are against this stuff it's good that people are standing against it.</p>

        <p>It's pretty biased if you look at the construction of the article.</p>
<p>&rt;More than 40,000 people have now died with the virus in UK, but one man’s sign said it was ‘fake science’ and comparable to a ‘bad flu.’</p>
<p>This sentence is one of many, but for instance, is constructed to ridicule the protests and imply they're invalid and foolish. The use of the word "but" shows that the author is concerned with directly refuting the protests, but doesn't examine the claims made by the protester in question - neither discussing what they mean by "fake science", or analysing flu statistics to approach the idea that it's "comparable to a 'bad flu'".</p>
<p>The purpose is simply to mock and undermine.</p>

        <p>It is a rather annoying problem that if people are going to protest the "New Normal", they're going to have to deal with the small minority of actual deniers that will get all the media attention when the great majority are not protesting because they deny there is a problem, but because the "solution" is making things worse.  People mention BLM, and really, BLM is in a similar situation, with the great majority mainly wanting more racial equality in how law enforcement treats them and wanting to protest peacefully, but having to deal with a loud minority being all "defund the police" and looting and rioting getting the media attention and getting in the way of real progress.  There's bad apples in every bunch, and we'll just have to find a way to deal with that.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I am by no means a conspiracy theorist, I am not anti vaccine or believe that the virus is a hoax. I’m just a man who thinks that we are being led by completely incompetent and cowardly governments who have completely overreacted. I’m sure many people feel the same way and want to fight against the restrictions.</p>
<p>However these protest always seem to attract oddballs which is obviously what the media focuses on. It’s frustrating because it detracts from the anti-lockdown message.</p>

<p>Meh. We really need these protests to be bigger, on par with the BLM protests and marches. 5k might seem like a lot of people, but when you compare it to other rallies like the aforementioned BLM ones, it's really not... I wish we had more numbers.</p>
<p>That, and like you wrote, these protests feel like they are run by people who are either trying to shove MAGA or 5G down everyone's throats. It's disappointing, especially given that we are in real danger of having our freedoms and livelihoods stripped away.</p>

        <p>Yea, from what I've seen the ones in Germany have far more people (100k+) and are far more level headed, more focused on government overreach and the covid lies themselves rather than the more out there tinfoil stuff although I'm sure they are there for that as well.  I guess with more people the fringe elements would be drowned out a bit more rather than representing a significant portion of those attending.</p>

        <p>the reality of it is that it gets ZERO attention whatsoever, but the uderlying philosophy for these destructive people IS their idea that "the government" can simply replace anything ad nauseum with zero consequences, because to them its allll made up, the financial institutions they dont understand, the government they dont understand, the businesses theyre destroying that they dont understand.</p>
<p>They are most most conspiracy driven group out there, and it's completely glossed over.  Their core philosophy is an easily disproved conspiracy theory that comes directly from ignorance,but we don't talk about WHY the chosen side does anything.</p>
