        <p>The BBC are are masters at leaving out the salient facts that go against their narrative when they are forced to actually report on something they dont want to but yet again,  more "scientific" evidence that the vaccinated are actually the "variant" factories that they so obviously abhor</p>

        <p>This is also what Geert Vanden Bossche practically insists. If you don't know who that is, check him out here - <a href="https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/">https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/</a>.</p>
<p>In layman's terms, what he claims is that while it is true that more viral replication in non-vaccinated people = higher chance of random mutation, it is the pressure exerted on the virus by vaccinees that selects which mutation will propagate. The takeaway is that it is the mass vaccination campaign in the midst of a pandemic that is driving the emergence of "variants of concern". Check his FAQ section.</p>
<p>Now, I don't have the background nor the knowledge to scrutinize these claims. What I do know, however, is that Vanden Bossche's concerns have been blatantly ignored by the scientific community, and there have been no adequate rebuttals to his statements, only attacks on his person and poor attempts at discrediting him as an expert, with little to no focus on the actual claims he's making. He has also been calling for an open scientific debate on the issue, yet nobody has taken him up on that. Because The Science is settled.</p>

        <p><em>No. He is wrong. The MSM rebuttal said that vax science is god and anyone questioning it, are all stupid. This guy is just a dumb conspiracy hick from Europe with a 2cent PHD in virology</em></p>
<p>Thank you for the url and the layman’s terms, it helps the real hicks (me) have that 10000ft understanding.</p>
