        <p>Hospitals are designed to operate at near max to max capacity. Anything significantly less tanks their financials, as we saw in the spring, and the fallout from that has been messy. I remember 3 years ago I was really sick and had to go to a Nashville ER. There were people everywhere, many in beds in the hallways and a few were being given IVs in a corner of the waiting room that had been turned into a treatment area. Nobody was panicking about capacity, the nurses were just like “yeah it’s always busy in here, this time of year gets a bit nuts” and shrugged and went back to work. I went back around the same time the next year to take a friend and it was exactly the same. This is nothing new or alarming, it’s just how it is.</p>

        <p>Yup. The only difference is they didn't have the media reporting on it 24/7 with a death counter at the bottom of the screen to scare people.</p>

        <p>you can check hospital usage in the usa <a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/">here</a></p>
<p>an icu at 40% is considered 100% 'full', as that is their break even with minimal staffing, every icu has the ability to run at 125% of actual capacity (mandated by law) some can run 150% if staff  can be found</p>
