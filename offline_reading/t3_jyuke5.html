        <p>I really, really hate it when people mockingly say, "MUH FREEDUMBS" to insult people who aren't happy being shut-ins for a year of their lives.</p>
<p>First, mocking someone for being unhappy is an asshole move. Second, since when is "freedom" a bad word?</p>

        <p>I usually say something along the lines of "No, they're your freedoms too. You might miss them sooner or later."</p>
<p>Then they usually say some shit about their "freedom to not get sick".</p>

<p>Oh I love it! LOL</p>
<p>The same people going on about their freedom to not get sick are those who would (pre 2020) happily go about their lives while contagious - going to work, sharing food and drinks, socialising, travelling etc. They didn't care about MY "freedom to not get sick" back then.</p>

        <p>I'm flying, in a plane, on Thanksgiving. Never would I have ever thought that this would be something I need to keep secret, something to be controversial. And here I am, going to hop in a plane and fly across the country! I've been told it's "non-essential"- but if going to see my deployed husband is considered non essential, then there's nothing "essential" in my life.</p>

        <p>Politicians have been saying to assume that everyone you interact with is infected. The demoralizing concept that we are nothing but disease vectors has been getting to me. The fact that we cannot talk to other people unless it’s through a mask is foolish. It’s why I hate the line, “my mask protects you.” Protects you from what? If I’m not showing symptoms, I am not protecting you from anything. We are training society that our mere existence as humans is “dangerous” so we must be “safe” and wear our masks when interacting with each other. And people have embraced this concept and will probably never leave the house again without wearing their trusty face diaper. It boggles my mind how soft our society is.</p>

        <p>It isn't really <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/asymptomatic-spread-revisited/">https://www.aier.org/article/asymptomatic-spread-revisited/</a></p>
<p>Asymptomatic transmission is a hypothesis. The evidence is against it. Public health officials insist it happens cause, why not, it's not like they dislike the power and prestige that comes from having the world revolve around them...but they don't have compelling evidence.   </p>
<p>They also sometimes just outright state that asymptomatic transmission is very rare when they aren't playing politics:</p>

        <p>I am so done with all of it. I am french, we've been in lockdown (again) for nearly a month now et Macron just announced the program of the rest of the festivities. Universities won't open until beginning of february.</p>
<p>I'm so mad. They are using that second lockdown, of which the point and effectiveness should seem suspicious even in the eyes of covid-panicked people (1) to pass outrageous freedom-restricting laws, and now they are telling us that we are going to reopen so slowly that I can't even count on having in-person classes before FEBRUARY ? Are you kidding me ? I knew people like to spit on the young, but come on, you already f*cked our futures for no reason, leave me the few years of fun and studies I have left ! I can't believe it !</p>
<p>I want to do something so bad, but I am so powerless. I don't know. I don't want to "just accept it", because doing so means giving up on my mental health, but what can I do ? Arg.</p>
<p>(1) come on, guys, in the spring it took us a month of lockdown to get to the peak of the wave, and now we got there less than a week after the start of the second lockdown and you believe that stupid measure had anything to do with it ? seriously ! Why cant' people think ! More positively speaking, I am hoping for a beginning of herd immunity, but of what use is it if the people in charge decide to just ignore it and go on with the stupid restrictions ?</p>

        <p>A friend of mine’s husband works in a hospital and she’s resorted to using her FB twice yesterday saying “Please, please take this seriously” and “I’m begging you to do your part.” Her second post she went on for a whole paragraph about how she wants her normal (she is still isolating with two young kids, the kid old enough to be in school goes virtually) and wants to hug her relatives and see her friends for drinks. But then she says “It’s not worth it” because hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and her husband has to come home and change in the cold garage and it has to be sanitized. So now she’s digging in her heels with her “take this seriously” crying, and all our mutual friends are eating it up.</p>
<p>Sorry but if the hospital her husband works at isn’t prepared after eight months of this, why is that MY problem? They had to have known it was coming and all the talk of a second wave. And maybe she should stop acting like she’s such a victim when she works from home and has a nice house. I know other people that work in healthcare facilities (including two in nursing homes) and they have reasonably normal lives outside of work while taking precautions. So do their spouses, if applicable. I don’t get the crying and foot stomping here.</p>

        <p>Most of the people I know in nursing or doctors are doing the same, on social media, then I see them out at the bar, restaurant or sporting events. There was even a big paper insert and news item they did all signing on to stay home. I scanned for names I knew, found some, check social media, they are out and about.</p>

        <p>I've been banned for a week from r/lockdownskepticism for mildly pointing out that these measures are no longer about public health, but about an economic reset and an opportunity for governments to remake the world in their image.  This is apparently a "conspiracy theory" that I pulled straight from the mouths of the highest level politicians in the western world.</p>

<p>I believe if they allow pro-Trump posts, or if they allow deep-state-awareness posts, they'd be banned themselves. I am not pro-Trump because I am not American, but I was banned because my words were interpreted as pro-Trump.</p>
<p>Just like in Soviet Russia, you can critique the government within acceptable limits, like 'agricultural policy needs improvement', but don't go full on 'Communism bad' because they'll shut down you and your platform and even your family will have troubles.</p>

        <p>Some ICU nurse on Facebook just got on me for choosing to go to Thanksgiving and bragged that she’ll have job security thanks to “selfish and self entitled choices” people continue to make. She doesn’t even live in the same state as me, yet she expects me to not have Thanksgiving hundreds of miles away from her and her hospital. Also, not even any of my family is coming up from her state. So how am I impacting her? On the very off chance someone from my family in PA sees someone who lives in or will travel to NC and end up on her ICU floor because they got sick from someone who lives in PA? And if that’s what she thinks of her patients maybe she shouldn’t be a nurse.</p>

        <p>I would say this explains how things got so bad in the first place. Anybody born after, say, 2000, has spent a great deal of their childhood glued to digital devices, mediating all their human relationships. A lot of these kids can't even look somebody in the eyes. They look to the devices for all their human needs, and when those who control the vast majority of centralized sources (traditional media, youtube, reddit, etc) declare reality to be a certain way, well, these from-the-cradle consumers don't have any basis for rejecting or even challenging that information. As /u/Throwawayact69420 said, these faceless global institutions are surrogate parents, family, and neighborhood to all of these so-called "digital citizens" (digitally mediated, alienated souls). Notice how many of these people have crippling anxiety and depression? The world they were born into is deeply dysfunctional and driving them all crazy.</p>
<p>On the other end of the age spectrum, you have all the boomers+ who have always looked to television and newspapers for guidance, and they certainly aren't going to stop now. My parents have lived through decades of vanilla flu (which has killed off plenty of old people they used to know, including my grandmother), but they see no problem imagining it all just went away overnight, and EVERY malady that a person can get sick with in 2020 is COVID-19 AND NOTHING ELSE.</p>
<p>Those two age groups combined are the ones driving the hysteria hardest, IMO. Real world civil liberties mean absolutely nothing to the youth, their world is social media. And the elderly, well, TV long ago perfected the art of control through fear, so their assent to technocratic tyranny is a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>I wish SNL would remake this, but with COVID instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Gh_IcK8UM</p>

I know NOBODY who died of the virus...the few I know who apparently caught it are all in terrible health yet survived without even needing to be hospitalised.

        <p>ShoveUrMaskUpUrArse - 1) I LOVE YOUR HANDLE lol and 2). We just forced ourselves to listen to our government tell us that “yes oh dear it’s sad people are killing themselves because of the isolation...but oh by the way for your own good we’re locking you down for another 3 weeks!”  What...the...holy...hell...is going on here?  I was so mad I had to shut the tv off.  It’s garbage and the way they set it up here makes no sense - no one allowed in your house (if it’s family) - oh home based businesses can have 1 customer - oh you can have your child care employee in as well but nope nope nope (finger wagging here) absolutely no family....I am exceedingly confused about the logic that went into that...perhaps I should sit down and drink until it makes sense....just kidding...maybe🤦‍♀️</p>

        <p>Anyone else couldn't be bothered even trying to make new friends? I just kinda ghosted someone because I didn't have the mental energy to deal with interaction anymore. Socialising has become a chore when you don't know if the other person will be a pro-lockdowner, whether you can ask them to go somewhere with you (maybe they're too afraid, maybe there aren't even any places to go without restrictions, etc), I'm just done with people for a while.</p>

        <p>Outside of school or work those people can be a real bummer. I mean what's the point of knowing someone who stays home all day and lives on the internet/games/netflix. It's a huge problem with my generation, nobody wants to have a real conversation anymore, everyone's glued to a smartphone. I find it ironic that people in my generation complain about these anti social "ghosting" behaviours when they're the selfish pricks prepetuating them (and btw these are the same people obsessed with covid fetish).</p>

        <p>There was a post on /r/ContagiousLaughter  about a daughter visiting her mom from University. The majority of the comments were calling the girl selfish for visiting. I’ve been on Reddit for a while but COVID has kinda made me realize how much of an echo chamber it is. It makes me want to just stop viewing the popular subreddits completely.

        <p>I just wanted to say thank you for the existence of this subreddit. My mental health has taken a toll because of the widespread hysteria and I bought into it until yesterday. I was going to avoid Thanksgiving, and I ranted about it on another subreddit, supposedly for "support", and was silenced by their moderators.</p>
<p>So I thought wow, <em>nobody</em> is willing to listen to my fears, and I'm just going to stay home, likely self-medicate with xanax and alcohol because I've been avoiding my family, my relationship has been rough because I was afraid of this stupid virus.</p>
<p>But once I was silenced in that subreddit, it clicked in my head that I'm no longer willing to destroy what I had with my family over a virus and widespread hysteria, an insanely low mortality rate.</p>
<p>I'm not dismissing the virus as a hoax, it still concerns me but I really need to let go of this constant fear that was keeping me away from them. To reiterate, my mental health is on the decline to the point where I'm popping pills every hour, thinking it would be easier to take my own life because "my family won't listen to me about how dangerous this is!"</p>
<p>You know what, I showered, I ironed my dress clothes, shined my shoes and I went to be with my family on Thanksgiving and I had a wonderful time despite feeling awkward at first.</p>
<p>All this time I've been thinking, "everyone is brainwashed by Trump! they don't realize how serious this is!" when I was the one being bamboozled.</p>
<p>None of my family is going to die. I'm not going to die. And I feel alright again because I've missed them. Family is all I personally have right now, battling mental illness and addiction. They've been there for me and I've sat there and criticized them over overblown scare tactics that I fell for MYSELF.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean I have to agree with their politics or their core values, I am a son, a brother, an uncle, and I'm not going to let this virus create a major rift in my family because I need them and when I'm recovered, maybe they'll need me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I bought into the widespread panic. I wear my mask, I wash my hands, sanitize, and if I go out, I'll act as if I have the virus around the others, but my moment of clarity has lifted so much anxiety that I cried after Thanksgiving, I cried from relief because I was laughing with my family for the first time in a while. And there were way more than 10 people, and all of them showed me warmth, kindness, and that they haven't forgotten about my recovery.</p>
<p>I'm DONE with the constant panic and being afraid and now someone was kind enough to point me in the direction of this subreddit because I want to see the other side of this thing.</p>
<p>P.s. I would never criticize anyone who is still super worried about it, there were a lot of great people in the previous subreddit I was in, and I know all of our situations are so different, and it's easy to become afraid, and people are dying. I felt that yesterday. But I don't know if I would have survived the struggle with mental illness or addiction alone. ALONE. I need my family and I'll not be deprived of their support because I thought I knew everything.</p>
<p>I hope you guys will take me in here. Screw the "new normal"! Who wants to see Rammstein in NYC with me when the "new normal" is back to "normal" and this is a thing of the past? I will buy you a ticket!!!</p>
<p><strong>And fuck Fauci. Fuck Cuomo.</strong></p>

        <p>I find myself on this thread more and more frequently. As this year comes to a close, the anger and anxiety grows, with both hope and fear for the new year. I knew 2020 would be a major turning point. The numbers just add up far too well. There is no going back to the "old normal" because a "new normal" is both necessary and inevitable. That said, it mustn't be the new normal our corrupt elites desire. It must be of our own creation as individuals, families, local communities. This is the way the wheel turns. I only hope we all find our people and our places soon enough, whatever that means for each of us.</p>

        <p>It got too big. Whenever a community gets too big, it implodes into a cesspool of collectivism, contrarianism, and behavioral sink. You can see a microcosm of the same phenomenon in some of the bigger subs. Hopefully that doesn't happen here, but you can already kinda see the different factions developing.</p>

        <p>That's not how history works. You can never go back, only forward, applying what you've learned from the past to the present and future. Just as we didn't go back to the "old normal" after 9/11, all we can do is either decide our "new normal" for ourselves or let it be decided for us.</p>

I'm currently in an argument with several people on my neighborhood Facebook page who are freaking out because people go to the playground without masks. I know I should just ignore it but it is so hard to and if I stay silent, then their bullying wins.

        <p>Too many of those Facebook groups, are dominated by 'Karen' types. As much as I badly wish I could sway those people away from doomerism, I fear swaying at least some of them ever over to our side is probably a lost cause. If even the media looking the over way over George Floyd and BLM protests didn't make them wake up, and ditto with the related hypocrisy of such groups over other things(like those protests are okay, but not say individuals wanting to attend an in person church service, WTF?), nothing will.</p>
<p>Since last I checked, weren't traditional liberals supposed to respect everyone's differences, regardless if say you're an athiest or someone who is into ____ religion? (regardless if it's something Christian, or something else like Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikh, B'ahai, etc)</p>

        <p>So I like to make it a point whenever I'm in casual conversation to say something to the effect of "yeah, when things get back to normal I'm going to X concert or taking a Y trip, etc." It's amazing to me how many people say "I don't think we'll ever get back to normal!"

        <p>Depression and hopelessness.</p>
<p>As much as I don't want to sound like a doomer myself, it really does feel like we'll never return to normal. I'm in NJ, where we re-entered a second lockdown last week. So many times, it was said this would be over after a certain period (June, July 4th, summer, Labor Day, etc). It's too much to ask people to hold on to hope when it seems like there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>It's the same reason I grew to hate the phrase "it gets better" during my teens. When things only continue to get worse, "it gets better" is as overused as "I'm sorry". It means nothing.</p>

        <p>They shut down the restaurant where I work AGAIN. Someone tested positive for covid.
I need to find a new job - probably a convenience store. They seem to be more stable employment than most places right now.</p>

        <p>A convenience store, grocery store, gas station..hell, even target or Walmart. I would look for jobs at places that have been opened this entire time because they are probably at less risk of shutting down. Good luck!</p>

        <p>I’m just sad because I feel like I can’t help but distance from all my friends who aren’t questioning a single thing or even up for friendly conversations about it. I just want them to see what’s really going on and nobody’s concerned????? I don’t know if I can be friends with people who won’t think for themselves at a time like this? </p>
<p>What I’ve noticed is everyone just really wants another stimulus, they want their work to shut down so they can get a break, they hope their work limits its hours. Everyone is screaming “it’s not about you! Don’t be selfish!” But they’re being selfish. </p>
<p>I just flew to see my sister who also thinks it’s all bull shit and I made sure everyone knew I was flying- I won’t accept that it’s a secret or non essential to see my only family member, literally. I was half hoping someone would call me out on it. DIA was PACKED and I felt like people were nicer than ever- maybe because those of us flying aren’t as fearful? </p>
<p>Sadly my flight back from Seattle had a woman being yelled at by the flight attendant about her mask slipping below her nose and you couldn’t get a drop of booze in the entire SEA TAC airport. Everything was caution taped off. Like I can’t even get some seafood before my flight to go to eat by myself in the corner? Instead we all had to stand in mile long lines next to each other for a bag of chips from the magazine shop? </p>
<p>I live in a college town in CO and I feel grateful that masks aren’t required on trails and in parks like some cities here- for now... but there’s just something SO wrong about walking my dog on a LARGE park sidewalk and a runner covers her mouth with her hand as she runs by me..... it’s just not logical. </p>
<p>Even when our town loosened restrictions and we were allowed to sit in bars as long as they served food, 6ft, limited capacity etc. I feel like all of my friends have just been completely shut in, glued to their phones/TVs and believing every word of meme propaganda they see..... saying they’re too worried. It’s been 9 months? How are we justifying being this scared for this long????? I did have one friend come out to the busiest bar in town one night (masks required when not at table, party of no more than 4-6), etc) and then he continued to talk shit the entire time about how wrong it was to be out in crowds..... </p>
<p>I give up</p>

        <p>I'm starting to wonder if I'm trapped in some kind of actual apocalyptic scenario. The world seems to be undergoing a global psychotic split, some kind of rapid and psychologically violent "cultural mitosis", tearing humans apart even from their friends, family, neighbors, society. A lot of people were already highly divided on the subject of the US president - but this whole COVID event is on another level entirely, in terms of the everyday, real-world ramifications. I could agree not to talk about politics with somebody on the other side of the fence, but now with all this going on? There is no escape from confronting the issue with other people nearly every day, online and off.</p>
<p>And it really fucking sucks. I really hope there's some light at the end of this tunnel. Would it be too much to ask for a new kind of political system that doesn't require people to force their will onto others? Wasn't that the whole ideal of the systems we had, however imperfectly they approximated it? Can we please go MORE in that direction, and less in this fucking textbook dystopian direction?</p>

<p>Yeah, and I guess it's a result of a combination of two things: 1) people taking a large % of their information from screens, 2) the oligarchic elites intensely exploiting that with an aid of teams of psycho-manipulation specialists.</p>
<p><em>I really hope there's some light at the end of this tunnel.</em></p>
<p>Let's hope this crashes by its weight before the oligarchs ruin our lives completely. </p>
<p><em>Would it be too much to ask for a new kind of political system that doesn't require people to force their will onto others?</em></p>
<p>That's on other people's minds, too: mine, and recently Michael Krieger @LibertyBlitz tweeted that he often thinks about it.  A few decades ago, John Holt briefly discussed the idea in "Escape From Childhood."  And given that the UN-style world order is deeply discredited, let's hope that when it crumbles we / the survivors manage to assert this vision.</p>

        <p>I was traveling on the 2 train in NYC. First experience with a "doomer" outside of the internet.</p>
<p>Lady starts harassing another woman about her mask because it was under her nose (so were many other people's; don't know why she chose to pick on this particular woman). A guy who came on the train saw what was happening and I guess decided to mess with doomer lady. Train was packed, so he held onto the pole near her with no mask. Lady went crazy, yelling about how he's endangering everyone (yeah, no one else really cared). Guy then takes out what is clearly not a mask (though I'm unsure what it was), and puts it over his face. Lady yells that's not a mask, but everyone else who can see is laughing and enjoying the show (me included). Guy got off at the next stop.</p>
<p>I tested negative twice for the virus. For all that lady knew, that guy was negative too. It really is more sad than funny. It's simply proof people have been taught over the last several months they must fear everyone around them.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the question of why, if she's so scared, she's on a packed subway train to begin with. I pass the police often when I go through Port Authority and have never been stopped for not wearing a mask.</p>

<p>The funny part is she will never, ever think about that to the depth required to make a discovery. If the people on TV say a mask is all you need, then by golly she's safe. But even a moment's reflection on being stuck in a confined air space with a bunch of strangers, who are only loosely complying, touching their masks and faces all the time, breathing jets out the sides of their mask, etc - would be enough to realize it's all theater and completely hopeless for stopping any pathogen whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I'm seeing so many depressing posts on social media this week. People feel like all of the happiness has been zapped from them and they can't see their family because the government told them not to. What is even more depressing is that those miserable people will turn around and blame the one "Karen" they saw at Walmart with her mask under her nose. </p>
<p>My state has "tightened up" their mask restrictions (basically now you have to wear a mask at the gym and wear one outside). I cancelled my gym membership and I refuse to wear a mask outside so it doesn't necessarily affect me. But it's still depressing as hell.</p>

        <p>Where you live, is the order to just wear a mask, or to wear a mask when social distancing is not possible? If it is the latter, i would bring that to the attention of anyone giving you issue. Outside smoking is a lot easier to maintain the social distance.</p>
<p>In fact, this is also a good response to the "mask-hole" people out there, if you see me w/o mask, just stay 6ft (2m) away and don't start a convo with me.</p>

        <p>This stupid safetyism is spreading to the rest of healthcare now. I am connected basically 24/7 to certain medical devices. Recently, there was a "safety concern" raised for one of these devices, which meant that people are unable to get any new ones for an unknown time period until the issue is resolved. Only problem is, the "safety concern" is an extremely minor problem that has existed for at least a year, and has NO impact on the functionality of the device. Some stupid government busybody had nothing better to do than raise this pointless complaint, meaning that hundreds (or more) of us who use the device have gone through a lot of anxiety over this non-issue.</p>
<p>We cannot allow the culture of safetyism to spread any further into medicine.</p>

        <p>It’s pathetic how people mock the elderly for not wanting to wear a mask. A couple weeks ago my mom forgot her mask for the store so she just hid in plain sight hoping they wouldn’t notice. Everyone in the store was mocking her and it was really sad to see in humanity. I guess the new motto is Respect The Elderly only if they are wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>The mocking in general has been terrible. I think it's a consequence of all the memes over recent years...making fun of flat earthers, anti-vaxxers etc has primed people's brains for mocking anybody different to them. These people should be ashamed of themselves. Making fun of someone because they wanted to leave their house and go to the grocery store...it's psychopathic.</p>

<p>Haven't been around lately. Been very busy with work and other items I won't get into right now. My area is still stable. Still not masking (and never will).</p>
<p>Went to vote without mask and it went great also. No problems at all. </p>
<p>My area is becoming more and more laid back when it comes to all of this. People are tired of it. My area was never strict to begin with but most here have had enough of the drama now. It's mostly back to normal here everywhere but then again we never strayed too far from normal anyway haha.</p>

        <p>As a dev, I am totally fine competing against the whole India. My expertise is very niche. In fact, even before COVID nothing really prevented my boss from firing me and replacing me with an indian contractor. We had and still have indian contractors working for us and we get along well. Indian devs who can do what I do are not cheaper than me, especially if you account for the hassle of cross-border paycheques. </p>
<p>If I was a teacher, I'd be scared of this online learning trend. One thing online learning doesn't need is the teachers unions. Physical schools are also not needed (and the administrators too). All you need is a giant facebook-like website that would match pupils with teachers. Also, as a dev I can't really scale. I cannot do 100x more work than I do now, even if I am really good at it. But any teacher can easily teach 100x or even 1000x more people online. They feel it in yoga now. Before, a mediocre yoga teacher could collect 20$ from each student for a class. Now, yoga teachers are trying to sell the same class online for 20$ and no one is buying, because for 10$/mo you can get unlimited classes done by superstar teachers. That scaling brings a lot of revenue for some, but leaves everyone else unemployed.</p>

        <p>I put on the Macy’s parade because my mom (who is usually on my side regarding opinions on restrictions) told me oh you don’t notice much different. Yeah, except that the marchers and a group of dancers that just performed are all wearing masks and there is no crowd. It feels like watching people walk down an empty street during a random weekday. They probably should have just canceled it.</p>

        <p>Went grocery shopping and had to wear my mask inside like a good conformist </p>
<p>So as soon as I get out I take it off and pretty much everyone around me has theirs on outside and this one guy passing me about my age mid-twenties lock eyes with me I looked away then he did it again I almost said something but just went back to my car.</p>
<p>He was parked a couple of spaces down and I saw him take off his mask why eye me for not wearing one outside if you take it off in your car ughh</p>
<p>So he left and i pulled out behind him we turned off the same way and I was following him and I got a crazy idea in my head what you gotta know about me is I drive a pretty torquey car (03 Passat w8)not all that fast but boatloads of fun.</p>
<p>I know it was an immature thought but all I wanted to do was follow him until it became a 2 lane and scream past him in 3rd at 6k RPMs...</p>
<p>He turned off right and some cars got behind him before I could follow so I just went left and went home. next time someone is eyeing me for not wearing a mask outside I will say something like take a picture or if I'm having a shitty day something more aggressive.</p>
<p>I am usually such a timid and nonconfrontational person but honestly, during these times you have to stand up for yourself more someone is giving you the evil eye about a mask speak up most people that judge with their eyes will get shot down the second someone opens their mouth!</p>

        <p>How are you all doing? Not looking forward to a full weekend of shoppers at my job and greeting them all with a mask on. (Which I constantly am pulling away from my face to make myself more understood when I give them the total.) I guess I could live with it. At least it's a salary. If people only understood the mask mandate's nuanced directive and it's implications.</p>

        <p>I live near Toronto, so of course the big topic in the news is that BBQ owner who opened his restaurant regardless of lockdown restrictions and i'm so saddened to see the overwhelming response of shit like "lock him up!!" and "good! He clearly has no problem killing people, take his business license away!" and a bunch of the usual reiterated B.S. talked about people who disobey the restrictions, specifically small business owners.</p>
<p>I just don't get it... Research has come out that has shown that COVID spread in restaurants is next to none in Ontario... Most of the spread happens in long term care homes, factories and meat processing plants (with hundreds of employees sharing the same work space). Like, this research has been published and is accessible. So why are we not only punishing businesses that DON'T lead to mass COVID spread, but also have an overwhelming amount of people applauding, supporting and cheering for restrictions that DO affect these businesses? Why are these same people not pushing for restrictions to factories and meat plants instead since those lead to COVID spread the most? </p>
<p>Again... This research is out there. Punishing small businesses by forcing them to close while also allowing the ACTUAL COVID spreading hot spots like factories and meat plants to continue to operate without change is like calling the fire department to put out a house on fire and instead having the fire department put their time and energy into putting out a small shrub on fire next to the house that's ablaze. It's so so so fucking stupid. And I hate how all these people that tell us we're the uneducated and stupid ones clearly don't bother doing their own research, as is evidenced by them supporting these restrictions that target the wrong businesses.  But they're in the majority so to them they think they're correct.</p>
<p>So annoying. Also my gym is lowering our workout time from an hour and 15 minutes to an hour... So that's fun. Ugh.</p>

        <p>Is there any way to compare the absolute number of deaths in the USA during 2020 to that of previous years? I'm finding it impossible to locate these numbers. </p>
<p>You'd think the doomers would be trumpeting a statistic like "there were 1.1 million deaths in the USA through September 2019, and here we are at the end of September 2020 with 1.4 million," if that's what the numbers truly were.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Even somethng noting that such statistics typically aren't available until the numbers are run at the end of the year would work.</p>

        <p>Can someone just tell me there's reason to look forward to 2021 and why?</p>
<p>I'm fucking trying, but the truth is I don't want to see 2021 because it's very clear this garbage is not ending. I didn't even want to see this far into 2020. I went through heavy depression in my teens - the worst being from ages 16 to 19 - and all that kept me from taking myself out is lack of acess to methods and fear of being unsuccessful. I hoped to never deal with those feelings again, but they came back full circle this year, and I honestly regret not ending it back in my teens because <em>this</em> is what I apparently lived for. (I'm 26 now.)</p>
<p>I mentioned a few times in previous comment I had an auto accident this month. I feel like that was the freaking tipping point. That's actually three years in a row (in the same month, no less!) I've nearly been killed. Previous incidents were a different accident, and a mall shooting. I'm finding myself wishing one of these things had killed me because <em>I do not want to see any more of this crap!</em></p>
<p>Hotlines are not helpful. I can talk and vent day and night, but nothing is changing and it feels more exhausting than cathartic. December is in three days and it feels like it doesn't matter anymore if this year ends because 2021 isn't shaping up to look different.</p>
<p>A friend I confided some of these feelings into said he's unsure I understand the damage taking my life would cause. He meant damage to those around me. The idea the only reason for me to stay alive is it'll supposedly make everyone else grieve for a while isn't one that gives me relief. That just makes me question why their feelings matter more than mine.</p>
<p>All that above said, no, I don't want to die. I'm just so fucking tired and whatever spirit I may have had has effectively died. I want to leave, escape, and go into another year of this. Unfortunately, there's only one escape. I said it in another comment, but asking to stay optimistic when there is no hope, no light, in sight is asking too much. That blind optimism is why I didn't leave in my teen years and I'm regretting it a ton right now.</p>
<p>TL; DR - I'm fucking tired, I don't want to see 2021, and I just want out.</p>

        <p>&rt; Can someone just tell me there's reason to look forward to 2021 and why?</p>
<p>Maybe a complete political and economic collapse that undoes every last technocratic attempt to control humanity? 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's likely but we really don't know what the future holds, and anybody pretending to know is either lying or part of the 'engineering' efforts (which aren't guaranteed to succeed).</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for mass in-country migrations, for like-minded people to start living together in like-minded regions? A lot of humans are newly jobless, or working remotely, so that kind of geographical freedom is at least one plus to all this chaos. We may not be allowed to leave our own countries right now but (in the US at least) we can go someplace less draconian, more likely to be around people who have a tacit understanding that this whole thing is alarmist horseshit.</p>
<p>In fact if I'm stepping back at this whole catastrophe and trying to understand some Greater Purpose to all of it, that might very well be it - people are realizing it REALLY SUCKS to live as a minority viewpoint among people who not only disagree but actually wish you dead for disagreeing. A giant "prisoner swap" on a national level would be fucking fantastic.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm looking for the most breathable mask out there since I hate those things. Anyone got some tips for the kinds to look for?</p>

        <p>lykeomg2themax - The N95’s don’t  work anyways...and you’re right - can’t breath - this summer I wore one painting with a sprayer under plastic - came out from under the plastic and lo and behold under the mask - which was seated properly - my face is covered in paint particles....now let them tell us again how well masks work?  If it can’t keep paint out chances are pretty non-existent that it’s going to help keep ANYONE from getting sick from anything.

        <p>Where I live you can say "I'm exempt" and they're not allowed to ask if it's for a medical condition or what your reason is. Some stores have their own policies and still won't let you in... But you should check the bylaw or mandate where you are and see if there are exemptions.</p>

        <p>I've been debating redditors lately and have found a consistent pattern in how it goes. I'm going to call it <em>the soft censorship strategy</em>, which I believe is quite deliberate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First they will allow the appearance of debate by giving you a chance to dissent, but either brigade or apply a downvote filter to make it appear as though your points are publicly disapproved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, they will try to bait you into overreaction, embarrassment, or some manner of character slip which will give pretenses for banning or to discredit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other line of attack is to wait long enough so that a "science advocate" shows up to give the smug redditor takedown on various arguments. This is aided because the first few responses in a comment chain will be heavily downvoted giving the impression that the debate is settled to bystanders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they will try to delete threads or soft censor without you knowing it, thinking that they can minimize the scope of your influence in this manner. Or try to contain arguments to easily ignored threads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, lacking this they will ban you without cause. Which is basically the cycle of reddit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we all know here that this site is highly astroturfed, kept alive by political donations, and is basically just a weapon of political control appealing to low IQ people. I really wonder how their traffic is doing though, considering the soft censorship approach is obviously ineffective in totally preventing ideas from spreading. Most conservatives I know have long since left this and comparable sites, and that number is constantly growing. Just out of curiosity, I've often checked the background of my debaters: Every time it is either a mentally ill person, a left partisan, or a government official. I get the feeling reddit has basically played themselves into a corner with censorship, since these people aren't talking to anyone outside their circle either</p>

        <p>The media use this to their advantage. There are a LOT of naysayers, so naturally when any of them get really sick and die, there's  a perfect opportunity to cherrypick a cautionary tale. "SEE? This IGNORANT FOOL was just like you, and now they're dead!"</p>
<p>But of course you could do the same with any cause of death. And we're not privy to the autopsy or person's health history, so we have no idea the total circumstances of death. As I've said before: how do we know a "COVID death" was in fact not an "asymptomatic COVID case" + traditional flu?</p>
<p>Nor do we hear many stories about the opposite: all the people DEATHLY AFRAID of Covid, but who are in perfect health despite "front line" jobs or some situation which put them at great supposed risk. Or the 80 year olds who test positive but never come down with anything. Those are non-stories.</p>
<p>Even granting COVID as a completely novel pathogen, with super deadly effects ... the fatality rate is a statistical blip. And the more people they test, the more apparent this becomes. All the fraidycats are welcome to stay home and let the rest of us live our lives. We won't bother them in their protective bubbles, we promise.</p>

        <p>The situations are just totally different. It's the hot dog/sandwich argument all over again. In other words, if you can't articulate a reason why the mask mandate is different from a seatbelt law, then you are forced to accept the mask mandate as a legitimate exercise of government authority. That's not how this all works. Not everything in life is can be reduced to some underlying general principle which, if applied, explains and justifies everything. </p>
<p>I see it as a total red herring. The situations are nothing alike--which is why I think it's so important for them to push the narrative that masks are totally unobtrusive and comfortable to wear. In reality, they are annoying. They impede social interactions because you can't see the other person's face. It's harder to hear what they're saying. They fog up your classes and you have to smell your own breath. They slide down as you're talking. </p>
<p>The protection is also dubious, especially with cloth masks. They don't filter anything, and the virus is aerosolized. Not to mention the fact that they aren't even fitted to your face. The air just gets in through the sides. Doctors have to get masks fitted to their face. </p>
<p>Contrast that with a seatbelt. Now, not everyone actually supports seatbelt laws in the first place. The fact that the law remains on the books doesn't mean it's somehow accepted as a sensible exercise of government authority. Hell, look at marijuana laws. People have thought that was a bad idea for years now, yet people still go to jail over it. I wonder why they don't use that example instead of the seatbelt one? Banning drugs was for our own good, right?</p>

        <p>1) Don't engage these people, no answer you give will ever satisfy them. "Fuck you, I don't want to" is good enough.</p>
<p>but if you must ...</p>
<p>2) A seatbelt is meant to protect the wearer. We can all acknowledge that cars move fast and collisions can be deadly. We can see it with our own eyes. The results are convincing. Some invisible virus that I'm only told exists, that I'm not entirely certain is different from the flu, the death count of which is completely unremarkable but the "cases" (positive PCR test results) keep going up, up, up? To the point where the IFR (infection fatality rate) keeps going down, down, down? Sorry, I don't buy the entire premise so I'm not going to humor you by wearing something to make YOU feel better.</p>
<p>Since most of the proponents are leftists, you could say it's analogous to this: is a scantily clad woman responsible for the sexual feelings that might be aroused in passerby? Should she owe them anything? Should she refrain because maybe some of them can't control themselves? They would say "no", because their reactions aren't her responsibility, and anyway they don't even accept the premise (that clothing influences human behavior in a way involving 'responsibility' of the wearer).</p>
<p>Well, we don't feel responsible for the feelings of fear and indignation that arise in the spectator of a maskless person. Not our problem. And furthermore we reject the entire premise, that this so-called deadly virus is even a big deal - certainly no bigger than the traditional flu, for which nobody wore masks or felt the least responsible for anybody else's getting sick. If we reject the premise, why would we alter our behavior just to make you feel better? Your fearful feelings are your responsibility.</p>
<p>3) I thought the whole arguments was each mask wearer is protecting mainly other people, not themselves, because masks don't even really work? How is that like a seatbelt, then? We've already learned (from many of the comments online) that you don't give two shits if we or our families die. So it's certainly not about saving our lives ...</p>
<p>4) These are the same people who believe that cops should just allow black men (who are under arrest) walk free if they violently resist, or even just verbally object to being arrested. Doesn't matter the crime he committed, doesn't matter what weapons he might have, doesn't matter what future threat he may pose (eg domestic violence arrest) - it's better to just let him go and maybe a "mental health team" can negotiate him to come into custody at some future date.</p>
<p>So why can't we have that kid gloves treatment? If we're not wearing a mask in violation of some city ordinance, just mind your own business, don't call the cops because, remember, <em>they are violent thugs who might kill us for sport!!</em> Instead send us a notice in the mail and maybe we'll go down to the courthouse on our own time, when convenient, if we feel the charges against us are just.</p>

        <p>Blah. Today is a bad day. I found out last week a relative has been on a ventilator with covid since October. Then today she died. She was 62, which seems young to me, and I don’t remember her having health problems at all, but I haven’t been close with her for many years. </p>
<p>I am feeling such a mix of emotions and I don’t feel I have anyone I can talk to, since everyone knows my stance on lockdowns and masks. I feel weirdly like a monster. But I don’t think covid is a hoax, I just don’t think masks make a difference and that lockdowns will cause deaths too. But i know people see me as a conspiracy theorist or something.</p>
<p>And I feel like my heart has been hardened to humanity over this fight against covid measures. I just feel listless. It was a rude awakening that the disease is real and can take people you love.</p>
<p>Now I’m just sad because the govt is trying to take away every single right and I do not believe they will give them back... and then covid is out there killing people, and I don’t particularly believe it can be stopped unless you are an island like Australia and you do the insane things Australia is doing. </p>
<p>So I just feel terrible all around. I don’t feel hope for the future. I am sad about my loss and just feel so awful.</p>

        <p>I'm so sick of losing people over this. So many people I used to respect post on social media about how they can't believe others go out in public, supporting mask mandates, saying people with medical exemptions should stay home instead of go maskless, even saying women should wear them during birth. I know I shouldn't take Facebook so seriously but it's the only way I communicate with friends we had to move away from, who we'll live close to again soon. One of our best friends in the south ranted about people going black Friday shopping and I told him not to be a coward AND not to judge people bc suicide rates are so high. Maybe people go black friday shopping to keep tradition or get out of the house. He says his mom is on oxygen so regardless of my 'political beliefs' we should all stop living our lives bc of her. When my daughter was on oxygen we didn't go out to avoid getting her sick. I never demanded other people stop living their lives so my daughter wouldn't get sick, that's SELFISH. If he's scared of getting her sick he needs to stay home, that's not anyone else's responsibility. I want to defend myself but it's my husband's friend first and he doesn't want me arguing, but he took his asshole friend's side too by liking his response about his poor mommy. Like dude I've had a kid on oxygen, how dare you use that as an excuse to take away peoples' rights. Wtf. I was looking forward to going camping again with him. Now I'm furious with him AND my husband. My husband is a coward who's more concerned with being politically correct than defending his wife. He wears a mask everywhere he goes and tries to make me wear one bc someone might try to hurt us. He's over 6'5" and looks intimidating but all this bullshit has him scared. I try to tell him it's mostly women getting picked on but he'll wear his mask and call me at the store complaining he can't breathe, still won't take it off. I wish I could go make my own friends instead of internet bullshit but I'm stuck at home with kids, can't drive and god forbid I risk getting us in trouble leaving the house bc I won't wear a mask so I never go anywhere. I was looking forward to seeing our friends but half of them are brainwashed morons so what's the point? You can't talk sense into people like that either. I feel like I'm losing everyone except my children because everyone else is so stupid they're not even people anymore. They might as well be literal sheep. I love my kids but it's a shame their father is a coward, we have a 3rd on the way too. I never thought I'd see him act like this, he's never scared of anything, now he's ruining our lives with his fear. I could handle our friends turning stupid if he'd stayed normal. I've pretty much lost everyone.</p>

<p>If you weren't married and didn't have kids with him, I'd ask when you met my boyfriend. We had so many problems over this, we had to just agree to not talk about the current events at all. Together since 2015 and never saw him like this until 2020. Feels like I don't know who I'm with. This one subject turns him into someone I can't recognize.</p>
<p>He wants to marry me. Not engaged because he wants to propose traditionally, but I already agreed to it. I really don't know anymore.</p>

        <p>Do what you want but I think it would be in the best interest of the anti-lockdown group to not name call and politically label pro lockdown people. While they do it to us two wrongs do not make a right and when you label the other side it further politicizes and divides the two groups.

        <p>A favorite Youtuber of mine made a great point in his video today. Why is the government pushing masks and social distancing so much even after eight months? If they really cared about our health, wouldn't they be encouraging us to exercise, eat healthy, and get vitamin D?  I've never heard a politician or "expert" (ie. Fauci) say that we should implement these measures into our daily lives so that if we were to get Covid, we would better handle it. The message is just arbitrary orders of "wear a mask" and "stay home", no questions asked. It just shows how little they care about our health.</p>

        <p>My mom and I got in an argument today and I feel in the dumps. I lost my temper, questioning what it would take for her to feel the government has gone to far to protect us from this “virus”, and she just reasserted her belief that the physicians in charge are making informed decisions. </p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

        <p>I wear a mask. I’ve worn a mask before the mandate was put in place. Nice try though. Keep convincing yourself the only reason this virus spreads is because of a small group of antimaskers.</p>
<p>Fucking idiot. I bet you’re one of those typical hypocrites who lectures everyone about following “the rules” but break them and go places that aren’t essential or take your mask off around friends and family members and then blame US for being at fault when you have blood on your hands all the same.</p>

        <p>It is a small group. We have had a mask mandate where I live for months and I literally never see anyone without a mask on. Lo and behold our cases have gone up. The real problem is you dumbass hypocrites who break the rules, but convince yourselves it couldn't possibly be you that's also contributing to the spread. You idiots can't even call out your hypocritical leaders who break the rules all the time. Maybe work on yourself first before you come here trolling a skeptic sub like the loser you are and take a look in the mirror and admit the times you did something you shouldn't have. Quit doing stuff that isn't essential. Quit meeting up with friends and family (if you even have any of those...probably not since you're wasting your time being a troll here). Quit being a hypocrite.</p>

        <p>Hmm, I am Canadian and already had a wonderful Thanksgiving with my grandmother we got Japanese food one of our favorites we hate turkey</p>
<p>I would extend an olive branch out to you and try to have a civilized conversation about the morality of imposing restrictions like this but unfortunately people like you usually just wanna come in here and try to insult us by calling us a bad name or insulting our intelligence</p>
<p>If we have enough conviction in our opinions to show them here and even some people to show them in public what makes you think calling us idiots will do anything to change our opinions.</p>
<p>It serves 1 purpose to further elevate the soapbox you live on I dont know if you are a virtue signaller about covid stuff or if you are just having a bad day but whatever it is I hope it gets better!</p>
<p>Have a great thanksgiving</p>

        <p>Hi. Could people of this subreddit take some time, and answer me a question.</p>
<p>How does a government profit from making people wear a mask?</p>
<p>This subreddit's topic is a discussion how the pandemic influences our lives. But at a first glance to me, as a random visitor, it seems like a flat earth society. There are a lot of memes, with pseudo-scientific arguments, lots of logical fallacies.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be rude. I am genuinely trying to understand reasoning behind thought that people in this subreddit have.</p>

        <p>I don't think there is a direct monetary profit from masks. But there is a "expanded powers" profit". Keeping everyone in masks reminds everyone that "there is a crisis going on" and that the government is justified in continued actions.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are also the epitome of a non falsifiable argument. If cases go up, pro-lockdowners can claim "people weren't wearing them correctly". If cases go down, they can claim "this is what happens when people wear their masks". Even if 100% of people wear masks 100% of the time, they can just move the goalposts and say "well we need everyone with n95 masks, cloth masks were never enough."</p>

        <p>My personal opinion, is they don’t profit. There is a market for it though, as companies out there are profiting , and despite mandating they make it the persons responsibility to purchase.
I have never said or thought the government “profits” from masks. The topic has become highly politicized, however.
The left In general tend to push the story that wearing them shows virtue in wanting to “save lives”. Where as the right has more of the “freedom of choice” and less government intervention approach.
Most of us have seen doctors on both sides argue for pro and against. Personally I feel people wear them more out of a sense of security to help them go back to work and keep the economy running.
Some people see them as a source of anxiety as it does trigger it in some people. Unfortunate, there is very little sympathy for that group, and they are constantly shamed and told to stay home if they have difficulty wearing one (especially for long periods)
I like to look at the science for and against and try to see the political motivations for people being pro mask and go from there , if that helps answer your question</p>

        <p>Control, why? Wearing mask does not restrict your freedom. Freedom in the sense of a democratic society freedom. I mean people's freedom ends where other people's freedom starts. </p>
<p>Do you believe there are viruses that affect respiratory tissues? Do you believe that simple mask and hand washing can (maybe not completely) help prevent spread of this virus. Simply because it introduces some barrier.</p>
<p>Then maybe if you believe also that the covid19 virus exists, then maybe your freedom should end, where other people freedom start. Maybe it is a good idea try to prevent spread the virus, and prevent death of another person that does not want to die from a lack of oxygen...</p>

        <p>Well no. But in some regions where new viruses outbreak is common, people do wear mask some years. Now there is a new virus that managed to spread around the globe, hence a precaution should be taken. Unlike a common flu we don't have vaccine nor immune response for that.</p>

        <p>There's a new virus in every city and town every flu season. There is no "immune response" for that. The flu vaccine is also not 100% effective, it was \~47% effective for the 2018-2019 flu season.</p>

<p>Do you even look at the definition of words before you make a comment trying to shame people? Masks and arbitrary distances have nothing to do with being civil you are simply imposing your own morality!</p>
<p>So you know if you are worried about people sneezing and coughing on you then yea wear a mask and if you are worried about asymptomatic cases you are batshit crazy and have more of a chance of getting a speeding ticket than Covid asymptotically!</p>
<p>The truth is people dont usually get censored on this sub whereas all the other big subs that deal with covid stuff and some that dont censor people's views if they are dissenting which is wrong, especially when it's non-violent!</p>
<p>Non-violent dissent should never be limited see Cohen vs California</p>

        <p>I shouldn't even be feeding a troll like you but can you explain to me how I am the uneducated one when you're the one saying things like plague rats and imposing your own morality onto the definition of words!</p>
<p>Not that it matters but I probably had a better education than you started out with Norton Gillham tutoring because I'm dyslexic then went to private school for PreK and K and then public school for 1-8 and I went to 3 different private schools in Ontario in my highschool time because they had courses I liked such as computer science or physics as a 1 on 1 class.</p>
<p>It's not outside of reality I went and picked up parts at an auto shop the other day and nobody wore masks they had the signs on the door but no masks on. Nobody sneezed or coughed on me so I was not worried dont even try to say they could have been asymptotic even if they were your mask would not have stopped that infection however rare it may be.</p>
<p>I guess your right your version of"education" is not for everyone but I guess group-think/indoctrination is right!</p>

<p>There are still asymptomatic deadly diseases that existed before covid.</p>
<p>Think of how many times you spread disease without knowing it.</p>
<p>You're so hell-bent on being an 'empathetic person' that you want to lock up the world for 2 years, stop anyone applying for college and getting proper education all while suicide and crime rates are going up because of it. You think you can save everyone in the world? Way to go.</p>

        <p>I would extend an olive branch out to you and try to have a civilized conversation about the morality of imposing restrictions like this but unfortunately people like you usually just wanna come in here and try to insult us by calling us a bad name or insulting our intelligence</p>
<p>If we have enough conviction in our opinions to show them here and even some people to show them in public what makes you think calling us idiots or "plague rats"will do anything to change our opinions.</p>

        <p>Normally in such situations I'd offer to take his place with the caveat I'd be discussing from a devils advocate perspective. But quite frankly, in my country at least, there is so much evidence of misrepresented statistics or simply out and out lying from politicians/scientists that I can't even devils advocate it.</p>
<p>Like, I know what their arguments are, but they just don't hold water. A lot of subjects I can argue both sides of regardless of my actual position (for example, Abortion, Gun control, strong national borders. If this was the black death, if it had infected 2 billion people and killed 500 million, then sure, I probably would be on board with lockdowns and banning peaceful protest. But I've seen no evidence that suggests the cure is better than the disease, everything I've seen says we're going to be reaping a whirlwind the likes of which we can't even comprehend in 2-3 years from this.</p>

I'll bet they don't have as big of an increase in suicides.</p>

        <p>Should we blame those deaths on covid or medical malpractice. When people needed oxygen machines doctors gave them respirators you know why cause the media was fooling them and having them panic. More hospitals are in bankruptcy now then they will ever be. Also we have T cell immunity and our cells can easily defend coronavirus. Also many other diseases and viruses have similarities to coronavirus so we can never really tell the difference.</p>

        <p>Your medical degree is leaking out your ass. Literally none of that is real. If you think we have this all figured out, why are more people dying? The mortality rate of those admitted to the hospital hasn't changed. I honestly wonder if you would realize how dumb you have been if you were lying in the street gasping for breath before you die. Or maybe you will kill yourself because you were told to care about someone else for a change and that crippled your world view? Maybe it was the money that you pissed away in the name of corporate socialism: personal capitalism. Our great economy couldn't even support a tiny little hiccup, got looted by the rich, and spiraled into this. Let's just hear the next bullshit lie of a talking point you were fed. I know at this point it is near impossible to admit that you have been indoctrinated into a cult of anti intellectuals because you were to stupid to tell who is spewing shit out their mouths and keyboards.</p>
<p>Supplemental oxygen has always been used for covid-19 patients. Ventilators were only used when safe O2 sats could not be reached with supplemental oxygen. People are still being put on ventilators. Apparently everything you ever learned about t cells came from resident evil. I know you are not an educated pathologist. I don't expect you to be able to tell the difference between bacterial pneumonia and a virus, let alone different viral strains. You're holding the rest of the planet back by claiming your ignorance is as valid as an expert. Honestly, you deserve a punch in the face from every one of the tends of thousands of doctors who have lost patients. You don't deserve their care.</p>

        <p>Thanks and aren’t you the same people who yell “Save lives” but wish death upon others. Very hypocritical. Actually most doctors will take me in because the hospitals aren’t over flowing. So thanks for your opinion and shove it up ur ass.</p>

        <p>Clark Osojnicki. That was his name. Go ahead and tell me he didn't exist or whatever mental gymnastics it takes to keep you in such denial. Seriously, is there anything that could get through to you that way more people are dying than usual and it is mostly preventable. You keep shouting 0.4% fatality like that isn't a lot. You sound like someone with less than 250 people in your social circle that you care about. Believe it or not, covid-19 could kill millions without including someone you know. People who aren't shit stains still care.</p>

        <p>The reason people stop talking when you bring up cars is because it's a stupid false equivalence. </p>
<p>Seatbelt laws are more authoritarian than mask orders: the only people you can hurt without a seatbelt are yourself and anyone dumb enough to get in the car with you. </p>
<p>We expect people to drive in a predictable, safe way. There are punishments for not doing so, from monetary fines to the revocation of privileges. Some people manage to not drink and drive. They still drive, but not when drunk. Others can't help themselves and end up not being allowed to drive, drunk or not. Lmk if we start putting people in jail because they didn't wear a mask. </p>
<p>I don't blame every car for the irresponsible actions of a few drivers. No one with a brain does. I can differentiate between people driving safely and people risking the safety of others for their own convenience. The latter SHOULD be banned from operating a motor vehicle permanently. </p>
<p>I don't blame anyone for doing the essentials, work, groceries, etc.  But some spoiled snowflakes can't go a couple weeks without their favorite bar, gym, or window to lick. Worse than that, the tiniest things like washing hands and a scrap of cloth are worth throwing a protest. Those are the assholes who shouldn't be allowed to drive. They aren't safely integrating in society. The ONLY common situation in american life that presents a statically relevant chance of a stranger killing you is on public roads. (Or disease). That's why we regulate the shit out of who can drive and what is allowed to be sold as a road worthy vehicle. </p>
<p>Either you think there should be ZERO rules and regulations governing public roads, or you acknowledge that sometimes the mean fascist rules are actually there to protect you from someone who doesn't process the risk or doesn't care if they hurt you.</p>
<p>Seriously: which is it to you? Should there ever be laws to discourage people from risking the lives of others for their own amusement?</p>

        <p>Not wearing a mask is straight up inconsiderate. Masks aren't meant to protect just you. They're meant to protect everyone around you aswell. Also apologies about the assumption.</p>

        <p>Telling other people what to wear is inconsiderate. And many people around me also prefer freedom over fear-mongering and hate having to wear masks just like I do. They prefer other people to not wear masks as well so I'm being considerate to those people.</p>
<p>But who knows, maybe natural selection will weed us out. So far none of us have had COVID-19 yet but we're hopeful.</p>

<p>People are being forced to wear masks for many hours a day due to threats of violence and extortion of money. </p>
<p>Look at children in schools. </p>
<p>Your 15 minute argument is completely invalid. </p>
<p>“It’s only two weeks of lockdown to save lives!!!” Two months... Two years...</p>
<p>You better stop being so naïve. You’ve been conditioned by the education system to obey the authority figure. They tell you what is right and wrong, then when tested if you do not memorize and repeat what you’ve been told, you are punished, you fail. School rewards order following more than critical thinking... I wonder why...</p>

        <p>“Masks are used to keep others safe”</p>
<p>All masks do is make it slightly less likely for your sneeze / cough / spit to get on somebody. </p>
<p>If you sneeze or cough with a mask on, those particles are still going to go through and around your mask. </p>
<p>The virus itself is much smaller than any mask fabric, meaning the masks people are wearing are useless, and are actually increasing the likelihood of inhaling bacteria and getting sick. </p>
<p>You should be wearing extra pairs of underwear extra tight to prevent people from smelling your farts and getting sick. </p>
<p>Plexiglass in stores is similar to back when restaurants had indoor smoking sections.</p>

        <p>I am a bit older, so I don't have a granma anymore, but I am bringing my mom into Canada from the US for Christmas. With all 'US is a covid hellhole' sentiment here it's not easy, and she can easily catch COVID on the plane. However, I think her meeting her granddaughter for the first time is more important than being detained at the border or even staying alive. She is an old lady, and even if it won't be COVID, any other ilness can take her out any time, so it is important to use the time we have and not wait for the lockdown to end.</p>
