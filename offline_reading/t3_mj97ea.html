    <strong>Wondering what it’s like in other states?</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of anger on here and I’m wondering what it’s like in other states. I’m in a state with a consistent covid number, also very liberal, but we don’t really have any restrictions that affect my day to day life at this point. My kids are in school full time, soccer, baseball, swim, gym time etc, I’m back in my office full time....I even just visited my spouse in the hospital (next state over, also quite liberal) without issue. Literally the only thing at this point affecting my life in any way is masks (but as a woman, not wearing makeup isn’t bad lol!). We have travelled both in and out of state, on planes, and have only been inconvenienced by the hotel breakfast and lack of pool. </p>
<p>What is it like in other states to create such discord? I have friends who have travelled to Florida and GA say it’s totally back to normal. </p>
<p>If things feel approximately back to normal in my state, a <em>dark dark midnight navy</em> blue state through and through, where are the areas where it <strong>doesn’t</strong> feel back to normal??? And if so- what is it that doesn’t feel normal to you? (Ie masks, govt involvement etc?)</p>
<p>My state has lowered cases at this point, somewhere around the national average. We also have about 25% of the total state pop fully vaxed and no vaccine passport or any other vaccine related restrictions/benefits.</p></p>

        <p>ETA: I mean to say that if things feel mostly normal in my bluest state, what’s going on in other states to prevent this?</p>
