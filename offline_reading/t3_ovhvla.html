<p>I'm here for NNN and when they shut that down it can go in the dumpster fire with Facebook and the rest.</p>

        <p>It’s wild. They have everything set up for manipulation:
-   Fake studies to appear legit with the goal of attacking people that refuse the vaccine 
-   Extreme vote manipulation with thousands of likes by bots in a few hours
-   Fake or paid commenters
-   Paid moderators that will not hesitate to ban and remove entire threads of the conversation resulting in almost the entire comment section from being removed</p>
<p>Looks like a coordinated attack to a very specific group of people. What’s good is that many are waking up.</p>
<p>All those removed comments were from people that see the bs, plus the attackers are getting desperate since they have to waste so many resources for their goal and they still fail.</p>
<p>Keep being reasonable! We’re winning.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, I needed to hear it. I was banned today from my city's subreddit for writing a polite explanation and cordial response to a photo I was in where I was called a "Karen" and an "anti-vaxxer" and the comment section included threats of violence, death, and wishing us "slow painful deaths."</p>
<p>My response -- polite and respectful... And yet -- banned. Threats? Wishes of death? Not censored. That is madness.</p>
<p>(This was a photo of a press conference I attended in protest of Covid-19 Passports.)</p>
<p>Coordinated attack by a very specific group of people. That's scary. To me this feels like a coup. The global nature, the coordinated Covid-19 Agenda throughout the entire planet and coincidental removal/death/assassination of any leader that doesn't comply...</p>

        <p>I’m assuming they have grown many thousand Reddit accounts with karma and use them whenever they want to spam a specific post with likes. </p>
<p>Either that or they pay third world people to like a specific post for cheap.</p>

        <p>Less vanity, and it used to be more meaningful conversation except ever since Covid-19 hit, the censorship makes it impossible to discuss.</p>
<p>I got banned today from /r/sandiego. I was at a press conference with people speaking against Covid-19 Passports. I was in the photo, along with many others. We were called "Karens" and "anti-vaxxers."</p>
<p>I wrote a very cordial response, explaining the true intent. Heck, I'll post it here but don't feel obligated to read it... But this got me banned. Forever.</p>
<p>You know what didn't get banned? Straight up threats to kill us and wishing us "slow painful deaths" etc.</p>
<p>Madness.</p>
<p>&rt; You guys should read the New York Times articles with Fauci advocating for pre-emptive vaccination for diseases which don't exist yet.</p>
<p>&rt; The problem here is that in your rush to hate these people you're forgetting something:</p>
<p>&rt; Maybe you want this shot. But what about the next, the next, and the next? If you give up your right to say no to this one, you give up your right to say no to any shot in the future. Shouldn't we have a choice?</p>
<p>&rt; There is great irony that the people you guys are so quick to hate are the ones who want the most freedom for you.</p>
<p>&rt; These aren't "anti-vaxxers." They just want choice when it comes to this completely new mRNA gene therapy which is having an unusual number of side effects (and deaths) compared with traditional vaccines of the past.</p>
<p>&rt; Most people don't even know about these side effects because any discussion of them gets you banned across social networks and many subreddits.</p>
<p>&rt; This kind of censorship is a use of force to short-circuit rational discussion. Talking things out is how people of a democracy come to agreement about how to get along with one another.</p>
<p>&rt; Not force. Not censorship. Not fear. Not dehumanization and not name-calling. People petitioning their government for representation goes to the heart of how this country works -- someone shouldn't be called a "Karen" for that.</p>
<p>&rt; Censorship and dehumanization are actions used by people who work against freedom and democracy. Who are the extremists here? People asserting their right to choose? Or the people censoring them, calling them names, and forcing an experimental new injection into them and their children?</p>
<p>&rt; My opinion here is hard to refute, and that's why people who say what I'm saying now are silenced in most social media and especially on Reddit... This makes a moderate, widely held opinion seem a lot more controversial and rare than it actually is...</p>
<p>&rt; And I caution you - this kind of extremism causes people to dig in and push back HARD. Do we want another Trump? Because that's what we'll get if you create a fake bubble of agreement that only one opinion is allowed to participate in.</p>
<p>&rt; If you believe in freedom and democracy, this censorship and silencing of discourse should concern you regardless of which side of this issue you are on.</p>
<p>And with that? Banned. Forever. I can never again participate in my city's Subreddit because that post is so extreme I am removed forever.</p>
<p>What good is Reddit if you can't even have discourse over an issue. How was that response --- to a photo I was in where I was being called names with people saying they wanted to kill me and for me to die a slow death --- banworthy!?</p>
<p>It blows my mind how far things have gone... Reddit is garbage, and this happening is proof.</p>

        <p>Right. The whole reason they made that “study” is to manipulate people into one direction: get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now any reasonable person would see through that and ask themselves “why would anybody be so determined to change my mind?”</p>
