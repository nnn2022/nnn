    <strong>As a high school student, this whole school situation is bullshit.</strong>
    <p><p>So my district gave us the option of going back in person or staying online for Microsoft Teams meetings every day. I chose in person. Whatever you chose, you had to go virtual for at least the first four weeks before they had the school building ready. Let’s just say that virtual learning is far inferior to in person learning; I’m not going to say anymore about that. </p>
<p>School arrives and everything feels different. There are signs EVERYWHERE saying masks required, how to properly wear masks, and all other guidelines and bullshit to stop the COVID spread. In the cafeteria, there are plastic barriers (or whatever the fuck they’re called) on every table, placed diagonally so that we can’t hear anything that the person sitting across from you is saying. And we have to wait to be called to actually get our lunch. Stairways are one way and most hallways are one way. </p>
<p>Now let’s talk about how they handle masks. They’re serious about it. I was walking with my mask under my nose, and a teacher told me to pull it up. I pulled it right back down when I walked away. And my English teacher... she’s crazy! She tells everyone to pull their mask up and it’s annoying. She even almost wrote a referral for someone taking it off to drink water. And what’s even more ironic is that I saw her hugging a past student. So you care so much about masks but not distancing? </p>
<p>In band, we have to use a blowhole mask. My first thought was how stupid it was. I don’t use the mask and so far my director hasn’t said anything about it. And we have to put covers over our bells. I play tuba, and there is no way in hell a virus can travel that far. </p>
<p>But there’s my music theory teacher. He declared on the first day of school that the virus wasn’t that bad and he wouldn’t wear a mask. When someone in the hallway asked why he doesn’t wear a mask, he replied, “I’m not afraid of germs; I eat germs for breakfast.” What a fucking legend. </p>
<p>Also, we have to spray our desks after every class. </p>
<p>Also, I really hate contact tracing. It seems so stupid to quarantine just because you were in the vicinity of someone who recently tested positive. </p>
<p>And the staggered releases are pointless too because most teachers don’t care. </p>
<p>I think I covered everything. </p>
<p>I can’t wait for this “deadly virus” that has a low chance of killing to go away so I can experience a proper life again. If we still have to do this bullshit when it’s gone, I’m just gonna reply “No.”</p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that they said over the intercom that masks go over the nose and they didn’t say over the mouth, so my music theory teacher mocked them and just put put the mask on his nose.</p></p>

        <p>Start a rebellion in your school?  All you need is a few friends to join in.  Walk through the hallways the wrong way, rip down signs when you see them, resist.  Do the exact opposite of what they say.  Never comply.</p>

        <p>As a high school teacher, I love this! I feel very pressured and coerced to wear a mask by administration, and I haven't yet been brave enough to just outright not wear one. But I will never tell anyone to wear a mask, and I would love to see students rebel en masse.</p>

        <p>I would love to go back to band but if they make some sort of dystopian covid version then I won't go. I prefer it as a nice memory of something I love and much as I miss it, I don't want to replace it with whatever horrible version they bring in instead. Band is social, gives me goals to work toward within music and without that it wouldn't be worth it. So actually, now I think about it I'm glad they haven't started yet. Plus, I still have one more year of high school after this to do it all again!</p>

<p>This is how our government is using coercion. It's crazy. They know people rely on their jobs. Right now it's masks. When will it be vaccines to go to work???</p>

        <p>That fucking sucks. Sounds like a prison. Don’t wear the mask. What happens if you refuse? Get sent to the principal’s office? Get suspended? Not sure if they can actually do that. I doubt they would go back to remote because a few people refuse. Probably the district or county’s decision.</p>
<p>Grocery stores are one thing where you only wear it for like 30 mins. But kids wearing them every day, 8 hours a day. What a fucking nightmare. Especially because masks become useless after a couple hours due to bacteria build up. Or after you take it off. Seriously, just throw your mask away after lunch or something and if someone asks why you don’t have a mask say you were following the CDC guidelines of single use masks.</p>
<p>If I was still in high school I’d be expelled or something real quick, lol. Good luck. Keep fighting, just like your music teacher</p>

        <p>Most places with mask mandates have exemptions written into the mandates. You can make your own exemption form to self verify that you are exempt and to give them evidence. I know people talk about a "medical" exemption, but I have not seen a mandate yet that says an exemption must be medical or that a doctor must give it to you. Most doctors do not want to take on that weird punitive gray area anyways. The best pertain to know whether you are exempt is you yourself. Get the original mandate or order. Find the section that talks about exemptions. In my state it says :</p>
<p>People who have medical or other health conditions, disabilities or mental health, developmental, or behavioral needs that make it difficult to tolerate wearing a face covering.</p>
<p>See. At worst I have a behavioral need not to wear a mask because my behavior is not to wear masks.</p>
<p>You can also often find "guidance" for schools from the Department of Health and use what it says to exempt yourself. You can also look for anything that your school has put out and look for anything useful to support yourself.</p>
<p>Schools are still refusing exemptions, but they are breaking the rules in doing so.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the endless emergency declarations and powers that governors are pretending to have are themselves illegal and unconstitutional. They should all go to jail for fraud.</p>

        <p>Careful young one, you're exercising a lot of critical thinking here!  No good can come of this! Next thing you know you'll think 9/11 was an inside job and that the federal reserve isn't actually part of the government.</p>
