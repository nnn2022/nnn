        <p>The Maldives was one of the first countries to open its borders to tourists back in July 2020. The country is a small archipelago of approximately 1200 islands with a population of around 500,000 people. </p>
<p>Cases were never alarmingly high, even though their measures were far from stringent. Lockdown policies made little sense, tourists were allowed to travel freely without quarantine but locals had to quarantine for 10 days if they wanted to travel within their own country. </p>
<p>Government health officials were on almost every street corner of the capital Malé, taking random PCR tests all day - so this isn’t a case of “not enough testing”.</p>
<p>Then came the sudden surge of gifted vaccines from India, China and COVAX. Sources in links: </p>
<p><a href="https://hci.gov.in/male/?12255?000">First shipment of Covishield from India</a></p>
<p><a href="https://hci.gov.in/male/?12637?000">Third batch of Covishield from India</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/26/c_139836135.htm">First batch of Sinopharm vaccine from China</a></p>
<p><a href="https://timesofaddu.com/2021/03/04/just-in-china-to-donate-additional-100k-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-to-maldives/">Second batch ofSinopharm from China</a></p>
<p><a href="https://avas.mv/en/97553">Limited COVAX batch of Pfizer </a></p>
<p>Everyone was getting vaccinated. Not just frontline workers or high risk people, every single person living there signed up. The Maldives has an extremely large number of illegal workers from Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries, even they were getting free shots.There were insane queues in the capital where people were crowding to get their shots. There were posters all over the country, the government was sending SMSs throughout the day like a possessive lover <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CyPlENv">few texts and posters</a></p>
<p>For a lot of people it was mandatory to get the shot, if not they were not allowed to keep their jobs or travel within their own country. It’s not mandatory by law, but it’s difficult to see the difference when people were left with no choice. </p>
<p>Over 60% of the population has now received at least their first shot and we see this sudden increase in cases. So with such a huge cocktail of various vaccines in a tiny, concentrated country - what the hell is going on?</p>

        <p>China vaccine is trash. Astra Zeneca vaccine not much better. They were bound to have an outbreak at some point. </p>
<p>Luckily covid is not that big of a threat. According to current stats, only 1 in 6,300 people in the Maldives have died from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. </p>
<p>That’s what I call a big nothingburger.</p>

        <p>Logically speaking it isn’t a threat. The problem is that they are increasing the regulations and locking down the country again, because of increased cases. </p>
<p>There never was such an outbreak, not even in the beginning of the pandemic. It’s only happening now and it has coincided with the mass vaccination that took place. I’m not saying it’s definitely because of it but I’m certainly curious about it.</p>
