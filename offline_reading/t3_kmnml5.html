        <p>&rt;Imagine a scenario, if you will, in which Dr Anthony Fauci is your personal physician, and he comes to you with news about your sickness. It could be pneumonia. It could be cancer. His first assessment is to inform you that you aren’t really that sick and this treatment won’t really do much for you. Then six months later, as you get sicker, he tells you to strenuously begin treating yourself with the very thing he said you did not need. Now imagine another scenario in which the good doctor tells you he was not being truthful with you because he tells you in his gut, you were not ready to hear the truth about how sick you were, but now that you are further along in your sickness and treatment, he can finally be honest with you about steps needed to mitigate your sickness. This would not be acceptable for you or your family. It should not be acceptable for the country as a whole. We shouldn’t live in a health-propaganda state.</p>

        <p>"What is it about humanity that it wants to go to the all detail to stop and listen. Guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, and he doesn’t know anything really about anything, and I’d say that to his face. Nothing. The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there, you will know it. He doesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understand medicine. He should not be in a position like he’s in." </p>
