    <strong>Small long term effects don't matter??</strong>
    <p><p>I hear people say the only side effects are rare like you die after the shot or the theories that people drop dead in 2-3 years. Those are all low risk. I am worried that maybe my physical body has less energy like 5% less in the long run, maybe my immune system is 5% weaker. Those are quality of life issues. Nobody talks about that and it's my real concern. The jab is not worth it to me.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed, it is simply too new to have conclusive data. The threat of covid is minimal. I'm not taking unnecessary risks.</p>

        <p>Yeah unlike our oppressors, I actually eat well and take decent care of myself. I don't want and don't need the vaccine.</p>
<p>And you're right, there is no amount of risk that is worth the reward for something I don't need or want. Also, the fact they censor and label any discussion of side effects as "misinformation" is all the reason more to say no.</p>
<p>There is more to this, though. Yes, the vaccines are bad -- this is obvious. But they also WANT the conflict about it. That's why the same media outlets say, "You MUST get the vaccine or you are the WORST PERSON on the planet." and then in the next report they say, "Here are the terrible side effects you will get if you take it. Look at this photo of this man who exploded into red pus."</p>
<p>My guess is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's an ENORMOUS economic issue that will happen soon, so they want distraction.</li>
<li>Resistance to the vaccine allows them to transfer frustration for the Covid-19 agenda onto a minority of people who don't get vaccinated. (Scapegoatism.)</li>
<li>Resistance to the vaccine allows them to justify Covid-19 Passports (and the CBDC that comes next, as well as the social credit system. It's all coming.)</li>
<li>Fully vaxxed people are suffering from sickness and side effects. As long as unvaccinated people exist, they can say it's their fault.</li>
</ul>
<p>They don't actually want everyone vaccinated or it would impede all the other things they're trying to do.</p>

        <p>yeah. I wish people would realize HOW new this tech is. In the beginning of covid, we were like okay so covid is new, let’s wait a while to gather some data and see how this thing affects people. The wait time for that was about 2-4 weeks. In that time, the virus leaves the body and any long term effects that are going to happen have already begun showing signs (eg: a lingering cough, reduced lung capacity). They won’t show up later randomly and then you say “ahhh that’s because I had covid 20 years ago” because it’s been dead and gone and hasn’t affected your body. The only variable is that we wouldn’t have known how long the effects last for, but would figure it out. The important thing would be that we would at least know what they are and how frequently they happen. </p>
<p>With the vaccine, the immediate effects are also bad. But the thing about data for this is that we don’t know what the effects are of the vaccine staying active in our bodies for long periods of time. Some things don’t cause issues at first, but over time they will. And we don’t know how long it takes for the pressure on the immune system to make it crack. Or not crack. We just don’t know what this “item” does over time. We know what it does after a few months, but after a year? A few years? It could totally change. That’s why vaccines are typically studied for 5-10 years before actually released to the general public for use. </p>
<p>I agree, I would love to know the long term effects, big and small, and it seems like we just aren’t allowed to even ask for a properly controlled product.</p>
