    <strong>"panda eyes"</strong>
    <p><p>i was banned from r/conspiracy it is run by eliteist moderators that cencor at will. </p>
<p>this is facts, and is the truth of everything, fuck covid, fuck anything else, lets look at supporting our kids and making sure we eliminate child trafficking and abuse for good. the discussion starts now </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"panda eyes"</p>
<p>are what elites refer to in some cases for kids, it is a real visible wring under eyes that shows the history for that child has been neglected or abused. they are a "lost soul" and the care system loves them. I say this from expieirnince, when i was in care i was told horrible things by the workers, sometimes they would bring me down when i was already lacking in self confidence at the time. </p>
<p>there are homes out there that have alarms on the kids doors, how is this benficaial to the childs mental health? they must feel like an animal, ive been in homes where i couldnt leave the house, 24/7 staff precense, anywhere i go, they go. thats how it is in care, i go upstairs, they come too. Also, realise these kids are sleeping in "care homes" with strangers. </p>
<p>this needs to be stopped, its not right and its evil</p>
<p>i cant do anything by myself but please listen to me, i am the flagbearer. ive been there and done it all. the alarms are there to mess with your head, its programming, the alarm has a frequency that emits negative and depressing tones to alter peoples minds. (the alarms are only on the kids doors and they staff wake up before to start shift) these alarms are literally killing the kids and preventing them from recovering. this may just be my own story but i say this because of the worry and concern it boils up inside me, i cant not say anything, i need somebody to understand and listen. </p>
<p>this system needs to be shut down we should not be putting our kids into care to let them be raised by "strangers" it is not right or helpful and begs so many question. fuck dbs checks, people can still fly under the radar, look at jimmy, epstiens, ghislaine. its all in plain view for you. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Instead, lets look at supporting the parents, lets look at helping them  learn the skills they need to be effective parent. this help society, this benfiets us, it is what we are suppposed to do. it is the right thing, taking the kid is the wrong thing. </p>
