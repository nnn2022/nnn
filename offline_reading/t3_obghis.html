    <strong>[PRE-PRINT] COVID-9 vaccination increases mortality of unvaccinated European children</strong>
    <p><p>A number of Children die due to spike protein shedding by vaccinated individuals</p>
<p>Disturbing study:</p>
<p>Spike proteins have become the subject of heated debate in recent weeks. "We made a big mistake and didn't realize it until now," said Canadian vaccine researcher Byram Bridle, for example, "we didn't know that the spike protein itself is a toxin and is a pathogenic protein." Bridle was antagonized for this, but received prominent support. "The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is cytotoxic, that's a fact," Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine, mentioned.</p>
<p>Now another study, not yet peer-reviewed, is likely to fuel the debate further. 
The title: "<strong>COVID19 vaccination increases mortality of unvaccinated European children, May-June update.</strong>" </p>
<p>Herv√© Seligmann, a researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, analysed unvaccinated children aged 0 to 14 from 22 European countries between January and May this year. He refers to "Ourworldindata" for the numbers of vaccinations given in the total population and to "Euromomo" for the total weekly mortality.</p>
<p>Study: http://www.nakim.org/israel-forums/download.php?id=851</p>
<p>or alternatively: https://www.mediafire.com/file/68mzz95hohdpz70/Shed-V8.pdf/file</p>
<p>http://www.ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations</p>
<p>http://www.euromomo.eu/</p>
<p>One of its key findings: "Indirect effects of Covid 19 vaccine, putatively through vaccine shedding of spike proteins and/or other molecules, increase all-cause mortality in the unvaccinated - especially in the early phase when vaccination has adverse effects on the vaccinated." Vaccine shedding refers to the transfer of spike proteins or accompanying substances from vaccinated to unvaccinated people through the excretion of fluids such as mucus (through coughing or even normal breathing) or even breast milk.</p>
<p>Seligmann's data show an increase in mortality in the weeks after vaccinations in Europe.</p>
<p>Side effects begin three to four weeks after vaccination</p>
<p>"Children in particular develop adverse reactions to vaccination," Seligmann writes. Particularly worrying, he says, is that adverse effects seem to increase over time. However, this does not rule out the possibility that vaccine shedding also affects unvaccinated adults of all ages.</p>
<p>A sad example is the death of a five-month-old baby in the US who died within two days of her mother receiving her vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine. The mother was vaccinated on 17 March, the day after the baby turned red, developed a fever, refused to eat and would not stop crying. At the hospital, doctors found a high level of enzymes in the liver - a sign of poisoning.</p>
<p>The baby died within two days. According to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), there was no reason for the baby's death other than the indirect effect of the vaccine, which is listed in the VAERS system under event number 1166062-1.</p>
<p>Either visit https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php and enter "1166062-1" in the field titled "Show VAERS ID", then click "Find"</p>
<p>or visit https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?IDNUMBER=1166062-1 for the corresponding record</p>
<p>"Among those under 15 yeras of age who are not vaccinated, adverse effects start three to four weeks after vaccination and gradually increase until the end of the period studied, i.e. 20 weeks after vaccination," Seligmann observed. At the level of the total population of children under 15 in the 22 countries studied, vaccinating one per cent of adults leads to an eight per cent increase in the average weekly death rate of unvaccinated children.</p>
<p>By comparing the health of unvaccinated children with none, one and both parents vaccinated, it is possible to test the extent to which vaccine excretion is responsible for indirect vaccine effects that affect unvaccinated children, Seligmann said.</p>
<p>Negative effects to be expected in the long term for all age groups:</p>
<p>In the absence of adequate analyses - mortality rates are very low among children - vaccine-related increases in deaths go largely unnoticed, the scientist points out. A weekly increase in vaccination by two percent means 58 additional deaths among 60 million children under 15. If this effect were extrapolated to one hundred percent vaccination coverage, this would mean five deaths per 100,000 children due to indirect side effects of the vaccinations.</p>
<p>"These effects are likely to go unnoticed in a large population spread across an entire continent," Seligmann believes. Direct consequences of vaccination are probably more noticeable even without adequate explanations and data analysis.</p>
<p>It should also be borne in mind that the results of this study only refer to the short-term effects of vaccination. Long-term sequelae due to vaccine-induced increases in rates of autoimmune diseases, cancers, etc. are not the subject of this study, according to Seligmann. Nevertheless, he considers them likely - and for all age groups.</p>

        <p>This was likely the only reason they postponed vaccinating children. The covid risk is far lower than the vaccine risks. But the real debate is: if kids can not be vaccinated then the virus will keep spreading. So lockdowns will be indefinite. But to compensate this, anti vaxxers will get blamed.</p>
