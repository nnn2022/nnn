    <strong>I'm getting more and more frustrated</strong>
    <p><p>When I first heard of COVID at the beginning of the pandemic, I was actually quite scared of it. My mum was saying that if you get it, your throat will feel like it's filled with glass and you will get permanent lung damage and stuff. She's still convinced that WILL happen if you get it but I'm trying to convince her otherwise. Thinking about this now, I would say that you would only be at risk of that kind of stuff if you're quite unhealthy already.</p>
<p>I live in Auckland, New Zealand and when we went into our first lockdown in 2020 I think to 'flatten the curve', it wasn't that suspicious yet since we did have quite a lot of cases. (Who knows how many false positives we got though since NZ tests mainly using PCR tests with 45 cycles)</p>
<p>However, earlier this year, my city got locked down for several weeks with ONE case in SUMMER. That was when it started seeming ridiculous to me since how on earth is that remotely logical. Sacrificing so much cuz of one case of a virus with 99.8% survival rate and who knows if it was a false positive.</p>
<p>Even more ridiculous is that even now when we are at zero cases, we are still at an 'alert level'. This means that masks are mandatory on public transport. I'm just so angry at the government for what they're doing to us. If this is how it is at zero cases, how do we EVER get out this mess?</p>
<p>To make things worse, almost everyone actually complies but it does seem like people are slowly waking up. I have to take the train regularly and have been asked to wear a mask multiple times. A few months ago, I was complying but now I'm just like screw them. When they ask me if I have a mask, I just say no and they usually tell me to 'use my jumper in the meantime' or something. I just ignore it and carry on with my day.</p>
<p>Another funny thing is that masks are mandatory nowhere else even though many places other than public transport are arguably higher in risk such as supermarkets. I feel like logic has gone out the window now and it's all about control.</p>
<p>On a side note, my mum, who is generally quite a wise and logically thinking woman, has been a sheep the whole time in this pandemic. She thinks that the government is doing this for our good, the vaccine is good and the virus is dangerous. Unsurprisingly, she watches the news all day. She had planned to get the vaccine in a few weeks but I managed to convince her otherwise. :) Hopefully, she continues to wake up.</p>
<p>In summary: At the beginning of the pandemic, I was rather scared. Then after my country's 'successful' defense of the virus, I was relieved and happy to be in this country. Now I'm just frustrated and pissed off and scared of what the government is going to do next. If the people keep complying, this is never going to end.</p></p>

Looks like hes targeting rand paul and others so they dont have any competition or blowback from the right. Sad times</p>

        <p>We are past the point of voting. We are past the point if meme-ing.</p>
<p>There aren't many options left that I can't think of besides one. </p>
<p>They will never give power back. We have to take it back. </p>
<p>But in my opinion this generation is too soft and decadent. </p>
<p>It likely won't happen until people are starving. And by then they will be in complete control.</p>

        <p>Please keep doing what you are doing and refusing to comply. Each of us that doesn’t wear a mask gives the others who refuse to do it too hope. I always love it when I see people who refuse to be masked going about their daily business and I am sure it makes at least a few of the masked think why are they doing it.</p>
