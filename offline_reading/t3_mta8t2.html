        <p>You’re not wrong, but you have to take into account a lot of redditors are young and not fat</p>
<p>So the likelihood of us dying to covid is super low. Conversely the likelihood of us dying from the vaccine is yet to be undetermined. </p>
<p>What bothers me the most is the lack of good faith between everyone involved. Why isn’t what we put in our body our choice? Why could we perform targeted lock downs to protect those at risk? Why are we gag balling any academic research that is showing that masks aren’t effective? </p>
<p>The fact that dissent is being muted is what truly bothers me the most and I wish more people would just forget the downvote button exists. Because right now you getting downvoted instead of spoken to is making NNN as bad as the subs we hate.</p>

        <p>The probabilities are still very low. For example, if we take 60-69 age gap data from that source, the probability dying is 0.045% and with the vaccine is 0.002 %. That means a difference of 0.043 % between them. Is it really worth it for it for a 0.043%? For me it isn’t, but if you consider it enough it’s your choice and it should be respected.</p>

        <p>Serious question: a lot of people on this sub wave away COVID deaths by citing that most of them were falsely recorded as deaths from COVID when they were really deaths WITH COVID. You realize that exact same logic applies to the vaccine, right? <em>All</em> records of deaths are just people who happened to die after the vaccine, very very few deaths have actually been linked to it.</p>
<p>Excuse my ignorance, but it just seems like NNN are doomers too, just for the vaccines instead; applying the same fearmongering and broken logic.</p>

        <p>I mean, I want to see if there is an abnormal trend upward in unexpected deaths of "natural causes," especially in 20-50 year olds after the vaccine.</p>
<p>We can expect some people to die of these things, it only becomes a concern when a significant more than expected do.  It is possible covid killed all the people who would have died of flu in 2020, which we never even bat an eye at.  It's possible the extra payout caused people to push other death events, like heart attacks onto covid.   That's why it's important to compare it to the average and see how much extra death there was than an average year, and how the age groups break down to really gauge the affect of covid.</p>

        <p>Overall what? Overall vaccines have killed people.  So when you say vaccines don't kill people you are stating something that is false.  Do they save more than they kill? Absolutely.  People still die from them and you straight up said they don't and called everyone stupid.</p>

        <p>1) Go to your local governments stats on covid 
2) take the number of deaths and divide it by the number of cases, this will give you the rate at which people who contract covid are dying at 
3) realize it’s literally 0.1% of people, be humble, admit you were wrong about the whole thing. </p>

        <p>That's cute, you googled an article and linked the pubmed for a reference without referencing the actual journal title (fyi, it's medical hypothesis - a journal that's published papers on AIDS denialism). The article reads more like an opinion piece that makes very liberal interpretations of the sources it uses.</p>
<p>Speaking of government stats, you'll probably notice that the mortality rate changes depending on what time range/region you're looking at. Also, do you think that immediate death from the disease is <em>really</em> the only thing people are concerned about?</p>

        <p>Actual doomers when a million people die of covid- "haha more people die of CARCRASH dumby do your own research the government planned out a virus that isnt real but is real because they made it but they didnt make it deadly, to trick everyone into thinking its deadly. Every government in the world agreed all at once and is on board with it. Also every nurse is being bought out by hospitals, look, I have a TWEET from someone who said she was a nurse and that she was FORCED by DOCTOR FUCCI to smother her clients with a spoon. Wake up sheeple 😎😎" </p>
<p>Doomers when 7 people get a blood clot, maybe from the vaccine - "ITS fuckin poison you morons haha have fun being sterile and mutating and cancer probably I read online how the VIRUS IS IN THE VACCINE and its gonna chance your DNA somehow gene theory morons trying to return to NORMAL?! NO NEW NORMAL EVER. I refuse because I'm a woke boi. Also women that like mask no get my peepee"</p>

        <p>Proof?</p>
<p>Facts?</p>
<p>Or is this just what you've decided to believe? Like, dont get me wrong here, there are ABSOLUTELY points to be made about the inefficiency and short comings of the lockdowns. But uncheck spread would lead to exponentially higher deaths. </p>
<p>Yall love looking at curve graphs and saying "well see, lockdown countries didnt fair much better than other countries"  which is fair, but go look at Indias infection rates for the past week or two. THATS what unchecked spread actually looks like. Exponential. </p>
<p>Criticize where its warranted, point out flaws, but the "Georgian Guidestone" "vaccine will lead to sterile populations" and "everyone but me is an NPC dummy, god I'm so smart" circle jerking in this sub is kind of undermining your points.</p>

        <p>Please don't group me in the "government wants control crazies" but...I did read a study a month ago and unfortunately I can't remember where to find it but it came out of the uk. It said life years lost by the has exceeded life years saved.  Essentially grandparents are 85 and we saved them, they'll die in 3 years so between the 2 we've saved 6 years. Meanwhile, 40 year old mom missed cancer missed cancer diagnosis because non emergency medical procedures were postponed due to lockdowns and her average life expectancy was 80 we lost 40 years.</p>

        <p>My father was diagnosed with stage four cancer in the right kidney, got it removed and is on chemo now. </p>
<p>This year. In February. </p>
<p>Treatment did not just stop because of covid. More precautions were put in place. I literally work in a hospital so anything that is trying to convince you that hospitals just went "oops sorry everyone else thats sick, we're only treating covid now get wreaked with cancer lawl" is an outright lie. </p>
<p>And, I'm basing this off of the information/summery you gave me, it seems to be assuming the only lives saved were people already on the verge of death. </p>
<p>I know as a general rule this sub hates what im about to say, but...anecdotally speaking, I've had to pull several 30 year olds off vents. Because of covid. Did that "study" account for their life expectancy? </p>
<p>Hell, my life expectancy probably dropped from the stress of being LITERALLY screamed at by the parents saying I was faking their sons brain death because...its just the flu, right? Is that accounted for?</p>
<p>Of course not. Because theres absolutely no possible way to account for that. But someone wrote it anyway, and you read it, and it agreed with what you already thought.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your anecdotal evidence.  I have some too. My father died of pancreatic cancer because he couldn't get in for a routine cat scan In October</p>
<p>I don't care about anecdotes.  As I stated a study came out showing the data that the lockdowns are causing more life years lost than saved.  I don't remember where to find it unfortunately but I suggest you try to find it instead of telling me about your life experiences.  We all have them.  I only care about data.</p>

        <p>I literally pointed out that is was anecdotal. My experience working in the hospital, however, is not. </p>
<p>Cancer treatments didnt stop. You made the claim that they did. You are proven wrong by me KNOWING they didnt stop and having a daily exposure to that fact.  </p>
<p>You make the claim, you find the article. I'm not going to go out of my way to find a study that doesnt exist, and if it does exist, uses non measurable units to ascribe pseudo scientific value to human life. </p>
<p>When was the last time your father had a scan? I'd like to know since you dont go typically go from no pancreatic cancer to dead from pancreatic cancer in under a year. It's a rapid form of cancer to be sure, but that timeline seems incredibly unlikely. I think the typical timeline is 15 months from t1 to t4. </p>
<p>Did he have a history of cancer? If so he 100% should have been moved up any waiting list for examination.</p>

        <p>Alright so you're first article. It's just people saying stuff. Anyone can say stuff. It's just a popular article because someone with Doctor in front of their name is making an unbacked, unstudied claim. I could literally link you a dozen articles about the opposite side of the coin. </p>
<p>Your second article. Yeah. Theres probably going to be an economic crash and we need to prep for it. Do you know what would also lead to an economic crash? Uncheck, exponential spread of a virus that would kill a chunk of the labor force at worst, or if you dont think that would happen, cause months of labor reduction while people recovered. Bad things happen sometimes and we were set adrift in an absurd world. Sorry the veil of comfort was lifted. </p>
<p>We can also solve the food scarcity issue at any point and we've had the ability to do so for decades. Sooo...vote left, push for those programs and it wouldn't be an issue. </p>
<p>Your third article literally doesnt even agree with you </p>
<p>&rt;“Before COVID hit the scene, I had already been saying that 2020 was going to be the worst humanitarian crisis year since World War II.” It’s estimated that 9 million people die of hunger each year, more than the death toll of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.</p>
<p>Soo its saying starvation was already going to be a horrible this year. Regardless of Covid.</p>
<p>It's also saying 9 million people were projected to die from it regardless. Covid might make that a little worse but...it was already worse.</p>
<p>And the word "could" is carrying a heavy load in that article. Could starvation be worse because of covid? Yes. Could lifting covid restrictions make the hunger crisis way worse? Yes, it could. Could the fall of Western Civilization solve the hunger crisis? I mean, it /could/</p>
<p>Pretty much anything "could" make hunger worse. That's why we dont use opinion-think peices as evidence. We can use it as a spring board and look at its claims but on their own...well they "could" be factual.</p>
<p>But they "could" just be used to confirm an opinion we already have. </p>
<p>As for your own statement.</p>
<p>&rt;The privileged who can work from home online would never know what is taking place in poorer countries whose economies depend on manual labor.</p>
<p>The united states is a country where people are so busted down and capitalism has gone so unchecked that the majority of people have no savings. We wernt really much better off. </p>
<p>Vote in social programs and fix the country or suffer under the consequences of your own choices. There 100% should have been more social programs in place in case this happened but a large chunk of the country votes against it every 2 years. Its harsh but theres literally nothing that can be done if, when a pandemic hits, the party in charge doesn't care about the people that voted them in.</p>

The rest of us are ready for normal and yall seem super into not letting that ever happen while complaining about how much you want it to happen. </p>

<p>And then called me a doomer. Nice bruh super smart. Now I cant NOT write a paragraph. </p>
<p>Also, and I'll say this till I die of the COvId VacCiNe PoisOnIng me, its absolutely hilarious that you decided to try to call people who wear a mask and do the bare fucking minimum "doomers" while you sit here thinking vaccines are coming for you, doctors are lying, the govenments out to get you and everyone but you is a sheep.You're the doomer.

        <p>You do realize the people you're defending literally insist upon you still wearing a mask and socially distancing even after you've had the vaccine right? I don't call that "getting back to normal".</p>
<p>Wasn't making fun of your accent. I was making fun of your rhetoric. Every doomer that comes on to this subreddit has a bizarre fixation with referring to us as "y'all".</p>
<p>The "fucking point" is that you're all virtue-signaling hypocrites who have preached for over a year about "iF iT sAvEs jUsT oNe LiFe!" to justify the dystopia we now live in yet turn around and scoff off any deaths resulting from the experimental vaccines we're all being aggressively coerced into taking.</p>

<p>The chances of dying from COVID is thousands of times higher than dying from the vaccine. Your chances of dying from the vaccine are less than 1 in a million while over 1/1,000 Americans have already died from COVID. </p>

        <p>You’re using purely anecdotal evidence to form your argument which is both unwise and overall a bad way to do things, but that’s on you. Nationwide data shows the true numbers, not your anecdotal and biased experiences.</p>
<p>The purpose of the vaccine is to lessen the spread of the virus and end the lockdowns. I want things to return to normal just as much as you do. The vaccine will allow people to build herd immunity to protect more people from getting sick. </p>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, herd immunity is benefiting you, too, by lowering the chances of spread. And demonizing the vaccine because it led to 3,005 deaths while portraying COVID as “no big deal” for killing over 566,000 is beyond irrational.</p>

        <p>How can you trust those numbers? Most of them died WITH Covid, not because of.</p>
<p>It's not just my anecdotal evidence but everyone I know (and that's a lot of people). Not one single person knows fucking anyone that's died from or with it. Yet here we are, only now emerging from our third lockdown with dystopian as fuck vaccine passports on the horizon and new scary variants in the news that threaten to circumvent the vaccine (at least that's what the news will report). As much as I want it to, I'm betting this isn't going to end anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Even if the numbers are elevated, which they may be, I’m not sure, there’s no way that the death rate for the vaccines is anywhere close to COVID’s. It’s just not possible. </p>

        <p>I'm personally rejecting it for a number of reasons, main one being it's experimental and we don't know the long term effects of it. Something just feels off about it.</p>
<p>If people want to go get vaccinated that's their choice. What fucks me off is people being forced or coerced into getting it by taking away their freedoms (vaccine passports) and vilifying them for having genuine concerns about it.</p>
<p>Herd immunity is achieved through vaccination AND infection (at least it was until they changed the definition...). The elderly and vulnerable should be prioritized over everyone else. After that it should that person's choice whether or not they want to take the risk or not, as those that would die from the virus have been vaccinated and therefore protected (if they are as effective as you say they are). Personally, I'd rather risk the virus.</p>

        <p>The evidence regarding the vaccines shows more positives than negatives. Yes, the vaccines were made quickly, but that’s because scientists from around the world pooled their sources together to form it. It went through clinical trials just like every other vaccine.</p>
<p>It was the Russian vaccine that skipped some of the trials. That one id definitely avoid lol</p>

        <p>My family member used to test vaccines on rats and mice.</p>
<p>She administered many vaccines that only showed side effects after years. One of them seemed entirely safe, until each rat which was given that vaccine died 2 years later. </p>
<p>These COVID vaccines have only been tested for under a year. How can we know that, let’s say, people won’t begin to die years after they got them? We can’t know that, not until they have been tested for a sufficient amount of time: which they weren’t. You can never know the long-term side effects of a vaccine which was tested for under a year. </p>
<p>I’d rather take a chance with a virus which has an almost definite chance of survival, than an experimental vaccine which could paralyse me in 3 years.</p>

        <p>We shouldn't accuse it's each other. Let's have a serious discussion on this. Let's say these numbers are right, then my only concern is, how do we know if the death was related completely to covid? </p>
<p>Sure, we can say the same about the vaccine, however that will still make all the numbers wrong. To discuss this properly, we need a 1:1 comparison.</p>
<p>The thing is, people on this sub are not even arguing about this. We just say that's it's not OK to accept a vaccine death easily just because it's 1 percent. And somehow the majority of people aren't aware of that. At least that's my feeling.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope we can stop having this discussion soon.</p>
<p>Stay Healthy!</p>

        <p>Deaths from COVID for those under 65: ~110,000</p>
<p>Confirmed cases of COVID for those under 65: ~24.8 million</p>
<p>Chance of dying from COVID for those under 65: ~0.4%</p>
<p>Reported adverse reactions to COVID vaccine: ~55,000 (this figure is believed to only represent 1% of potential adverse reactions, because most go unreported) </p>
<p>80% of COVID deaths were seniors. Of course, their lives matter, and considering that we’ve identified what makes someone vulnerable, those people know who they are and how to protect themselves. There’s no good reason young people and those willing to accept risk should be barred from work, shopping, socializing, exercising, etc. when the vulnerable have every opportunity to keep themselves home. </p>
<p>Healthcare workers, people living with elder relatives, nursing homes, and perhaps some other public offices where in-person contact is absolutely necessary, can/should continue practicing preventative measures. But the average person is at a very small risk for suffering from it or spreading it to someone who can suffer from it. </p>
<p>There’s also little evidence that all these restrictions are actually preventing the spread when put to practice in real world environments. Some of the states with the highest case/death rate are those with the highest restrictions. I’m not seeing a significant statistical difference between open/lax and closed states/countries.</p>
