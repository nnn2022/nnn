    <strong>Hypothesis: Disobedience is ultimately impossible</strong>
    <p><p>A true mechanism of control would account for all possible outcomes, including societal fractures, and a more cosmic extent, existential fractures. Disobedience on the micro and macro levels would be managed by ever more expansive systems of control: successful divergence from the present system is entirely possible due to such divergence being part of a larger control system.</p>
<p>That being said, whatever you do is constantly feeding newer and deeper mechanisms of control: the architecture of the universe is dependent on you, and will accommodate your decisions. It could be said that you are always contributing to the architecture of what could be called "God", and that the extent to which you seek what people call "God", as well as your approach, directly affects your relationship with "control".</p>
<p>Accepting that you are being controlled--and not fighting that--paradoxically grants you the ability to control, thereby allowing you to establish progressively larger levels of dominion over yourself.</p>
<p>The question changes from "How do I free myself?" to "What should I obey?" which is a more important question in my opinion. What to value? What to work towards, work against? Is the true power really what's being presented? How do I best orient myself? What will determine my actions?</p>
<p>"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." <em>-R. Buckminster Fuller</em></p></p>

        <p>May I respectfully suggest that you come down to earth? The flowery words are nice and all, but the reality, at least in the context of this sub, is something a little different. You state in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/nxwmvx/covid_and_the_vaccines_were_presented_in_a_way_to/h1htjcr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3">this post</a>:</p>
<p>“I'm at the point where I'm thinking of getting the vaccine just for the status benefits… I'm just lazy… Whatever "the agenda" is, I don't care… So, fun as it is to think of this stuff as a conspiracy, I can't believe it.”</p>
<p>Have a read through this sub if you’re looking for some useful information. That is if you are genuinely interested.</p>

        <p>We don't have a true mechanism of control yet because we are simply not there yet. </p>
<p>It is up to us to <em>prevent</em> that mechanism of control to allow further disobedience. </p>
<p>I disagree that it's ultimately impossible if action is taken. If no action is taken, then yes, resistance becomes futile. </p>
<p>Then you must comply while making your disobedience clandestine. But you should still disobey where you can. </p>
<p>My landlord is a Holocaust Survivor and has way more survival stories than you'd believe - <em>hours</em> of interviews. </p>
<p>He will tell you. You must <em>never</em> give up your fight. Even in chains. Keep fighting, keep chipping away at the pieces of their walls, and stay alive long enough to watch them perish before you.</p>

        <p>My point is that by disobeying one thing, you obey another. You say we aren't there, that we don't have a true mechanism of control yet--I disagree. I think we are there, but like a horse all saddled up and not knowing his own power, simply under the illusion of control. It can buck at anytime and run off, do its' own thing. I think we, even as individuals, on our own accord, can do things beyond our imagination, and that the primary mechanism of control is that which would inhibit belief--the narratives, the perceived schema of control systems, the cameras, ideas of imprisonment, conspiracy, and other things--these are the saddles that weigh our minds down, that let society ride our brains. And we would do best to take them off.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Become a larger system of control.</p>
