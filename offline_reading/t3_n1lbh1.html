    <strong>We need to talk</strong>
    <p><p>I have looked at some comments from less respectful people who disagree with the beliefs of most users on NNN, and people have received death threats and rape threats for posting an aggressive comment on a post. I understand members of this subreddit most likely receive the same. Both sides think they are doing right. Anti NNN think they are educating crazy people and saving them from covid and Pro NNN think they are saving people from the government and fear mongering. I understand most members of this subreddit are in a tough spot, as not responding to Anti NNN people won't stop the hate you receive, but the message you want to send cannot be sent through hate and aggression, but a real open dialogue.</p></p>

        <p>Those people are generally regarded as pricks bit you can understand where they are coming from, yeah? From their point of view it's as simple as people being too lazy to wear a mask and are therefore killing people. The problem isn't that shallow, but when people feel justified and right, punches aren't held back.</p>

        <p>Nope,  Don't see where they are coming from at all. It takes a truly sick mind to want other people to "off themselves " for not wearing a mask </p>
<p>I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure there were contagious diseases before covid.</p>

        <p>Well said.  But, this is the polarization they have driven us to.  There is no middle ground on any issue.  I respect anyone who chooses to get the vaccine (e.g. my spouse), but I only wish the sentiment went in the other direction.</p>

        <p>I agree...to a certain extent. Don't fight fire with fire is what you are saying. Some of these people considered doomers are open to a civilized conversation. Others just want to be right, and get hostile and call you names when you disagree. It would be nice if we can reach a middle ground, but in reality a lot of these doomers don't want to compromise their position of virtue over the people they consider to be wrong. It is important to decrease the division between us if we want liberty and freedom for all.</p>

        <p>Anti NNN people who come here to troll are attacking free speech. So I'm anti-their-presence here. They have the whole rest of the internet to be their echo chamber, and they can speak freely about anything they want, everywhere. </p>
<p>No need to come here on their attack/"salvation" missions. All they need to do is just talk about what they care about in the rest of the www. And let  us talk about what we care about here. </p>
<p>They should stop trying to silence any opinion that differs from their own. They act as if they are the self-appointed protectors of the universe, and as if the sheer existence of our words out in the world is going to have an automatic killing power over the innocent! </p>
<p>Maybe they should trust others in the world to make sense of ideas in their own ways, and trust that anyone who reads NNN won't automatically be harmed by reading alternative viewpoints! The entire mass media gives them the Approved perspective all day every day. Maybe the brigaders could trust that reading a few words on one subreddit will not automatically undo all the other information out there!</p>
<p>Any idea that can't stand up to a discussion is guaranteed to be a weak idea. NNN isn't going out and attacking anyone else's right to discuss anything. It would be great if others could extend us the same courtesy.</p>
<p>Just in case you happen to know any of them, please pass the live and let live message on.</p>
