    <strong>Our health is our own responsibility, not someone else's...</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all! I have been hanging around this sub for about a month now, it honestly feels like the only place that there are people that makes sense anymore (I'm in Ontario, Canada, so...). I come here all the time just so I don't feel so alone! I'm so thankful it exists. Finally decided to join because I've wanted to put across this point for a while - not sure if anyone has looked at it from this point of view yet, but even if they have, I think it's worth mentioning again. This will probably be a bit long, sorry.</p>
<p>For my entire life I have been allergic to peanuts. And not just "my throat gets a bit itchy" or "I get some hives" or "I throw up but then I'm fine". I'm full on anaphylactic, epi-pen carrying, throat-will-swell-up-and-I'll-die-from-just-the-tiniest-speck-of-peanuts allergic. Having been like this since I was a very young child you can imagine how difficult going anywhere was for me - birthday parties, youth groups, even Christmas time at my relatives' house - everywhere was a potential danger, because at that time having "peanut-free" products was barely a thing. Everywhere I went there were peanut butter cookies, peanuts, peanut butter sandwiches, granola bars with peanuts, you name it. I learned to never touch anything, keep my hands well away from my mouth while I was out, and completely avoid any desserts. I was always that kid at birthday parties who couldn't have any cake.</p>
<p>I am 31 years old now and at the gym where I work, people can still buy CLIF bars with peanuts, coworkers still bring in peanut butter bagels, peanuts, PBJ sandwiches, you name it. They are fully aware that I am anaphylactic and they still choose to do this, and you know what? That's fine. I make them aware that I am allergic, and then I do the same things I have always done - I wash my hands before I eat, I don't touch my face, and I basically act like everything I touch could have come into contact with peanuts. </p>
<p>And I'm fine with this. You know why? Because my health and well-being is my own responsibility and always has been. It is absolutely, 100% my own responsibility to keep myself alive and to avoid situations where I could potentially be in danger. Sure, I could FORBID anyone at work from bringing in peanut products. I could ask management to please stop selling the CLIF bars with peanuts so that no gym members could eat them and then touch the equipment that I might later touch. I could tell everyone in my friend circle that they cannot eat peanuts for at least 2 days before hanging out with me or I will refuse to see them. I could go to court and demand that restaurants stop serving any items that have peanuts in them because *I* cannot eat there for fear of cross-contamination. All of these things would make my life easier, but again, here's the thing - it is not anyone else's responsibility to keep me safe. It is mine and mine alone. </p>
<p>So my point, as I'm sure you have guessed by now, is WHY should I have to take this so-called vaccine just because someone else is worried about catching COVID? If you are that worried about catching it, then it is your responsibility to not put yourself in a situation where you could potentially catch it. It is also your responsibility to make sure that you are doing everything in your power to keep yourself as healthy as possible so that if you do catch it, you will be fine. It is not my responsibility to keep you safe, I'm sorry. You cannot count on other people keeping you safe, they shouldn't have to change the way they live to keep you safe, and they shouldn't have to feel guilty or feel responsible for keeping you safe, either. And if that makes me sound selfish, then I guess I am. But for somebody who has spent their entire life only being able to count on myself to make sure I didn't die, I really don't see why this situation should be any different. Just my way of looking at it. </p>
<p>Sorry for ranting!!</p></p>

        <p>I made this same point about peanut allergies and analogized it with lockdowns and having to ruin our lives to keep other people safe. Of course the replies were quite unkind in April 2020 on FB. People are really quite stupid, canâ€™t do logic.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear it didn't go well last time you brought this up! :/ Unfortunately I'm not surprised to hear that about FB at all. Totally agree with you though - logic seems to have vanished completely these days.</p>
