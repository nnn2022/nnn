        <p>Nick is very well versed in common law, and you used to be able to find videos of him providing free law education for people and how to know your rights. A while back he and his friends essentially tricked police into thinking they were going to open his mma gym during lockdown by talking about it in a facebook group. They did not, however the police organised the media to be outside his gym that day anyway hoping they could use him as an example. He filmed the whole process and it was sickening, unsure if you can still find the video.</p>
