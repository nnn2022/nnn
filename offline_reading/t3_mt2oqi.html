    <strong>When people say "trust the science" what they actually mean is "trust the media." Newspapers, magazines, and other news megacorporations are not science.</strong>
    <p><p>When you research covid 19 through places like Google Scholar, directly accessing peer reviewed science, the picture painted of covid 19 is that a previously unknown zoonotic virus jumped into humans, and while it's very similar to the flu genetically, symptomatically, and in severity, for some as-of-yet unsure reason it's just a real nasty fucker of a thing for anyone whose immune system already has a lot on its plate. If you're healthy, it's just another flu, but for elderly, immunocompromised, and otherwise unhealthy people, it's dangerous enough to warrant active preventative and avoidance measures.</p>
<p>And yet, in the media, covid is this worldwide pandemic that fundamentally threatens our way of life, so severely it warrants indisputably authoritarian government mandated measures. The actual science is only reported on when it fits the narrative; even peer-reviewed scientific papers are not immune to being buried and censored for questioning the narrative.</p>
<p>We need to bridge this divide to the people who pay more attention to their TVs than what's going on outside. Currently, they believe that they're believing the science, it seems to me there should be some collection of all the papers which contradicts this media narrative. Papers like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/">this one</a> discussing the many cons and no pros of masks. If there were one single reddit post, one single website somewhere, a single link any of us could direct someone there and they'd find nothing but meaty, cited, academic works, I feel like that would start changing a lot more minds. </p>
<p>I only ended up here slowly seeing the cracks in the illusion for myself, there was no one NNN post or comment or anything that swayed me to the viewpoint we all share here. I had to figure out for myself that, if it was common knowledge you couldn't trust corporations or the government two years ago, there was no reason why that would all the sudden be different. But, if there were one single link that acted as a repository for all known and new <em>actual</em> scientific knowledge, you would have been able to change my sheep mind eight months ago, as opposed to me only figuring it out in the last month or so.</p></p>

        <p>That‚Äôs why they banned a recent Stanford article about masks and even Biden‚Äôs own member of his covid response team .. both of those happened on twitter. It‚Äôs not trust the science. It‚Äôs trust who has called Jack Dorsey. Jack never pays fines... compromised scum bag.</p>

        <p>I was studying corruption of science a long time before covid, mainly due to pollution and safety issues. Partially for my work.  </p>
<p>I noticed that there is a lot of group-think in science communities, which amplify the false sense of safety. They don't know that the real world is chaotic and does not follow the strict rules of the models. Or even the well defined environments of the laboratory. Additionally, the small adaptions and model simplifications together are adjusted towards the wanted result. So in a chain of 6 people you get a huge systematic bias, which is hard to overcome.</p>
<p>And they also don't know that people lie. Many are nerds and think that everyone is like them. But some simply cheated through the exams, or are there to make quick money. Statistical manipulation like P-hacking are pretty standard and most people can not see through it. Many scientists even think that it is normal statistics.</p>
<p>But most importantly: companies are for profit and not for science, so any "science" that they produce can be taken with a grain of salt. Their "science" is more a part of the sale-department. And for universities their "science" is the source for funding.</p>

        <p>The only reason it was a pandemic in the first place is because the WHO changed the definiton of pandemic. It used to be about deaths, now it's about the % of infected regardless of deaths. So using this definition, we have been in a pandemic every winter with the flu or common cold since beginning of mankind.</p>

        <p>The media isn't in the truth telling business.  They're in the advertising business, and people are programmed to feast on negativity.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs a problem with the business model in current year. </p>
<p>Either pay a large amount of money to have investigative journalists and maybe come back with a nothingburger of a story or have to put the information out in a way that politicians hate or people with short attention spans further ruined by smartphones will understand. </p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Pay effectively minimum wage to have ‚Äújournalists‚Äù come up with clickbait titles. </p>
<p>The latter makes more economic sense than the former but businesses end up trapped in a cycle where they have to come up with increasingly ridiculous stories.</p>

        <p>And all of them do not know what the scientific method is...</p>
<p>You first observe, research, hypothesize, test your theory, analyze the data, come up with a conclusion and repeat the cycle again  </p>
<p>People seem to think it ends after coming up with a conclusion, and is definitive. <br>
Well guess what, not too long ago the scientific community thought the Earth was at the center of the universe, then they thought Earth was at the centre of the solar system and everything revolve around it.<br>
And they come up with shit like "well I guess gravity isn't definitive either"... fucking dumbshits</p>

        <p>But you‚Äôre not even correct in that. They aren‚Äôt both Coronaviruses... </p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a Coronavirus obviously, but Influenza is an Orthomyxovirus, an entirely different family from an entirely different major group of viruses. </p>
<p>The only genetic similarity is that they‚Äôre both single-stranded RNA viruses, which is an incredibly superficial and mostly meaningless similarity. They‚Äôre even read in opposite ways (sense vs antisense). </p>

        <p>Then I really have to dispute the ‚Äòvery similar in severity‚Äô part of position. COVID-19 has dramatically differently severity than the typical Coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and not just those with some degree of frailty.

<p>Yes, you should be critical of the media and the government and not simply take things at face value. But conversely you should also not parrot unsubstantiated claims that are outright false and/or misleading. The article you've posted is even in its own words a hypothetical thesis. It rambles both back and forth claiming that face masks are simultaneously ineffective at preventing transition but are also detrimental to your mental health and can lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Yes, part of the scientific process is challenging ideas and assumption by peer review.  But being an armchair virologist doesn't make you an expert, especially when your intent is to look for confirmation bias. Literally no on uses the phrase "trust the science" outside of this sub. Being a cynical contrarian doesn't make you enlighten or smarter.</p>

        <p>&rt; Every single scientist and medical professional around the world have only encouraged masks.</p>
<p>That's bollocks. This time last year we were being told by scientists not to wear masks as healthy individuals as they <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-news-face-masks-increase-risk-infection-doctor-jenny-harries-a9396811.html">could increase the risk of infections</a>.</p>
<p>And there were debates and discussions around it precisely because there was no clear evidence for their usefulness in the healthy population and, honestly, there still isn't, especially when you look at the larger statistical picture and cannot pinpoint the moments mask mandates came into effect on the epidemic curves. Even the WHO when they flip flopped over the issue due to political pressure still kept a caveat emptor in their recommendations around masks citing there was no compelling or robust evidence for the general public to use them.</p>

        <p>Wow, that's real meaty there mate. Like in what you linked, clearly the author set out to prove a point. Just like CNN does. And it is effective at influencing people, and it would be a sin not imitate effective technique wouldn't it? Influencing is a real art, me personally I've got huge respect before influencers. They are like literal mages, a couple of words and a gesture and like a stock crashes or something.</p>
<p>I get it, you're evil and don't care about grandma and the immunocompromised, to you reading facial expressions is more important than A LIFE, but they? They'll save those lives. The will reduce the spread whatever it takes, if it means lying, emotional manipulation, gaslighting - so be it. They are willing to bear the ire of the ancestors. And they are doing it for good (saving a life is ALWAYS good, as long no lives are lost in return) and against evil who literally thinks murder is ok because he "can't breathe" or something. Even a freaking furry can breathe.</p>

        <p>There is a difference between being alive and living. I choose to live and not just be alive. I would rather die doing what I love than live as a shell of a human. If you are so afraid of living, the burden is on you to stay hidden in fear. The burden is not on me to play into your paranoia.</p>
