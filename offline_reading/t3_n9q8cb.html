    <strong>Go ahead. Call me reckless. Call me stupid.</strong>
    <p><p>At the beginning of this crap, my wife and I we were a little scared but quickly after some time had passed we saw through the garbage. </p>
<p>Our daughter, who is in 2nd grade, essentially got an extended spring break in 2020. It wasn’t until months later until the school decided to do things online and this is where we saw the change in her. She wasn’t as social, we weren’t as social and just the black cloud of covid haunted us as a family. </p>
<p><strong>Finding GOD.</strong> Look, for my entire adult life I would best describe myself as agnostic and would actively seek to argue with Christians about their beliefs. Never in my life did I ever think I’d step foot in a church again and I didn’t until 2020. At first, it was all about my daughter and allowing her to see kids her age and to see people smile but it has grown into so much more than that. I’ve found the answers to everything that’s happened in my life for better or for worse and it all has a meaning and purpose that brought me to the point I am at today. </p>
<p><strong>Reckless Behavior.</strong> Now on to the title of my post. Somewhere around either April or May of 2020 is where we as a family started going to church. We have done so EVERY Sunday since. And every Sunday we have been mask free around maybe 900-1000 other people. (Large church in San Antonio, Cornerstone Church). This isn’t just for 1.5 hours though during service. We even go to the night time service. We also enjoy all of the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Y0CaBZC">fun activities</a> our church put on throughout the year. All of them mask free. I’ve gone to see my family, extended family in KS came here and the in-laws from PA came to visit and went to church with us. All of this time and all of these interactions were mask free. I hardly wear a mask anywhere anymore regardless if a sign exists or not. Ive been to the hospital and the VA, maskless. I purchased (2) cars, maskless. Man, I could go on and on regarding the “reckless” behaviors myself and my family have done the past year.</p>
<p>Guess what? None of us. Not my wife, my daughter or I. No one in our family here or the family that visited from out of state ever got covid. </p>
<p>I say all of this to tell those on the fence, go out and have fun. Be normal because you can be normal. </p>
<p>I give thanks to God every day for providing us these opportunities because we, as a family, would be in a different spot right now if it weren’t for Him.</p></p>

        <p>God is a provider to all those that respect and worship him, however, dark times are coming. Stay safe brother, they'll be hunting down us believers one day or another. Know that you'll be saved by the Lord, whatever happens, if you are with His Truth, and not the lies of men and the beast system.</p>
<p>I  do the same: I go maskless every day, I risk a fine of thousands of euros here, but nobody says a thing.</p>

        <p>Great post. Without committing so fully to the community aspects of the church, I have similarly crossed over to this point of view and really do believe that God is the antidote and key to this madness driven by Communism and Marxist ideology — the first precept of which being an atheistic worldview.</p>

        <p>Nothing says you love god by saying fuck everyone else imma refuse even basic safety standards. I remember how being a good religious person means you do everything for yourself and don’t care about others at all. Good to know you use religion to justify being a shellfish prick.

        <p>Whatever you decide to call it, there’s no reason for you to be berating someone for having a different belief system from yours, especially when according to your own belief system, it won’t matter what you believed in at the end of the day—everyone (Christian, atheist, or otherwise) would be dead as door nails regardless. </p>

        <p>A common understanding (and practice) of basic manners and courtesy is essential to a civilized society.</p>
<p>For example, if you see a girl who is wearing an exceptionally unflattering outfit, you are likely to have opinions about her appearance. You certainly can share those opinions - but you just as certainly should not, because doing so violates our standards for manners and courtesy towards others (in other words, you would be an asshole even if you are right). </p>
<p>Similarly, if you see someone who is deeply upset and crying about something that you consider absolutely ridiculous and not worth any attention, much less tears, you can certainly say so - but you just as certainly should not, because doing so violates our standards for manners and courtesy towards others (in other words, you would be an asshole even if you are right). </p>
<p>The common thread in these situations is that sharing your opinion would be needlessly hurtful, with no benefit (your narcissistic pleasure in making sure the world knows what you think doesn’t count). You cause harm without any resulting productive outcome, and thereby simply make things worse for other people - you ruin a day, encourage insecurity, etc. </p>
<p>You are right, you are free to do this. But by all standards of our society, choosing to hurt and offend people when you have the option of simply keeping your opinion to yourself (or sharing it later in private if necessary) absolutely makes you an asshole. </p>
<p>It is your right to behave like an asshole, but that doesn’t mean it is a good or admirable choice. If you are going to choose to behave like an asshole, at least have the honesty to own that choice instead of cowering behind your childish defense of what you are “allowed” to do.</p>

        <p>&rt;The fuck has some imaginary friend got to do with anything? May as well thank the avengers.</p>
<p>Let us take the presumption that the imaginary friend does NOT exist, what harm has this individual done but do positive things in their life? Isn't this the type of activities that we, as a sub-reddit, condone and encourage? I would like to think so.</p>
<p>If this imaginary figure, as you put it, inspired this man to break free of his chains, I count that as a win, and would continue to encourage this man and his family to stay free. What comes from that?</p>
<p>I get it, you don't believe in God, okay, that is your right, and you have a right to believe in sticks and stones, as long as you don't throw them me or any one else. </p>
<p>We get inspired from different things, and I think you're misunderstanding the OPs post that he is pushing religion. I think you need re-read his post, and he says it himself, "<strong><em>I say all of this to tell those on the fence, go out and have fun. Be normal because you can be normal.</em></strong>" He goes on to say what <strong><em>inspired him</em></strong>, and he thanks God for it because that was his source of inspiration. We get inspired to do great things from all walks of life, I got inspired to become a prepper from my older brother. I also became an avid reader from reading the book the Art of War, by Sun Tzu. Many people get inspired to do well for themselves after reading fiction, does that make these people delusional?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can argue the harm is relaying on a non-existent entity to pull you through life. You have the will within you yourself. You are God and the orchestrator of your universe, your emotional strength, you are the alpha and the omega. The cosmos exists within your conscious.  I believe everyone is strong enough to not require a god to hold their hand. If God was real he is not needed. He is weak and insecure, afraid of man. The action that religion somewhat advocates that if you're at a low then faith in a God can save you sounds like an oppression tactic to me.</p>

        <p>You're missing the point. Based on your logic then the majority of humanity then is delusional. That because of this delusion they are incapable of making any sound decision, including myself. That is a huge presumption since you do not billions people what makes them get out of bed in the morning or what inspires them to achieve great things.</p>
<p>You wrote, "I believe everyone is strong enough to not require a god to hold their hand" and you know what? You're wrong; not every one is you or I. Every one is built differently and are the products of their circumstances and environment. Your scientific approach works for YOU, but does not work for the OP. Who knows, may be in time, he will find inspiration as you do through science, but for right now, he has found God, and look at what that concept is inspiring him to do, and he is <strong><em>HAPPY</em></strong>. Would you rather have him suffocating under the stress that there is no hope, and he has no avenue to find inspiration which would lead him down a path of tragedy? </p>
<p>These people like the OP are not weak minded people. A weak person does not come on to this sub-reddit and spill their guts from how low in life they were, to where they are now; a weak person does not do that. The worse thing to do is call some one crazy outright without understanding what led them to where they were because it is dismissive. Have you ever considered the fact that may be the environment is sick?</p>

        <p>Yes majority of the world are delusional and I think the presence of this sub supports that. Majority of the world are on the side of governments and their positions on covid. I don’t believe you or anyone else is incapable of making sound decisions but if your motive is because of a God then that is truly terrifying. </p>
<p>You telling me I am wrong, and not everyone is capable of being in a better place out of their own will is exactly why I associated religion with oppressive tactics. You sound like [a] government. In fact you use the same discourse style as the Democratic Party in the U.S.
“You can’t make it because the system is against you”</p>
<p>I get the impression that I’m being told “Life is poor because you haven’t accepted God, it will improve if you do”. Well bollocks to that. I am God.</p>
<p>If a person is susceptible to religion then any self help program will work and that’s all it is. </p>
<p>I know the benefits of being exposed to religious communities and believe they are some of the best people anyone can meet. I’ve associated with Mormons, Sikhs, Christians and Hindus and they are always wonderful, kind and helpful.</p>

        <p>&rt;I don’t believe you or anyone else is incapable of making sound  decisions but if your motive is because of a God then that is truly  terrifying.</p>
<p>You have a misunderstanding of what motivated that man to lift his chains. Clearly you are stuck in the mindset that there can no be motivations outside of science, you fail to recognize the concepts of philosophy, humanism, secularism and basic human decency which have been around since man walked the Earth.  </p>
<p>&rt;I get the impression that I’m being told “Life is poor because you haven’t accepted God, it will improve if you do”. Well bollocks to that. I am God.</p>
<p>Uh no, I am not telling you anything. If you want to be God, Ghandi, Buddha, Yip Man or the rocks and stones, that is on you. I am sure you heard of the concept of free will, right? </p>
<p>If a concept or idea improves the life of a human being, mentally and physically, what is it to you that person has found a way to live a better life? He is harming no one. Whether he continues to believe in God, that his business, as long as he leads a good productive life free of any chains.</p>
<p>&rt;I know the benefits of being exposed  to religious communities and believe they are some of the best people  anyone can meet. I’ve associated with Mormons, Sikhs, Christians and  Hindus and they are always wonderful, kind and helpful.</p>
<p>Irrelevant, and pointless; I've associated with practically the same folks, that still doesn't make me anything more then you.</p>
