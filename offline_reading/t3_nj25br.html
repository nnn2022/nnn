    <strong>COVID Conspiracy Theory</strong>
    <p><p>The last couple weeks we‚Äôve gotten new information that builds a narrative for how Covid is being used to create a New Normal. One is broader acceptance that COVID may have been manufactured by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Wuhan lab. There is a Chinese defector and scientist named Dr. Li Meng Yan who claims Covid is man-made given the structure of the virus. The second is that senator Rand Paul may have proved Dr. Fauci approved US funding of gain of function research of coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab. Dr Yan argues the Chinese military used their learnings from gain of function research to create COVID, a bioweapon.</p>
<p>In the past Tony Bobulinski claimed Joe Biden tried to create a shell company so Hunter Biden could collect money from Chinese businesses (owned by the CCP). In addition there‚Äôs another claim that Chinese assets were giving Hunter political advice for Joe Biden. Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop appears to corroborate this information (refers to Joe Biden as ‚Äúthe chairman‚Äù). Rep. Eric Swalwell (D) was caught working and having sex with a Chinese spy. Another controversial issue is Trump‚Äôs claim that Joe Biden cheated in the election. If you‚Äôve followed this issue one of the claims is COVID was used to justify last minute rule changes and mail in ballots which enabled large scale cheating. COVID was used as an excuse to exclude Republican poll watchers from ensuring the votes were counted accurately and state election laws were followed.</p>
<p>From this it‚Äôs not hard to develop a conspiracy theory that COVID is the creation of the CCP, Dr. Fauci and Joe Biden collaborating to remove Trump from office. Just before COVID struck Trump was implementing a tariff and cracking down on CCP business interests. We all know how COVID has been used to demonize people who are skeptical of big (communist) governments and support individual liberty. Is it possible the CCP used COVID to get Joe Biden elected? Is the CCP using Joe Biden to protect their business interests and to make communism the new normal in the US? This doesn‚Äôt even touch on the censorship by Big Tech, which has to follow the orders of the CCP to do business in China. </p>
<p>I doesn‚Äôt necessarily think all these things are true, but it seems closer to the truth than the mainstream narrative.</p></p>
