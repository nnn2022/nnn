    <strong>Brainstorming protest ideas: Anti-Lockdown Autonomous Zone in NYC</strong>
    <p><p>Clearly this isn't going to end until the anti-lockdown people begin to revolt en masse. With that said, the one thing keeping us controlled and docile is that we are unable to gather effectively in order to generate enough attention and inspire the (I'm assuming) absolute fuck-ton of people who are quietly criticizing this stupidity but are not confident enough to speak up.</p>
<p>the NYC metropolitan area is the most populated and camera-filled place in America. Whether you disagreed with it or not, the Autonomous Zone concept has proven to work for generating media buzz. Occupy Wall Street was very attention-grabbing and shows there's a large population of young people in the NYC area that is willing to create enough chaos that the media can't help but look.</p>
<p>The one thing we got going for us compared to Occupy or Chaz is that our demands are clear and simple: Open everything back up. Truthfully, this is the only way. There needs to be a clear response to tyranny.</p></p>
