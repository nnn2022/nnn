    <strong>Discussions with the "other" side are many times futile...</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure you all have tried discussing with someone who believes we should all mandatorily vaccinate ourselves with the new shots for the sake of humanity. They get all suddenly philanthropic, but when you state a fact, it's always you having to provide the source. When you ask them for their sources they deviate the subject and turn you into an apathetic anti-vax moron without any empathy. </p>
<p>The funny thing is when you're actually pro-vaccines, but you still get called anti-vax for not wanting some new experimental and potentially harmful new technological medical treatment into your body. Thus the discussions are most of the time futile because even when the scientific sources are provided, they're just tossed away and ignored. Yet you keep trying... That's the issue right there, do you stop trying because it's futile and a waste of time? But then if we stop trying, we risk going further into the black hole of this dystopia.</p></p>

        <p>I 100% concur with what you wrote. But concerning the constant demand of sources, it gets even more ridiculous when they flat out refuse to look at them after you painstakingly found the one quote they got hung up upon, even if it had been talked about for months in the media. 
(Just to give a flavor: "no, organization XY did not say Z" (by that time, organization XY had been on the news every single day with that one specific claim, but it's been half a year since, and it was a pain in the ass for you to find actual sources that haven't been edited without a notice of retraction.))
"No, I won't look at the Proletarian Daily, that is a right wing conspiracy paper". (Obvious and fictitious example) Like wth.
"Yes, they said it like that and acted accordingly, but they didn't mean it that way, the mere fact that you mention it shows me you are a nutjob."
Another example:
<em>Opens topic out of nowhere, you disagree and provide evidence</em>
"Alright, maybe you found some peer reviewed meta analyses in a high impact level scientific journal, but this tumblr blog says otherwise. Also what is your obsession with constantly bringing up facts when they suit you? Just goes to show you're obsessed with this and probably picked your data carefully." Like what!?</p>
<p>Sorry, had to vent. It really hits close to home when people you have a lot of respect for, or who you deem very intelligent, or even family suddenly behave this way.</p>
<p>As to your point if we should try anymore.
I don't know. I fight becoming cynical. But it's a hard fight. More often then not thoughts of Schadenfreude creep into my mind.
With those who strut around like a pigeon that just walked all over a chess board and thinks it won, I don't engage anymore. My mental health is important too, and so is yours.
I think it's Solzhenitsyn who says that even in the authoritarian death camps he survived, people who voted in that very system wouldn't acknowledge how they erred.
They're brainwashed, and it's hard to come out of that.
Think of it as an emotional, psychological or intellectual impairment, it's different from person to person. You wouldn't hate on people with mental problems, just try to apply that stance here as well. My take is to try and help wherever and whenever possible in a nonjudgmental way.
I try to give people who have taken damage from the jabs (I know a handful closely) some info (e.g. many people with elevated vitamin d3 levels should have their doctor check if they suffer from low d2, things like that) or try to convince them to go to a doctor who actually takes the time to talk to them and assess the situation, instead of one that sees hundreds of patients per day.
Maybe most important of all, I try to give them hope. I think we all could need a little bit more of that.</p>

        <p>I've been anti-vaxx for many, many years and have never minded being called an anti-vaxxer. The thing is that our side is infinitely more knowledgeable with data than the brainwashed zombies which is why they will never admit that they were wrong and that they were deceived. The cake has been baked and the schism is now permanent (barring supernatural intervention). I don't expect anyone who is pro-NN, pro-mandatory vaxx, etc can ever changed by themselves. I officially resigned on the 1st of July because it would mark \~18 months since we saw that the virus wasn't deadly on the 6,900+ passenger World Dream cruise liner in Jan 2020.</p>

        <p>Youre not having an actual discussion.  Your arguing against emotion.</p>
<p>Often when they ask for source, they are going to negate it anyway, even if the source was from God himself, written on the 10 commandment tablets.</p>
<p>The best way to start the discussion is to ask if there is anything you can say that will make them change their mind or if their conclusion already decided.  I have found, that if they are willing to answer that, then they have to take steps to not do the things that they would normally do.  They tend to be on their best behavior.</p>
<p>Its not a silver bullet.  Just remember, that if your goal is to persuade them or win the argument, theyre not likely to get there.  However, I have pointed out that any source I cite or any response I give will likely elicit the same canned response and they are likely tying it up before I even respond.  It tends to soften them up or it has an effect on those listening in.</p>

        <p>A few things-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start saving links and studies that dispute the mainstream narrative in your notes on your phone, for easy access when you need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t use the term anti vax. Youre pro medical choice and freedom. It’s a simple issue. When you frame it that way it’s harder to argue against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the people in your area who are protesting this and join them. We are the majority. Search groups in your area with “no mandates”, “medical freedom”, and similar keywords. There are even small actions that have a big impact when enough people do them. </p>
</li>
