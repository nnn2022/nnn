        <p>Must be fun living in an echo chamber - sitting on a fold out chair in front of a crowd of your peers, furiously masturbating using gun lube while holding an American flag patterned vibrator up your ass. All while they cheer you on - telling you how strong you are for not following the sheeple until you splooge all over yourself, feeling the hot, sticky glory of your own retardation warm on your skin. Everyone cheers harder as your head stops spinning and you open your eyes. You feel satisfied because you’re better than everyone else, and everyone around you thinks so too. You masturbate again, eat a Big Mac and go to sleep all to do it again the next day. I yearn for your life. March on soldier.</p>

<p>a <strong>DAILY</strong> 1.8% decrease in new cases is not insignificant. This is compound interest.</p>
<p>If you were getting 10,000 new cases per day, then at a 1.8% daily decrease you'll be seeing around 5800 new cases after 30 days. Assuming it stays at 1.8% another 30 days and it goes to 3362, another 30 days and it's 1987.</p>

<p>I disagree. That assumes that with masks, 98.2% of cases still happen. As a result masks are 98.2% ineffective.</p>
<p>So no, they don't work.</p>
<p>On top of that, cases don't matter, deaths do. And the death count is not in any way correct.

<p>This is some serious cognitive bias. Did you read my last paragraph about a reduction of 80% to new cases after 90 days and involuntarily wiped it from your memory?</p>
<p>&rt;On top of that, cases don't matter, deaths do.</p>
<p>I think you'll find new cases correlate with deaths, regardless of which country you look at.</p>
<p>&rt;But hey ignore the blatant lies and embrace the false idea that 1.8% (essentially margin of error) is in any way worthwhile.</p>
<p>The study was working with  "<em>Data on cumulative county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from state and local health department websites and accessed through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Protect</em>"</p>
<p>When you're working with such enormous data, and there is a clear downward trend before reaching -1.8% at the 80-100 day mark is no longer a margin of error.</p>
<p>Can we just acknowledge your mental gymnastics. Having referenced a study you thought proved your point, only to be told it's actually the opposite. You now denounce the study and say it's all bullshit anyway.</p>
<p>Now I could spend all day referencing all sorts of studies that disproves your anti-mask agenda but lets be real, like all conspiracy theorists you're going to double down and keep on reading only the things that agree with your narrative.</p>
<p>Don't do what you did today and reference an actual scientific study. Science isn't your friend.</p>

<p>No I've read it. Doesn't matter. </p>
<p>If masks worked. We'd see a far greater reduction in cases. But hey, let's look at all the facts.</p>
<p>Masks aren't needed in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/news/asymptomatic-transmission-of-covid-19-didnt-occur-at-all-study-of-10-million-finds?fbclid=IwAR0AGG3xmf8G3tYbPL5Kpk6L5OHp8kGd7BDueemZnuidKgPu8UbjuSSGCKI&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 didn’t occur at all, study of 10 million finds</a></p>
<p>https://hellboundanddown.com/2020/12/26/university-of-florida-researchers-find-no-asymptomatic-or-presymptomatic-spread/</p>
<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</a></p>
<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestdempsey.com/bacterial-pneumonia-and-other-health-risks-of-wearing-masks-alarm-doctors/#:~:text=Dr.%20Meehan%20said%20that%20reports%20from%20around%20the,suffer%20reduced%20oxygen%20supply%20due%20to%20wearing%20masks.">Dr. Meehan said that reports from around the world are pointing at a notable rise in bacterial pneumonia among people using masks.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>&rt;I think you'll find new cases correlate with deaths, regardless of which country you look at.</p>
<p>Cases don't even correlate with cases, as they're heavily inflated. The PCR test has proven to be unreliable at every turn</p>
<p>&rt;When you're working with such enormous data, and there is a clear downward trend before reaching -1.8% at the 80-100 day mark is no longer a margin of error.</p>
<p>That depends on if one factors in all the variables. Without a control group we have no clue if the virus was already on its way out. Keep in mind that it has shown to follow seasonal numbers much like the flu.</p>
<p>&rt;You now denounce the study and say it's all bullshit anyway.</p>
<p>I'm not denouncing the study. I'm telling you your interpretation is wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;Now I could spend all day referencing all sorts of studies that disproves your anti-mask agenda</p>
<p>There's not a single real world study that shows masks work. </p>
<p>&rt;Don't do what you did today and reference an actual scientific study.</p>
<p>Why? Every study supports the idea that masks do not work.</p>

        <p>100 yards.</p>
<p>I was going to re-zero my scope but it got far to windy so I just sent rounds down range for the memes. I took my scope off to use blue threadlock so ya.</p>
<p>I can usually hit the 1ft gong at 300 yards with little to no trouble with surplus 5.56. I'm actually looking for a range that has a further target so I can actually be challenged. </p>
<p>If you missed the comment, Ruger American Ranch in 5.56.</p>

<p>Here is where the CDC states "DO NOT use facemasks."</p>
<p>http://archive.today/RKdWc 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/84900</p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

<p>WHO does not recommend masks
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.

http://archive.today/4SGYt</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>
<p>http://archive.is/CfQBO</p>
<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

http://archive.today/rib2o</p>
<p>University of Minnesota CIDRAP
"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

<p>PCR test and the pandemic that wasn't:</p>
<p>“Because we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,” she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants.</p>
<p>“That’s how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,” Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days."</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Much like how I likely more far more about guns and computers than you do. </p>
<p>Your entire world view is that of someone who can't imagine the need to use a firearm. So what, upper middle class liberal from a family in a mostly white neighborhood?</p>

        <p>And, what message are you broadcasting here? To me this seems like you are ignorant scared and armed. Expressing yourself by shooting at a mask that represents some made up oppression. You follow speed limits right, do you think drunk driving and wearing seat belts is oppression too? Grow up dude.</p>

        <p>&rt;And, what message are you broadcasting here?</p>
<p>That I shot a mask as a target because I ran out of paper. This is tagged a "humor" not "threats against the life of presidents". </p>
<p>&rt;To me this seems like you are ignorant scared and armed.</p>
<p>Ignorant? At worst this is showing I can hit a known target size at 100 yards. At best this is me using a piece of trash from the floor of my car as a target.</p>
<p>The gun I used, a Ruger American Ranch is a bolt action gun using a calibre that's banned from hunting deer in most of Canada and some states due to its low lethality. Get back to me in 6 months when my SW 500 Magnum is repaired and you can talk about how I'm doing a "shoe of force" or some shit.</p>
<p>On top of that, ignorant of what? These are literally one time use masks. This is one of the 3 big Rs, Reduce, Reuse Recycle.</p>
<p>This has been reused.</p>
<p>Granted I do not support masks and will not wear them.</p>
<p>&rt;Expressing yourself by shooting at a mask that represents some made up oppression. </p>
<p>My local government stopped the mask manage today, or the day this was taken if you're in a different time zone. </p>
<p>So yes, I shot a mask that was a symbol of a provincial government's overreach of power.</p>
<p>&rt;You follow speed limits right</p>
<p>Depends how late for work I am. I usually go the speed limit due to better fuel efficiency, but I do not always.</p>
<p>&rt;do you think drunk driving and wearing seat belts is oppression too?</p>
<p>Driving laws exist as the roads are government property. They have the right to make these laws.</p>
<p>They do not have the right to enforce laws on clients in a personal place of business. </p>
<p>This is not a valid comparison. Especially as both drunk driving and no seatbelts are allowed in most places with exceptions. Such as a low enough BAC, usually .08 or so, and no seatbelts in vehicles built without such as old classic cars. Hell, even a lot of States allow riding in the truck bed of a truck without a seatbelt.</p>
<p>So no, your comparison has no merit here. Try again.</p>
<p>&rt;Grow up dude. </p>
<p>Bud you're the one mad I reused literal trash as a target. Grow the fuck up and let people enjoy life. I haven't asked you to change a damn thing in your life, and I never will.</p>
