    <strong>Biden's "Masking for 100 days" plan makes me so angry!</strong>
    <p><p>Biden says he will ask Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days of presidency.</p>
<p>He says and I quote " “It’s only 100 days to mask, not forever. 100 days. "</p>
<p>This makes me angry on so many levels. First it completely ignores the fact that we have been doing this for months! I have been wearing a mask whenever I go out since at least early June!! That is 193 days!! Well over 100 days, and guess what, it hasn't worked!!</p>
<p>No acknowledgement of that from him, no acknowledgment at all of what we've already done!</p>
<p>And the second thing that completely pisses me off about that statement is the fact that he say's "it's only 100 days, not forever" </p>
<p>Well he'd better well know it won't be forever I'll tell you that. But he's completely lying when he says "only 100 days". Sure nobody will remember this quote by then, and it won't ever be brought up ever again, I'm sure. But I can absolutely assure you will NOT be only 100 days. It will be well, well beyond that when we're allowed to take the masks off. You know why? Because 100 days from January puts us in mid April. Not everyone is going to be vaccinated by then. So how can he just pick some arbitrary even number and say "oh just 100 days, that's it". If you don't know, then don't say "just 100 days."</p>
<p>If he did bring it up again, and say, well the 100 days is up, I'd say he did a good thing and stuck to his word. But he will never do that, because it's impossible that this will be over in 100 days.</p>
<p>I was also reading today about this, and the comments were "it won't be long enough". And then someone replied "well at least it will get people doing it for 100 days. After a certain amount of time it becomes a habit and there won't be any pushback."</p>
<p>Uh-huh. So they want us to get into a habit of doing this. And then once we get in a habit we just never stop. I see, and these people think they are geniuses and smarter than everyone else so just need to trick us into getting into a habit of wearing masks subconsciously. That sounds great.</p></p>

        <p>You know what pissed me off irationally hard today, a billboard outside the supermarket, it said: Mask off, Tuck in. As if I am expected to wear the damn thing all day, everywhere and just take it off before laying down to sleep. F* Em! And for sure, it wont be just 100 days.</p>

        <p>It feels like they want you to weld it to your face. I wouldn’t have a problem with it if they didn’t take it to such an extreme, wearing a mask when your on a walk alone. And they’re so obnoxious about it.</p>

        <p>Speaking of 100 days, here's the summary of the last 100 days of academic papers on masks (+ let's remember that not all types of published evidence are equal: meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials sit at the top of the <a href="https://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rbof/v78n6//0034-7280-rbof-78-06-0413-gf01.jpg">biomedical evidence hierarchy</a>, and should be given more weight than laboratory/mechanistic and surveys/observational/correlational studies): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted: 
&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>18 November</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. 
A Randomized Controlled Trial</em>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">(Bundgaard et al., 2020)</a>. This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study: 
&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. <strong>Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>17 November</strong> 2020, <em>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> published <em>Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504">(Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>27 October</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">Chou et al., 2020</a>), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded: 
&rt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in <em>community settings</em> remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in <em>health care settings</em> remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>25 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Frontiers in Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</em>, by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full">(Wang et al., 2020)</a>. The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded: 
&rt;Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is <strong>not significantly associated</strong> with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>22 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Environmental Research</em> published <em>The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: Hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities</em>, by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311208?via=ihub">(Rodríguez-Barranco et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;<strong>In the case of masks, the results of this study slightly suggest the opposite effect to that of protection</strong>, possibly due to misuse of masks by the general population untrained in their use.</p>

        <p>I do think that putting an actual hard stop on this stuff would make a difference. I might have actually complied if they did that to start. I was down with 2 weeks to stop the spread back in March. I am most certainly not down with this indefinite lockdown bullshit. At a certain point we need to learn to live with it and that point was somewhere around April 10th</p>

        <p>To clarify, Biden will require masks  in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/biden-will-ask-americans-to-wear-masks-for-100-days.html">federal buildings and during interstate travel</a>, which I imagine was already happening despite Trump's anti-mask sentiments. So at the end of the day, he is not changing much. It is theater to make him look like he is being an effective leader. For most Americans, it will still come down to what their governors are or are not mandating.</p>
<p>It makes sense that he retreated a bit; a national mandate forcing private citizens to wear a mask would have been a huge power grab that would have invited substantial constitutional challenges. Still, given the direction the country has been headed politically, I am sort of relieved to finally see some implicit acknowledgment of limits to government power.</p>

<p>Neighboring county is much more rural and exceedingly Trump, at least by all the signs and flags.   Almost everywhere, everyone is wearing the mask except young people and people I am told only vote for Biden.</p>

        <p>&rt;This makes me angry on so many levels. First it completely ignores the fact that we have been doing this for months! I have been wearing a mask whenever I go out since at least mid April!! That is pretty close to 250 days if not more!! Well over 100 days, and guess what, it hasn't worked!!</p>
<p>Oh but <em>Trump</em> was in office, so none of that counts. It's only Real Masking(tm) when a Democrat tells you to do it.</p>

        <p>It hasn't worked cause most of you idiots don't wear masks. Can you not understand that? "Not me! I won't wear a mask!" is said so proudly on this sub, then you claim that masks don't work. How the fuck are they supposed to work if half the country is not participating?</p>

        <p>Maybe in Florida, where they actually LOOKED AT THE DATA and realized that for a VIRUS, masks do nothing as the Danish mask study and the 50 years of research on this subject said.</p>
<p>Here in Maryland? Everyone is wearing a mask in businesses and this shit is STILL SPREADING!</p>
<p>Masks do nothing in the real world. They are health theater, nothing more.</p>
<p>Don't try that "Well surgeons wear masks!" whine: Surgeons wear masks solely to prevent themselves from sneezing into a wound. If they had a viral disease, they would not be allowed anywhere NEAR a patient.</p>

        <p>Not really, some places in Florida still have the mandates, in fact through April in one county. My area does not have a mandate but places still require masks. It isn't all lax and normalcy here. Compared to some places, yeah it's way more lax, but we aren't just no masks and complete normalcy like people tend to paint it as.</p>

        <p>How do you explain other countries success in keeping it under control? If masks really did nothing, why are we in the US struggling so to keep it under control compared to countries that didn't politicize mask wearing? What's your solution? And you think the CDC doesn't look at DATA?? I'm wondering what the benefit is to have everyone wearing masks if they don't work, like you claim. Who wins? Big mask lobbyists?? Whatever we've been doing this far doesn't work, I'll agree there. But I think it's due to a large percentage of people, like this sub, who won't make any changes regardless of mask mandates and lockdowns.</p>

        <p>The Biden "mask plan" is of course meant to be completely redundant, it's true goal is  to start dividing society into the "good guys" and the "bad guys" and then blaming the "bad guys" who don't comply for all his woes and the fact that pesky virus won't go away. What this tells us too, is that the vaccine will be inefficient.</p>
