    <strong>Friend invited me on a trip, she probably thinks I got the vaccine when I didn’t and I’m scared it will be a problem</strong>
    <p><p>I’m fairly certain that she and at least one other person going on this trip have been vaccinated. She invited me to go with them and didn’t ask if I got the vaccine or not, but I never talked with her in detail about what I actually believe regarding the pandemic. So that makes me feel like she probably just assumed I got it (I live in california, &amp; was a lot more liberal before covid happened). </p>
<p>I don’t know what to do. Am I supposed to just show up and not say anything unless it comes up?? That happened recently with another friend and they totally freaked out on me and said they weren’t comfortable hanging out anymore. So I don’t want to just tell her out of nowhere that I’m unvaccinated because I don’t want to be uninvited over that and I don’t want to potentially argue about anything.</p>
<p>I just wish we could freely choose to get it or not without being seen as a dirty virus-carrier. I am perfectly healthy, haven’t gotten sick this entire time. I hate this predicament that’s been forced upon me just because I didn’t want to get an experimental mRNA vaccine. I’m thinking about just not going altogether so I can avoid this. Friend is about to move away from me as well so maybe I should just forget about going. </p>
<p>I have to decide by Thursday this week because they’re heading out on Friday. </p>
<p>Please help if you have any ideas of what I should do, this is giving me so much anxiety 😭😭😭</p></p>

        <p>If they're vaccinated then it shouldn't affect them if you're not. Unless the vaccine doesn't work, in which case it wouldn't matter if you were vaccinated or not.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. But it doesn’t matter at this point if their logic checks out or not (it doesn’t), I just don’t know what to personally do when it comes to these situations since it feels like vaxxed people would rather segregate than interact with us</p>
<p>So you’re saying you’d just show up? Would you lie about being vaccinated? I feel like that’s not a good idea since everyone’s probably carrying around their little cards. I’m just worried about them “finding me out.” I hate that I feel like I’m having to carry a dirty little secret, it’s ridiculous. I’m not a fucking criminal ffs</p>

        <p>Your medical information is no one's business but your own. If they were concerned with your vaccination status, they would have asked prior to the invitation and it's up to you whether or not you tell them. You can't be held responsible for the assumptions of others.</p>
<p>When anyone asks if I'm vaccinated, I tell them it's not their concern.</p>

        <p>Why not just volunteer telling her the truth. Then you get to find out if she’s your friend or someone that lets politics decide your life.</p>
<p>I’m conservative and have a liberal friend that I know 100% doesn’t care, and even if he asked me, id be happy to tell him because I know he doesn’t care beyond his own curiosity, especially since I’m in China and that would be more on whether or not I was willing to get a Chinese vaccine. Point is I know he’s my friend and doesn't care, no doubt at all. You should be able to say the same or they really are just an acquantance.</p>

        <p>I would just show up. It’s your FRIEND.  Now, I had a job at new clients house awhile ago.. and I just showed up there .. and asked them if they wanted me to wear mask.. that was awful. They were like “well aren’t you vaccinated?”  And I’m like.. not yet.. and just ugh.  I finished job though.  They haven’t called again.  Um.. they were strangers though.   Now.. it’s just passé across the board, ain’t it?  No one is still like that, are they??  I mean.. like social peers?</p>
