    <strong>My last straw with Lockdown Skepticism</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, just wanted to make this post and see what people think. I went to post this article on LS: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-expert-vaccinated-people-can-spread-the-delta-variant-2021-7">https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-expert-vaccinated-people-can-spread-the-delta-variant-2021-7</a>)</p>
<p>The article is basically just an 'expert' from a somewhat controversial stats institute (which has been accused of creating a misleading model, and of course was once hired by Trump) who wanted to point out that because the CDC recommends to not test asymptomatic vaccinated people, it would be not be possible to really confirm how much the delta variant is being spread by vaccinated people. He goes on to make a few assumptions, like assuming Scotland's recent spread can't be accounted for without vaccinated spread, but whatever, the point is that it can't be measured and maybe people should be paying more attention. There are several other things in the article that I don't really care about, but are there nevertheless. None of these are 'controversial', such as the vaccines being slightly less effective against the delta variant. </p>
<p>So yeah, I go to post this on LS, and the mod there steps in and says they 'don't seem to cite solid evidence' (meanwhile there are opinion pieces splattered all over their page). I tried to make my case, but the mod (who I have had problems with before - basically just exercising their power to control discussion) deleted my messages to them.</p>
<p>What do you think? Am I in the wrong here, should I let it go and continue to participate there? Or is this an example of overzealous moderating?</p>
<p>Note: No hate to anyone on LS or this particular mod. Just really trying to see if this is an issue or if it's just me LOL.</p></p>

        <p>I used to be on there all the time but I’ve felt the moderation was too heavy-handed for my taste for a while now. Are they generally pro-vaccine?</p>

        <p>Yeah, LDS is pro-vaccine for the most part. There are some people on there who are anti-vaccine, but they're in the minority.</p>
<p>I'll grant that it might have been okay to be pro-vaccine until May, but so much has happened over the last two months and I don't know how anybody could be pro-vaccine at this point.</p>

        <p>I was actually happy when they first came out because I figured we could completely return to normal after everyone who wanted one had the opportunity to get one.  How naive of me.</p>
<p>But at that time I had no idea they would be pushed so hard in a really creepy way, or that they had horrible side effects.</p>

        <p>Been saying this for months.</p>
<p>Why else would they be allowed to (more or less) continue on their merry way while the other anti-new abnormal subs keep getting quarantined, brigaded to hell and back, and so on?</p>

        <p>I haven't been on it as much lately but they have always leaned towards heavier moderation.  Its just a different vibe than this sub and has it's merits.  I can't speak to this incident.  It seems like you just posted a mainstream article.</p>
