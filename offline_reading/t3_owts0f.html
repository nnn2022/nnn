        <p>How terrifying.  It seems like they will never be able to imprison 2/3rd of the population tho, if they all continue to hold their stance and not cave in.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the payment deal between vaccine manufacturers and governments? In the US and I imagine most if not all countries, the vaccine is free for consumers.  Obviously, somebody is footing the bill... I assume it's the governments or NGO's.  I'm just wondering if there is a clause in there that X number of vaccines must be used or there is a penalty or price increase if fewer doses are sold.  That would explain the big push governments are taking to vaccinate people, and now pushing for additional boosters, etc - and using fines like this could help offset the cost.</p>
<p>Kind of like how private prisons in the US have to be kept at 95% or higher capacity per the business contract... so the government has to keep the inmate population high or they are in breech of contract.</p>
<p>Just wondering if we have a similar situation going on between the governments and pharmaceuticals companies for the sale of vaccine doses.</p>
<p>That would also explain why the goal posts have moved.  They may have over-estimated people's willingness to get 'free' vaccines, so now to reach their target dose quota, they are threatening people, enforcing mandates, and saying people have to get more and more boosters.</p>
<p>I can find info on funding a little bit (such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0407-covid-19-vaccine-programs.html">this</a>) which is for programs to promote vaccine access and acceptance, but doesn't actually pay for the vaccines themselves.</p>

        <p>You might be right. That's probably what's going on at the government level, if these elected officials are not in on the elite's depopulation plans. Then again, some presidents definitely do know what's up like all the ones that died for rejecting vaccines in their countries.</p>
