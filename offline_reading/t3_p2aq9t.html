    <strong>Great Internet Reset - Could the man who wrote the Rockefeller LockStep Pandemic plan be catalyzing a Mr Robot-style Hack Attack 'scenario' from the same document? He now works for Salesforce who almost released open-source software which would allow hackers to setup malware far more efficiently</strong>
    <p><p>The Great Internet Reset may be near</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/peterschwartz2">Peter Schwartz</a> founded the Global Business Network who were involved with the infamous 2010 <a href="https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">Rockefeller document</a> 'Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development'. One of the scenarios was Lock Step which made a chillingly-accurate prediction of the 2020 pandemic. Another scenario was Hack Attack of which here's an extract "more sophisticated hackers attempted to take down corporations, government systems, and banks via phishing scams and database information heists, and their many successes generated billions of dollars in losses."</p>
<p>Currently Schwartz is the Senior Vice-President Strategic Planning at Salesforce. Now, something strange happened with Salesforce in 2017, the company was about to publicly release open-source software which would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce#%E2%80%98Meatpistol%E2%80%99_presenters_let_go_at_Def_Con">allow for malware attacks</a> to be rapidly setup (the tool was called Meatpistol), removing lots of the work normally involved. Two of their employees were about to give a presentation on it at the same time as it was going to be released, then just one hour before, they were sent text messages telling them not to publicly announce the release of the code, however their phones were off so they still gave the presentation. The two employees were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/08/salesforce-fires-two-security-team-members-for-presenting-at-defcon/">fired afterwards</a>. Salesforce withheld the Meatpistol code.</p>
<p>The creation and release of this software could have helped to bring about the Hack Attack scenario described in Peter Schwartz's scenario planning document. If it had been planned from a high-level within Salesforce, it could be that the coders didn't realize it was meant to be kept quiet, and they were also quite proud to show off their new tool.</p>
<p>For those interested, here's the presentation - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnVFWKKLRwU">DEF CON 25 - Josh Schwartz and John Cramb - MEATPISTOL and A Modular Malware Implant Framework</a></p>
<p>On another note, Salesforce bought $100 million of Zoom IPO in 2019, then sold around August 2020, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210114140103/https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/salesforce-dumps-zoom-shares-after-more-than-tripling-money-since-ipo.html">more than tripling their money</a>.  Schwartz is so good at making predictions it would seem, some may think it almost as if he knew the pandemic was about to hit and move hundreds of millions of people onto Zoom.</p></p>

<p>And the CEO of Salesforce works with WEF</p>
<p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff</p>
<p>“In 2009, the members of the World Economic Forum named him as one of its Young Global Leaders”</p>
<p>It is possible that Salesforce is a weapon of The Great Reset, the hacking software required for a global Internet takedown is being created by their Red Teams.  When the Internet returns, it won’t be the same, everything will require real ID.</p>

        <p>It seems highly unlikely that Salesforce would pay coders lots of money to create new tools which already existed, and then then the coders would want to head to Defcon in Vegas to present that they just made the same old thing, nothing groundbreaking.</p>
<p>“Meatpistol, while still in its early stages of development, had already improved the efficiency of the Salesforce red team. "Malware implant creation used to take days," Schwartz said during his presentation. "Now it takes seconds," he said, cutting "weeks off our operation time."”</p>

        <p>It was for a massive phone company in the U.K and it always goes down. We’d have to write down deals on paper when it happened. Everything is done by email now as our store nearly got shut down to GDPR breaches. Nothing major but companies in the U.K can get fined a lot as it’s a percentage of your yearly earnings.</p>
