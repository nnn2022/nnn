        <p>Took 60 minutes more than a frigging year to run this story. What a joke. </p>
<p>Literally everyone who suggested this virus may have come from the Wuhan Institute of virology was labeled a conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>I’m personally still about 50/50 on the question of whether it came from the lab or from an animal reservoir. We will likely never know the answer for sure unfortunately, because apparently no actual investigation has been done. </p>
<p>Either way China is shady AF.</p>

        <p>Are you serious?  You think nature and humanity mutated a coronavirus at the exact same moment in time?  The odds of that happening are astronomical. Add to the fact that the outbreak happened in Wuhan, that had an infectious disease lab that worked with coronaviruses, and it gets even more likely.</p>

        <p>I think you misunderstood- I don’t think that these two events happened at the same time. I think one or the other happened, but I’m not sure which. Honestly only a few people who worked in that lab would know for sure.</p>

<p>This guy says he can prove they used recombinant technology to make the coronavirus more pathogenic.</p>

        <p>Fauci visited that lab and after hearing him say this was nothing to worry about early last year I think he knew about it.</p>

        <p>It MOST LIKELY came from the lab.  I wouldn't put it at 50/50.</p>
<p>Now, nothing in science is 100%, but what we do know, is sars-cov-2 closest known relative, with 96% genomic similarity, RaTg13, was discovered, mapped, and housed in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  So don't for a second believe the reports that "nothing like" sars 2 was stored at WIV.  Obvious lies, as the closest thing to Sars 2 was discovered by WIV.</p>
<p>We also know that the existence of eight other viruses mapped along with RaTg13 was hidden from the WHO team.  Even more damning, was that the genomic data of Chimeric horseshoe bat CVs (of which Sars-Cov-2 is one) which were passed through mice, genetically modified to carry human ACE2 receptors in their lungs, was DESTROYED along with all traces of the viruses being experimented with, shortly before the WHO team's arrival.</p>
<p>We also know that several workers at WIV became ill with Covid like symptoms in early 10/2019, which is when many epidemiologists have hypothesized the outbreak began.</p>
<p>Finally, there is simply no explanation for the Furin Cleavage site present on sars 2, and it fits within no conceptual model for the natural evolution of the virus.</p>
