    <strong>This is never going to end.</strong>
    <p><p>The pandemic emergency is not “far from over” as some media say; It is NEVER going to end.</p>
<p>They said the vaccines were the only ticket to normalcy. Even though some places get close to the majority of people vaccinated, looks like nothing has changed, they still collect daily cases and now they only use the positivity rate to decide if we need to be imprisoned in our homes (even if hospitals are not overcrowded). </p>
<p>People, unfortunately, there is a New Normal. A “normalcy” of living in fear and panic, of seeing other people like they are gigantic germs, of being announced lockdowns and stay-at-home orders out of nowhere, at anytime. Travel overseas is no longer attractive. The world we knew before February-March 2020 is over, for good.</p></p>

        <p>The scariest part about this isn’t the lockdowns, the govt overreach, vaccine passports or anything like that, because thats at least somewhat expected from government. No, the scariest part are the people who have absolutely NO issue with being locked down, staying home, living a dull, boring, and meaningless life for as long as it takes because they really believe Covid will go away. Not only do those people not have an issue with it, they actively call for it and encourage it. Almost a full year and a half of my life has been taken from me with no real end in sight. How tf did it come to this? Don’t people wanna experience and live life, travel to new places, meet new people, create new friendships? Sometimes I wish I was an easily manipulated brain dead idiot like all these young healthy people who have truthfully nothing to fear from covid. Life would be much easier to accept.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>I feel very lucky that my lifestyle now and pre scamdemic are very similar. I can't imagine how much more it would suck if I was more socially active. </p>
<p>If anything this situation is making me even more asocial, I just don't want to interact with people when you realize that most of them are just brainwashed zombies.</p>

        <p>Yes. We've been lied to since this all started about all of it. The novel virus, masks reduce spread, asymptomatic spread is a thing, testing and tracking is needed even though the test is garbage,useless, 6-6-6 distancing helps!, all must vax, even those who had it. LIES</p>

<p>Seems being a signed-up member means you're legally obliged to follow their 'guidance', and with over 190 countries signed up, that's basically all of them.</p>

        <p>And that means what exactly? </p>
<p>Do you have no awareness of what’s going on throughout the world? They are mandating vaccines in europe. There are massive protests in greece, france, and Ireland, riots in the the netherlands, all civil society had broken down in South Africa. In Australia, they are locked down again, people can’t leave their homes</p>
<p>The present administration has announced that it will monitor and censor personal online communication regarding the vaccine. We’ve had a stolen ejection. The rule of law is dead in this country (and most places in the world)</p>
<p>A worldwide totalitarian dictatorship has been established with control of all governments and media throughout the world.  </p>
<p>What do you think is going to happen when people start dropping like flies from ADE from the vaccine and the media is blaming the un-vacced? We haven’t seen how unholy it’s going to get. </p>

        <p>In a way, this totalitarianism has been creeping our whole life (and before). They’ve been planning this for over 100years. This is a climax or acceleration of a sort. I agree with you, I believe we are only in the beginning of this terrible phase unfortunately. It’s going to get scary worse this fall winter, though so hope enough people are woken up to resist.
