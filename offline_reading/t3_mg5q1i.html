    <strong>How do your friends and family feel about these vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>Would be interesting to hear since reddit makes it seem you are basically hitler and an insane conspiracy theorist. It's funny that more than half of employed people at various companies have refused but apparently it's insanity.</p></p>

        <p>One side couldn't reason their way out of a paper bag, so Daddy Gubmint telling them to do something is just fine and dandy. This side also contains a high percentage of TDS victims and feminists.</p>
<p>The other side seems to be taking it in consultation with their personal doctors. Some want the vaccine, some would rather piss on the courthouse.</p>
<p>My friends, such as they are, are all over the spectrum for decisions and reasons.</p>

        <p>Because it's still in trial phase and has no information about it's long term effects. The nature of vaccine that they used has been never used to inject in human before. Check Dr Tenpenny interview on YT. Will give you a lot valuable insights on dangers of this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Moderna started human trails on the vaccine over a year ago so I don’t think it’s fair to say that we have no evidence of long term side effects. Also we know for a fact that Covid can have long term symptoms so I’m not sure how you are balancing those two risks.</p>

        <p>Why it's not FDA approved? And how did trials started over year ago if virus is just year old? Plus, 80% people have mild to no symptoms, so I'd rather take my risk. And after all, the vaccine doesn't prevent you to get or pass on the virus, it may lessen the symptoms but there was people that died from it or experienced severe side effects. And if it's protecting you why you insist on others having it? My body, my choice. I respect your choice to have it, please respect mine to decline it. Thank you.</p>

        <p>1) Why it's not FDA approved?</p>
<p>Because FDA approval takes longer than a year to do. Since 550k people have died from Covid the FDA said its better to get a vaccine available that we reasonably believe is safe rather that keep having people die. </p>
<p>2)And how did trials started over year ago if virus is just year old?</p>
<p>Covid was first identified in December of 2019 and phase 1 trials for Moderna started in March.</p>
<p>3) Plus, 80% people have mild to no symptoms, so I'd rather take my risk. And after all, the vaccine doesn't prevent you to get or pass on the virus, it may lessen the symptoms but there was people that died from it or experienced severe side effects. And if it's protecting you why you insist on others having it? My body, my choice. I respect your choice to have it, please respect mine to decline it. Thank you.</p>
<p>I never insisted that you take the vaccine? All I did is point out that according to the information available on average getting the vaccine will be better than getting covid unless you have any evidence to point out otherwise?</p>

        <p>My dad just thinks they’re pointless, especially if you already had it (he and my mom already did). He doesn’t plan on getting it, but he doesn’t think they’re death shots either. My mom is more skeptical and doesn’t trust them at all and does not want one. I’m on the fence about whether they are safe or not, but I’m not planning on ever getting one. Not unless I’m told I can rip my mask off immediately after the shot and never wear one again. And I don’t see that happening. My friends think the vaccines are fine, but have no issue with me not wanting one. My liberal aunts think we should all get vaccinated because they watch too much nonsense on tv and believe everything they read.</p>

        <p>My retired mom was on the fence. I made my case to her against the vaccine, and told her I'd support her, no matter what she decided. Meanwhile, my schoolteacher cousin was trying to find my mom the first vaccination appts available. A local clinic came around where she lived and she got the J&amp;J one-shot version. Cousin just got done with the two Moderna shots. I remain skeptical of these vaccines and will wait at least 5 years before considering letting them anywhere near my body. Too many unknown factors in play ("warp speed" development/testing, vaccination tech not used on a mass scale before).</p>
