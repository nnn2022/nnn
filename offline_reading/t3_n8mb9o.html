    <strong>My boyfriend’s sister (who was an AP student) is now not graduating high school</strong>
    <p><p>So, my boyfriend’s family, I’m not super close to them but I live in the same house as them for money saving reasons. </p>
<p>His mother is super hysterical about the virus and did not let his sister or brother go back to school, or do anything, really. </p>
<p>She’s a hypochondriac and she’s always worked from home. She’s been adamant about not sending her kids to actual classes because she doesn’t want them to be exposed to COVID. </p>
<p>The Mother’s mother is super hysterical, too.</p>
<p>The brother was a tall, lanky kid. I see him gaining weight. The sister is 5’3” and wears a US 3X now. She’s always been obese but now I have a feeling she’s probably over 250 lbs. </p>
<p>Well, back to the sister. She’s not graduating high school. This girl, was a damned AP student. Big nerd. </p>
<p>And now, she’s flunking out of high school. She seems to be binge eating and depressed. She lives in squalor (her room is filthy, dirty containers and trash everywhere). </p>
<p>It’s really sad. I’m not trying to be snarky, but it really is throwing these two kid’s lives away, along with many else’s.</p>
<p>The lockdowns are really doing a number on young people. If I had kids, I’d rather them get Rona and go to school then become like my boyfriend’s siblings.</p></p>
