    <strong>I'm trying to weigh individual rights with the rights of business owners. Any thoughts?</strong>
    <p><p>I really carry no issue with persons determined to wear a mask in public.  It's of course normal to see in Asian populations, and it's perfectly within their right to mask should they desire, free from duress or pressure from a state or federal mandate.  It's not for me, but if it's what makes them comfortable, then so be it.</p>
<p>And, deep in my being, I also respect the decisions of business owners to set mask requirements for entering their stores.  I don't agree with it, but I feel like the ownership should have the authority to set dress codes for their businesses, and conduct their business as they see fit, barring of course duress or pressure from a state or federal mandate.</p>
<p>Would anybody that's smarter than me be willing to share a perspective?</p></p>

        <p>I will never infringe on the right of a business to impose masks. This is why I ONLY shop at mask-indifferent markets and will never spend a euro in a pro-mask establishment. The shops I frequent have never once enforced masks since this dystopia started.</p>

        <p>I think the business owners have a right to ask customers to wear masks and customers have a right not to shop there. I think the classic saying of voting with your feet will prevail in every situation. If enough people don’t shop there because of masks the business will change their policy, baring government intervention.</p>

        <p>Businesses have the right to set mask requirements, but they also need to comply with the ADA. Kicking people out who claim they have a medical condition preventing them from wearing a mask is illegal. </p>
<p>Literally every business in my city and surrounding cities “requires” masks, but the employees of about a third of the places I’ve been to haven’t said anything about it when I go in maskless. Most of the rest ask me to put on a mask and then drop it when I politely decline. Only a handful have actually refused service to me, and in those cases I left and will not be patronizing them anymore. </p>
<p>Individuals have rights. So do businesses. But I have witnessed many businesses going against the ADA, which is not within their rights.</p>

        <p>We are supposed to be innocent until <em>proven</em> guilty.<br>
Forcing us to wear masks, even a business, is like saying we are not innocent, we are guilty of being infectious. And there is absolutely no proof of that.</p>

        <p>Do what the mask cult Karens do. Comment on their reviews that they're mask Nazis. Pressure them to lift restrictions in any way you can. </p>
<p>They may have the right to impose masks. But you have the right to make it hurt.</p>

        <p>The problem in our area is that business owners don't get a choice.   If they try and go maskless, the state comes down on them with fines, then seizes their bank accounts.</p>
