    <strong>Well it happened. Mom finally called in concern to get vaxxed</strong>
    <p><p>I love her to death she’s always been there for me. My parents got it a while ago and seem to be okay thank God but also know and respect where I stand. </p>
<p>I’m about to leave the country and before that I got the call later than normal in concern. Guessing they had the news on. Which is what I said of course. </p>
<p>Anyway I told her I at least want to wait for FDA approval, she said it is and where are you hearing the news that it is not. I reiterated many times specifically “FDA approval” or approved. I asked her where she’s getting the news that it is because she insisted she was going to prove me wrong because it is. </p>
<p>Immediately after I sent her a link to a google news search of just “FDA approval”, and said pick your source. She knows I hate all the news and it’s very biased and even then all the headlines proves me right </p>
<p>So so far, so good. I live on my own and have for
Many years and that’s not the point. It just saddens me to have her worry this much when I’ve done so many risky things with my life I even told her about beforehand many times and all the sudden shes scared to no end. Not that she wasn’t before but this was way different. </p>
<p>Anyway</p>
<p>Just wanted to vent. It’s not easy. I did tell her for now this wa the hill I die on snd there’s so much more to it then just the vaccine. She had no idea about the green pass or how Australia hasn’t been able
To even leave their country in over a year. And I didn’t even bring up 1% of the truth. House lockdowns, certrain days you’re allowed to go to stores in a handful of countries, so many things. All I said is this country was not founded on people that willingly comply and give in to each and every demand. </p>
