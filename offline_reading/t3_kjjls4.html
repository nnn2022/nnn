    <strong>Anyone else’s spouse following the narrative while you question it?</strong>
    <p><p>My wife and I had quite the discussion last night while laying in bed. I told her how tired I am of all of these restrictions and that people need to wake up and start questioning the things we are being forced to do for a flu. She said “well you’re the minority because the rest of us are just doing what we need to do to make sure we can go back to normal”. I told her how hopeless and alone I feel because of our difference in opinion. While she accepts that we believe different things, it’s frustrating to me because she is very against getting the vaccine, but still wants to wear a mask and social distance everywhere we go and essentially cancelled Christmas/seeing family this year. I understand some of her fear because she is pregnant and came in contact with someone who tested positive, but I told her to not worry because it causes more stress on the baby than covid would. Anyone else have thoughts or similar experiences?</p></p>

        <p>Also, I think it's fucked that she's going around with a diaper on her face breathing in her waste all day while also carrying a baby. 
I'm sorry if that's offensive. I've got a real problem with this shit.</p>

        <p>Not offensive, what makes everything harder is the fact we live in a major city and no one around here seems to be actively resisting, so I think she is just doing what everyone else is. I thought I could convince her because when we take walks she only pulls her mask over her mouth when someone walks by (she does think it’s weird to wear a mask outside), but after our discussion last night I think I’m alone.</p>

        <p>Also in a major city where no one seems to be resisting. My boyfriend and I resist as much as we feasibly can. I saw a woman without a mask at the grocery store being harassed by management. I ran in to get some pecans (sans mask) and on my way out I reached out to her and said. “Good for you girl. Keep it the fuck up. I support you.” </p>
<p>We’re all around you. People are scared to speak up because they don’t want to be ostracized. You’re not alone. Maybe a minority, but we’re out here. </p>
<p>I would struggle if my partner didn’t agree with me on this. This is a really important fight we’re in.</p>

        <p>Not a spouse, but my boss and I differ on our take on covid. He is a truther, too. Idk how to get through to him. I just try to drop truth bombs and facts when the opportunity presents itself. I'm very sorry you have to go through this. I would be so lost if my wife and I didn't see eye to eye on it.

        <p>The concern at this point is not so much your relationship with your wife, but your child’s future. </p>
<p>Will your child be taught that her mere existence is a threat to other people, and vice versa? </p>
<p>Will she be denied formative positive interactions with other humans, in favor of masked faces?</p>
<p>From birth to 5 years old is when the majority of brain development occurs. You can hardcore fuck up a child in those years with this “humans are inherently dangerous so you can’t see their faces” bullshit - and no, “she’s so young she won’t remember so it’s okay” is completely wrong. She may not remember, but it <strong>will</strong> shape her brain and understanding of the world. Their brains are absorbing so much and developing so quickly that even a few months of this can have a permanent negative impact.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I fully intend to do what I can to avoid that.  Luckily my parents and my wife’s parents feel the same way as I do, so the baby’s grandparents will not participate in the charade.</p>

        <p>I think maybe home birth would be best for that. I’m hoping I don’t have to get jabbed so I can be in the delivery room but it’s looking that way.</p>

        <p>Yes, we've more or less decided on home birth for that reason. None of the midwives we've talked to require the mother to wear a mask, but they vary in their other restrictions.</p>
<p>Can they make you get a vaccine to be in the delivery room? I don't think they can. Mask yes, test maybe, but not vaccine. I'd push back hard on that.</p>
<p>The thing that scares me is being pushed to get a test, because there have been cases of mothers being forcibly separated from their infants because of positive tests (which sometimes even turned out to be false positives). I am trying to find a midwife who I'm confident won't demand that I get one, because even though those cases are rare, I don't want to risk providing any ammunition for anyone to separate me from my newborn.</p>

        <p>I plan on it. I haven’t been able to be at any of the ultrasounds due to these restrictions so I’d at least like to be a part of the birth. It’s made it feel like it’s not even real, so I haven’t been able to emotionally prep yet</p>

        <p>It’s so weird to me that midwives have restrictions. My midwives have been awesome through all this, and I’ve had zero restrictions. This will be my third birth with them, and I’m so grateful they’re not buying into the panic. My midwife did get Covid and self-quarantined for two weeks so I had one appointment get cancelled, but other than that pregnancy as normal.</p>

        <p>No, thank God. I don't know how I'd deal with that. Especially since my family has drunk the kool-aid and won't see us. I would be incredibly isolated if my husband were thinking that way too. Fortunately his whole family is still spending plenty of time with us and our child.</p>

        <p>I think that this far in? If my partner was a believer they would be long gone. I don't have many criteria for relationship success but "don't be a moron" is probably number one. </p>
<p>Fortunately, my missus took about a month to be convinced of the reality and has never slid back over the line. </p>
<p>And Covid does not affect the unborn or babies - so, there is quite literally nothing for your partner to worry about.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think that this is a rare issue where there isn’t really room for compromise. </p>
<p>You make evidence-based decisions - or you don’t. </p>
<p>You believe the government has the right to stop you from earning a living, or having a friend over for dinner - or you don’t. </p>
<p>These are fundamental aspects of how we view and relate to the world, and being opposed on these is just not a recipe for a healthy relationship.</p>

        <p>Agreed. This is way bigger than "which clown should live in the White House for the next 4 years?" or "Wendy's or McDonald's?"</p>
<p>It's how you frame nearly everything in life mentally. I understood even if I didn't participate in the initial wave of panic but it's been nearly a year, there's so much evidence out there as to what's real and what's not - I can't excuse people over-reacting anymore. </p>
<p>I am weighing up whether to terminate what was once a very close friendship over this lunacy at the moment, the guy has gone from rational to number one mask cuck combined with a ridiculous belief in the brilliance of the Thai government. Every single day he says something so stupid that I can't fathom how it made it out of his head... he's a healthy 40-something hiding like a coward from a cold that kills sick, fat, 80-year-olds. </p>
<p>And I don't have to put up with him in my house or my bed because if I did? He'd have been gone 8 months ago.</p>

        <p>I started watching the youtube channel AwakenWithJP and make sure to put one on all the time when my wife is around.</p>
<p>I do try and be understanding as my wife is in a tough spot with work, as our health unit tours her facility all the time and she makes a product that is health related, so she has been under heavy restrictions longer than any government has been doing fuck all about this, but then there is personal attitude, and that is where we differ.</p>
<p>I do ask her if she thinks that the government where she is from respects people's rights and she acknowledges that they would not, and I remind her that the tyranny we accept, is the tyranny our children will have to endure (she loves the "I'm just being safe for our daughter" line)</p>

        <p>Don't lose hope. I discovered quite a few significant belief differences between me and my wife after we got married. I was already a truther, and she was anything but.</p>
<p>But after years of detailed discussions, and sharing "crazy conspiracy" videos with her, she's just about completely turned around.</p>
<p>Even after coming around, she still thought Covid was for real. I knew from day one that it was a scam, and even after seven years of marriage, she still thought I was crazy. But she knows now, and she's as fed up as I am.</p>
<p>The most important thing is being able to have a free and open discussion about your disagreements. That's especially hard for women because they tend to be more emotional about things (not a criticism, just a fact), but if you work at it <em>with</em> her, then you should be able to start gaining some ground.</p>
<p>It also helps to be somewhat expert in the subject matter. It's very hard to argue against someone who really knows the facts.</p>

        <p>I feel so lucky that me and my missus are on the same page. 100% wouldn’t look the same way at her if she was pro lockdown, reciting the news propaganda every day. I have enough of that shit at work from colleagues and clients.</p>

        <p>I think I might have helped convert my partner. He’s not really anti-mask but he’s anti-lockdown, skeptical about the vaccines and not at all a doomer even though he’s pretty liberal. He’s kind of a prepper too but not because he’s scared of covid. We agree that something feels really off about all this and want to be prepared for the worst.</p>
