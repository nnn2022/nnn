    <strong>Isolations and Livelihoods</strong>
    <p><p>The situation can make you feel so lost, and it's designed to do that.</p>
<p>I am in the fringe entertainment industry. I create a webcomic, sell indie music of the geek variety, act on occasion, and publish books. Because of the nature of what I do, I am in contact with a variety of people. Most of them are leftist by nature.</p>
<p>I have to stay silent when they put down Trumpers, or rant about some situation they don't know the facts about. I accept they have different opinions than I do as they require - that we be diverse and accepting - while they don't practice what they preach. I have to watch what I say in public. A lot.  (Although sometimes I break.) I'm always having to tow the line.</p>
<p>But when it comes to this vaccine issue, I find myself unable to stay silent as much. I'm trying because I already don't make a lot of money as it is. I've already been ostracized by some  for being racist (for liking an old song), and recently was told I wasn't welcome at one of my CD supplier's concert unless I was fully vaccinated.  Yesterday they pretty much said that anyone who isn't getting the vaccine is competing for the Darwin Award, and another I thought of as a friend - well let's just say she set me off and now the internet knows a whole lot about why I don't trust modern day vaccines on the whole than I normally would have wanted them to.</p>
<p>Vaccine injuries are real, and they're more numerous than people want to accept. Hearing of all the thousands of deaths from this nightmare - many of which are NOT being reported to VAERS so that the people are simply relegated to being ghosts in our urban legends as we try to warn each other - should let people know that between the shot and COVID, the COVID gamble is your safest gamble right now. At least with COVID we know that taking Vitamin D *is* safe, and a proven effective prevention method to help fight from getting it or allowing it to get worse.</p>
<p>I have a blood clot. Hearing that one of the vaccines causes blood clots in young people - even though WHO tried to deny this - made me very glad I didn't sign up for THAT one. I'd have had a stroke for sure, in the best case scenario.</p>
<p>But even so, my livelihood and my outlets are shrinking daily. All because the people around us are forking stupid.  It's getting harder and harder to wish them well, that they don't suffer the way others have done because I want to be free so badly.</p>
<p>I have been very careful with posting information. I post articles touching on WWII history or side information without getting direct: educate them the way they're trying to smother us... frogs in heating water. I have at least seen one person on my Facebook who was pro-vaccine slowly start to open his eyes. Wish the rest would.</p>
