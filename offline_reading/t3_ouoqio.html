    <strong>Controversy at its best</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, I am from Lebanon, a country in the middle East for those who ain't geography peeps. Since 2 years ago, we're experiencing an economic crisis, the local currency plunged, we have severe fuel shortages, barely get 2 hours of national electricity per day, pollution is on the rise and medication drugs for severe and non severe cases are barely found in pharmacies. The government is literally shitting on the people here and doesn't give a damn about people living or dying. But vaccines, oh vaccines, we have lots of them, all kinds, as much as you like, and in fact they announced today that you can't enter local restaurants without a proof of vaccination. Such a caring government. Rings a bell?</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately no, there are very few people who are against this, but are very little in numbers, at least from what I'm observing, unfortunately people believe that whatever products (vaccine in this case) or news(western media) that come from the west is right and they just follow. They absolutely have no sense in connecting what's happening to the great reset. An activist who had over a 100k followers on Facebook has been warning people about this for years, but unfortunately people made fun of him and still make fun of him, until Facebook banned his account couple months ago.</p>

<p>Yeah, there seems to be a lot of that "thought" (or lack thereof) going around.</p>
<p>But seriously, Lebanon is getting onboard with new abnormal bullshit? I thought they had WAY bigger problems than that right now. Hell, I even remember last year people being pissed off enough to be on the brink of storming parliament and taking out the trash.</p>

        <p>We have serious problems that affect our daily lives since there is no government since almost a year, people know that the people in power are shit but they think that in terms of Covid-19 and the vaccine the government should take full control. It's prisoners who hate freedom.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs sad bro, sorry, unfortunately the West is largely controlled by the same forces running this scam, I would just say hold off for as long as you can, I am SURE that TPTB know the house of cards is going to fall down, that is why they are in a rush to jab as many people as possible, once the official story is ‚Äúwe messed up, it‚Äôs a mistake‚Äù then the pressure to get jabbed will disappear and the unvaccinated will be envied by those damaged by the jab.</p>
<p>Stay strong and we will get through it in the end</p>
