    <strong>When the wrong people are in power</strong>
    <p><p>The thing I don't see addressed often is what happens to "Joe General public" in war and tyranny and it is f***ing terrifying.</p>
<p>Please read about: Mao's re-education camps, the Rape of Nanking, Falun Gong in China, tortures at Guantanimo Bay, the war on the white farmers in South Africa, the Uyghers and last but certainly not least what happened under nazi rule.</p>
<p>Then go read about Agenda 2030, Bill Gates and vaccines, eugenics, and even the fact that NY state openly admitted to testing pesticides on orphan wards of the state.</p>
<p>These will all give you really realistic and scary examples of what happens when the wrong people get power. It is VERY important to monitor who is in power. </p>
<p>What makes anyone think that they're "special " and that this stuff doesn't repeat?</p>
<p>I mean, we all look back in horror st Salem with trials, Nero, medieval torture etc but there is a bent toward cruelty in human nature.</p>
<p>This Covid situation has allowed such a power shift that the group of us here are more concerned, and shoild be, that the risk of those who have power outweighs the risk of the virus.</p></p>
