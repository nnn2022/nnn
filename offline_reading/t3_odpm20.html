    <strong>Hypocrite politicians and separation and fracturing of communities</strong>
    <p><p>I was writing this as a comment to another post about "Build Back Better....better for who?" and I saw a comment that said "biggest wealth transfer ever", talking about how our lockdowns effectively shuttered many mom and pop shops across the country, put many working class people out of a job, we saw suicidality spike. We're more fractured as societies as we relegate ourselves to Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc more instead of going to work and talking to our colleagues, going to weddings and funerals to hug and kiss our loved ones, we don't commune over potlucks and BBQs, etc </p>
<p>We've caught multiple American politicians living it up during the lockdowns, not wearing masks, not socially distancing, eating out, having large gatherings, etc. Everything we were "advised" to not do. Walmart, CostCo, Target, Big Pharma all sucking up the remaining dollars thanks to their crony politicians.</p>
<p>It's not politicians being two faced that pisses us off or, at a lesser degree, sends mixed messages and frustrates a confused populace. Everyone already knew politics is confusing and/or corrupt/dirty and have become somewhat indifferent/complacent about. What disheartens ppl is the fact our fellow Citizens still carry water for these con-artist and huckster Governors and Representatives despite all the evidence of them being hypocrites and bought and paid for.</p>
<p>So, I sincerely ask, please forgive the 80k+ members in this group for being skeptical, hesitant, or flat out dismissive of the message COVID messengers deliver. Stop banning us, selling us out, or calling us names. We're simply trying our best to be prudent by calling out the bullshit. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p></p>

We're just protesting the new authority, for a fair and (ahem!) Democratic society, even yours mr moderator. X</p>
