        <p>Every nurse and doctor already know this even if they lie and deny the truth. 5 minutes googling "antigen" will reveal how stupid this test is. Antigens are not specific to anything. They attack everything from viruses, to bacteria, to pollen!</p>

        <p>I would love to know how positive predictive value doesn't also apply to PCR tests...
funny how as testing increases cases jump up in an 'almost' predictable manner!</p>

<p>&rt;Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.<br>

<p>Page 39.  (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>&rt;Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/¬µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>

        <p>So they are testing for virus with a test kit that doesn‚Äôt look for live viruses and according to the inventor can‚Äôt be used to look for viruses but the test looks for ‚ÄúRNA‚Äù but the virus their looking for hasn‚Äôt been proven to exsist ü§îü§îü§î</p>
<p>So wtf is the test looking for???</p>

        <p>This is how everyone and their mother can test positive at anytime. If it's allergy season the numbers of positives would shoot through the roof. They can pull this fraud for anything. Any virus they want to pull out of a hat and use for mass control can get people who don't know better to believe it exists through this and that's exactly what's happening now. All you hear about is cases and once there's enough it's just thrown on big news to instill more panic and then more restrictions are introduced the idiots will just eat up despite everything else they see in the world telling them the opposite is happening. Rinse and repeat forever.</p>

        <p>&rt; Remember that positive predictive value (PPV) varies with disease  prevalence when interpreting results from diagnostic tests. PPV is the  percent of positive test results that are true positives. As disease  prevalence decreases, the percent of test results that are false  positives increase.     <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For example, a test with 98% specificity would have a PPV of  just over 80% in a population with 10% prevalence, meaning 20 out of 100  positive results would be false positives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The same test would only have a PPV of approximately 30% in a  population with 1% prevalence, meaning 70 out of 100 positive results  would be false positives.¬† This means that, in a population with 1%  prevalence, only 30% of individuals with positive test results actually  have the disease.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;At 0.1% prevalence, the PPV would only be 4%, meaning that 96 out of 100 positive results would be false positives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Health care providers should take the local prevalence into consideration when interpreting diagnostic test results.</p>

        <p>&rt; Like molecular tests, antigen tests are typically highly specific for  the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, all diagnostic tests may be subject to  false positive results, especially in low prevalence settings. Health  care providers should always carefully consider diagnostic test results  in the context of all available clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological  information. Test interference from patient-specific factors, such as  the presence of human antibodies (for example, Rheumatoid Factor, or  other non-specific antibodies) or highly viscous specimens could also  lead to false positive results.</p>

        <p>Hi everyone! Looking for some help. I took a rapid antigen test Monday. It came back positive. I then took a PCR test Tuesday because I heard that the rapid tests weren‚Äôt very accurate. My PCR test came back negative. I have also had zero symptoms and have felt 100% fine. Do we think it was a false positive? Any input on person experience is helpful.</p>
