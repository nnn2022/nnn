    <strong>Slovenian analysis of the Moderna finds uranium in vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>YouTube video is gone, I couldnt find it anywhere on internet</p>
<p>'' A general practitioner examines vaccines under a microscope before and after exposure to a magnet (flu, COVID, hepatitis, dye (with which vaccines are stained for contrast)).</p>
<p>Spectrometry can be used to find out the composition of the metals in the vaccine, but since only the forensic laboratory has the same, they did not have access to it. There is also a public health institute one, but it can only analyze the metal content of water. Therefore, they diluted the vaccines with 200ml of distilled water (they made a very rare discharge - 1/200) and made reference values.
The samples were acted upon with a magnet to test due to the rare solution the concentrate obtained on the sample size (slides).</p>
<p>The flu vaccine has been shown to contain tin, iron and aluminum
COVID vaccine - iron
PCR tests - iron, aluminum, nickel</p>
<p>They also sent the person's urine to a German laboratory (Slovenia does not have a laboratory with this option) to which they added a vaccine.
1. sample without additives
2. Sample with mRNA vaccine added
3. Sample with flu vaccine added</p>
<p>The German laboratory did the analysis and there are two values. One total and one per gram of creatine in the urine (which is a more accurate ratio).</p>
<p>In the sample without additives there is an elevated level of cadmium, in the sample with mRNA there is elevated silver, cadmium, nickel, chromium, uranium. The variety of arsenic and zinc was also increased compared to the sample without additives.</p>
<p>Cadmium and molybdenum are elevated in the urine with the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Since repeated use of the 2nd and 3rd dose vaccinations and constant vaccination with the flu vaccine are mentioned, metals that are harmful to health will be deposited in the body. '</p></p>

        <p>I don't know if it's true or not but get your vaxxed friends and family some zeolite just in case, the best heavy metal detoxer around as far as I'm aware. And many other benefits</p>

        <p>What machine did they use? I find it hard to believe the entire country of Slovenia doesn't have an ICP-MS or ICP-AES available.</p>
