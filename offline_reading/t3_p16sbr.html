    <strong>I just had a talk with my doctor and he doesn't like where this is headed.</strong>
    <p><p>When I arrived, I was only asked if I had got a C-19 vaccine and not even if I wanted one. He asked what my views on the vaccine were, and I told him it seems off to me so I would rather not get one, but I also told him about how I don't think lockdowns, masks, social distancing, etc. were a good idea either. </p>
<p>He told me a story about one of his patients making a check-up appointment for her new born baby. She absolutely refused to go inside the building for fear of the 'Delta Variant'. Doctor stated, "How could you be more afraid of any virus than your baby not being well?" He also stated that staying inside for months at a time has severe negative health effects.</p>
<p>If a certified doctor agrees that measures taken to 'prevent' Coronavirus infections are a bad idea, then you should most likely believe it.</p></p>

        <p>Props to the doctor for actually telling the truth. There are MANY medical professionals who are afraid to speak up. It was likely your honesty which made him feel safe. Thank you for that. I would honestly guess that the majority of healthcare workers don’t want the clotshot deathjab but are quiet, because they don’t want to lose their jobs. It’s time to start speaking up!</p>

        <p>Just a nurse. But I know plenty of other nurses and doctors who are not taking the vaccine.  Honestly, for anyone who has been involved in acute care for any real length of time appreciated the break we got during covid.  The community flooded our hospital with free food and gifts to show support. Meanwhile, the total amount of admits to our hospital was a record low, but nurses felt over worked because every patient who was admitted tested positive and required max ppe.  The helper staff (house keeping, nurse aids, transporters) refused to enter the rooms because they were all scared, so the nurses had to take care of the trash, empty linens, and had no help with patient care.  Then nurses felt even more over worked when patients started coming to hospitals again and there was no staff to help because everyone left to take 90$/hr agency jobs.  Healthcare is insanely under staffed right now.  Agency nursing is taking over.</p>

        <p>This, what’s a doctor’s demeanor going to be if you’re wearing five masks, gloves and a face shield before you ask him a question? People will be much more likely to be honest with you if they feel that you’ll actually understand what they’re saying and not twist their words (or sue them, or report them to their bosses). </p>
<p>We are living in a time where the credibility of healthcare professionals is being bought and sold as a tool for public influence, and to hold to one’s truth against the narrative is a huge risk to their jobs. I think in the long term, the credibility of medical professionals is going to be severely damaged due to this pandemic and the things people are being pressured into saying (and withholding).</p>

        <p>Can’t appeal to credentials, because there are just as many certified doctors that will claim they have the opposite opinion (whether or not that opinion was influenced in any way, who knows).</p>

        <p>There was a post here on NNN the other day that stated  the medical board will strike off doctors spreading false claims on covid and the vaxx. Then a post showing scientific papers falsified, trust the science. </p>
<p>Doctors like this are running a real risk of losing their livelihoods.</p>
