        <p>I was never concerned.</p>
<p>I've seen that same global pandemic type hysteria before and the only difference this time was politics. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now.  I have 2 main takeaways: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I now fully understand how a genocide like the holocaust can happen with the full blessing of the society around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How accurate Yuri Bezmenov was and how easily you can whip People into a hysteria with propaganda even when the actual facts contradict it.</p>

        <p>The "Under 50" is a very important point there, but it's valid.</p>
<p>However, I have seen other subbreddits where people challenged the CDC data as "obsolete" "not true". Which is kind of funny, whenever the government or CDC says something they agree with it's a fact, when not, then it's obsolete and invalid.</p>
<p>Some other overall numbers, which also claim that 33% of excess deaths is attributed not to covid, but possibly to lockdowns and restrictions.</p>

        <p>Well even most 81 yr olds with one comorbidity didn't die.  And at this point being scared is not enough to cut it to excuse this behavior.  It's largely not deadly.  By promoting these false views that go AGAINST science, you are harming my children.  You are harming me.  You are actively harming millions of people by trying to be some imaginary savior of seniors.  Now when the seniors get sick they are literally doomed because of a bunch of scared little selfish bitch adults that can't bother to read anything beyond a news article that think they are going to die Fuck right off.</p>

        <p>Have you considered the context of how many people die ina  perfectly normal year?</p>
<p>It's a small fraction of normal death. Yes there is some excess deaths, no it's not a substantial amount in the context of expected deaths and the average age of death for covid is above normal life expectancy.</p>
<p>I wish people would stop presenting the data in such a way as to make it sound more severe than it actually is. This is a big part of the reason why the public is so unjustifiably scared.</p>

        <p>Excess death is a BS number that is not finalized until 12 months after the year is finished and the CDC even straight up tells people that on it's page. But people ignore all that and use the number as if it is set in stone.</p>

        <p>While this data is a currants it’s also prudent to know 2 things.</p>
<p>1.) Covid 19 has lifelong after effects that we don’t know the full extent of, there could be a lot of deaths or complications years down the line from the virus.</p>
<p>2.) Covid 19 has evolved and mutated a number of times already, even during 2020. Thankfully it’s usually mutated to be less deadly, but that doesn’t mean it can’t mutate into a stronger, deadlier virus either. It’s easy to forget that the common cold used to be a death sentence for people 100 years ago.</p>

        <p>How can you say Covid has lifelong effects when it's only been around for a year now? We have no idea what the long-term effects are, if any. Some people report not feeling right months after having Covid, but we have no clue what that means, at what percent and for how long it will be a factor, if any.</p>

        <p>&rt; 1.) Covid 19 has lifelong after effects that we don’t know the full extent of, there could be a lot of deaths or complications years down the line from the virus. </p>
<p>you better provide some damn evidence for this claim!</p>
<p>any claim of longterm effects of a virus, that doesn't even have a test and was never isolated is just straight up nonsense.</p>
<p>one of the claims is, that covid-19 makes you lose smell and taste....</p>
<p>guess what though every respiratory tract infection/cold can get you to lose your smell and taste sense:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/</a> </p>
<p>that nonsense about longterm effects is just propaganda to get fear into those people, that  can't be put into the fear of death.</p>
<p>&rt; 2.) Covid 19 has evolved and mutated a number of times already, even during 2020.  </p>
<p>what utter garbage.</p>
<p>how can something mutate, that was never isolated to begin with and has no test?</p>
<p>and yes i do have evidence for this statement of course, just read this comment:</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>&rt;I am not trying to dismiss the existence of the virus</p>
<p>don't worry, i can do that for you :)</p>
<p>come let's join on the journey of faking or making a virus :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094943/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094943/</a></p>
<p>first we take some random sick people with no new unique symptoms and then we:</p>
<p>&rt;RNA library construction and sequencing<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Total RNA was extracted from the BALF sample using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of the RNA solution was assessed using a Qbit machine and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) before library construction and sequencing. An RNA library was then constructed using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v.2 (TaKaRa). Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed during library construction following the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end (150-bp reads) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the MiniSeq platform (Illumina). Library preparation and sequencing were carried out at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>take some random balf (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) from that person and then take sample full of host dna and all kinds of things. take some rna from that huge sample full of everything and then and that is the crucial part:</p>
<p>throw it all together in some library construction. filling tons of parts in randomly and throwing all together and voila you faked yourself a new virus into existence.</p>
<p>but, "wait", i hear you say, "they have virus isolates to study and they need those to make vaccines and create tests."</p>
<p>well.... they themselves admit, that they don't have any  virus isolates:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>&rt;Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available ...</p>
<p>BUT i hear you ask again, "there are tests going on in the millions, what are they testing for then?"</p>
<p>that is the best part, as you don't have a real new virus according to the data, you of course can't have real tests, which is beneficial if you want to change numbers how you like.</p>
<p>instead of real tests you use some worthless PCR-method "tests". you can change the numbers of cycles and thus increase the number of positive results to your liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/</a></p>
<p>you also don't have any known false positive or false negative rates of course, so the full false positive rate, which i would argue is 100% of the positive results goes into a worthless statistic :)</p>
<p>tests so great, that they test fruits and goats positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a></p>
<p>and no, antibody "tests" are just as worthless:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2469">https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2469</a></p>
<p>so you got no scientific proof of the virus, you got no real tests whatsoever, you got NO unique symptoms whatsoever either, so what are you left with?</p>
<p>some people in china randomly falling over, this could have been part of setup propaganda, they could have gotten hit by who knows what, but probably just some acting i guess at this point.</p>
<p>and you got in some places more deaths for a certain period and those just straight up got murdered through blowing their lungs out:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z">https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z</a></p>

<p>&rt;<strong>Sara said COVID-19 patients are placed on ventilators rather than less invasive CPAP or BiPAP machines due to fears about the virus spreading</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>She explained: 'The ventilators have high pressure, which then causes barotrauma, it causes trauma to the lungs'</strong> </p>
<p>so it's a scam, from beginning to end,</p>
<p>and why those people fell over is something, that we may never know for certain and whether it was fake or not, but rightnow there is no evidence, that we are dealing with anything new whatsoever!</p>
<p>_________</p>
<p>this comment goes into great detail about the original paper claiming to have found a new virus and how it is worthless garbage, it also presents research and references, that shows, that the "tests" for "covid-19" are worthless garbage.</p>
<p>since i wrote this comment a bit ago a new development happened however.</p>
<p>an external peer review exists now, that tears the original paper, that claims to have the first "test" for "covid-19" a new one:</p>
<p><a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In light of our re-examination of the test protocol to identify SARS-CoV-2 described in the Corman-Drosten paper we have identified concerning errors and inherent fallacies which render the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test useless.</strong></p>
<p>i am NOT throwing out blind believes, but i went over and am sharing the research, that shows, that nothing new was isolated and no new real test exists.</p>
<p>and  nothing with new unique symptoms has been shown to exist either.</p>
<p>so the conclusion is clear:</p>
<p>0 evidence exists for anything new to exists, so one can rightfully state,</p>
<p><strong>that there is no new virus! there is no new disease!</strong></p>

        <p>There’s quite a bit to unpack here.</p>
<p>Many of the articles you have linked aren’t entirely credible, as they themselves make claims with little to no proven evidence (they say they have evidence, but that evidence is only verified by them, and many of the articles come from small or even independent “news” articles). One of the links you sent shows what is happening in Portugal...a country known for having a super corrupt government and not being trustworthy. </p>
<p>Secondly, there are many things in the world that have no physical evidence to exist, yet people still believe anyways. Black holes are invisible, and planets that get too close are sucked in immediately, vanishing. Does that mean black holes don’t exist? There’s no evidence for god, or reincarnation or karma, does that mean every religious person on the planet is some kind of blind idiot? No.</p>
<p>We haven’t even seen the bottom of the ocean, but that doesn’t mean we assume it’s bottomless. The safest assumption is the best assumption. </p>
<p>People are having trouble breathing and are dying at alarming rates for seemingly no reason, and there is no way every government across the entire world is faking hundreds of thousands of deaths and somehow hiding people away so that they can create a clandestine operation to trick the public into believing that there is a fake virus.</p>

<p>well we should stick to the facts and look at what the actual numbers say.</p>
<p>this report does a nice breakdown showing, that generally winter-burden mortality is not worse than in other years in most cases. the insane "covid peak".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832637_All-cause_mortality_during_COVID-19_No_plague_and_a_likely_signature_of_mass_homicide_by_government_response">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341832637_All-cause_mortality_during_COVID-19_No_plague_and_a_likely_signature_of_mass_homicide_by_government_response</a> </p>
<p>it goes over the euro momo and usa data and goes into some detail about the "covid-peak" in some places.</p>
<p>to me the "covid-peak" can easily get explained by government murdering people as i already have shown in my comment before:</p>
<p>____ </p>
<p>and you got in some places more deaths for a certain period and those just straight up got murdered through blowing their lungs out:</p>

<strong>She explained: 'The ventilators have high pressure, which then causes barotrauma, it causes trauma to the lungs'</strong> </p>
<p>_______</p>
<p>oh and they also pushed DNR (do not resuscitate) orders onto people, or have doctors put them in WITHOUT patient consent even, this of course also spikes the overall mortality rate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>deliberate false and deadly treatments to kill people and pushing DNRs are  not my opinion, but what the references say of course.</p>
<p>so what you are mostly left with is a reclassification of deaths and NOT an addition of new deaths.</p>
<p>so let's go over the death counting scam with a few countries as examples.</p>
<p>austria:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html">https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html</a> </p>
<p>&rt; (1) Jede verstorbene Person, die zuvor COVID-positiv getestet wurde, wird in der Statistik als „COVID-Tote/r“ geführt, unabhängig davon, ob sie direkt an den Folgen der Viruserkrankung selbst oder „mit dem Virus“ (an einer potentiell anderen Todesursache) verstorben ist. </p>
<p>says, that they are counting everyone who dies WITH a positive covid-19 "test" as a covid-19 death. so heart disease deaths, cancer deaths, car accidents, whoever everyone with a positive test gets thrown into the statistic as a "covid-19 death"</p>
<p>UK the exact same:</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Number of deaths of people who had had a positive test result for COVID-19 and died within 28 days of the first positive test. </p>
<p>usa the same:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09">https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR2fY7dVdMo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR2fY7dVdMo</a> </p>
<p>and they also include a MASSIVE financial interest in calling deaths "covid-19 deaths"</p>
<p>now you might think to yourself: "surely that can't be going on, no way this gets done in practice".</p>
<p>well to just show 2 examples:</p>
<p>here we have a motor cycle crash death getting thrown into the statistic as a "covid-19 death":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-questions-raised-after-fatal-motorcycle-crash-listed-as-covid-19-death">https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-questions-raised-after-fatal-motorcycle-crash-listed-as-covid-19-death</a> </p>
<p>and here we got a person falling from a 10ft ladder and dying from the fall a "covid-19 death":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8958309/Builder-51-died-falling-10ft-ladder-killed-coronavirus.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8958309/Builder-51-died-falling-10ft-ladder-killed-coronavirus.html</a> </p>
<p>can't make this shit up.</p>
<p>the traitor governments aren't even hiding this as i have shown you with 3 examples already. they are OPENLY telling you, that they are just throwing everyone who dies with a positive test into the statistic and as i have already shown you before the covid-19 "tests" are completely worthless.</p>
<p>so what happens is, that people die from certain diseases as they have died before, but now they are getting called "covid-19 deaths" int he statistic with ever increasing fake number, that gets flashed all over mainstream media to create fear and breed acceptance of slavery to government measures.</p>
<p>and as said the short spike, that was seen  in overall mortality in some countries can easily get explained through deadly false treatments as shown and other reasons.</p>
<p>&rt;  so that they can create a clandestine operation to trick the public into believing that there is a fake virus. </p>
<p>this isn't their first rodeo. look at the swineflu scam, that had fake models from the SAME PERSON btw. extremely harmful vaccines, false media fear propaganda and lying governments.</p>
<p>the people, who back then  were still somewhat listened to  like wolfgang wodarg and were able to stop this insanity with the swineflu  somewhat are now getting completely ignored and attacked by the mainstream media.</p>
<p>and remember, that what you can believe or imagine yourself doesn't matter.</p>
<p>the facts are that tons of governments deliberately counts deaths wrong to create fake numbers. i showed you 3 examples of them saying it to our faces.</p>
<p>look at the facts and don't be limited by what you think is possible or isn't possible.</p>

        <p>I won’t deny that some of these facts are true, but again, it’s not the whole story.</p>
<p>The DNR orders are to prevent doctors from getting infected. Would you go mouth to mouth with someone who was infected with an airborne virus? Especially if you were an already overworked doctor taking care of way too many patients. I certainly wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Additionally let’s address the fact that most of your information is coming from the government, and yet you call them the “traitor government” you’re saying the government can’t be trusted, but you are also completely trusting all the information they are giving you. Does that not cause some dissonance in your argument?</p>
<p>Are the death numbers inflated? Yes, partially. But the infection numbers aren’t, and in my opinion, any deaths are too many deaths. Just because some deaths are not Covid related doesn’t mean Covid doesn’t exist or that we shouldn’t take measures to protect ourselves. Better safe than sorry.</p>

        <p>&rt;But the infection numbers aren’t</p>
<p>to requote my own comment sadly, that you seem to forgot to read or sth.:</p>
<p>_______ </p>
<p>instead of real tests you use some worthless PCR-method "tests". you can change the numbers of cycles and thus increase the number of positive results to your liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/</a></p>
<p>you also don't have any known false positive or false negative rates of course, so the full false positive rate, which i would argue is 100% of the positive results goes into a worthless statistic :)</p>
<p>tests so great, that they test fruits and goats positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a></p>
<p>________</p>
<p>since i wrote this comment a bit ago a new development happened however.</p>
<p>an external peer review exists now, that tears the original paper, that claims to have the first "test" for "covid-19" a new one:</p>
<p><a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In light of our re-examination of the test protocol to identify SARS-CoV-2 described in the Corman-Drosten paper we have identified concerning errors and inherent fallacies which render the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test useless.</strong></p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>the tests are COMPLETELY worthless. the external peer review is completely destroying the original paper claiming to establish this new "covid-19 test".</p>
<p>the court ruling is also shown here and the funny tanzanian example, where fruit and goats test positive ;)</p>
<p>and a funny recent one, where an austrian politician tests cola live while speaking in the parlament with a "fast test":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-aGdBh_sXI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-aGdBh_sXI</a> </p>
<p>guess what the cola has covid-19 ;)</p>
<p>do you see the picture now of completely worthless tests being done to fake  "covid-19 infection numbers" into existence.</p>
<p>what more can i do than provide you a mountain of evidence, that the infection and death numbers are all fake?</p>
<p>&rt; The DNR orders are to prevent doctors from getting infected. Would you go mouth to mouth with someone who was infected with an airborne virus? Especially if you were an already overworked doctor taking care of way too many patients. I certainly wouldn’t. </p>
<p>as far as i know mouth to mouth is NOT part of CPR in any hospital.</p>
<p>random CPR example on  doll in hospital:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXmAzsRQi9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXmAzsRQi9I</a> </p>
<p>you already have all the tech ready in the hospital, so there is no reason for any mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>you can see in the video  the bag ventilation thingy pressed onto the mouth and nose, until the patient in this case a doll is intubated.</p>
<p>so you have the wrong idea of how CPR is done in those cases.</p>
<p>&rt; Does that not cause some dissonance in your argument? </p>
<p>it is an interesting question why the governments openly state how they fake the death numbers. however as you already saw those government statements are not the only evidence for false counting and in this i can not see a motive why they would lie about something, that will NEVER get mentioned on mainstream media anyways.</p>
<p>but why speculate to much. the reality is, that they all did write down, that they are faking the numbers. you can wonder about this yourself.</p>
<p>the information stated in bright letters is often different to the one, that you can get in the details and it is no different here.</p>
<p>maybe they just don't care, that people will  read this, because most people won't read this. hell maybe they have this weird idea of having to tell the public about their scam as it is going on.</p>
<p>and keep in mind, that while yes i am putting together an argument, it is important to remember, that the references stand on their own.</p>
<p>remove all my writing between the references if you want and just go through those and make up your mind just based on them.</p>
<p>afterall i am a stranger on the internet, what do i know and who knows what my motives are. the references however including peer reviewed studies can be trusted mostly.</p>
<p>that is also why my comments are full of references. i am just trying to put them into an easy to read comment.</p>
<p>in fact i don't want anyone to believe anything i say. i want people to read the references and figure things out for themselves.</p>
<p>you think, that the governments are  saying, that they are lying about the death counting to spike numbers is weird for such a scam? well off you go now you got something to dig in and see what you can come up with after further research.</p>

<p>Not that it matters, because every source will just get written off a "right wing white nationalist conspiracy" in some way or another.</p>

        <p>Where’s your link to back up this?</p>
<p>“ One of the links you sent shows what is happening in Portugal...a country known for having a super corrupt government and not being trustworthy.”</p>
<p>That’s one hell of a bold statement. I’d like to see some peer reviewed studies and detailed articles from “reputable” publications backing up this assertion and providing the details and facts to verify it. In what ways are they corrupt? School system? Elections? Medical community? Law enforcement? Corporate sector? Private sectors? Banking and financial industries? Media? Public services (water, chemicals, safety regulations)? Court system? Product liability? Auto safety? Welfare? Child and family social workers?</p>
<p>I mean, which portions of the country of Portugal are so massively corrupt, and where are the facts that back this up? And make sure you show some proof from publications and data conducted by other countries or the EU, since we apparently can’t trust anything they say or print because they’re corrupt at their very core.</p>
<p>Also, I find it a bit ironic that you are so totally sold and convinced on the massive corruption of the entire country of Portugal, yet in the next breath you argue that anybody who believes governments around the world might be corrupt enough to not tell the truth about the virus is an absurd tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. </p>
<p>You literally use the concept of government corruption to write off an article that doesn’t align with your Covid narrative.</p>
<p>Then you question the very idea of governments lying about the virus and argue there’s just no logical motive for governments to lie to their citizenry (and the entire world) so, therefore, that’s a nothingburger topic we don’t need to investigate and should just outright dismiss.</p>
<p>So I’ll ask you the same thing about Portugal: What’s in it for them? If they’re as corrupt as you say they are then what’s the driving force behind that, who is benefiting, and what’s their endgame or reasoning having an entire operating system and government structure that is deeply and profoundly corrupt?</p>

        <p>All of those questions you just asked me about Portugal are my main argument about why it’s ludicrous to think that every country on earth came up with a “fake” virus.</p>
<p>Who benefits from any of this?</p>
<p>The main reason why I haven’t posted any articles about my sources yet is due to this subreddits rules. Since I am not a member of this sub I need to wait 15 minutes before comments. With all the people talking to me in this thread the current amount of time I’d have to wait is about 6 and a half hours, not including actually writing the posts and compiling the evidence.</p>
<p>Most of the people replying to my comment have already made it clear they don’t actually care about my evidence, and I know from experience earlier in the year that I can’t convince a lot of these people. If anyone is actually interested in discussing this I encourage them to DM me about it.</p>
<p>The only thing I can say now is: Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Worst case, virus is fake and you’re uncomfortable for a few months. Best case you keep yourself and everyone you love a little bit safer. There is not one downside to wearing a mask.</p>
