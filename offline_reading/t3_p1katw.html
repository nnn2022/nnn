    <strong>I hate this 'new normal'</strong>
    <p><p>I know this has been mentioned countless of times, but I still can't help but cringe at this term. I recently called a mental health hotline, and the person on the phone actually used this phrase on me and told me that "I just have to adapt to life as it is now because we will never return to pre-pandemic life". I cannot even begin to explain how much that triggered me. Is this really the way we are going to live our lives from now on? Will we never be able to stop wearing masks, or travel without having to quarantine? These were supposed to be temporary measures just to curb the spread of this virus, but now there are people who genuinely believe and want this way of life to go on forever??</p>
<p>I cannot imagine myself living a life where offices don't exist and everyone works from home. I cannot imagine schools being conducted over Zoom, or gyms and dance studios requiring safe distancing forever. I feel like I am the only person who cannot move on from the memories of pre-pandemic era, and everyone else seems have adapted to this current way of life and accepted things as they are. The world is in such a mess right now, and everything just seems so bleak and depressing. Nowadays, whenever I watch shows depicting normal life (people hanging out with friends without masks, having team discussions in the office, going to a movie or concert etc.), I just can't believe that the last time I did those things was in 2019. If life is going to be like this forever and this 'new normal' nonsense persists, I don't know what I'm living in this world for anymore. Everyone tells me that I should just make the best of the situation, and aim for partial normality/do as many activities as the current situation permits. Am I wrong to say that that is not enough for me? I don't want partial normality, or "some semblance" of freedom. I want my freedom back. I want the old normal, the life we used to have where we can go out and socialise with others without restrictions, where there was a set routine for work and school.</p>
<p>I feel like nothing can reassure me anymore. They said vaccines will be the way out of it, but the rate of vaccination is so slow and there are so many stubborn people who refuse to get it. Not to mention the recent article published in the UK that the Delta variant causes the same amount of virus in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. And then there are so many debates about vaccine passports, mask mandates, international travel bans, freedom of choice for vaccination etc. It truly feels like the world is in a mess and society is so segregated because of COVID issues, that the spillover effects of this pandemic may last forever. Businesses have folded, entire industries (especially travel) have been halted for more than a year, and so many people are unemployed. People kept saying last year that this would be over in Fall 2021, but it certainly does not seem to be over now. Now WHO is saying end of 2022. I really wish they would stop shifting the goal post and do something about this already. I know things change and we must roll with the punches, but this is all too much. Will we ever live a normal life again?</p></p>

        <p>You are living in the new 9/11type era. This is what it felt like when freedoms were restricted here in America 20+ years ago and the fear to keep the population in compliance was the "terrorist threat".  Those measures were also suppose to be temporary.</p>
<p>When this covid situation all first started I spoke to an elder management colleague in denial. He kept saying "when the summer comes and the weather warms up it will kill this virus." I said to him "I don't think this is going to be a few months type of situation. This is going to take 5 years if we are lucky." I also said this is a world I don't want to be living in if this is going to be the next 5-10+ years of existence.</p>
<p>You just learn from the prior experience of national emergency, and this is what it's like. But this is far worse, and now invading all aspects of culture and social life all over the world unfortunately.</p>
<p>With some hope, just like 9/11 and the war on terrorism, people will forgot about the boogieman and their attention will eventually focus on other things, which I'm hoping for to get this monstrosity to be over with, and people won't be afraid of covid anymore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm a little more concerned of what the next crisis event will be to distract people from all this.</p>

<p>I hope you are right, but war with terror and previous like war with communist there was external “threat” - USSR or “bad” Muslims with turbans. Nation was terrified but somewhat united.
Now the boogeyman is internal and people are turning on their own.
Now instead of keeping terrorist out we will be keeping other people out. 
This is ultimate division.</p>
<p>Some would say that’s the result of decades of programming and destruction of family and closely knitted communities. Or the last step, where you are told to be afraid of your peers.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. Why do you think they brought all the troops back from the war?</p>
<p>They are prepping for civil unrest here. And any subversive, destabilizing, or social control techniques used overseas is now free reign here on us.</p>
<p>The social division and insidious internal decay we are seeing is unnerving, and hopefully some unity can be found.</p>

        <p>I hope the policy of vaccine mandates in the military, aren't going to be those future trigger or flash points to sow further division.  </p>
<p>I know a few people in the military who are planning on refusing the vaccine. </p>
<p>We will see.</p>

        <p>If people considered 2017-2019 to be “normal” then they were deceived, this has been in the works since then. Thus, there never was and never will be a normal. The world economic forum, bill gates foundation, and the U.N. is pushing the term “new normal.” Stay strong, be more spiritual, get more knowledgeable and prepare for the worst at any moment. God is with us.</p>

        <p>I understand how you feel. It’s really overwhelming and it’s a massively manipulative scenario so of course we feel like it’s not enough because it isn’t. It’s deeply wrong what’s going on. You said that stubborn people aren’t getting vaxxed. Perhaps look at that piece - what are they seeing - why are people refusing?  Who is telling us what to do and why are we listening? It ends when enough people stop complying. Understand why people aren’t going along with “the plan”. Own your power - we have to come together and stop it.</p>
