    <strong>When a mask goblin is harassing you, don't try to convert them. Try to....</strong>
    <p><p>....Convert the people listening.</p>
<p>If someone is so deranged that they'll verbally attack someone for not wearing a disgusting, bacteria-infested diaper on their face then they're too far gone. Moreover, they aren't even good people.</p>
<p>They're either narcissists who <em>love</em> telling people what to do OR they're members of the woke cult who are using this as an opportunity to seize power and destroy western civilization by spreading their toxic ideology/religion.</p>
<p>Either way, terrible people.</p>
<p>If you want to resist and enter an establishment without a mask, here's your game plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smile and be friendly</strong> - The propaganda these people consume tells them that we're all a bunch of violent rednecks who don't "believe in science" and want to kill their grandma. We all know that's projection, diaper fanatics are more likely to be violent than free breathers. If bystanders see that you're smiling and being polite while a diaper-cult member is screaming at you then they'll think you're the sane one (because you are).</li>
<li><strong>Use humor</strong> - If you're a quick-witted person then you can clown on the pro-muzzlers a little bit. Woke ideology is completely humorless and patently ridiculous. There are so many little contradictions and absurdities you can make fun of. If you can make the bystanders laugh, you've already won.</li>
<li><strong>Dress well</strong> - The propaganda machine makes them think that people who value freedom are degenerates. If you're young, dress trendy. Lockdowns and diaper-wearing are considered "cool" due to celebrity influence. Show that it's possible to be a "cool kid" and value freedom at the same time. If you're older, dress like a mature professional. Show that we're the reasonable ones. It sounds trivial but that's why the other side is winning. They understand that the so-called "shallow" things are the most important.</li>
<li><strong>Be in a light-hearted mood</strong> - Don't walk around with a serious demeanor. Don't psych yourself up by getting mad at pro-muzzlers. Psych yourself up by hanging out with friends or watching stand-up comedy. Then walk around without a muzzle. Your light-hearted mood will win people over. Normal people are sick and tired of all the seriousness and negativity. If they see that free breathers are normal, fun people it'll help win them over.</li>
<li><strong>Small-chunk it</strong> <strong><em>-</em></strong> You don't have to go all-in at first. Just pretend you forgot to wear the diaper and when someone says something, fake-apologize and put it on. You'll notice that most of the time nobody even says anything. Most people don't care and are just complying because of the pressure. They're so worried that they'll get in trouble for not following some random rule that they aren't even paying attention to what you're doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>EDIT: Ask them why sick people in hospitals didn't wear masks before the pandemic. It's fun.</p></p>

        <p>My favorite suggestion was this statement made by someone here:  "your health isn't my responsibility.  If it were id probably tell you to lose some weight" which only works on fat people,  but here in the US you've got a 50/50 chance that you're dealing with an overweight person.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn a mask since March and just walk around smiling and greet others. I haven’t had any real problems, but I’m in Japan so it’s different. <br>
I did have a few say some things when I walked out of a store once, I just stretched and took in a deep breathe and said, “This fresh air is so nice, oh you guys can’t experience that because your all in mask. To bad”</p>

        <p>What doctors are saying that, do you have any sources? Do you have any evidence at all of this claim? </p>
<p>Also lets define 'selfish' shall we "(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure." Sounds like an anti-masker to me.</p>

        <p>I'm sure you care about the millions of people losing their jobs, businesses, and mental sanity because you think you have a right to their bodies.</p>
<p>You crave the satisfaction of having the moral high ground, and pointing out how "evil" the others are who disagree with you. As long as you can be the self-righteous moral pointing out the evils of the "troublemakers" you dont care how many people suffer, because at the end of the day you'll feel good about yourself and get useless internet points.</p>

<p>You have the right to do whatever you want as long as it doesn't impact the lives of other people. You live in a society, and the greater health of that society comes first. Its not a massive ask to wear a mask to potentially save the lives and health of others. Don't like it? Go live in the middle of nowhere. If you think you're "suffering" by having to wear a mask then you're nothing but a selfish man-child who needs to grow up, and probably get some therapy.</p>

        <p>&rt; If millions of people are losing their jobs thats a governmental issue.</p>
<p>Yes, because government destroyed all their jobs and businesses by overstepping their bounds with ineffective, immoral and ridiculous shutdown measures.</p>
<p>&rt;You have the right to do whatever you want as long as it doesn't impact the lives of other people.</p>
<p>Of course, but who is defining what "impact" means here?</p>
<p>&rt;You live in a society, and the greater health of that society comes first.</p>
<p>This is a phrase that is impossible to define, and doesn't really mean anything upon closer examination. If you implement policy A that harms Bob and helps Jeff, have we improved the "greater health" of society? How do you measure "greater health"? Who gave government the right to pick who and how many people it can harm?</p>
<p>Collectivist thinking has been a tragedy of human history because it relies on coercion and violence backed by nothing other than moral superiority. It doesn't matter what you personally think is okay or reasonable, you have no right to force anybody to abide by your ideas. The individual is the smallest minority. There can be no justice in society, if there is no justice for the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>My well-being is my own responsibility, and nobody owes me anything other than what they've voluntary agreed to. I don't have the right to restrict others freedoms so that I feel safe, comfortable, happy, or anything else. There is no moral foundation to suggest otherwise, because the only alternative is tyranny on a massive scale, which history has show plenty of times.</p>
<p>Viruses and disease are a fact of human life that will be around forever, and there's nothing we can do about it. Locking someone up because they <em>potentially</em> could transmit a virus is like locking someone up because they could <em>potentially</em> violate someone's property. It's abhorrent, and sets the precedent for any arbitrary violation of rights to occur later.</p>
<p>This was the ethical argument, but the reality is none of these mandates even work, so you can't even claim the utility argument either.</p>

        <p>It's called Australia. Do you really think that actually stopping people from being in contact with one and other has zero effect on the transmition of an airborne virus? Do you really think that putting a barrier between your mouth and the people around you has zero effect on the transmition of an airborne virus? Surely you're not that dense.</p>

        <p>Definitely. I will admit that although I regularly follow these guidelines, it is so much harder to follow them, when being confronted, and everybody else around “appears” to be on the opposing side. It is important to remember that most people are NOT against you and are just following instructions to not cause problems over “something small”.</p>

        <p>Agreed, it is really hard to do.</p>
<p>Your last point is correct, most people don't care about any of this and want to live their lives without causing trouble. The problem is that they're going to keep on not causing trouble right up until the concentration camps open up. </p>
<p>We have to wake them up. </p>
<p>Also don't fall for the propaganda yourself. We're the normal ones. We're not the extremists, the pro-muzzlers are.</p>
<p>We're not against mask-wearing if someone is in a high-risk category and freely chooses to put it on. We're against forced compliance. We want people to assess risk for themselves. We're sane.</p>

        <p>Additionally if you’re a minority, young/elderly or female or anyone else they deem “vulnerable”, make sure the people around you know that you’re a “young female girl being harassed” by a “grown man” to wear a mask. Doomers care a lot about being woke. Show how ridiculous they are.</p>

        <p>Yes!! All of this is perfect. The best thing you can do to make people support your beliefs is to make yourself a more likable person than the opposition. It’s the same kind of psychology as when people  would become conservatives after watching those SJW cringe videos back in 2016</p>
