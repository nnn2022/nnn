    <strong>Help me convince husband of dangers ahead</strong>
    <p><p>I have him convinced of the dangers of the vax. I had to work at it but he knows I know a lot of medical stuff with the extreme health problems I have and I've had to fight for diagnosis on multiple things. I showed him articles and links. He still believes in the system somewhat and thinks conspiracy theories are wrong. We are both leftists [me disaffected]  but he still believes in at least the progressive side of the Dem party. I told him they could make the vaxx mandatory and I told him I would rather die then be made into a human GMO and suffer more medical trauma than I have already gone through. [I have religious/spiritual beliefs about the vaxx too] He seems to think everything is going to return to normal. I want to prep to the hilt too, but he isn't on board with that. All I have is some seeds, a small raised garden off property and a Jackery that would give me one night of power for a CPAP machine. There's maybe 3-4 weeks worth of canned food in here, if it all went to hell and water is easily obtainable. He thinks I am crazy when I told him they could make the vaxx mandatory and then what will we do then, and that the country is collapsing. Sometimes I think some stuff gets through, we get into the "let's leave the country" since he can claim citizenship elsewhere, but all that country has gone more totalitarian. He think it's nuts when I talk about moving more rural or finding a place where people are more close knit and down to earth. [My town is probably at least 80 percent vaxxed except for the inner city area and rural ones.] He is not happy since I told him I hate the Democratic party now [well I hate both parties] but he is aware of my conspiracy past and stuck it out with me during my past Christian fundamentalist days....[he never converted in] I get scared because the pressures are immense. I know he has to have some cognitive dissonance going since I used to talk about them using a plague to oppress the planet, and take control and about RFID chips, and things like that. 
I don't think he will take the vaxx, he has a disorder which gives on a very very high risk of blood clots. He also knows my med problems and won't pressure me either. However I am worried he is not seeing what is coming. I know he is under a lot of pressure and we are old and have gone through too much in this life and are so isolated.</p>
<p>He still believes in the system far more then I do and thinks this going to be "over" soon</p>
<p>Provide links and other advice. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>Well, there <em>was</em> a “successful” animal trial for the covid vaccines before they moved on to human testing, however the animals were only observed for 28 days and I’m pretty sure none of them were sacrificed to determine any potential adverse biological effects.</p>

        <p>I wonder about that, maybe it's better he isn't anxious. I think he doesn't want to think about it honestly.</p>

        <p>My wife is the same way.  She didn’t believe anything I was telling her for many many months.  We have now agreed that the world is fucked and are getting along so much better now but I have begun to realize that she’s not better off stressing about everything. Stress is very unhealthy and we should avoid as much of it as possible</p>

        <p>I agree about stress. Maybe husband can't take anymore. I can understand that. I am stressed out. My husband admits the world is fucked at least. I suppose I am thinking of planning matters here. Hope your wife feels better soon too.</p>
