    <strong>nurenburg code violations</strong>
    <p><p>i'm sure others here have said this exact thing, but i thought i would post this. if you have already gone through all this, my opinion is at the bottom</p>
<p>1 The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that, before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject, there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person, which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.
The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.</p>
<ul>
<li>why it violates: the person involved should be of legal capacity to give consent. they have allowed like 12 year olds to get the vaccines behind their parents backs. the child may not even realize they are being used as a lab rat.
no intervention of force is allowed, deciet, check fraud check, coercion check. contraint, check (constraint as in possible constraint of basic liberties if we deny the shot) 
also, the person involved does not have knowledge or comprehention of what is involved, since its experimental. they are to be told of the hazards, what to expect, and the health effects. again, the vaccines are experimental, so thats impossible. </li>
</ul>
<p>2 The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>why it violates: cannot be uneccesary. ivermectin is a legitimate alternative which is safer. in mexico it has reduced hospitalizations by 76%. there is plenty of evidence it works</li>
</ul>
<p>5 No experiment should be conducted, where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the
experimental physicians also serve as subjects.</p>
<ul>
<li>why it violates: the knowledge of the prior knowledge of risks of the vaccines is being suppressed. this endangers people. (experts being censored warning us)</li>
</ul>
<p>9 During the course of the experiment, the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end, if he has reached the physical or mental state, where continuation of the experiment seemed to him to be impossible.</p>
<ul>
<li>why it violates: the threat of our liberties being restricted impedes the subjects ability to put an end to the experiment. an experiment he has been coerced into which is against the nurenburg code</li>
</ul>
<p>10 During the course of the experiment, the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgement required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why it violates: because the risks are unknown, there is probable cause to assume the continuation of the experiment is likely, or at least possible to result in injury to the subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opinion: this worldwide experiment is taking place masquerading as an approved safe treatment for those who are not aware that they are the test subjects, some of which are children, and this adds another layer to medical malpractice... another layer that i guess they didn't think they would even have to say because it is so incredibly unlikely. you cannot create a scenario where someone may not know they are being tested on due to basic morals. even if the vaccines turn out to be safe, there are people who are unaware they are being tested on, which is not okay given that ivermectin is not experimental and it could be used instead</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

It is also 'part of international common law and may be applied, in both civil and criminal cases, by state, federal and municipal courts in the United States"</p>

        <p>You said the magic word.  "May". As in  I may win the lottery today. The tooth fairy may visit today.</p>
<p>The court case in Texas two weeks ago,  the nurses.</p>
<p>The judge said,  the Nuremberg code only applies to governments,  not to businesses and not in this case.</p>
<p>So it may apply,   or it may not.</p>
<p>Your homework is now to figure out which is more important to a US judge.  International common law or a precedent in a US Federal court.</p>

        <p>In fact, there is a US court case that says people can vaxxed against their will.  I think it was upheld at scotus.  </p>
<p>Yes we are.  You will end up taking it.  </p>
<p>In fact the only way I dont see that happenings is:</p>
<p>Your employer doesn't make you,  it is not approved by the FDA,  or it drops off the radar and no one cares anymore.  Someone gets a good court case and wins.</p>
<p>The nurses had no leg.  Nurses have been forced to take flu jabs for years.  This is no different. </p>
<p>In fact ,  the pressure is minor now because they aren't approved.   Once the are approved,  there is no speed bump anymore.</p>

        <p>Yep. All you said is spot on. I'm being forced into it by my university. There's absolutely nothing a reluctant person can point to that will serve as an effective shield against a soft coercion into "vaccination." In Indiana, where I live, it is state law that "every child in Indiana SHALL be vaccinated against..." a litany of diseases for which vaccinations are now routine. They've been unethically mandating vaccines by law for decades. This is no different. We are cattle, they do what they want with us. Be prepared to quit your job/school or take your chances with death/disability. That's what life comes down to now.</p>
