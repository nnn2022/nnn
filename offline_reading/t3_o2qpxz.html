    <strong>CAL/OSHA "VOTES" TO LIFT FACE MASK MANDATE FOR THE VACCINATED (SEGRAGATION IS BACK)</strong>
    <p><p>Went into the parts store this morning as usual and was about to put on my face diaper but noticed no one was wearing them.. "okay fuck this thing" I think to my unvaccinated self as I stuff it into my pocket. I'm telling the clerk what I need and at the same time he's announcing to every passerby that if they are vaccinated they can take off the mask. One office chick walks by and replies to him, "I know, but I don't have health insurance right now and I don't want to risk getting sick from the unvaccinated." She might as well had just said "I know, but the vaccines don't do shit as we all know but this mask will help because science." </p>
<p>From what I've seen the mass population her in Cali is dead asleep, and now the state is moving forward with it's plan of mass segregation of the population into vaxxed and unvaxxed. I see vaccine ID's coming within the next few months if not sooner than that, at which point I have no choice but to move my wife and I out of the state before it goes full Nazi Germany. I grew up being bullied so at this point I'm more willing to wear a mask than before just so everyone knows I'm not vaxxed because I actually want them to be irritated and come at me because I'll bring it right back</p>
<p>Stay safe friends</p></p>

        <p>I’m in Cali too and every day I see masked people walking alone down my quiet street. I went to Target and was one of TWO people wearing a mask. Today i have to go the grocery store as I can’t put it off any longer….and I expect be the only maskless person. All I can say is, masks aren’t required here anymore so I’m not the weird one for walking around maskless!</p>
