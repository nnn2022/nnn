        <p>It won't, this is why you have mix your sample with the buffer, it neutralises the pH and stops anything highly acid breaking the test.</p>
<p>If you add 10x the amount of lemon juice it breaks it, if you did a swab in it then put it in the buffer like you would normally it doesn't come up positive.</p>
<p>If you do the test completely wrong you can make it positive.
If you do it correctly it will be negative.</p>

        <p>An account created solely to live in this sub and be a dissenting voice. I'm sure most in here would appreciate good faith discussion. But this is clearly a user with a specific purpose.</p>
<p>EDIT/ADDITION: Wow! So to prove the point of this user's shady behavior. Here is my last reply in a LONG convo that is hidden behind multiple clicks after they started deleting their replies to me and editing their previous messages instead.</p>
<p>So if anyone else happens to have gotten to this point. Minutes after I edited my last post I got banned from r/pics out of no where! I actually didn't even know I was in the sub tbh. üòê</p>

<p>I never claimed to be addressing you "in good faith", clearly.</p>
<p>One fact you can't deny is that you have created a dummy account for the sole purpose of being a dissenting voice in this one sub alone. I have not browsed your history in detail as I don't have the amount of time that you clearly do to be that detailed and persistent in my response. </p>
<p>I could be wrong of course but I am going to guess from what I have seen, in this account that you have dedicated to this sub, you have not had one comment where you are in agreement with anyone, or have even offered so much as an encouraging or positive tone in any of your messages. This is why I do not believe you are here for any good faith discussion.</p>
<p>You also have admitted to being a dissenting voice in this sub, so I feel pretty confident in my assumptions above. Now I can also derive other assumptions based off of the fact you have created a dummy account JUST for this sub and purpose.</p>
<p>I assumed the most likely option, just some internet troll with nothing better to do than spend their time stirring up shit among people they disagree with. Another likely option is that you are indeed a bot. Even a quick look has shown me you have had multiple long discussions like this one on this sub. Citing many articles, having LONG replies like this one I am currently writing, and doing this a lot. It takes a lot of time to do what I'm doing right now. Even the fastest typers and readers would have to spend a LOT of their time to equal the participation you have had in this sub. For someone to create a dummy sub to spend A LOT of time on it seems like odd behavior even for a dedicated internet troll. But people are pretty amazing and will dedicate a lot of time to anything these days, so who knows. </p>
<p>This is what my shillbot comment was meant to describe, which is a description of one's behavior, not an insult like calling some an asshole or something, which I never did.</p>
<p>I also don't consider this an "attack". This behavior of yours is intended to provoke attacks, but describing behavior is not an attack, even if the person who is having their behavior described says it is. I do take issue with this behavior, as most do, which is why I called you out on it. But I still did not attack you because of it.</p>
<p>Also in the quick look I took, and in the detailed comments I saw from you, whether you intend to or not, you came across like someone who thinks they are an expert in the field of COVID and/or the fields related to the discussion around it. If this is true, which I highly doubt, then I would ask what is the motive behind this behavior? If you are creating an anonymous dummy account to discuss a subject that you are an expert on, with the intent of trying to "educate" those who you think are wrong and potentially causing harm to others, why would you do it anonymously? Put your name on it,  make it public, take all of the piss and vinegar and insults that I have seen you throw at others out of all your replies, and have good honest discussions with people who claim to be after the truth. Then take the vast amounts of credit that many out there would be happy to give you for it for such brave behavior. I myself would commend you for it, agree with you or not.</p>
<p>This will obviously never happen. So I am pretty confident that my shillbot comment is a fair and accurate description of your behavior. </p>
<p>As far as our personal interaction goes, you also got very defensive and told me to mind my own business fairly quickly for someone who would ever claim to be after a good faith discussion. Yes I was calling out your behavior, but without insults. You were free to prove me wrong in our own discussion but never did IMO.</p>
<p>I did not address any of your points because you do not appear to be here in good faith and discussing anything with someone like that is pointless because there is no intention other than agitation.</p>
<p>It is not hard to derive facts from assumptions. I of course could be wrong, and you are always free to prove me wrong. But from what I've seen and described above I doubt you will be able to convince me. And if you think you are doing anything to convince others of anything else, based on this discussion alone my opinion is that you will not.</p>
<p>Happy hunting shillbot</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes I do believe the behavior I described to be sad indeed. Stating that belief is not an insult, just another opinion you disagree with. A differing opinion is not an insult even if you found it offensive.</p>
<p>(Also minor spelling/grammatical since I am not a botüòè)</p>

        <p>As someone who has a fair bit of experience in scientific research I see it almost as a responsibility to provide an alternative to the anti scientific sentiment on this sub, just where it's obvious and easily refutable. Which it often is without too much effort.</p>
<p>I'm not stupid enough to dox myself for the amusement of people in this sub, and it's not like qualifications matter so much here anyway, you're not paying attention to the public health and virology professionals as it is. </p>
<p>If you are admitting that I could never change your mind then you've already decided that evidence doesn't matter. That's fine, but don't pretend that you've got anything backing up your position or that it's not worthy of being called out.</p>
<p>A lot of it is not about convincing the person I'm replying to, it's just showing that false assumptions and flat out lies should be challenged, is that bad faith? I don't really care if you think it is or not, you seem to think good faith needs to be agreeing with people for some reason. </p>
<p>At the end of the day you've gone through all this because it seems you don't want someone commenting in this sub that's against the circle jerk, creating echo chambers isn't good so I'm going to keep commenting.</p>

        <p>You could at the very least do it in a positive and engaging manner. You don't. You even purposely twist words to suit your argument like you just did there. I never said you couldn't change my mind about anything, but that is how you word it in your reply. </p>
<p>You have deceptive and abrasive behavior and this is why I don't believe there is anything to gain from talking with you, in addition to my belief that you also don't have good intentions behind your behavior.</p>
<p>If you do have altruistic intentions of any kind, this approach isn't going to have many positive effects, if any at all. If this is not your intention, then yes it is bad faith. </p>
<p>Why bother asking if you don't care? If you don't care, it seems to be clear that good faith discussion isn't your intention, therefore your motives should be questioned and assumed to be poor.</p>
<p>EDIT: Adding an edit to reply to the edit of your last message since you deleted your last response before I could reply to it.</p>
<p>I have mentioned several times in my posts that it is not what you are doing, it is how you are doing it that is the problem. Yes this matter and I'm not sure why you seem to find it so hard go grasp.</p>
<p>Someone who claims to be behaving in an altruistic manner and with good intentions while acting in a deceptive manner can actually be a very dangerous person if they truly believe they do have moral high ground and that they are acting in an altruistic manner. </p>
<p>Of course if they don't truly believe this about themselves then they are just acting like a troll or shill. And people who behave like a troll or shill, whether or not that behavior is intentional, usually get treated as such. Even you deleting your responses you were embarrassed of and instead adding more to this last post shows your dishonesty and deceptive behavior.</p>
<p>In the end I am actually giving you the benefit of the doubt with my assumption of your intentions.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of the time I'm quite polite to be honest and I'm met with hostility. You think calling someone a shill is positive and engaging? Looking at your comment history you are pretty condescending most of the time and have been toe as well so I don't think you have any moral high ground.</p>
