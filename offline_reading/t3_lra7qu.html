    <strong>My Experiences Traveling by Plane to Tanzania - I Even Flew the Second Leg Without a Mask...</strong>
    <p><p>I flew Turkish Airlines out of ATL.  I showed up at the international terminal without a mask.  Not only did nobody say anything, the person checking me in overlooked my extra heavy carry-on.</p>
<p>Once I approached the TSA checkpoint, a TSA piggy told me to wear a mask.  Even though I had one just in case, I asked to be provided one.  He gave me a polyester one that smelled like it was soaked in aircraft fuel and DDT.  I'm pretty my cancer risk has gone up because of it.  Throughout the first leg, I tried to keep the mask hanging on one ear until someone would 'ask' me to put it on.</p>
<p>For the first flight to Istanbul, sometimes the flight attendants wouldn't say anything, sometimes they would.  It definitely was better than those american airlines flights where the fascists tell you how many bites of food you can take without a mask on.  I mostly just slept with the blanket over my head and my mask off.</p>
<p>As we taxied to the gate, the flight attendant complained that my mask wasn't covering my nose.  I complied, but reminded her that masks are ineffective.  A few minutes later, some arrogant prick, who claimed to be a doctor himself asked the classic, "Are you a doctor?" with a contemptuous superiority that is common amongst these glorified biology majors.  I responded that I was literate.  He then grabbed his mask with his bare hand (against CDC guidelines), pulled it down to his chin (also against guidelines), then whisper-shouted, "**** you!"  I told him that I was coming to Tanzania to help children who experience the much greater health risks of Malaria and HIV.</p>
<p>The Istanbul international airport had employees (mostly girls) riding on segways and mini-bikes telling people to put on their mask properly.  I estimate about 5-20% of the airport patrons either had their masks pulled down to their chin or wore the mask not covering their nose.  Even though, I never left the secured area, I was forced to go through another security check.  They confiscated my unopened juice box that was just given to me on my last flight and they took my tape measure.  It's one thing to steal the tape measure, but when they take a man's juice box, it becomes personal.</p>
<p>As we were getting ready to depart, I noted that the guy sitting across the aisle had placed his mask on his knee.  I wasn't going to be outdone by some geek off the street; I'm a world saver, for Pete's sake.  I took my mask off too.  I was politely reminded to wear a mask, but I didn't budge.  I did notice that the other guy put his mask back on (sell out).  We were about to take off, so the flight attendant let it go.  Once the plane took-off, I knew that it was more likely that I could make it the entire trip without one.  Most readers have seen clips of passengers being 'escorted off' of the plane, allegedly for not wearing a mask.  There was also one or two instances in the past where the plane was diverted to remove a passenger, so for the remainder of the flight I had some extra adrenaline.  I was politely reminded multiple times that I was required to wear one.  I politely refused.  Then, just when I anticipated another mask reminder, I was instead reminded to buckle up due to turbulence.  For the rest of the flight it was business as usual.</p>
<p>I will say that the flight was at about 30-40% capacity, so I had the whole exit row to myself.  When I arrived in Tanzania, the employees at the Dar es Salaam airport were wearing masks almost all of the time; however, the immigration and custom officials seemed oblivious to my lack of a face covering.</p>
<p>This was my experience, your experience may vary.  As far as I know I wasn't even 'banned' from Turkish Airlines (although they probably wouldn't tell me until I show up at the gate with a nonrefundable ticket.)  The key is to stand your ground as much as you can.  At the very least, always make them tell you to put the mask on, then you can remind them that the preponderance of evidence suggests that face masks are ineffective at preventing the spread of a viral contagion, especially amongst the general population.</p></p>

        <p>How is Tanzania in general? Can you tell us more about your trip there? I'm also interested in going there, maybe Zanzibar instead.</p>

        <p>That's too broad of a question.  Do you have any familiarity with east Africa at all?  I can answer something specific, but I have only been here a week.  I have been documenting my quest here: https://www.youtube.com/user/VeganThug/videos</p>
<p>I'll discuss a few things about my trip in the next video.</p>
