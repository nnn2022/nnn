        <p>I would actually remind the person bitching about it that we're way past the flatten the curve(which was idiotic too but we won't point that out), most people are not actually ill(asymptomatic), and its more likely a vulnerable person can infect the healthy than it is the other way around.</p>
<p>If the store doesn't enforce the policy, then I wouldn't care even if the person is screaming. It would make them look silly instead. The people around them will perhaps listen.</p>

        <p>The argument that reusing a mask is safe and will keep people healthy is just disgustingly negligent and anyone with any common sense gets that.</p>
<p>I think what helps disarm people is that they see my mask on my neck, so they're immediately at ease. I can play it off like i was about to pull it up or just forgot, whatever. Asking someone to pull their mask up seems to be a bigger trespass than demanding they produce one and put it on.</p>

        <p>The curve requires a valid test and there is no valid test as it's based on bat blood.</p>
<p>Ie Bat blood -&rt; test that might be valid for it -&rt; test on humans -&rt; results -&rt; curve.</p>
<p>At the test that might be valid for it -&rt; test on humans part, there is the wrong conclusion. You have to start at questioning the test itself.</p>

        <p>Dump boxes of masks on the floor. Hold public burnings of masks, not bought by you. Take them from businesses, or wherever you find them.  </p>
<p>What would also help, that I plan on making, is a black light comparison between a mask worn for five, fifteen and thirty minutes. Sterile v non-sterile (such as a warehouse) environment, to further disprove efficacy and to prove the dangers of wearing them.  </p>
<p>Finally, start getting in contact with Sheriffs, Constitutional attorneys and local minutemen. Begin organizing to arrest, convict and punish all politicians involved in this lie. The primary charges would be Accessory to murder, conspiring to commit genocide, treason and embezzlement.</p>

        <p>Great idea actually.
A huge poster saying "This is what &lt;country&rt; thinks about the corona measures" and below that a non-inflammable Rainwater tank with masks inside burning.</p>

        <p>I wasnâ€™t wearing one earlier in the shop, just buying some tobacco quickly, and got sworn at and nearly physically attacked right in the store by some self righteous prick - moaning about me not having a mask, and not being 2m away (when I was, it was marked on the floor)
All freedom is gone now</p>

        <p>Try not to be in victim mentality. I know, it's hard, but try to come up with things you can do. 
Also, next time, keep your voice low and steady. Stand your ground, and don't allow the person to monopolize the discussion. Speak out on your opinion. Remain respectful, and ask for the same respect in return. If the level of aggression begins to increase, respond with more force and assertiveness to show that your tolerance is decreasing.</p>
