        <p>No, I think it's a real virus, because I've spoken with real physicians and they've told me that much. There has been some talk about the Chinese deliberately releasing it, but I suspect that's unfair. The supposed release, which was said to have been accidental, was from an American owned lab near Wuhan. In other words, we have outsourcing to thank for this.</p>
<p>When a lab is run in a high tech country like the US, safety tends to be good, because we have well equipped, highly trained staff with years of experience watching everything. When that lab gets picked up and moved to a developing country because management wants to pay its employees what would be starvation level wages here, the staff there isn't so well equipped or so well experienced, and they can only do their best.</p>
<p>That being the case, I'm reluctant to condemn the Chinese scientists or technicians involved. We had some horrible accidents in our early days, too, and really, more help could have been provided to the people in China as they got going. Say, by paying some of those experienced staff members to go over to China and help train the people there, and otherwise get things going.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No, where the opportunism arises, I think, is in the response to the virus, as individual people acted on their own less than noble agendas.</p>
<p>Eg. While a civilized governor of New York would have spent a bit of money, and helped nursing homes relocate to more remote areas (perhaps temporarily) to get their residents away from the high risk, high population density areas where they'd be likelier to get infected, Cuomo signed an executive order forcing infected patients into nursing homes, ensuring the massive death toll he then used to justify a power grab.</p>
<p>The virus is real and has to see a real response, one that would have to include offering quarantine to those at risk (offering, not forcing), but bad people are still bad people, and we have a lot of them.</p>

        <p>That would hardly serve their interests, as it presents the world with what is likely to prove a persuasive argument against sending more industry to China.</p>
<p>Also, the Chinese aren't a hivemind. There are decent people living in China. There are individual Chinese people being accused of mass murder. Before such accusations are directed against anybody, least of all somebody living in a country with a dismal human rights record, one should be able to back those accusations up with something more solid than "you know this was all planned."</p>
<p>Also, why would the Chinese authorities deliberately infect their own population, first, knowing that they'd be putting themselves at risk? China is known for being a gerontocracy, is it not?</p>

        <p>I appreciate the thought out reply, nice to have a discussion on here that doesnt devolve into name-calling. </p>
<p>My general (admittedly half-baked) thought is this: I dont believe they intentionally infected their own people. I do have a fair bit of skepticism that this was all an accident. </p>
<p>It would benefit the Chinese Government (not the individuals that make it up) greatly to have an economic collapse in Europe and The West. I feel like tariffs on imports from the east will vanish. </p>
<p>We the people cant afford to buy domestic, and companies hemorrhaging money cant afford to pay Americans to produce domestic.</p>

<p>Perhaps. But China's population clusters along its coast in a way that ours does not, so they would have every reason to suspect that the virus would hit them far harder than it would hit us.</p>

<p>Please don't. Just be careful when you move, from wherever you are now, that you're not moving into another hole filled with excrement.</p>
<p>I'd definitely recommend avoiding Chicago. And New York, too, but that probably isn't a surprise. Honestly, any large American city is probably a bad idea, at this point.</p>
