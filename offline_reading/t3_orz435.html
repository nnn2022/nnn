    <strong>The Irish government blatantly discriminates against young people, yet again.</strong>
    <p><p>Today marks the first day indoor dining resumes in Ireland, also marking the beginning of a split society in one of the most compliant countries in the world. </p>
<p>https://www.thejournal.ie/pubs-restaurants-indoor-dining-reopening-5503713-Jul2021/ </p>
<p>I hate my country, I hate what it's become. I wake up each morning in a haze and for a minute I forget I'm not allowed to be in certain places or eat a meal indoors out of the lashings of rain that shower over us most days of the year. </p>
<p>Only those fully vaccinated can eat indoors however young workers who have not had access to vaccines may not be permitted inside unless they are WORKING for the vaccinated.</p>
<p>I'm 23 and have never tested positive for Covid-19. Neither have all of my immediate family, friends or boyfriend, most of us students or working in close contact with the general public throughout the ENTIRE "pandemic". I know more people with unexpected side effects to the vaccines than I do people who have suffered the disease that has brought down and decimated my parents business and my early 20's. </p>
<p>I don't recognize my friends anymore. 
I've become a social pariah because I refuse to get the jab. I've had reactions to vaccines before, I'm nervous, I don't trust it and, I know I'd regret it if I got it.</p>
<p>I continue to tell myself I can miss out on eating inside or concerts or even future job opportunities but it hurts knowing everything you loved to do before March 2020 you are now specifically being excluded from. 
I'll miss out on these parts of life to keep my bodily integrity, but how far is this actually going to go? 
I feel depressed and worried about my future here.</p>
<p>Please don't support businesses that have no issue employing minimum wage 18-24 year old workers to work indoors yet make them sit in thunderstorms with their plate of Sunday roast. Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>On the plus side, when all these restaurants and bars see spikes amongst the ‘vaccinated’ then they definitely cannot blame the uninjected.</p>
<p>And yes, this completely sucks.</p>

        <p>They'll blame it on the unvaccinated workers and prohibit them from working for the vaccinated. Outdoor dining is alright for the moment because we had a heatwave but sooner or later it'll be scan your QR code or get a McDonald's and eat under a tree.</p>

        <p>They’re likely going to blame it on the unvaccinated being “variant factories” as they like to call it. This will likely create even more hostility towards the unvaxxed. I hope you’re right, but if the vaccinated are going to be among the worst hit I doubt they wouldn’t bother to think of a way to spin it as the fault of the unvaccinated</p>

        <p>Hang in there kid. Think about it like this. You are 23 and female. You may wish to have a family one day once things have run their course, which they of course will. Everything in the world is based of rhythms, vibrations and cycles. Hermetics teaches us about the whole psyop in advance, it tells us that everything starts on the mental plane. This is where the covid scam started and from where it is controlled using media and government. This in turn creates polarity in the form of division and vibration in the fear and other emotional responses.</p>
<p>The thing is that rhythm is cyclic meaning the bad stuff will not last forever. The worst time will be the days and weeks just before the cycle peaks and all of that energy will swing the other way. A bit like when the stock market or bitcoin goes parabolic and then crashes. This will happen to covid. It is absolutely inevitable. It can be seen throughout our history, even though our history is just his story and therefore polluted. But the rise and fall of the communists in Russia, the third reich, Rome, Babylon, Atlantis etc. All part of the same rhythm. </p>
<p>Do what thou wilt. But remember that this will seem darkest before the change. Change will come and the people that come out the other end with bodily autonomy, real humans, unadulterated will be the ones that inherit the next chapter.</p>

        <p>Very comforting to read, thank you. I do wish to have a big family and provide the life I had up until 2020 someday. I study History and media, knowing history continues to repeat itself has been daunting but immensely comforting as I know it's just a horrible coincidence I'm living in one of those repeats.</p>
