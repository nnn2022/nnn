    <strong>Fire Fauci</strong>
    <p><p>If you haven’t seen Fauci’s congressional testimony and Sen Kennedy pushing him on it, check it out here: https://youtu.be/_Rt_dcAh8JI</p>
<p>It is shocking in every possible way. Beyond belief that a public official could be this ignorant, let alone the highest paid official in our government 💰🤓💵 </p>
<p>The Q/A went something like this:</p>
<p>Kennedy: You’ve testified that you didn’t give any money to the Wuhan lab to conduct gain of function research. How do you know China didn’t lie to you and use the money for gain of function anyway?</p>
<p>Fauci: The NIH had seen the results of the experiments conducted using U.S. government funds; the viruses studied could also be found in public databases. None of that was gain of function.</p>
<p>K: How do you know that they didn’t do the research and not put it on their website?</p>
<p>F: There’s <strong>no way of guaranteeing</strong> that. But in our experience with grantees, including Chinese grantees…they’re <strong>very competent, trustworthy</strong> scientists. I’m not talking about anything else in China I’m talking about the scientists. <strong>You would expect that they would abide by the conditions of the grant</strong> -- which they’ve done for the years that we’ve had interactions with them.</p>
<p><em>Yeahh sooo competent, soo trustworthy. That’s what China’s know for 🇨🇳🙄”</em></p>
<p>K: So you don’t think the Chinese would lie to you?</p>
<p>F: The scientists I’ve dealt with have been trustworthy. 👨‍🔬👍🏼😀</p>
<p>K: Do you think the scientists have told the truth about the origins of the Wuhan virus and not been influenced by the CCP?</p>
<p>F: I don't have enough insight into the Communist Party in China to know the interactions between them and the scientists. </p>
<p><em>Really? Maybe you should’ve done some research on that before you handed them bundles of cash!</em></p>
<p>K: Why are we giving them money? 💴❓ </p>
<p>F: The bats that have the viruses are in China. That’s where the bats are🦇....We’ve seen the results of the studies.  </p>
<p>K: Including any private studies?</p>
<p>F: Not sure what you’re getting at sir</p>
<p>K: You gave them money and you had no way of knowing whether they did gain of function research, except you trust them, is that right?</p>
<p>F: <strong>We generally always trust the grantee to do what they say</strong></p>
<p><em>Seems like a great policy! Don’t even research who we’re giving money to, just blindly trust them</em>🧑🏼‍🦯</p>
<p>K: Have you ever had a grantee lie?</p>
<p>F: I can’t guarantee that a grantee has never lied to us, <strong>you never know</strong> 🤷‍♂️ </p>
<p>I don’t need to hear any conspiracy theories on Fauci and whether he’s receiving money from this place or that, or profiting off the vaccine in some way. The reason Fauci should be fired is laid out clear as day in this damning testimony. Fauci gave the greenlight on funding a lab overseen by the world’s most corrupt and powerful government. He had absolutely no way of knowing whether they’d keep to their promise, and had more reason to suspect that they wouldn’t. It doesn’t matter if the Chinese scientists “seem trustworthy”. What matters is that the CCP has absolute jurisdiction over the scientists and can disappear them at any time. </p>
<p>Fauci eagerly funded the reckless scientific research of our largest global adversary. In doing so, he contributed to a pandemic that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and allowed China to speed ahead while our economy was crushed. Imagine not only still being employed after all that, but being made into a celebrity by your country. Man it makes me sick 😷</p></p>

        <p>Yeah but this dude’s a good puppet - the most effective I’ve ever seen. If you force him out that’ll at least send a message that if you happily find the research of our enemies, you will lose your job. It’s the absolute least we could do</p>
