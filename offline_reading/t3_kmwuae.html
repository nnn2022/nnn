<p>No. I work at a hospital, and I have for the entire "pandemic." It's real, but nowhere near what is being put forth by the media and "medical experts." </p>

<p>See 3. Politicians claim to follow the science, but one just needs to take a look at the recent "surge" in the midwest. Every stats shared nearly identical infection curves, peaking and declining roughly at the same time, despite the fact that each state did things differently. From South Dakota remaining fairly open and unrestricted, to Minnesota being straight up East Germany, locking down and encouraging people to tattle on one another.</p>

        <p>Have you seen the video of the ex fiser doctor talking about covid? He essentially has said its going to spread regardless, there's nothing you can do about it. The only reason rates are different per areas is because that region most likely has more or less resistance from past coronaviruses.</p>

<p>He's right and it seems to be (surprise) acting <em>seasonal,</em> and following the old "Hope-Simpson" chart pretty closely.</p>

        <p>Well, they're being complicit in blowing it out of proportion by not questioning state "experts" at all. I was a print journalist for nearly two decades before getting into healthcare and this is a dereliction of duty... that is easily explainable.</p>
<p>They want clicks. They want views. They don't care about the news.</p>
<p>If they were concerned about the actual truth, one of the things they would be pushing for is actual data. For example, in MN the department of health does not include date of death when reporting "covid" deaths. Just the date reported. This is a huge metric when determining disease burden. Instead, they report whatever number they like. If you are interested, MN actually had it's "peak deaths" on December 17th.</p>
<p>As for disease burden in MN right now... there is none. There are plenty of beds available and when comparing this time (weeks 49-51) last year, we're below normal when it comes to overall census. Heck, there are <em>less than 100 people inpatient currently in the MN metro area with Covid.</em> MDH has this data, and the press should be pushing for it since it's extremely easy to just show up at a hospital and see that there aren't dead in the hallways.</p>
<p>Instead, they keep telling the public they are to blame, going after small businesses (which have NOT been vectors for transmission - Just look at the complete lockdown in California, it accomplished nothing but poverty) and claiming "exponential growth," despite the fact that <em>their own data</em> shows, as of yesterday, a doubling time of <em>300 days.</em></p>
<p>We were scared here in March. By April most of us had moved on.</p>

        <p>I don't think you can nail down one singular cohesive stance. But the general sentiment here is that governments have made an unbalanced decision in balancing the severity of the virus with the consequences of their prevention measures. "The new normal" refers to how as a society we are now treating the virus as the end all be all source of suffering and changing everything about our lives to fight something that isn't even that's bad. </p>
<p>Also very few people here believe the virus is truly fake. That's just a gaslight  people love to throw around whenever someone questions the validity of covid restrictions.</p>

<li>Personal responsibility for safety</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>No (some conspiracy theories here but basically everyone believes SARS COV 2 is a virus that infects humans)</li>
<li>The virus isn’t that serious. The response isn’t warranted over something as common as a respiratory illness.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s the short answer. Personally I believe the response has been a choice of mandatory suffering for all, and I don’t believe we’ve “saved” many lives by doing so. This is a lose-lose answer that society has chosen.</p>

        <p>&rt;Their symptoms are very similar</p>
<p>Which is why flu symptoms are now “treated” with a COVID test. Negative? Oh well, we’ll mark you as presumed positive. Oh you think it was just the flu? Well a test for that would fall for sure by now, it has been too long.</p>
<p>This is why flu cases are “down” by 95%. Does that not sound fishy to you?</p>
<p>&rt;didn’t know it wasn’t the common cold</p>
<p>No surprise there. It’s so deadly, you have to be tested to know you even have it.</p>

        <p>You can’t tell the difference. That’s the point. This shit is an overblown flu.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s concerning because that inflates the case counts, which the despotic politicians use as their excuse to shit on the Constitution. </p>
<p>Never mind the fact that raw “cases” with no other context is irrelevant. Percentages by demographics, by symptoms, etc. would be the sane metric here. Kinda tangential to my point, I know, but it felt like a good segue.</p>

        <p>Jsyk viral tests are notoriously tricky. That’s why flu tests were so uncommon before covid. They were not reliable enough to trust so doctors gave a symptom based diagnosis instead.</p>

        <p>Sorry to keep popping up, but the 'hospital between life and death' is a bit of an exaggeration... while it's certainly virulent, it's not as deadly as they expected back in March, not by a long shot - at least, that's what I've seen and heard in my research, as well as from my nursing friends. I'd love to get more information on your viewpoints if you'd be willing to share.</p>

<p>If it makes some feel better to use a mask, then by all means, but I dont see that theyve helped any as the overwhelming majority (at least in my local area wear them yet somehow people are still getting sick.

        <p>Thanks for your politeness. It's good to see someone looking for actual discussion. I really hope that you consider some of the responses, and come to conclusions yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As everyone else has said... freedom. Letting people have their rights again. Being able to see a dying family member and hold their hand is a right. Choosing whether or not you're going to wear a mask is a right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, as another comment already said, people should have the right to decide for themselves whether they'll wear a mask or not. The main problem is that it's turned into a trap: you either wear a mask "because it isn't inconvenient at all, and you're saving lives!" or you're a terrible, selfish person. It is inconvenient, and there's a disturbing lack of evidence that suggests that masks mitigate disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus is real. I believe that the numbers are inflated, and deaths have more to do with co-morbities and age than the virus itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frankly, what gets my spidey senses tingling that something isn't right here is how long this has gone on. We didn't see this with H1N1 or Ebola. People aren't freaking out about much more deadly conditions, such as HIV (which kills about half a million people a year due to HIV-related complications). Consider this. It is the government's job to keep people calm in times of crisis, and demonstrate leadership and a sense of normalcy. We're seeing the exact opposite. There's nothing normal about being told every day about the supposed mountain of bodies generated by COVID-19, or the regulations that are trying to encourage you to wear a mask in your home and outside. Meanwhile, the same politicians behind all this are blatantly ignoring their own rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is starting to become a class issue, more than anything. The wealthy get wealthier, while middle-class and low-income folks lose their jobs, their businesses, their hope. You know who profits from all these small business dying? Spoiler: it isn't the grandma and grandpa everyone's so hell-bent on saving.</p>

        <p>Well, you're welcome, I just remembered people will respond more and tell you their views if you treat them nicely, hence the little discussion we have instead of me getting banned.</p>
<p>my response to your responses
1. you have a point, I would also like to hold my dying loved ones before they passed. And yes, choosing whether or not you will wear a mask is a right, however:
2. The fact there is small evidence of masks mitigating disease. People would be more willing to wear a mask if they were shown HOW it would help. Same way people would take meds when shown how it would help their health.
3. Numbers are inflated, well i still need to search up on that, but atleast you agree its real.The government and politicans should be following their own rules too. People look up to them, if they are seen not following their own rules, then the people won't either.</p>
<p>Yeah, people tend to be able to turn a disaster into a profit. Meanwhile my family is barely hanging in there.</p>

        <p>Regardless of where you stand with our current president, he said something very important during the debates: "the cure cannot be worse than the disease". I personally don't think that masks are the hill to die on. If that's all it takes to open everything back up, then so be it.</p>
<p>Issue is, it <em>isn't</em> all it takes. We also evidently need social distancing and lockdowns and plexiglass and outdoor dining in -15° weather. Rates of suicide and domestic abuse have skyrocketed. Ditto with depression and anxiety. Combine that with SDD and the general unhappiness that already existed around Christmas, and you have a recipe for trouble.  Ironically, this has made our society very, very sick in a figurative way. I know that as of late, I've had more and more trouble getting out of bed in the morning. And I've been lucky enough to keep my job throughout all this.</p>

<li>Being able to have rational discussions and voice alternate options/opinions without it turning into an us vs them. No deaths besides covid seem to matter anymore, and that needs to stop.</li>
<li>Not mask mandates, no. If someone wants to wear a mask, that's their personal choice, but absolutely not to the mandates and forcing. A HUGE issue with the messaging is just wear a mask, any old thing will do - but not make sure it's clean, not make sure you don't touch it anymore, no focus on keeping it sanitary - that more than anything highlights the core problems here. A dirty mask is a useless mask, and the vast majority of people have one or two masks they just huck in the car, in their pocket, what have you. Masks in sterile hospital environments are one thing, but mask use in the untrained masses is quite another, and any attempts to even mention that fact is shouted down.</li>
<li>No. I believe it is a real virus, but the hysteria is almost entirely a media creation.</li>
<li>As said above, I do believe it is a real virus. The new normal is wholly unneccessary because it is not working, and is causing untold amounts of collateral damage. The vast majority of spread is happening IN HOMES, where they're locking everyone up,  but again not something anyone is talking about! Strip clubs are still allowed to be open, but small businesses are not? How does THAT makes sense? The rules are arbitrary at absolute best, and it seems more geared towards class warfare than anything else. If you can afford a good lawyer you can stay open, but most everyone else is just screwed.Not to mention that with our new treatments and strategies, the mortality rate has decreased significantly since March. I'm living in the middle of southern california, where I never see a single person without a mask in stores, and everyone is militant about making sure everyone complies. And yet somehow they say we're not locking up hard enough. Even with that, California is off the charts with covid supposedly (not going into PCR cycles, that's a whole nother can of worms). So why keep locking down, when it's clearly nor working? They just extended the stay at home order indefinitely today, and frankly it's insane.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tl;dr: Lockdowns are not the only solution to this problem, and indeed may be doing more harm than good. But any attempts at discussion are met with derision, if not outright hatred. A middle ground needs to be reached.</p>

        <p>I think the new normal is necessary because the virus spreads faster in dense populations, so if people stayed home or social distanced, or wore masks, transmission would lessen and we'd have lesser cases to deal with.</p>

If you lift all the restrictions then people start herding too close to one another, the infection spreads.</p>

        <p>I also have a few questions for you - can you answer these questions for me?   </p>
<ol>
<li>Since you asked us, I'm curious - what do you stand for? What do you think *we* stand for? (Though certainly not a hivemind here, we're quite a diverse bunch)</li>
<li>What is your primary source of information? Do you usually seek confirmation from multiple information channels before taking something as truth? Is there one source you trust above all others?</li>
<li>Why is your take on why there are almost no flu cases reported this year, which is a near statistical impossibility?</li>

<li>Primary sources of information include official dept. of health websites and firsthand (or secondhand?) info from the doctors in my family</li>

        <p>Thank you for your civil response - it's refreshing to be able to have some normal discourse.  </p>
<p>I'd be very interested in hearing what your family has to say, I'm always looking for more information to better form an opinion. Are you in the US, or elsewhere?</p>
<p>I know you didn't say anything about the flu, I just brought it up as something that indicates a clear problem with our current testing/numbers, and was curious if you had an opinion on it.</p>
<p>Right now we are smack dab in the middle of flu season in the US - something that normally fills the hospitals up all on its own. (And have had nightingale hospitals/tents set up in years past, with ICU's well over 125% with bad flu seasons.) Considering people's livelihoods are actively being destroyed with the current lockdowns, covid is getting all the limelight and I find it rather odd that the flu has all but disappeared. I think it at least warrants a look to figure out where our regular old epidemics went, as well as perhaps look into the PCR cycles being perhaps too sensitive (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html</a>), and that the current surges are nothing more than false positives. The false positive rate has never been released as far as I know, nor is there an official gold standard of Covid test.</p>
<p>My point is, if people's lives need to be destroyed, it had best be for a good reason. Here in SoCal a bunch of people have been begging for the evidence behind the latest restrictions, scientific study, anything, but they've gotten nothing but derision. The fact that so many higher ups are withholding 'the science' that is dictating their actions (or outright lying to us for our own good supposedly, in the case of Fauci) … isn't that a little suspicious? Why wouldn't they be forthcoming with their reasoning? What could they possibly have to hide?</p>

        <p>&rt;What do you guys stand for?</p>
<p>Against all forms of fascism and slavery, that includes the one type were the enslaver is called "government".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe in mask-wearing?</p>
<p>If you paint a car, are a firefighter or operate on a cut open human - and related instances, it makes sense.</p>
<p>(Though that's still a conclusion not a "believe", or at most an educated assumption. Blindly believing in something is inherently unscientific and ignorant).</p>
<p>Forcing people to wear a cloth resembling a muzzle when going outside? Fuck off with that shit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe the virus is fake?</p>
<p>It's not a "belief" either, but a very obvious conclusion that this whole scamdemic is a pretense to set up something that appears to very closely resemble nazi-germany - scaled up worldwide. Absolutely horrific.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;What makes you think the virus and new normal is unnecessary/fake?</p>
<p>First how literal insanity is enforced with brutal amounts of severe violence - like everything the politician scum does, but this time even more obvious and extreme than before.</p>
<p>But also the countless and extremely obvious propaganda techniques, fallacies and logical errors that are deliberately used to manipulate people into compliance, some of them are:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>appeal to "authority",</li>
<li>appeal to popularity,</li>
<li>status quo bias ,</li>
<li>foot-in-the-door-technique,</li>
<li>bait and switch,</li>
<li>slice by slice,</li>
<li>gaslighting,</li>
<li>lying,</li>
<li>extreme hypocrisy,</li>
<li>framing,</li>
<li>scapegoating,</li>
<li>massive double-standards,</li>
<li>false analogies,</li>
<li>moving goalposts,</li>
<li>double binds,</li>
<li>minimization.</li>

        <p>Hi there, appreciate the genuine questions.</p>
<p>1/ freedom, proportionate response, truth, 
2/ no, there are numerous studies showing their ineffectiveness, nevermind the flip flopping of certain experts regarding them.
3/ no, I believe the virus is real, I'm pretty sure I had it (Ill for a week, horrendous fever, fatigued, I rested in bed for the week and recovered fine.) I do not think it is anyway near as deadly as it's hyped up to be.
4/ first and foremost, my gut instinct. When the media and politician's all started singing off the same song sheet so quickly, I knew something was up. I predicted back in spring that there would be another lockdown in autumn(flu season).</p>
<p>Second to that, the incredible levels of censorship within established media of any divergent voice (there are many).</p>
<p>Exaggeration/switching of deaths caused to inflate numbers. Positive covid test in last 30 days = good chance that's your cause of death even if it wasn't.</p>
<p>Rushed vaccine using new tech, no liability for manufacturers...</p>
<p>The blatant "boiling of a frog", ever changing and often contradictory measures taken, more often than not with NO scientific data to back it up. The behaviour is one that fits the style of control/abuse</p>
<p>The fear/hysteria I see in my fellow humans, when if they switched off the TV, and used there own senses and social circles to gather information, there would simply be no real world data to inform them a Pandemic was going on.</p>
<p>Ridiculous propoganda tag lines (stay safe, new normal etc..)</p>
<p>They told us, back in the very beginning about the new normal, they said that things would never go back to the way they were. This was widely said before the first lockdown.</p>
<p>The blatantly ineffective PCR testing, with billions be ing spent on it. The previous use of death rates then positive rates to justify Draconian measures.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, over a hundred thousand people have died in recent years, directly linked to austerity measures... All of a sudden, our government care about our health and well-being?!? And care not about creating levels of debt that are frankly ridiculous.... No, something is up.</p>
<p>The WHO changing the definition of herd immunity in recent weeks...</p>
<p>There is more.... But that is the main jist of it.</p>
<p>My response would of been to offer support for vulnerable groups who chose to isolate themselves to reduce risk to them. And for everyone to live life.</p>
<p>The cure is immeasurable worse than the disease. The response so disproportionate... And it seems, this virus is being used as the vehicle to usher in an authoritarian, medicalised, police state. </p>
<p>I fear this is the most dangerous power grab in human history. We stand to loose everything.</p>

<li>Questioning the idea that the virus rises to the level that makes it worth doing all of the measures that have been done.  Lockdowns and even masks have social costs to them and there is great inequality who is affected by them (work from home class v. everyone who actually has to work in person).</li>
<li>I am fine with people wearing whatever they want, I just don't think the government should be in the business of mandating any type of accessory whether its a mask or ankle bracelet (assuming the person is not serving out a sentence).  I think there are a lot of questions that have been raised regarding "asymptomatic spread.  It seems unlikely that just walking around and breathing has anywhere close to the spread that coughing and sneezing achieves.  Sick people should stay home.</li>
<li>Do you believe the virus is fake" is a ridiculous question with all due respect.  The virus is obviously real and a big reason it is dangerous is because it's so contagious. The danger that it poses to the average person does not warrant the overblown reaction. </li>
<li>It's true that many people are dying but from the data indicates that it's heavily skewed towards populations who had high morbidity risk already such as obese and the elderly.  Quarantine has always been a concept that separates the sick from the healthy population and allow everyone else to go on.  The notion that all of a sudden we reverse that concept and instead assume that we should treat EVERYONE as sick until presumed otherwise (test or vaccine) seems like a twisted black mirror episode to me and not a world that is pleasant enough to be worth living in because of the types of things we have already been seeing. </li>
</ol>
<p>I would compare all of what has happened to be similar to the 13 year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States">prohibition of alcohol</a> in the US back in 1920.  In both cases, a large enough portion of the population convinced the government to restrict the rights of others due to legitimate public health concerns (alcoholism was even worse back then).  Even if when done with the best intentions, there are ethical concerns over allowing government to have that type of control over our freedom towards what we put in and on our bodies and also who, when and where we meet.  The freedom to peaceably assemble does not seem ambiguous in this context.   </p>
<p>I understand that the average redditor is unlikely to read anything at length that they disagree with so I will finish with a meme in case they might hit the link:</p>
