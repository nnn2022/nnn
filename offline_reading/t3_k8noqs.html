    <strong>An Unbiased Look at Covid Mortality</strong>
    <p><p>When looking at the mortality data it is important to understand the context in which this data is collected. In the case of the United States specifically, we know that anyone that is Covid positive when they die is counted as a Covid death. 
Source: https://youtu.be/GGHp1GdOD4k</p>
<p>This means that hypothetically if Covid has no impact on mortality there is a certain number of people that will still be recorded as a Covid death. I am not saying that this is necessarily bad practice, but it is fundamentally important to keep in context when trying to understand the numbers.</p>
<p>Now let’s do some math...</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/">Statistica</a> and there population data in 2019 we can see that there are 44.16 million Americans in the 30-39 age demographic.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">this</a> CDC resource I am able to find the number of covid cases as well as the total of deaths in the 30-39 demographic. These numbers are:
1,763,347 cases &amp; 2,584 deaths</p>
<p>since 1,763,357 cases/44,160,000 population = 3.99%, this means that if covid has no impact on mortality we should still expect to see 3.99% of deaths within the 30-39 age group to involve covid. </p>
<p>We know that the actual number of deaths involving covid in this age range is 2,584 so we can compare this to the expected number of deaths to form some conclusion. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I am unable to find a total number of deaths in the US for the age 30-39 demographic, but using <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex">this</a> resource I can make an estimate by averaging the 25-34 demographic with the 35-44 demographic. The number of total deaths based on this estimate is 70,407.</p>
<p>So, knowing that 3.99% of this demographic is positive, we should expect to see 0.0399 * 70,407 deaths in this age group, assuming Covid has no impact on mortality.
0.0399*70,407 = 2,811 expected deaths. </p>
<p>So let’s comparing our expected deaths (assuming Covid has no impact on mortality) of 2,811 to our actual number of 2,584. We can conclude that Covid is not increasing mortality within this demographic.</p>
<p>Limitations:
1) I did have to make an estimate of total deaths in the 30-39 age range, but without better data I did the best I could. </p>
<p>2) I recognize that it is possible some of the covid cases within this age range were likely closed at the time of death, this would mean that my estimate for expected deaths from covid is a bit high. However, much of this can be explained by the fact that we ARE seeing a higher number of expected deaths (2,811) than actual deaths (2,584). Again, since the government will not release better data, I am doing the best I can.</p></p>
