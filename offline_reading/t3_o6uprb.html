    <strong>New Joe Rogan Podcast with Bret Weinstein &amp; Dr. Pierre Kory</strong>
    <p><p>Recommend it to everyone on this sub. Details just how incredibly effective Ivermectin has been worldwide in not only treating Covid, but also in preventing covid as well. </p>
<p>Talks of this drug have largely been under wraps as there’s a patent &amp; there are also generic versions of this medication so there’s no real profit incentive.</p>
<p>Major takeaways from this podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>YouTube took down Dr Pierre Kory’s official senate hearing after approaching close to 9 M views. First time he publicly states that alternative treatments like Ivermectin are highly effective at treating and preventing covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While talks of Ivermectin are highly censored and flagged on YouTube, any talks of Rendezevir and vaccines are totally fine. Coincidentally both of these accepted topics also generate billions of dollars in profit. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Findings of Ivermectin worldwide are astonishingly positive and are being under discussed in mainstream news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They claim that covid can be wiped off the face of this world if we start using Ivermectin as a prophylactic en masse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know these sound like grandiose claims, but I really recommend listening to this episode. I’m trying to encapsulate hours of conversation into one post but their meta analysis on several studies and real life examples of mass distribution of Ivermectin world wide (including covid variants) are very significant.</p></p>

        <p>Very level headed discussion, almost too level headed but good to see a mainstream discussion about it all without 5g, microchip blah blah noise around it. </p>
<p>No one can deny the blatant censorship.</p>

        <p>Agreed with the part about why logic was thrown out window nonstop.  </p>
<p>The goal is to vaccine everyone under this “emergency “ order and you can’t issue an emergency vaccine if there’s something else out there that works.  </p>
<p>Along with basically idea that 100% cannot allow Trump a chance to win election / pump pharma companies.</p>

<p>Anyone who trashes Ivermectin or other possible treatments has to be explicitly told this.  There is an obvious conflict of interest (profit motive) to push drugs and vaccines that are still under patent over generics.</p>
<p>I've been told here that "Ivermectin doesn't work" and told that the studies that show this had issues with design.  I more than willing to cede the point that Ivermectin doesn't work, but proper studies should be done to repurpose existing therapies even if there is no money to be made.  </p>
<p>&rt; They claim that covid can be wiped off the face of this world if we start using Ivermectin as a prophylactic en masse.</p>
<p>I've said this here before:  Many poor and remote areas (think Africa, India) already have access to Ivermectin.  It's going to take awhile for even proper well tested vaccines to make it to these places.  Even if Ivermectin isn't as effective as Bret and Dr. Kory think, it could at least slow things down.</p>
