    <strong>Any Ideas On How I Can Move to the USA?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from Canada and I'm getting sick of this authoritarianism that is destroying my country. </p>
<p>Most provinces are slowly reopening now but they did this same shit last summer and then closed everything again so I think it's probably the same shit.</p>
<p>There's many other countries that have minimal restrictions and are much easier to move to but I wanna move to the USA as it is much more developed and I don't need to learn a new language.</p>
<p>But is there any real way I can? I'm pretty young so I don't have a degree or anything. I do plan on getting one but I don't think I'll be able to get a job in the states with that as it's not niche enough. I don't have anyone that could sponsor me either.</p>
<p>Ik people are gonna make jokes saying I should illegally cross the border since Biden doesn't care when Mexicans do it but I wanna see if there's any other way I can do it legit. So if anyone has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Canada was an easy kill. They just rolled over. There are bigger plans afoot to subjugate America, like race-based civil war, cyber attacks by "China", open borders for the Cartels, some kind of project Bluebeam reveal, etc. Just something to keep in mind.</p>

        <p>True but at this point I'm just sick of the lockdown and all the other restrictions. I definitely have some backup countries too just in case.</p>

        <p>Nicaragua is main one I'm looking at but I'm worried about potential riots there since there's an election this year. There's also Mexico, Bolivia, Belarus, Russia and Zambia that I'm considering if Nicaragua doesn't work out.</p>

        <p>Mexico is probably my next choice as most states there haven't been that strict (A few have tho). And once I get a passport there I can move all around the country so if one state government sucks I can just move to a different state. I'm definitely considering Bolivia too tho.</p>

        <p>Consider some of the Commonwealth countries. Belize, for example. English is one of their official languages (the most common, I believe), and it is considered to be fairly stable and "safe" place, relatively speaking, as long as you avoid areas that are heavily populated by gangs and the like. As a tourist destination, it is fairly well-developed, but at the same time, not even close to being any sort of big-time world player. All in all, a nice little "backwater" that frequently gets overlooked, for better or for worse.</p>

        <p>They were and are fairly strict with lockdowns and stuff so kinda defeats the purpose imo. Also Belize is very sketchy especially in Belize City. Nicaragua is the only place in Central America I'd move to. The rest have all been pretty strict.</p>

        <p>Just giving one example. There are numerous Commonwealth nations. Moving between them is generally easier than moving to non-Commonwealth states.  </p>
<p>Thing is, moving <em>anywhere</em> at the current time is going to be extra difficult regardless, being that most countries are restricting such things anyway. The border between Canada and the US is still closed. I've been looking into moving since before the pandemic. It's not a quick and easy process at the best of times. It's a shit situation everywhere, and while the idea of getting the fuck outta Dodge seems enticing on paper, the more I look into it, the more it seems like a waste of time and money.  </p>
<p>The absolutely fastest track is always going to be if you have money. If you are able to invest enough into the economy of your target destination, you can basically get fast tracked to an extent. But you will need, at minimum, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and likely more. And even with that, there's still no guarantees it'll all work out.  </p>
<p>A more economical and effective path would be to remain in Canada, but move to a more remote location. Generally speaking, that means heading further north. Stay off the government's radar as much as possible. The result will be more or less the same as if you outright moved to a whole new country.  </p>
<p>There's really no way to fully "escape" the tyranny of government overreach. It doesn't matter which country you're in. It's there no matter where you go.</p>

        <p>North doesn't automatically mean just the territories. There's a Northern Ontario, Northern Quebec, Northern Manitoba, Northern Saskatchewan, Northern Alberta, Northern BC. Every one of these provinces have northern reaches that are extremely sparsely populated compared to the south. Wouldn't even need to go all that far north to find small communities with very little in the way of law enforcement presence. But there are pros and cons to doing this, obviously.</p>
<p>And it still takes time to move interprovincially - though considerably less than moving internationally. At least, it does if you do it right. By the time you're ready to go, things should be more opened up (though for how long is a question mark - we'll see). And even if they are "closed", you can still travel for work and other specific reasons. Presumably, you should have some sort of job lined up before moving. Simply moving without a job or a plan is, well, idiotic to say the least.</p>
<p>It kind of seems to me like your ideas are unrealistic. Reading through some of the other comments in this post, you appear to be taking ludicrous suggestions more seriously than things that are grounded in reality. For example, talking about moving to Las Vegas and grifting a Vegas whore/escort into marrying you. That is absurd. This isn't a movie.</p>
<p>I have traveled to numerous countries in Central/South America, Europe and Asia for work over the years. I actually lived in China, of all places, for over a year. I have experience with this process, and I am telling you that it is not quick and easy at the best of times, let alone in the current situation. South and Central America, Commonwealth or not, is certainly a viable option, but it's not going to be the cakewalk that you seem to believe it will be. You will absolutely be giving up a lot of things that you take for granted, especially if you don't have a significant amount of financial resources straight out of the gate.</p>
<p>In all honesty, without a degree, your prospects are minimal. If you don't have a (useful) degree, that eliminates a lot of destinations pretty much outright. If you don't have a degree, the best option is simply to be independently wealthy, which from the sounds of it, you are not.</p>
<p>Even though it seems to me that you're not that interested in accepting real advice, I'll give you one more. Try to get in with an international shipping company. Live on the ocean, travel from place to place. You'll still be a Canadian citizen, but you won't be in Canada, at least not all the time. It's hard work, of course, but if you want to "get away", that's definitely a solid way to go about it.</p>

        <p>It seems like a lot of your ideas are simply you not knowing anything. Northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan have been insanely strict with COVID. With bordline fascist policies in Northern Manitoba for MONTHS. Either way the unemployment rate up there is so high that moving up there and finding a job would probably be harder than moving to a lot of these other places. Plus a lot of these places are quite dangerous.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's easy to move to Nicaragua. But there is realistic options for me to get residency if I save up enough. </p>
<p>So tbh you don't know what you're talking about. If anything the northern parts of provinces are EVEN WORSE than the southern parts.</p>

        <p>Ontario just announced digital IDs for late-2021 which will include uses as checking in for medical appointments; getting marriage, birth, and death certificates; opening bank accounts; applying for government benefits such as EI or CERB; and of course vaccine records.</p>
<p>I'd say that's pretty close to a vaccine passport without calling it a vaccine passport...</p>

        <p>As someone who moved here from Switzerland 15 years ago it was difficult. I didn't have any degrees because I was young then. I met a good woman and we got married but even then it was a huge pain in the ass and the process was still huge. The hardcore right wingers tell you it's easy the legal way but it really wasn't. Me and my wife thought about giving up and her just coming to Switzerland with me because the process was absolutely terrible and mentally it was really stressful. </p>
<p>Maybe as a Canadian it will be easier. Try looking up student visa. It requires you to be enrolled in school so that should give you a few years here and try to get established. </p>
<p>People who say crossing the border illegally is easier are not completely wrong.</p>

        <p>The Universities in the USA are a lot more expensive than the ones in Canada plus I don't think that gives you a direct path to citizenship either.</p>
<p>I've thought about trying to meet a women there and getting married but I don't think that's possible for me either. I haven't dated anyone in 4 years. I'm awkward and not that attractive. So it's an option worth thinking about but I think the chances of someone there liking me are basically 0 since no woman has liked me in general in a really long time.</p>

        <p>That's true it's not a path to citizenship but it gives you chance to meet people. </p>
<p>As for the woman thing I can't help you. But in american culture people are way more open to meeting new people than they are from the country I came from. Where I'm from people are snobs and don't care about meeting new people. I don't know if that can be said for Canada though.</p>

        <p>In Canada people are very polite but more snobby and less talkative than Americans. The main problem with university in the States is how expensive it is compared to Canada so I think it would be better to just go to the USA on a tourist visa and try to meet someone that way.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Start with vacations here if that's possible. You never know you might meet that special someone. But be aware even that is not guaranteed. Don't try getting into a fake marriage because the immigration will be on you like flies on shit and they will hound you. </p>
<p>When I came here my dad had business here for a few years that allowed me to go to school here. After we went back to Switzerland I connected with this girl I used to go to school with on facebook and I came here a bunch of times for 3 months at a time because that's all tourist visas allow. I did get an extension for 6 months at one point and that wasn't an issue at all.</p>

        <p>This isn't necessarily "good" advice.. this is "you want to get out of your country and this will get you here" advice. </p>
<p>(What i did as a lifetime resident) Apply for a state college here that has on site housing. Navigate Fafsa and get student loans. Use those to supplement your income while you look for a job. The downside is This Will Put You In Debt. The upside to that is you won't have to repay that until you either A. Stop going to college or B. Graduate. Then you have a grace period of 6 months. So don't do it unless you're committed. </p>
<p>Or come here, and Just apply for jobs here. Everyone is hard up for workers because nobody is wiling to work for peanuts anymore. Without any real experience you're looking at retail and fast food, or sales. Watch out for mlm scam jobs. Do not use websites like Craigslist for job hunting, do the legwork. Face to face applicants stick in the memory better. </p>
<p>Part time can work you up to 30 hours with no benefits. They can also make you work more than that by splitting the hours up into different pay periods. 
So you could essentially work 3 weeks in a row with no day off, if its in 2 pay periods. For the first 90 days you can be fired for anything, at any time. 
This is how most fast food, large corporation and big business establishments go. </p>
<p>Wwoof (not a typo) is another option if you want to or are willing to work on a farm. They will trade manual labor for food and housing. You cannot be a felon. I'd Google the organization for more information. </p>
<p>You can visit for up to 6 months. So come here and use that 6 months to get a leg up, and then apply for whatever visa you need to stay. </p>
<p>Or marry someone.</p>

        <p>This is good advice. I was in the same shoes at one point and looked up every option available. I ended up getting married with a girl a met many years ago in school when my dad had a business visa that allowed me to go to school here for the few years I was here. </p>
<p>When we got married and started the whole process it took a few years and it was the worst time of my life. My wife and me almost gave up and her just move to Switzerland with me because it would have been easier that way.</p>

        <p>Go on a vacation to Vegas.  The entire town is centered around gambling, drinking, and marriages..</p>
<p>They even have drive-through weddings.</p>
<p>So make an online profile trying to meet a nice American woman and be sure to tell her over the phone how you are investing in some vegas company or some rich guy sounding thing.</p>
<p>Get some fake ATM reciepts that have like 367k on them or something and talk about how your "American Account" is (whatever) to thereby imply that you have other accounts.  Stay married, get the info straight, and disapear from her.  Don't divorce her, just separate.</p>
<p>I know it sounds hard, but if you just act rich in vegas, but don't relate it to gambling, you can find loads of addicts to marry.</p>
<p>Maybe marry some rich old lady too, or a chinese millionaire woman.</p>

        <p>Definitely an interesting idea. Ik a little about Vegas but I didn't know about this.</p>
<p>&rt;So make an online profile</p>
<p>Any websites spasificly or does it matter?</p>
<p>&rt;Get some fake ATM reciepts</p>
<p>Where do I get these from? Dark web?</p>
<p>&rt;Don't divorce her, just separate.</p>
<p>Why not do I lose the green card if I divorce?</p>
<p>&rt;you can find loads of addicts to marry.</p>
<p>Addicts to what? Gambling? Drugs?</p>
<p>How do I hide the fact that I'm not that rich while I'm with the women?</p>
<p>Sorry if these are dumb questions but I'm very inexperienced with this stuff.</p>
<p>Also I'm really terrible with dating too as in haven't dated in 4 years, not very attractive, fairly awkward, ect. Do I still have a chance? Thanks for all the info. I'll definitely look into this.</p>
