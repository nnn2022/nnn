    <strong>Some people are fighting back in Alberta! Let's hope we win this court case!</strong>
    <p><p>Today there's a hearing in front of the Queen's bench to overturn the lockdowns and restrictions in Alberta. Let's hope the Justice Centre is persuasive and these judges are rational human beings!</p>

        <p>Proud Albertan here</p>
<p>We are violating the lockdowns and having family over for dinner this weekend.  At least my In Laws will come.  </p>
<p>To bad my own parents are to fearful of the Fines to say or do anything.  My Friends are to scared of the fines too,</p>
<p>My one friend works for Part Source(Owned by Canadian Tire) and was told that if discovered they breached COVID Mandates by visiting family this weekend is grounds for Termination.</p>
<p>Another who works for Edmonton Transit was told in no uncertain terms that if they were caught breaking the restrictions they would be fired.  This is for every single City of Edmonton Employee...they can lose their jobs for visiting family.  </p>
<p>A direct Violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms!!  </p>
<p>I am left wondering how much more will it take for people to stand up and say enough is enough?</p>

        <p>We are violating the restrictions as well. My parents and in-laws plus my youngest sister will all come over.. We have a whole plan of smuggling them in. </p>
<p>I've heard of a few people doing similar things. And it's just insane that we are now going be considered criminals for spending Christmas with our families. It is absolutely ass backwards. I hope these restrictions are overturned.</p>

        <p>The fine they'd receive would be under the Public Health Act. Last I checked, that's provincial legislation. </p>
<p>And it's frankly bizarre to imply you can't fire someone for breaking the law until a judge (who aren't the only people who can decide whether the law was broken, btw) finds that they do. You're suggesting that if I own a retail business and my employee is arrested for, say, shoplifting, I can't fire them until a conviction is rendered months or possible over a year later? That's untrue.</p>

        <p>You can fire them, they can then take you to court for unlawful dismission when they are proven not guilty. </p>
<p>But the thing you aren't understanding is these people won't have even been charged with anything. They will have been fired for literally no justifiable cause.</p>

        <p>Oh, of course. Iveson is going to stalk each of his employees on Christmas day and immediately fire anyone with more than one car parked in front of their house. Or they're gonna fire people for accidentally letting it slip during water-cooler chit-chat that grandma came over for dinner. Gimme a break, HR doesn't work like that in your wildest dreams. I'm not necessarily on board with the policy with my charitable interpretation of it, but in any event, I don't think it violates labour law.</p>

        <p>Yes, the restrictions violate the Charter, but I think a court would find that they are saved under section 1. Governments do not have to invoke section 33 to uphold a law that violates your Charter rights. Most laws probably violate your Charter rights in one way or another. Technically, prohibitions against child pornography violate your section 2 rights, since all expression short of violence is protected as free speech in Canada. The reason why those laws survive constitutional scrutiny, however, is because the Charter itself provides, however, that your rights are only protected subject to "reasonable limits... as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." </p>
<p>A law can violate the Charter but nevertheless remain operational if its intended benefits outweigh the deleterious effects. The test for whether a law is saved under section 1 was set out in <em>R v Oakes</em>, and its criteria aren't "very specific" at all. A court just has to be satisfied that (1) the impugned law addresses a "pressing and substantial issue" (very low threshold to meet), and (2) that the breach is not arbitrary, overbroad, or grossly disproportionate with respect to its intended purpose. In jurisprudence, very, very, very few laws have met the first step of the test and failed the second. The only ones I can think of off the top of my head from the one constitutional law class I took in my first year of law school are the criminalization of abortion (<em>Morgenthaler</em>), the criminalization of prostitution (<em>Bedford</em>), the criminalization of physician-assisted dying (<em>Carter</em>), and I think (but I'm not sure) constructive murder in <em>Vaillancourt</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to defend the restrictions, I'm just trying to substantiate my opinion that courts are unlikely to strike them down.</p>

        <p>There's a difference between a law violating the Charter and violating individual Charter rights. A law can limit or undermine your Charter rights, but still remain constitutionally valid if it is justifiable in the circumstances. That's what I tediously explained in the comment you're replying to. </p>
<p>Child pornography is a perfect example. See the case of <em>R v Sharpe</em>, <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1837/index.do">2001 SCC 2</a>. Here's the Supreme Court literally directly saying that CP is protected under the Charter (but the law prohibiting it is justified under section 1): </p>
<p>&rt;27 In summary, prohibiting the possession of child pornography restricts the rights protected by s. 2 (b) and the s. 7  liberty guarantee.  While the prurient nature of most of the materials defined as “child pornography” may attenuate its constitutional worth, it does not negate it, since the guarantee of free expression extends even to offensive speech. </p>
<p>Whether something is a "pressing and substantial issue" is an extraordinarily low bar, as I said. All the government would have to say is that they want to protect public health, and that will pass that branch of the doctrinal test. They don't have to provide any data or anything to satisfy that part of the test; the law doesn't have to actually accomplish its purpose to remain constitutional, it just has to be rationally connected to its driving objective, and impair Charter rights proportionately. </p>
<p>Lastly, the fact that the court has already rejected an interlocutory injunction on the restrictions makes it fairly likely that the lockdown won't be struck down as unconstitutional following a hearing on the merits.</p>

<p>Far to many people do not know their Rights and therefore allow others to walk all over them.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>My one friend works for Part  Source(Owned by Canadian Tire) and was told that if discovered they  breached COVID Mandates by visiting family this weekend is grounds for  Termination.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Another who works for  Edmonton Transit was told in no uncertain terms that if they were  caught breaking the restrictions they would be fired.  This is for every  single City of Edmonton Employee...they can lose their jobs for  visiting family.</em></p>
<p>Sounds like grounds for an unlawful termination lawsuit to me. What these people choose to do on their own time is none of their employer's business.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that there will be tons of fellow-employees looking to curry favour with the boss or steal a promotion into your job by reporting you and getting you fired.</p>
<p>That's how shit worked in Communist countries; that is what is coming here.</p>
