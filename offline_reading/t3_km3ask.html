        <p>He told the truth back then. And he changed it under political pressure. Or.......He informed the rulers that masks would spread things worse, and they liked that idea cause it would justify lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I don't think you really understand. Assuming they are effective (which has been proven countless times) they stop you from spreading because if you are sick in a shop and cough into the mask you don't get the virus all over food and surfaces that other eople will touch. If those people touch it and don't sanitize their hands before touching their eyes/nose/face/mouth they can get the virus. Regardless of their mask being on or not. </p>
<p>So yes the mask is there to protect others from you. Pretty straightforward really.</p>

        <p>Except that homemade cotton masks or even the “face coverings” you can buy have not been proven to stop respiratory illness. The studies are either set up using unrealistic conditions (25 CM distance), particles that are too large, an absurdly high viral load, etc. </p>
<p>I have been challenging folks on this one for months and have yet to see this “proof.”</p>
<p>Also interestingly the premise of transmission via surfaces has been related to “potentially possible” by the CDC/WHO. So the argument of coughing on surfaces people will touch is irrelevant. Additionally you mention symptomatic transmission as a reason to wear masks but we are making everyone wear them. </p>
<p>I would recommend you look at and analyze the primary data via two lenses. First, if masks have been proven countless times why are there so few articles that have shown their “effectiveness?” Second, is the “proof” set up in a remotely realistic conditions?</p>

        <p>You have no idea how much this made me smile! Notice how they say things like “may” “probably” “potentially” very definitive language. Which of the sources did you view as the most scientifically relevant? </p>
<p>From reviewing ALL of these papers at one point or another none of them prove widespread usage of home made masks is helping prevent the spread of Covid-19 or even respiratory illness. Even if you combine the relevant data from the various papers IMO masks are not doing
anything productive in combatting the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Here is the difference - you spent “5 mins on google” and I’ve been questioning and dissecting all the information available for months. Take my advice and apply critical thinking to these papers. After that, If you want to have a conversation/debate based on your analysis I’m here.</p>

        <p>I understand what is meant by the words they use. There's no definitive proof but there is evidence to suggest masks help. But if we are talking about the difference between wearing or not wearing a mask, they have definitely stated that the droplets and aerosol droplets are reduced by a mask. That's in there in plain English.</p>
<p>But your view is black and white, if the masks help reduce the chances of passing the disease by even 1% isn't that better than 0%? I know 1% wouldn't exactly be cost effective but neither is shutting down the world.
You just want so badly for the masks to be useless that you will deny any evidence that suggests otherwise or write it off as not effective enough.</p>
<p>The way I see it, me and my co-workers in the hospital I work at have been distancing and wearing masks. Cleaning work surfaces and keyboards and mice before using them and we are one of few departments that have not been forced to isolate as a result of catching covid. And we visit every other department and office in the building daily, incliding covid hot zones. We have all been fine. But many other departments have not. By following guidelines we have all been able to remain at work </p>
<p>What's so wrong with taking this seriously? Why deny?
I just don't get it. 
 We don't know fully the best way to beat it so lets just not try at all?</p>

        <p>Just so we are on the same page you have no primary evidence. The reason this is a black and white issue is because there are so many folks who just assume masks works despite an overwhelming lack of evidence despite both masks and respiratory illnesses being around for hundreds of years. </p>
<p>Your anecdotal information is your experience but in my large (&rt;100 person) group we did not do masks and I required my team to work in the office. We had zero cases. </p>
<p>Your arguments are emotional pleas that revolve around doing something has to be better than doing nothing. This simply isn’t the case. The panic caused thousands to lose their jobs, people abandoning nursing homes, hundreds to die due to improper ventilation usage, etc.</p>
<p>I can’t argue with your lack of data/facts. Ironically, you want so bad for this pandemic to be more seriously than it is so that all the pointless things we’ve been doing haven’t been for nothing.</p>

        <p>So does that apply to everyone who doesn't want to wear a mask? Do you trust people to be honest about illness?</p>
<p>One thing that is backwards is that if someone you know is sick and it's contagious. I'm talking a cold or some random bug that's going round, you would back up a little and ask/expect them to keep away so you don't catch it. And they tend to want to stay at home with a warm drink maybe a blanket and some TV or whatever you do to relax(essentially isolating). If you were sick and went to work they would send you home to protect the workforce and if it was a kid on school he would be off to avoid spreading it round.</p>
<p>This is all normal and expected behaviour for bugs that basically don't kill anyone but just make you feel a bit crap for a short period. But covid comes along and actually does kill and people want to carry on pretending it's not real and shun masks as infringement on freedoms or some rubbish. </p>
<p>It's crazy</p>

        <p>People ARE in fact getting this wrong. A family member at Christmas said something like “Fauci lied to the people at the beginning claiming that masks don’t work in order to stop people from buying them so hospitals could have enough...”</p>
<p>NO. That’s not what happened. Fauci stated what was the scientifically supported position at the time, then forced masks on the population based on political hysteria.</p>

        <p>Yup. He told the truth, based on long established science. Then the mask push started and he dutifully jumped on that bandwagon and rationalized his previous statement by claiming it was a lie for the greater good. </p>
<p>Masks are 100% political, intended to mollify the public with a false sense of security and distract them by giving them an easily identifiable "other" to project blame onto.</p>

        <p>It's amazing that the medical community literally just discovered in 2020 how awesome masks are. What the hell were they doing for the past 5000 years?</p>
<p>How many poor people could have been saved from TB just in the past decade? 10s of millions? Why are there no charities collecting masks and sending them to Africa like malaria nets?</p>

        <p>This is so true. BUT I'm also a little bit scared that now after we have been told how good and how necessary these masks are we won't be able to stop wearing them. Ever. Because of flu and Strep. pneumoniae etc...I mean how can they talk people out of this when it's now  clear we will all die if we dare to enter a grocery store or a bar without these stupid rags.
