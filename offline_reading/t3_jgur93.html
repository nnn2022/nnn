    <strong>Do you know anybody who turned 180 degrees?</strong>
    <p><p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Do you personally know anyone who was brainwashed but then turned 180 degrees after being red-pilled?</p>
<p>People I personally red-pilled successfully were never fully brainwashed - rather fence-sitters. The really hardcore ones that I tried to red-pill couldn't be turned. They were undecided for a bit, then went back to their brainwashed comfort zone as soon as they had a chance.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Edit. To be honest, I wish I never took that damn red pill myself. Ignorance is indeed bliss. Knowing what's really going on and still being forced to operate among "normal" people is a curse.</p></p>

        <p>One of my coworkers has done a 180. His wife works as a contract cardiac surgery nurse in California and they compare what’s going on in California and Colorado where we live. The fact that one state is in complete lockdown still and one state isn’t and the numbers are all over the place was enough to show both of them how arbitrary and stupid all of these rules are. </p>
<p>One other friend is slowly making her way out of the house but still isn’t going anywhere to sit and eat. She showed up to go view a house with me that I was curious to buy so that was a victory in my book.</p>

        <p>Northern CO actually isn’t that bad. I was just there and some people don’t wear masks even in very liberal Fort Collins. I went to a couple stores with young hippie type guys who weren’t wearing them. Can’t speak for Denver though, it’s probably full of doomers, and Boulder definitely is</p>

        <p>Yeah, NoCo and the towns east of Greeley are pretty chill. The one time I've driven through Denver since March, I immediately saw some lady jogging with a mask on, so I assume it's pretty bad.</p>

        <p>I wish I was out in Greeley right now. I’ve got family out there. I’m in Minnesota right now also, it’s a nightmare here. Luckily I’m in a pretty rural area, but it’s close enough to the cities that every COVID restriction follows suit here.</p>

        <p>No but some days I have those red pill blues... I think it would be easier and less stressful to not know the truth. Sometimes I think that people might know somethings up subconsciously but it’s just too painful to accept.</p>

        <p>Me! I was a full doomer, super scared and getting angry at those who wouldn't listen to guidelines, and really hating "conspiracy theorists" for how "selfish" they were.</p>
<p>Now I'm the "conspiracy theorist" haha. What woke me up was track and trace. The idea of giving the government all my movements and habits on a silver platter really rubbed me the wrong way, now I see how I was blinded before and it was all leading up to this.</p>
<p>They will all have their wake up moments, some will take longer than others.</p>

        <p>Nah.  there is no point in arguing with anyone no one ever chanegs their mind.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was in an argument with someone and he started going on a "Trump is stupid" tangent.  I asked why he thinks that and he brought up Trump serving fast food to the national college football team winners.</p>
<p>I was like "do you really think a bunch of college athletes want to go to a state dinner and eat goose liver and caviar?".  Long story short the dude wouldn't even admit that college kids eat fast food.  Actually claimed that college kids and especially athletes only eat healthy meals and Trump was a shithead for giving them buffets of Mcdonalds and Burger King and stuff.</p>
<p>It's insane how little ground they will give.</p>

        <p>I've seen it going both ways.</p>
<p>I know about a guy who used to be lockdown and restrictions skeptical, but became for it because of his girlfriend.</p>
<p>I also know about a case where someone used to be fine with lockdown for the first few months, but not supporting it anymore. That's me.</p>

        <p>I have friends who have loosened up on restrictions and have started going on weekend trips away and going out to eat and to breweries. Turns out it's easy to screech at everyone to stay home a month in but 7 months later it gets a little tiring.  Nobody has done a true 180 though.  The hysterical shrills I know are still hysterical shrills.</p>

        <p>Me. Took me a couple weeks. I called the police numerous times on Chinese people to have them deported and got hung up on. I called the police on homeless people people vaping people standing in line to buy useless shit etc etc. Then I looked into the numbers themselves. It didn't take me long to realize this was a massive overreaction and after the first couple times they doubled down on the restrictions I realize it was no mistake.</p>

        <p>If you're confining that question strictly to the virus, me.</p>
<p>When it first broke out in Italy and those images of people dropping were coming out of China. I was terrified for myself and family. Thought it had a 10% kill rate. I wore an N95 mask three weeks before the government told us to strap cloth to our face.</p>
<p>But I learned, and my opinion evolved with the data. We know it's a very low infection fatality rate. We know it barely effects young people. We know the response is killing the world's economy.</p>
<p>Now, I wear a "nonewnormal" or "lockdowns kill" t-shirt. This is complete bullshit and we need to get back to normal life right now.</p>
<p>So Yeah, complete 180 here.</p>

        <p>Me. In my defense, I literally got pregnant right before everything went to shit and the unknowns of rona on a baby plus severe anxiety had me sanitizing, wearing gloves and changing clothes when I came home from the store. </p>

        <p>I did in the first day of lockdowns. I made one stupid doomer Facebook post and most of my friends did too. Then one of my friends made a post that was like, "This is bullshit". And I thought, "Could it be bullshit?". Within minutes of really thinking it through and probably thanks to my anti authoritarian slant, I realized yes, it is indeed bullshit. </p>
<p>I don't know anyone irl who believes continued lockdowns are good at this point, only local representatives and some companies and public people I encounter. </p>
<p>I can always see many sides to an issue. I know the viewpoints that don't require twisted logic and hypocrisy and contradictory values are right. When the BLM protests happened, I was like, "Yay protest. Fuck the police." And I can say the same thing about lockdown protests. I can see my friends anytime and not feel like a slimy retard like the people who go out to a restaurants and then complain about the crowd there. I care about people dying and didn't contribute to an increase in that from cancer deaths and suicides and drug overdose and domestic violence by supporting any new normal.</p>
<p>I can also read a scientific study and use common sense to see that there's no way to stop a virus that's been spreading worldwide for a year. We can only mitigate damage where it occurs most. That's elderly care facilities. I speak out to whoever will listen (in small doses) and I think it helps ease any dommerism that I encounter.</p>
