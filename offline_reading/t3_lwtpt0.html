    <strong>Glad I graduated before all this dystopian nightmare</strong>
    <p><p>I don't really watch tv but one day I saw this broadcast of the government showing how schools are adapting to the "NeW nORmaL". Every single kid has to wear masks, social distancing, no hugs, no handshakes, no one is allowed to share their stuff and they have to speak quietly. 
I live in Brazil and I graduated high school in 2017 and I'm thinking how lucky I was because I don't think I would be able to adapt to that. I like hugging my friends and wrestling with some them and we used to share our stuff all the time and so on. 
Now kids are being taught that your friend next to you is a dangerous bio weapon that will kill your lovely grandma if they get too close to you. No handshakes! No hugs! 
I see some family friends having babies and I wonder what kind of orwellian world are they going to live in, when you're taught to fear every single person around you and that you're simply not allowed to criticize the government or the so called "experts". 
It's a scary thought that I wanted to share with you guys. I wonder what's gonna happen...</p></p>

        <p>dude I graduated 2020 just as it was ramping up (lost my grad and final half of final year) but at least I didnâ€™t have to deal with the mask mandates and rampant indoctrination going on at schools this year. Talk about dodging a bullet.</p>
