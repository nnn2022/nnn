    <strong>My honest advise when you meet someone IRL who has the opposite views</strong>
    <p><p>Whether you are antivax/provax, antimask/promask, or NNN/NN, if you happen to meet someone who has the opposite view as you and trying to convince you to comply, just take a deep breathe, smile and tell them you will consider about it, or "thankyou for your kindness" and walk away. Your day will be better and the person will felt like you left him hanging, it will also do less damage on the image for your group of people.</p>
<p>Even if they were shouting at you, just smile and walk away.</p>
<p>If they were being physical like spitting or infringing your personal space, or being totally physical, just make sure everything is being recorded and push yourself away into safer distance, and proceed with whatever measures you felt adequate during that moment. If nothing major happens always walk about with a genuine smile.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, if it’s to the point they’re mad or shouting there’s nothing you can say that will wake them up out of their herded sheep mentality, better just not to waste any more of your time and move on</p>

        <p>just move on irregardless if they are talking nice or shouting. you are already convinced about your beliefs, same way as they are convinced with theirs, best is to leave each other alone as nothing positive can come out of it.</p>

<p>Then again, I'm told people are afraid of me and years of weight lifting kinda helps with that, I'm sure.</p>

        <p>"Thank you for your concern" and a smile, should be enough for most encounters.</p>
<p>If its a family member or close friend, you can extend it even further. "I know you love me and only care about me. I'll consider it." And just leave it at that. If its brought up again and again, just keep thanking them and consider it forever.</p>

        <p>The problem is that what you permit, you promote. And unchecked, this will get worse. Many people have been manipulated into thinking that others with a different opinion are legitimate <em>dangers</em>. I think some actually believe this. They see people who disagree as threats, and it’s only a matter of time that these people will become more emboldened. They already want to exclude people from society, which is step one. Their hate will fester, and their preferred propaganda will throw kerosene on that fire. We are on a very dark path.</p>

        <p>Lol I’m not looking for a fight or to do anything extreme. I just want to be left alone. But if we let people scream at us and dehumanize us without opposition, then creeping normality will set in. They’ll think it’s totally righteous to accost people, and indeed is a part of their moral duty. That then leads to much bigger concerns down the road. These people are hopped up on fear and propaganda - this is a dangerous mix that we have seen far too many times in history.</p>

        <p>I will. But what is this shit your saying in other comments about “packing” and referring to guns? </p>
<p>I’m getting some real “false flag” vibes from this post, almost like you want people to disagree and talk about getting violent. </p>
<p>We have to be very vigilant in this area, because this tactic has been used to get other subs banned, and they would love nothing more than to point to a thread like this and say we’re advocating violence, which we’re not. We just want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>You have to be careful when people dont let you smile and walk away and starts closing in and become physical.</p>
<p>If you are carrying you should be prepared for the worst case scenarios. There are extremists and opportunists out there as always, if someone starts being physical, you wont be able to smile your way out of the situation unless someone intervenes.</p>
<p>Just look at the blm movement and anti asian movement, people dont just be verbal but physical.</p>
