    <strong>Does Anyone Else Feel Like They're Going Insane?</strong>
    <p><p>I had a very low tolerance for stupidity before this whole mess started so you can imagine how I feel living in this fucking clown world right now. My brain honestly feels like it's going to explode. I look at the stats and figures and I can't wrap my head around HOW or WHY people are getting so hysterical over all this. The numbers are so fucking low when put into perspective, yet people are content to fucking mask up and lockdown for their rest of their pathetic, miserable lives, all to stop a virus with a fucking 99.7% survival rate?! It's fucking ludicrous and retarded!</p>
<p>I want to post on Facebook about it, to share that study about asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people not spreading the virus, but what would be the point? I know I'd get death threats and people screaming at me in the comments for daring to speak out instead of just wallowing in my own filth watching Netflix and opening endless Amazon parcels whilst wearing a face-diaper. I would just be subjecting myself to a virtual kick in the nuts and be seen as a fucking pariah. </p>
<p>I want to see my friends and family again. I want to be able to step outside without feeling like I'm being judged just for existing. I want to be seen as a human being, rather than a walking, pestilent disease-pod. But this shit is never going to end, we're just going to keep going into further lockdowns and face-masks will become normalized (possibly made mandatory) and the complacent, virtue-signaling, doomer cunts that have allowed it to happen will turn around and blame us for it.</p>
<p>I feel like screaming in the smug, masked faces of the finger-wagging cunts that continue to perpetuate this fucking apocalyptic narrative. I am past the point of caring. I DON'T CARE. To tell you the fucking truth, I never did. And neither do they. Do not let them tell you different. These are the same hypocritical cunts that support crowds of people lining up shoulder to shoulder at "peaceful" BLM protests, only to turn around and tear apart people who met up with their families on Christmas. Fuck 'em and their nans.</p></p>

        <p>Yes and yes. I went to an outdoor mall to spend some christmas money. There was caution tape and police everywhere, all the fitting rooms were closed, and huge lines to get into stores where only 5-6 ppl could be allowed in at a time. </p>
<p>The idiocy of seeing everyone standing outside in the cold for 30-45m to enter a nearly empty store was too much for me. Prevent virus by making people stand in large groups outside in the cold. Yeah. OK. </p>
<p>I tried enjoying myself. Then I see people eating outside, some on the ground cuz they close the indoor foodcourt seating. I was getting so angry at the stupidity of it all I started getting a migraine trying to contain myself. </p>
<p>I am disgusted that it seems like nobody loves their freedom. It is a grotesque scene seeing people lined up outside like it is a breadline and emergency tape everywhere like a FEMA camp, just to go into a store with hardly any people in it. </p>
<p>It was the image of the new american gulag system. Be happy with your new nikes while we take away all your freedoms. Shutdown small business while we make you wait outside for no reason to shop at a big box store.</p>

        <p>The fact that people go through this shit, look around and see nothing wrong with it is what really fucking concerns me. I went to the shops yesterday and people were fucking walking down empty sidewalks with their cuckmuzzles on. It's fucking lunacy.</p>

        <p>I see people in cars with masks on. The whole thing just defies all logic. </p>
<p>The elites believe we are all dumb sheeple who will go along with anything. Thats why theyre taking away everything doing all this tyrannical crap. And by the way I see people act, I almost agree with them. They know its all a farce and the people who dont resist are the biggest joke to them. </p>
<p>I'm really thinking about organizing an activist group who will do revolutionary things such as; eat indoors at a small business with no masks and play sports at the park with a large group of people. 🙄🙄</p>

        <p>I went to the park the other day and a high portion of the people there were wearing masks, despite being well spaced out from each other. Including joggers and bicyclists. Yet I'm looked at as a lunatic. For wanting to breathe in fresh air and feel the wind on my face. Outside.</p>

        <p>Over the summer I saw plenty of people out on the Chesapeake bay wearing masks while alone. On a boat. Out in the bay. I'm out of sympathy for the vast majority of people here in Maryland.  As far as I'm concerned most of them are part of the problem.</p>

        <p>Went to a park in Texas yesterday and the majority of the people there were wearing masks while walking outside. It was not a crowded park and you were never near other people for more than a second or two as you passed. So many small children wearing masks while riding their bikes. Seeing this really makes me sad and I find it takes the joy out of going to places like this. </p>
<p>I also found that a lot of the maskless people were so friendly and acted like you were a human being while the masked families acted like other people are nothing but disease vectors. I can understand the desire of most to wear masks in crowded indoor locations but wearing it outside in nature outside of a crowd I do not understand at all.</p>
<p>I also saw someone in a convertible wearing a mask yesterday.</p>

        <p>Can confirm. I visited San Francisco about a month or two ago. I could count on two hands the number of people without masks and I was there for 3 days. Everyone looks at you like you’re a fucking leper when you don’t wear a mask. Went hiking nearby, same fucking thing, every single person wearing masks. It’s beyond delusional at this point..</p>

<p>No you fucking do not.  NO ONE forgets they have one of those on.  You can't fucking breathe normal.  It is in your peripheral vision, they cause glasses to fog, mine will ride up until it's  in my eyes, just. No. Fuck that. You don't gahdamn forget you have it on.</p>

        <p>A relative claims she forgets she has it on, that she's 100% comfortable in it, and that she could sleep in it if necessary. She says she'd be fine wearing it 24/7 and acts like I'm lying or being a baby when I say I find it uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>It's not that people need to be happy, they just need to believe they are happier than the people surrounding them.<br>
People living in the ghetto don't think of themselves as poor. They think they are middle class, because they are on average same level as those on their block. Even if they are on multiple low income assistance programs.</p>

        <p>I went to a mall last week (indoor with ridiculous restrictions).
The food court was open, but the seating area was fenced off. HOWEVER, everyone was standing (not even 2 ft apart lol) around eating around the whole circumference of the seating area, sitting and eating in the massage chairs, basically being more crowded than they would have been had they been seated at tables.  </p>
<p>The whole situation is ridiculous. </p>
<p>I had a seat in in the lounge outside of the nursing area. Lol it was pretty comfortable.</p>

        <p>Yeah, a few showed up after people started following our lead, but by that time we were full and had moved on. But what can they do? "Uh you can't eat that here" to 300 people? </p>
<p>If they said that to me I'd plop my ass on the floor where I stood. There were no signs anywhere stating why the seating area was closed, or that eating indoors is prohibited. Nothing.</p>

        <p>It's true. The blatant hypocrisy of society these days....it's astounding. </p>
<p>I can 100% sympathize with you there. I have 2 school aged children. I hate that their whole childhoods are marred by this mess. Nothing will ever be "normal" again for them. The school systems are as corrupt as every area of government, sometimes moreso because of the conditioning techniques and brainwashing used on our children. </p>
<p>I'll never forget the day that my oldest son came home from grade school and announced that "president obama was the greatest ever, and he voted for him in their school election". </p>
<p>I asked, why is he so great? "Because my teacher told us he was the best". </p>
<p>We sat him down and had a talk. He agreed that it's better to make decisions for yourself based on facts than it is to just do what others are doing. </p>
<p>The thing is though, most parents are unaware of the things they are telling their children. Education is no longer what it was. You aren't taught what you need to know, just what they want you to know. By the time kids get to college, they are properly indoctrinated into libral/socialist culture.  It's disgusting.</p>

        <p>This is the one reason I don't feel too terrible the schools were closed. Although I feel bad about the kids missing socializing. These schools are very toxic though and I worry for the future. No teacher should ever be telling kids that a certain president or political leaning is "the best." </p>
<p>It's good I didn't have kids. I think I'd have gone raging mad over the world. I'm already so angry as a single person who really has nothing to lose. I can't even imagine.</p>

        <p>The closed fitting rooms enrage me. I haven't been able to buy a pair of pants other than sweatpants or leggings all year. And I need pants. I can't eyeball fits. I need to try stuff on. I've been really upset about this and feeling like shit because I don't have any decent clothing anymore.</p>

        <p>I feel like I could have written this post.  You have captured my mood completely.  </p>
<p>Just yesterday I had a long Facebook battle over an asymptomatic carrier article I posted.  </p>
<p>Since I've been home in my hometown for the past week I can confidently say I feel like I'm going insane.</p>
<p>I had this very conversation with someone yesterday.  Everyone is very nice about it too.  They're like, "well, maybe you need therapy.  We'll get you the help you need."</p>
<p>Help I need!?  I don't need any freaking "help".  I need you guys you get your heads out of your freaking asses.  </p>
<p>This holiday has really opened my eyes.  No matter what we say, it just bounces off like Teflon.  They keep changing the goalposts, changing the story.  </p>
<p>It's like they are unable or unwilling to see the truth.  </p>
<p>I'm so happy for this subreddit, which has at the very least made me feel not alone.</p>
<p>The experience you described in your rant happened almost 100% verbatim to me yesterday as well.</p>
<p>We're not alone.</p>

        <p>You lose everything you've built over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The industry in which you are an expert, is now completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Everything you've learned up until now, how to deal with clients, how to speak in a social setting, how to deal with people - all rendered completely useless.</p>
<p>You're told to sit down, and watch Netflix for an indeterminate amount of time.</p>

        <p>Never forget which side of the political spectrum was 100% pro-lockdown in the coming years. Reddit, twitter and the left will push very hard to shift the blame to their political opponents while pretending to be innocent victims or naive people that were “just trying to save grandma”. They’ll attempt to label anyone calling them out as “hateful” or “callous and uncaring.”</p>

        <p>It was a light hearted aside. My main point was, consider making art for yourself &amp; see what follows.</p>
<p>If your whole narrative is based around other people &amp; whether they would consume your art, you don't get to value it on <em>your</em> terms. Seeing yourself as your primary consumer &amp; then just seeing what happened, that could be some really beneficial growth from all this nonsense.</p>

        <p>That's literally what gaslighting is.  I know that the rabid left has commandeered the word and re-defined it to mean "saying things I don't agree with"- but the <em>actual</em> definition is essentially, manipulating somebody into questioning their own thoughts and memories, causing them to think that they are going crazy.  You are being gaslit by the fake news media, tyrannical government, and the masses of easily-brainwashed simpletons who lapped up all the fear porn without questioning it.</p>

        <p>Honestly: Yes. I am tired of the masks, I am tired of the lockdowns, I am tired of reading articles online about people literally starving to death because the businesses they worked for are shut down and the feds did not tell the states "No lockdowns unless you replace the income of your citizens put out of work!"... I could keep on going here.</p>
<p>It also doesn't help that I am 100% sure that numerous people were put on ventilators when they did not need them and doctors knew they made CoVid-19 worse and not better out of the fear the doctors had towards this glorified cold for most people.</p>

        <p>Fucking right on. Your last point has reminded me of another thing that pisses me off: all the articles right now saying the hospitals are overcrowded and understaffed. First off, hospitals are always overcrowded this time of year. Secondly, maybe they wouldn't be right now if every person with a positive test didn't swarm to the hospitals in a fucking frenzied panic. And last but not least, they're understaffed because every doctor and nurse that gets a positive test has to fucking isolate for two weeks.</p>

        <p>you're missing perhaps the most important part: that they're perfectly happy to have too few people working the shift, because they'll just demand that fewer workers do greater percentages of the work. They have no reason to care about the quality of their care, because COVID is their excuse every time the work suffers. They know nobody can do shit about it, because the job market is held at gunpoint and desperate replacement workers are lined up around the block.</p>

        <p>they literally aren't even trying. It's way more beneficial for them to just push fewer workers to do more, and let the quality of the work suffer. Nobody is holding them accountable for the quality of the work because COVID excuses everything. Simultaneously it doesn't matter at all if they stress workers out and make them quit, because it's so easy to hire another extremely desperate one. It's become extremely advantageous for workplaces to do this. There is no downside. So of course they're going to do it. Hospitals do it. Other places also do it.</p>
<p>I work in a nursing home. I've been saying this whole time, I'm not a freakin' hero, I don't deserve some special recognition for being exposed to COVID (which I have, plenty), in fact I deserve no credit for this at all. But holy shit do me and my coworkers all deserve a raise for dealing with these protocols and these radical working conditions. Meanwhile I would happily take even reduced pay if it just meant we could be done with this crap</p>

        <p>I share pretty much all of your frustrations and would say I agree 100% with the post with one important caveat: <em>it is THEY that are insane, not YOU</em></p>
<p>I can honestly say I'm heartbroken to see how quickly and easily the masses have rolled over, and allowed their freedoms and livelihoods to be taken on the pretext of a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate!</p>
<p>What's that quote again?
&rt;"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety"</p>
<p>I see people driving alone in their car with a mask on and wonder, what kind of insanity could drive someone to this?</p>
<p>Right back in March, April before I abandoned FB I posted a lot on there about this and tbh, I didn't get attacked (much, lol) but I'm the kind of person it's water off a ducks back if I do...it might have helped that many of my friends are 'truthers' but many are not and my posts were public...I didn't state anything that wasn't factual and able to be backed up and I know I changed some minds so maybe consider giving it a go...just state things calmly, don't be aggressive and you might be surprised by the reaction honestly - there are more people think the way you do than you might first think</p>
<p>I agree 100% it's clown world now...I almost feel like I went to sleep on Earth in January 2020 and was abducted and dropped into an alien version, I just don't recognise what people have turned into  🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>I feel opposite. It's driving me crazy, yes but I feel everyone around me is going insane. I look around at grocery stores and my heart breaks. I see people wearing their muzzles and thinking nothing of it. People walk all the way to their car still wearing it. Even people wearing them while driving....by themselves!</p>
<p>And idk if it's me but I thought the survival rate was 99.997%. I've been teasing the guys at work (they feel the same way as I do) that we trust lysol with 99.99% but a virus that's the same we run for the hills?  And a "vaccine" thats anywhere from 70-95% effective is the new gold rush?? Wtf.</p>

        <p>Couldn’t have said it better myself. Great post. 10 months later and I still keep hoping that I’m going to wake up and it was all just a bad dream. Cause that’s literally what this is, a bad dream. </p>
<p>How so many people can just sit around and accept these completely lunatic, illogical, arbitrary and fucking downright stupid restrictions, mandates, and rules just defies all logic and common sense. I always knew fear was a powerful drug over the sheeple but this year has awakened me even more then I could’ve imagined. </p>
<p>But I do encourage you to speak out on social media. I kept quiet for the first several months but I’ve gotten to the point where I truly don’t give a single fuck anymore, and I’ve been blasting my feed with everything anti lockdown. I know that I’ve lost friends and work connections (I work freelance, and rely on my network of work connections) but this is far to important not to be speaking up about. I don’t want to associate with people like that anymore anyway.</p>

        <p>What you can do is just live your life. I go wherever I want. I don't put masks on my kids. I make sure to post wherever I see my family and normal friends. I never even talk about the virus. I never post pictures of us wearing masks. I don't even acknowledge what's going on. So, that is a very easy way to go about it without being confrontational on social media.</p>

        <p>I posted something similar on Facebook back in the summer and had friends turn on me. I think I had 10 people immediately unfriend me..lol. I ended up deleting my post. </p>
<p>My family would have turned on me but they still want access to my daughter so they have to play nice. Luckily, my husband is on the same page as me. </p>
<p>I have a friend who lives in Arizona and regularly speaks out on social media. But she has a large group of friends who all agree with her (lucky). </p>

        <p>Yes absolutely. I just want to yell at people WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?? But it wouldn't do any good. They have some sort of blinders on and flatly refuse to see the truth of this. Sometimes it makes me feel like maybe I'm the crazy one, afterall how can so many people be wrong, but then I see something giving us even more evidence against the narrative and I just can't buy into it. I don't understand how any one does. I'm just so tired of it all.</p>

I let them call me a “sociopath” or whatever other ad hominems they throw at me instead of a good argument to back up their lunacy. People like you and me and everyone else on this sub...sorry to say this, but we’re just better than them. They aren’t worth performing for.  Say what you want. Do what you want. The only true power they have over you is their shitty opinion of you. You’re right: fuck ‘em.</p>

        <p>What you're feeling is pretty common, to people who have sense and aren't looking to "opt out" of the life we are supposed to be living.  As we've seen, with some of the visitors that have passed through Reddit, is that some people WANT more lockdowns and love the isolated life.  Many of them considered themselves inconvenienced to even have to be among the rest of us back before this crap.  They truly hate others, and hate themselves, even though they may not ever admit that.  They are miserable people, and they revel in the fact that many of us have been made miserable.</p>
<p>I keep telling myself that all of this will pass soon, but there is very clearly a large portion of assholes, at least here on reddit, that never want it to end.  They want to continue living in a fucked up dystopia.  It's like all their wildest movie and video game dreams come true.  Even worse, social media became a place many people hide out in the past decade, and now, it's all many people have, since they don't go to a job place or a classroom.  They just stay cocooned. It's miserable for anyone that has a sliver of an extroverted personality.</p>
<p>I cut out social media, besides Reddit, back around June, when the rage spilled into the streets.  Have not missed it.  I'm not changing my life to some avatar based pseudo reality.  But, some of these boneheads coming over to spy on us on this forum are exactly that, and it's what they want.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’ve been losing it since March, as I was against shutting everything down from the start. I had a feeling the reactions were more overblown than the illness, meanwhile I was jumped on immediately for not panicking and saying people shouldn’t be afraid to gather in person. All my friends and most of my family were into the hysteria from the start and still are. And now, nine months in, no one is at all interested in changing their minds or seeing the harm this has caused. I know someone STILL only doing porch visits and Facetime with friends and family and is praised endlessly because her husband is a nurse and she’s doing this now so everyone is “safe” and can “be together later.” </p>
<p>And the “tired nurses and doctors” trope. Everyone acts like that until March 2020, hospitals were paradises where no one died or was seriously ill. They were always fully staffed and nurses and doctors sat around with their feet up all day while taking care of easy breezy patients with no complications. Oh that didn’t happen? I’m sorry but you signed up to care for the sick and dying and to treat everyone who needs you, regardless of their political beliefs or criminal history. If you don’t like it, well, McDonald’s is hiring somewhere I’m sure. It’s one thing to acknowledge that they have a hard job, but another to worship the ground they walk on and demand having their feet kissed because they went to work. </p>
<p>Nothing is ever enough for these people unless you change your whole life forever. They even want masks and restrictions to continue once the vaccine is available so they feel “safe.” </p>
<p>It’s so strange how not wanting to wear a mask when you’re not sick and still wanting to take the “dangers” of eating out or seeing your family makes you the insane one. But the people on makeup and reality TV subs who stalk influencers or reality stars and make lists of people who were “irresponsible” because they traveled or met someone else in person? They are the normal ones. How is that not backwards?</p>

        <p>I feel like I could have written this.</p>
<p>To make it worse, I go camping about every other weekend for three or even four days with my horses... and when I return to polite society, I'm not reintegrating well now.</p>
<p>I'm more and more saying what's on my mind, and if that means telling some they're a fucking idiot, so be it.... er.  Even at the office.</p>
<p>I can't stand the news.  And where the hell was that, last night on CBS, that shows a mass fucking grave with pine boxes and people in hazmat suits!?  TF was that shit?  Where was it? There was no context, just a bunch of shit strung together as the reporter is hammering home the fear.</p>
<p>I could literally stay in the woods, with my horses, and be happy - if my husband, kids, grantoddler, parents... could/would, go with me and stay.</p>

        <p>Nothing's stopping you, you know. I bought my plague doctor mask and robe back in January. It's the only mask I ever wear. Cane, elbow-length gloves, the bit. It's going to take a lot of us in this kit, <em>V for Vendetta</em>-style, standing outside City and Town halls, maybe with a guillotine or two, to get out of this madness.</p>

        <p>I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. I see people wearing masks in their cars by themselves, walking down an empty street. Someone I know posted about how funny it was that she was wearing her mask in the house for a few hours before she realized it. It's sad. I pity these people. They will not be ok after this is over, they will always be scared. I just am so exhausted.</p>

        <p>I feel as though I’m at the end of how much I can live like this for. I’m not suicidal per say, I just wouldn’t be mad about it if I got hit by a car etc. It’s really getting to me now, every piece of news is worse than the last. I had the mother of all panic attacks yday after hearing about a new ‘tier 5’ in the UK where you can’t go outside not even to exercise. We’re living in a post apocalyptic world. I find myself engulfed with anger at people who watch BBC news and lap it all up, family included.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen more doctors than I ever have before standing up and saying enough is enough! Why do pro-lockdown folk always say ‘I TRUST THE SCIENCE/DOCTORS’ and then straight up ignore all the scientists and doctors that are speaking against the narrative? Why do people want to live in fear and virtual non existence? I’d offer words of encouragement regarding mental state but I’m just as worried for my own brain at the moment❤️</p>

        <p>I completely understand this. It is totally infuriating seeing how many people have fallen for one of the greatest rouses of all time. People are impossible to talk to about it, too. Most of my “friends” can acknowledge the inconsistencies in the narrative but cannot see beyond that. They can see the plot holes but still have faith that daddy government is doing what is right for us - because the government has <em>always</em> done what is right for us. If there were this many plot holes in a movie or TV show people would quit watching it. But, since this is real life, people are apparently eating this shit up. I hear you, it fills me with seething rage to see how many people cannot see through it. I have lost total faith in our humanity. I feel like we will be stuck in this endless hell forever.</p>

        <p>I am currently visiting family in Northern New Jersey. The amount of people driving around in theirs cars while wearing masks is insane. Same with folks just walking/jogging outside. And many are walking by themselves. So much has been learned about Covid-19  regarding symptoms, transmission, treatment, risk factors yet these people are still stuck March. If I pulled up to my parents house a year ago wearing a surgical mask because I was afraid of a virus with a 99.8% survival rate they'd trying to get me to psychiatric help. Now I'm the crazy one. People have lost their minds. </p>
<p>So no - You are not insane. You're remaining rational in the midst of a mass hysteria being fueled by politics and state and corporate propaganda. You are not the enemy.</p>

        <p>It's the year 2050. You're on a lunch break at work. You leave your germ-free isolation work pod and go down to the cafeteria, passing through numerous disinfection "zones" that mist you with chemicals along the way. You buy your food, and take it to your assigned eating pod, where you can safely remove your mask.

        <p>I am right there with you. I know I'm sane, but what scares me is how insane everyone else is.  </p>
<p>What's happened is mass psychosis through brainwashing, and it's absolutely fucking terrifying.  </p>
<p>I live in MA and the governor here just reduced capacity at restaurants to 25% and wants people to wear their masks while sitting at tables when not actively eating or drinking, which means he wants you to wear a mask between bites and sips.  </p>
<p>These mandates are based on ZERO fucking science and the states own data shows that "spread" at restaurants is responsible for 0.4% while household and nursing homes make up over 60%.  </p>
<p>I bring these inconsistencies up and people act like it's no big deal and everything is cool. </p>
<p>Meanwhile my kids have gone from full remote to hybrid, and back to full remote.  Why?  Because our town is "yellow" which means literally nothing, and is based on some bullshit metric that is again, based on ZERO fucking science.  </p>
<p>My wife has to teach remotely from home (even though she has advocated for opening schools fully without masks and distancing) and keeps getting more kids added to her class because the parents in the district she teaches in are a bunch of uninformed sheep.  </p>
<p>We don't see some of our friends now because they are afraid of the "second wave" that isn't happening, and because daddy governor said gatherings can't be more than 10 people or whatever arbitrary number it's at now.  </p>
<p>The thing that bothers me the most is that people seem completely fine with all of this.  They think that magically one day daddy governor is going to give the all clear and everything to going to snap back to normal.  When I talk about our rights and how they are being eroded they scoff and act like it's not happening.  </p>
<p>If ignorance truly is bliss, then I don't want to be happy.  I'd rather be informed so I can see them coming.</p>

        <p>The basis behind the color coding is to try to regulate things based on the number of cases and/or hospitalizations. It isn’t complete bullshit. What is problematic is how every state and community gets its own choice in how to regulate...it leaves things too far up in the air and up to people who have no experience in disease management to make these calls. There does need to be a better system in place, for sure. However, you can’t deny that there are hospitals that have or are becoming overwhelmed with the number of COVID patients, and even if you believe the mortality rate isn’t that high or that big of a deal, full ICUs means other issues (trauma, heart attacks, etc) won’t be able to be properly tended to. In other words, the transmissibility of the disease and the sheer number of individuals who need hospital treatment due to symptoms such as an inability to maintain a healthy oxygen saturation level is a problem regardless.</p>

<p>The color code and number of hospitalizations has absolutely nothing to do with my kids going to school.  They don’t tell you who is testing positive, how old, what condition they are in or anything.  It’s just Cases! Cases! Cases! That are completely out of context.  </p>
<p>Some hospitals are stressed, but not all, and it’s nothing abnormal for this time of year.  The vast majority of hospitals around the country have very low percentage of Covid patients.  Full ICU’s are not an issue because they are designed to be full and run near or at capacity regularly.  </p>
<p>Not a single hospital in my entire state is overwhelmed or at capacity, and only 15% of ICU is for Covid.  </p>
<p>The narrative being pushed by the media that hospitals are overwhelmed due to Covid simply isn’t true, and the data shows that.  The color code system is bullshit, and not based on any science whatsoever.</p>

        <p>They can’t tell you who is positive, their ages, or their condition because that’s a HIPAA violation. To an extent it has to be “cases” because you can’t give out patient identifiers (age is often one of them). You can look up stats independently from universities and agencies as well to try to glean context. But it IS hard because the numbers obviously can’t be accurate as not every positive case will be caught. </p>
<p>Yeah hospitals are designed to run and run even when crowded. The problem is that some are so full or nearly at capacity that they won’t be able to treat patients. It isn’t good to be operating close to max capacity because if something happens (think major accident in a snowstorm or something) there won’t be the resources to care for those people. </p>
<p>I know Utah had an issue with running out of room. Currently in my state I believe hospitalizations are down at the moment, but have been very high the last few months generally.</p>

        <p>I'm not asking personal information, but they can give the ages and existing conditions without violating HIPAA.  The state dashboards do it.  </p>
<p>They also don't tell us what the CT is on the PCR tests used so we don't even know who is actually sick or contagious.  Again, it's "cases" without any context and it's driving bad decisions.  </p>
<p>The reason it's only "cases" because hospitalizations and deaths are not rising like they predicted, and when you mass test everyone using a "test" that isn't really a test and is highly prone to false positives you get massive amounts of "cases" where people don't have covid, and are not and never were sick.  A positive test does not mean that person is sick.  </p>
<p><em>Some</em> hospitals are near capacity, but the majority of patients are not covid, and the vast majority are operating at normal capacity.  The ideal capacity for a hospital to operate at is 75-85%.  </p>
<p>National estimates show that inpatient beds (all patients) is at 66% which is below average.  17% of those are covid, and ICU capacity is running at 61%, which is also below average.  </p>
<p>Utah was over the 85% threshold for a short period of time but the hospitalizations are trending in the right direction, and the majority were not for covid.  </p>
<p>Again, this isn't abnormal.  Hospitals can be inundated and at capacity due to flu.  It happened in SoCal in 2018, and they even built auxiliary hospital tent.  </p>

        <p>The CT can’t tell you contagiousness. It can be used as a marker for disease severity and reveal things like infiltrates which are helpful for the attending and associated staff, but it won’t help the general public to know the CT results per patient. </p>
<p>Yes there can be false negatives or positives with the PCR test...but even a true positive doesn’t inform us of the contagiousness as it isn’t known exactly when or for how long someone is contagious. The CDC FAQ page explains this; there’s an estimated window for incubation and viral shedding but not definitive knowledge. </p>
<p>In terms of hospitalizations, they actually are significant: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/12/28/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html. Reached a high in terms of COVID specific hospitalizations. The CDC also has data for COVID, influenza, and pneumonia cases. And it makes sense they’d include pneumonia as COVID is often accompanied by pneumonia and it can be confusing in reporting as someone’s ultimate cause of death might be pneumonia, but it’s pneumonia developed due to COVID-19. </p>
<p>Arguably the deaths are also significant...and what makes this so much of a big deal is the sheer transmissibility of it...it’s more contagious than many other conditions and it’s such a widespread thing and it can be hard to predict outcomes...there are cases where people become very ill and it makes sense due to pre-existing conditions such as an autoimmune disease, cancer, etc. but there are also cases in which it appeared unprecedented for a patient to become as ill as they did. Moreover, preliminary data suggests that recovery from COVID isn’t the end of the story. You can catch a cold and then move on (for the majority of people), but there is evidence of lasting lung damage after surviving COVID, so even if the mortality could be scoffed at (poor taste, but just for the sake of argument let’s say we do), there are chronic results we don’t yet understand.</p>

<p>The CT doesn't tell you anything.  That's not what it is.  It is helpful to the general public because it's it's over 25 then the person is not sick, contagious, currently infected, and the PCR process is most likely picking up dead nucleotides.  If they provided the CT and set a standard this entire thing would be over already.  </p>
<p>PCR is not a test.  It's a lab process used to study disease.  That's it.  The inventor of PCR, Kerry Mullis said since it's inception that it should never be used to diagnose, or test for viruses, and cannot detect current infection.  </p>
<p><em>In terms of hospitalizations, they actually are significant</em> </p>
<p>Again.  That's one hospital that's not as bad as CNN is telling us.</p>
<p>The majority of hospitalizations are not Covid, and many are PUI. Those can be flu, or a myriad of other illnesses.  Either way, it's not abnormal for a hospital to be full during cold and flu season.  Especially in such a densely populated area. </p>
<p><a href="http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf">http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf</a></p>
<p><em>"The CDC also has data for COVID, influenza, and pneumonia cases"</em></p>
<p>No.  They have mixed Flue, pneumonia, and covid together(PIC), and now Flu has disappeared, which makes zero sense.  </p>
<p><em>Arguably the deaths are also significant...and what makes this so much of a big deal is the sheer transmissibility of it...it’s more contagious than many other conditions and it’s such a widespread thing and it can be hard to predict outcomes...there are cases where people become very ill and it makes sense due to pre-existing conditions such as an autoimmune disease, cancer, etc. but there are also cases in which it appeared unprecedented for a patient to become as ill as they did.

<p>Arguably the deaths are not significant.  Literally everything you described can happen and does happen with cold, flu, and pneumonia and is not unprecedented at all.  </p>
<p>"Long Covid" is a term that is being used to scare people.  If you get pneumonia you can have lung scarring and it can take months to recover.  I know this because it happened to my mother, and another friend of mine.  Lasting effects from an illness are nothing new.  </p>
<p>The whole narrative that covid is causing all of these unprecedented and abnormal medical issues for people is unfounded.  The reason why it appears that way is because there is a magnifying glass pointed directly at covid, and that's all people are looking for/ at.  They are completely ignoring everything we know about respiratory illnesses, and that complications can and do happen with every illness and that there are outliers where a seemingly healthy young person can get hit hard.  </p>
<p>If things were put in perspective and with context this entire debacle wouldn't be what it is right now.  The media has whipped everyone up into a frenzy.</p>

CT normally refers to computerized tomography, and I'm thinking specifically of lung CT, which are of obvious clinical importance but there wouldn't be a value system as in over 25...unless you're referring to a person over the age of 25? Unsure to what you're referring. </p>
<p>"PCR is not a test. It's a lab process used to study disease. That's it. The inventor of PCR, Kerry Mullis said since it's inception that it should never be used to diagnose, or test for viruses, and cannot detect current infection."</p>
<p>Regarding PCR, it's not actually what the creator said. You can see the link for more details on how the statement was taken out of context. What he meant was that PCR testing does not directly identify the virus but identifies the genetic material involved in viral sequencing.
https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr/fact-check-inventor-of-method-used-to-test-for-covid-19-didnt-say-it-cant-be-used-in-virus-detection-idUSKBN24420X</p>
<p>The test informs us of the presence of viral material which, while it cannot inform whether the person is currently infectious, reveals whether one has most likely been exposed to the virus (barring false negatives and false positives, albeit the literature seems to be a bit more focused on the problem of false negatives. If false positives were of primary concern, it seems like it could easily be controlled by only testing individuals who are symptomatic as this article suggests: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30453-7/fulltext. </p>
<p>"The majority of hospitalizations are not Covid, and many are PUI. Those can be flu, or a myriad of other illnesses. Either way, it's not abnormal for a hospital to be full during cold and flu season. Especially in such a densely populated area."</p>
<p>https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/covid-2020-12-31. This is today, and it shows US hospitalizations for COVID at an all time high. Another issue with this is not whether the majority of beds are COVID or non-COVID, but that if there are not enough beds, then not everyone can get equal treatment or treatment at all. </p>
<p>"No. They have mixed Flue, pneumonia, and covid together(PIC), and now Flu has disappeared, which makes zero sense."</p>
<p>That is exactly what I meant, hence my use of "and". Also, the flu isn't gone. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm Shows that while the current estimates are below what is expected, that is not to say the flu doesn't exist this year. Moreover, there will be diagnostic and symptom confusion given the similarity in flu and COVID symptoms. </p>
<p>"Arguably the deaths are not significant. Literally everything you described can happen and does happen with cold, flu, and pneumonia and is not unprecedented at all."</p>
<p>Normally though you don't have global infection spreading much more easily and quickly than other pathogens. Yes, people die every day. But people don't typically die in masses due to a novel virus. </p>
<p>https://www.lung.org/getmedia/98f088b5-3fd7-4c43-a490-ba8f4747bd4d/pi-trend-report.pdf.pdf. The data here show in 2013 there were 56,832 deaths due to influenza/pneumonia in the US. We are at around 343,000 COVID deaths in the US right now. That is clearly not proportional. Plus, while there's no cure for influenza, there's a much better grasp on it medically along with vaccines (and yes they aren't 100% effective as can clearly be observed). </p>
<p>""Long Covid" is a term that is being used to scare people. If you get pneumonia you can have lung scarring and it can take months to recover. I know this because it happened to my mother, and another friend of mine. Lasting effects from an illness are nothing new."</p>
<p>It's definitely true that terms are thrown around in an attempt to spark outrage or fear in people. I've seen many article titles like "COVID is never going away", which seems to be a headline meant to instill fear that life will be forever as it is today. But the reality is that of course it will; people still catch the plague...but it isn't the Black Death reoccurring constantly. </p>
<p>Back to the point, though. I am not using the term long COVID. I am only suggesting that the long-term outcome for those who have survived COVID is unknown, and there might be adverse effects. In terms of pneumonia and lung scarring, that's my point! Pneumonia itself is a serious condition and can have very detrimental outcomes. COVID-19 associated pneumonia is also serious and perhaps even more so given the constellation of clinical signs that can accompany it. </p>
<p>Yeah in general the mainstream media isn't going to represent things in the most accurate way, especially when we're referring to a specialized field like medicine. However, I'm not sure where you're seeing people ignore knowledge on respiratory illnesses. Given the treatment protocols in hospitals, it certainly seems like patients are being treated using knowledge we have of respiratory illnesses. </p>
<p>In terms of abnormal medical issues, that's untrue that it's unfounded. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-uncovers-blood-vessel-damage-inflammation-covid-19-patients-brains-no-infection Just one example of the neural damage possibly occurring with individuals with COVID. Part of the issue is that one pathogen seems to be able to evoke a myriad of symptoms and it can be difficult to predict who is likely to have which symptoms. </p>
<p>Of course complications happen all the time and even younger and/or seemingly healthy individuals sometimes succumb to disease. The primary difference here is that it's occurring with a highly infectious agent on a global scale. There are plenty of medical scientists conducting research who have dedicated their lives to the study of viruses, disease generally, immunology, etc., who are identifying things about COVID that they find surprising and certainly not an overblown scenario.</p>

<p><em>"Yes, people die every day. But people don't typically die in masses due to a novel virus."</em></p>
<p>People are not dying in mass and this virus is no longer "novel".  Yet another term being used for excuse making and fear mongering.  </p>
<p>The deaths [er day being reported are just that, the day being reported.  What they don't tell you is the dat of death, the fact they are doing dearth certificate matching, and also the 8 week reporting lag.  The numbers today could reflect 2 months ago and everyday in between.  </p>
<p><em>"We are at around 343,000 COVID deaths in the US right now. That is clearly not proportional."</em></p>
<p>No we aren't.  There is no distinction from who died <em>with</em>, and who died <em>from</em> covid.  We do not know the CT used so there is no way to confirm if these people even had covid when they died.   </p>
<p>Plus,. there are countless cases of people dying from clear other causes but being listed as covid.  The death counts are MUCH lower than reported.  </p>

<p><em>"In terms of abnormal medical issues, that's untrue that it's unfounded."</em></p>
<p>The problem with articles like this are that they make connections without showing any cause and effect.  Just because they are now looking at everything under a microscope and find abnormalities does not mean it was caused by Covid.  Just likeMyocarditis.  It is a common symptom that can manifest after any infection, but because people were not mass testing and looking for abnormalities like they are with covid, it was never discovered.  Correlation does not equal causation. </p>
<p><em>"The primary difference here is that it's occurring with a highly infectious agent on a global scale. There are plenty of medical scientists conducting research who have dedicated their lives to the study of viruses, disease generally, immunology, etc., who are identifying things about COVID that they find surprising and certainly not an overblown scenario."</em></p>
<p>Except it's not, and the examples you are giving are outliers and statistical anomalies.  This is a respiratory virus, and we understand them veery well.  There is nothing special or unique going on here.</p>

        <p>If you aren’t referring to CT scans, then what are you referring to?</p>
<p>Unfortunately your PCR sources seem to be heavily biased journalism sources and not actual scientific sources on PCR testing or reputable evidence-based sources. I suggest looking at PubMed as a started to find primary sources on the content. I do that often and it’s great because a lot of it is even open access if you don’t have credentials to access many of the journals. </p>
<p>In terms of the hospitalization, I didn’t make a claim as to the proportion of COVID vs. NON COVID patients. Also, I made a claim that it’s significant, which only means it’s important, and if things continue we could see an exponential increase (as was seen already) and you have to think about resources both when the census is low and when it’s high. </p>
<p>In terms of the flu being gone, if you’re going to argue my point that it isn’t gone by saying that it’s gone in comparison to other years, I think at that point it’s just arguing about semantics and not the content. It doesn’t matter how we are using the word “gone”, what matters is that it does indeed still exist. </p>
<p>You didn’t add a source to the claim that people aren’t dying in mass? I don’t mean millions at once, to clarify the semantics. You can throw out the word novel if you’d like. I can say virus, or infection, whatever. Once again, the term novel was just meant to indicate the virus is newer than others. Sure it’s not as new as it was a year ago, but it’s new in comparison to malaria. That is all I intended to convey there.</p>
<p>For the death certificate matching, what do you mean by that? Also, source showing the lag time? I’m interested to see what they mean when they’re talking about matching certificates. </p>
<p>If COVID deaths are just being reported to instill fear regardless of actual cause of death, why? What benefit is there to that? Higher numbers are likely to lead to greater restrictions. This means businesses suffer and in turn the economy...for example, Florida got caught underreporting cases. https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4781. Also here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/04/florida-governor-rob-desantis-covid-investigation-misled-public</p>
<p>Those are examples that show that there are cases in which numbers are intentionally underreported. I fully believe the LA Times article in which 30,000 “cases” were counted accidentally. Of course everyone makes errors. And maybe someone intentionally made that error. But there’s evidence of hiding cases, which seems to serve self-interest. I don’t think any numbers of COVID cases or deaths are totally accurate. They can’t possibly be...they are estimates. Regardless, however, there are still people getting sick (so there’s definitely accuracy in said estimates) and the actual day-to-day reality of this has hit home for many and depleted those in the frontlines who have been exposed to more trauma than is usual.</p>

        <p>CT refers to the cycle threshold of the PCR process.  If it's over 25 then the results are essentially useless.  Even Fauci talks about this.  He says 35, but that is still far too high according others with a solid knowledge of PCR.</p>
<p>My sources are not biased.  They are referencing the inventor of PCR who isn’t around right now to tell the truth about it and how it’s being bastardized to keep this pandemic going, and has some choose words for people like Anthony Fauci.</p>

It doesn’t matter how we are using the word “gone”, what matters is that it does indeed still exist.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing semantics.  Compared to other years it's literally gone, which tells me they are classifying flu as covid, and due to PCR being completely unreliable and prone to false positives ,that can explain why.</p>
<p>You didn’t add a source to the claim that people aren’t dying in mass? I don’t mean millions at once, to clarify the semantics.</p>
<p>It's not semantics.  If you look at the data, when it was reported, and how it's being counted, you can clearly see that people are not dying in mass.  Covid is being attributed to MANY deaths that have nothing to do with it simply for the reason of having a positive test result within a certain period of time from an unreliable "test".  Hence dying with covid, as opposed to from.</p>
<p>For the death certificate matching, what do you mean by that? Also, source showing the lag time?</p>
<p>Death certificate matching (death certificate surveillance) is when someone dies they go back and look if the person had a positive covid test within a certain amount of days, if they did they classify it as a covid death.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1334515738405720064?s=20</p>
<p>CDC says lag is up to 8 weeks or more.</p>
<p>"this delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death"</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm</p>
<p>There is also backlog reporting and data laundering (reporting a weeks worth of data in a single day), which is happening all over the country.  ES and Jennifer Cabrera report on this regularly.</p>

<p>I don't know why they are doing it.  Keeping all of this going is clearly hurting far more people than covid itself, yet here we are.</p>
<p>That woman in Florida was fired for cyberstalking not underreporting data.  The woman has mental issues.</p>

<p>Do you have an example?</p>
<p>The day to day numbers are far below what they are being reported as.  I've shown the evidence supporting it.</p>

        <p>"My sources are not biased.  They are referencing the inventor of PCR who isn’t around right now to tell the truth about it and how it’s being bastardized to keep this pandemic going, and has some choose words for people like Anthony Fauci. "</p>
<p>The 2 sources you gave were not written by reputable journalists or researchers. If you've got other sources that are less biased then perhaps you'd have a point. The Reuters link I provided had the original quote and info on what the creator said. Did you read it? </p>
<p>Concerning PCR, did you read the articles? Article 2 says "  Therefore, the strategy depicted in this study presents a simple and efficient step in minimizing false-positive signal when employing viability PCR." That was in 2017 and was an explaining how to REDUCE false-positives. No one said the PCR test is 100% accurate. There are both false positives and negatives, albeit this is NOT the majority of tests. If the majority of tests were false results, PCR testing would have been discarded from medical practice. Refer to my prior sources to see that there's concern about false results, but overall there seems to be a leaning toward false negatives. </p>
<p>Article 3 supports my assertions, thanks for the source! " Although the use of sensitive PCR methods offers value from a diagnostic viewpoint, caution is required when applying such data to assess the duration of viral shedding and infection potential because PCR does not distinguish between infectious virus and non-infectious nucleic acid." PCR testing IS useful for diagnosing COVID, but not for knowing the length of time for viral shedding or infectiousness, which is exactly what I've said this whole time. </p>
<p>Article 4 is similar to one I shared earlier about false-positives, with a possible solution to repeat PCR testing in those who test positive despite being asymptomatic. That's an easy thing to do. And positive tests have been re-done when the person appears to show 0 symptoms. </p>
<p>Article 5 is interesting. " new research indicating that CT values could help doctors flag patients at high risk for serious disease. Recent findings also suggest the numbers could help officials determine who is infectious and should therefore be isolated and have their contacts tracked down. CT value is an imperfect measure, advocates concede. But whether to add it to test results “is one of the most pressing questions out there,” says Michael Mina, a physician and epidemiologist at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. " Note it was published at the end of September, so the concept of using the cycle threshold is something being examined. However, your assertions that we can use that and then this whole thing would be over isn't a logical conclusion. Instead, it seems like the thresholds could be used to help determine, as the article suggests, level of infectiousness and guide some clinical decision making/be used as a predictive marker for who is likely to become severely ill. So yeah, the thresholds might have a good use for reporting and understanding the infectiousness/severity of the virus, and help guide treatment. It won't, however, make this all be over as you suggested earlier. </p>
<p>I'm surprised you included article 6 as it's based on correlation. " observe a strong correlation between Ct value and sample infectivity in a cell culture model ". The authors are quick to acknowledge their results are correlational and therefore have to be interpreted with caution. Moreover, this article is about when patients can possibly be discharged safely from the hospital. </p>
<p>Article 7 is inconclusive and points to more research needed " these high Ct values are mostly correlated with low viral loads. From our cohort, we now need to try to understand and define the duration and frequency of live virus shedding ". </p>
<p>Article 8 is a systematic review looking over, once again, likely infectiousness based on the cycle thresholds. Yes, this can be useful as a tool in deciding how long to isolate and when patients can safely be discharged, but it doesn't disprove the seriousness of the pandemic at all. </p>
<p>" There is nothing significant going on in hospitals, and the data shows this. "</p>
<p>Which data? From what I'm seeing, it IS significant. I don't know the background you have in statistics, but what I know leads me to believe this is significant. If you've got a different analysis, let me know which data points in particular are non-significant and how they are non-significant in comparison to baseline. </p>
<p>" It's not semantics. If you look at the data, when it was reported, and how it's being counted, you can clearly see that people are not dying in mass. Covid is being attributed to MANY deaths that have nothing to do with it simply for the reason of having a positive test result within a certain period of time from an unreliable "test". Hence dying with covid, as opposed to from. "</p>
<p>It absolutely IS semantics when your use of the word "gone" is meant as an exaggeration when I use it literally. That's nothing more than semantics. As for the in mass part...around 56k/year for flu/pneumonia vs. 343k for COVID. That IS a big difference and I think using the term "mass" is acceptable. But speaking in raw numbers is fine, too. Your response to my evidence that supposedly contradicted this was majority non-scientific/reliable sources like FoxNews. Moreover, if you don't trust the counting and the numbers are actually much lower, why do you trust the what the data shows as being reflective that things are NOT actually so serious? You've contradicted yourself several times. The data are wrong when you disagree with what it shows, but they're correct when it shows what you believe to be correct? That is the most unscientific method of reviewing data, and it'll lead to faulty conclusions every single time. </p>
<p>" There is also backlog reporting and data laundering (reporting a weeks worth of data in a single day), which is happening all over the country. ES and Jennifer Cabrera report on this regularly. "</p>
<p>The ES post doesn't show where that graph came from. Of COURSE there will be backlog reporting. People won't be able to report everything in real-time, especially when autopsy results are needed. I don't see how that is a problem, necessarily. It's a problem if you think the daily reports are a representation of that day's 24hour period, but if it's understood that there can be delays in reporting, then we adjust for that. Also, a delay in reporting doesn't mean that the total number is wrong. In other words, even with delayed reporting, we still have a large number. </p>
<p>" I don't know why they are doing it. Keeping all of this going is clearly hurting far more people than covid itself, yet here we are.</p>
<p>That woman in Florida was fired for cyberstalking not underreporting data. The woman has mental issues."</p>
<p>I was not referring to, or focusing on, the person who got fired or the reasons for it. The purpose of sharing that was to include evidence that under-reporting cases has been going on. That IS the example of evidence I gave of under-reporting cases. I included more than 1 article about it. You can ignore the BMJ one if the firing event takes precedence in your mind. </p>
<p>" The day to day numbers are far below what they are being reported as. I've shown the evidence supporting it. "</p>
<p>You haven't actually shown it, though. The medical professionals would certainly disagree with the reasons you've presented. It seems like you just want to argue no matter what I say; perhaps I'm wrong and you've looked over the sources I provided, read them thoroughly, and still disagree. But it sort of seems like you're just angry and have decided you're right and you're only looking to support your current opinions. You had major problem with the neuro article I included because you said it was only correlational, yet back up your point with multiple correlational studies. That seems a bit contradictory, eh?  I was willing to consider I was wrong about PCR testing, which is why I did reading on it after your comment. I found that while it isn't a perfect test, it's definitely clinically useful. I hope you'll be able to look at the scientific evidence with a little less bias, albeit none of us can view anything without at least some bias, but at least with an open-mind. Stay safe.</p>

        <p><em>The 2 sources you gave were not written by reputable journalists or researchers. If you've got other sources that are less biased then perhaps you'd have a point. The Reuters link I provided had the original quote and info on what the creator said. Did you read it?</em></p>
<p>My sources are not biased at all.  I have interviews withKerry Mullis saying just that but Reddit won't let me post links to Bitchute.  What I'm saying accurate, and your Reuters article is arguing semantics, and not showing the entire context. </p>
<p><em>"Concerning PCR, did you read the articles?"</em></p>
<p>Of course I did. It's pretty clear you don't understand what you are quoting because you are cherry picking sentence fragments that you think support your point, but don't actually. You didn't even know what CT was but are going to argue PCR is useful for diagnosis?  Even though the inventor himself has said repeatedly that it isn't? I'm not even going to go through and rebut your incorrect explanations of the papers I cited because it's clear you have made your mind up and are going to interpret them any way you like.  </p>
<p><em>"Which data? From what I'm seeing, it IS significant."</em></p>
<p>State and national Data. It's NOT significant.  I've already posted my sources, and you post a CNN article.  </p>
<p><em>"It absolutely IS semantics when your use of the word "gone" is meant as an exaggeration when I use it literally."</em></p>
<p>It's not semantics AT ALL.  It's literally gone compared to other years.  Look on Flu View on  the CDC site.  </p>
<p><em>"As for the in mass part...around 56k/year for flu/pneumonia vs. 343k for COVID. That IS a big difference and I think using the term "mass" is acceptable."</em></p>
<p>It's not "mass".  I've shown this with multiple  sources.  The Covid numbers are greatly exaggerated.  </p>
<p><em>"Your response to my evidence that supposedly contradicted this was majority non-scientific/reliable sources like FoxNews."</em></p>
<p>You don't have an actual rebuttal so you cherry pick Fox in order to completely dismiss everything else I cited.  Did you watch the Collins County board meeting where they literally read the state criteria for classifications?  Care to comment on that?  LA Times?  The Hill?  </p>
<p><em>"Moreover, if you don't trust the counting and the numbers are actually much lower, why do you trust the what the data shows as being reflective that things are NOT actually so serious? You've contradicted yourself several times. The data are wrong when you disagree with what it shows, but they're correct when it shows what you believe to be correct? That is the most unscientific method of reviewing data, and it'll lead to faulty conclusions every single time."</em></p>
<p>I haven't contradicted myself once, and I've provided evidence for everything I've said, unlike yourself.  </p>
<p>It's clear the death numbers are not as high as they claim, and even state agencies are showing this, and hospitalizations are not extremely high according to the same state agencies.  The ones making these claims are not the states, but places like CNN and other MSM outlets.  </p>
<p><em>"The ES post doesn't show where that graph came from."</em></p>
<p>It comes from CDC data.  Read some more of his tweets.  </p>
<p><em>"People won't be able to report everything in real-time, especially when autopsy results are needed. I don't see how that is a problem, necessarily. It's a problem if you think the daily reports are a representation of that day's 24hour period, but if it's understood that there can be delays in reporting, then we adjust for that."</em></p>
<p>Exactly.  The numbers being reported daily are nowhere close to what they are saying.  There are not 3,000 people dying per day from this.  Again, this is more propaganda from MSM. </p>
<p><em>"Also, a delay in reporting doesn't mean that the total number is wrong. In other words, even with delayed reporting, we still have a large number."</em></p>
<p>Again, it's not as large of a number as I have already shown.  </p>
<p><em>"That IS the example of evidence I gave of under-reporting cases. I included more than 1 article about it. You can ignore the BMJ one if the firing event takes precedence in your mind."</em></p>
<p>I'm not ignoring the BMJ article, it's referencing the woman I'm talking about.  She isn't honest, and is clearly unstable, so if the information is coming from her it's not reliable.  The Guardian article is nothing but a smear piece so I will dismiss that. </p>
<p><em>"You haven't actually shown it, though."</em></p>
<p>I have actually showed it, and you even acknowledged it earlier.  Now you are contradicting yourself. </p>
<p><em>"The medical professionals would certainly disagree with the reasons you've presented"</em></p>
<p>Oh really?  "The" medical professionals?  Which ones are those exactly?  </p>
<p><em>"It seems like you just want to argue no matter what I say; perhaps I'm wrong and you've looked over the sources I provided, read them thoroughly, and still disagree."</em></p>
<p>You haven't provided and quality sources, and it's pretty clear you are not arguing in good faith because you completely dismissed 8 of mine, and misrepresented several others.  </p>
<p><em>"But it sort of seems like you're just angry and have decided you're right and you're only looking to support your current opinions."</em></p>
<p>I'm not angry, and it's not my opinion.  I've provided multiple lines of evidence to back up what I've said that you have yet to counter with any concrete evidence or a solid argument.  </p>
<p><em>"You had major problem with the neuro article I included because you said it was only correlational, yet back up your point with multiple correlational studies. That seems a bit contradictory, eh?"</em></p>
<p>Incorrect. The study you cited showed only correlation and no causation.  The articles I cited were not correlational.  They showed the functionality and complete unreliability of PCR.  You cherry picked a few sentences you thought supported your argument which did not.  </p>
<p><em>"I was willing to consider I was wrong about PCR testing, which is why I did reading on it after your comment. I found that while it isn't a perfect test, it's definitely clinically useful."</em></p>
<p>PCR is not a "test" in the traditional sense, and it's only purpose since inception is for use in a lab setting to study viruses, not to diagnose, and not to show current infection.  It's not fit for purpose and is being used for something it should not be.  The entire pandemic is being driven by PCR, and that's why we are in this mess.</p>

        <p>Typically when we say CT in relation to COVID we are talking about computerized tomography to rule out pulmonary embolism and assess lung status. This is why acronyms are a problem at times. I’m used to working on COVID patient charts and anytime a provider mentions CT we are talking about a scan. </p>
<p>Re-read the Reuters article because it expands upon the quote. </p>
<p>To state that you aren’t going to comment on my responses to your linked articles are a sign that you can’t provide a counter argument to my points. Moreover, your counter to the numbers is that they’re over-reported or not significant. </p>
<p>Yes you have contradicted yourself. Your reliance on data is self-serving. Re-read your posts. </p>
<p>In terms of the ES posts, makes way more sense to link the primary source instead of a Twitter feed. </p>
<p>In terms of the numbers, I don’t see how the number dying within a 24 hour period is relevant. It’s about the overall disease course, It isn’t important to focus on how many people happen to die on the same day. </p>
<p>Most studies show correlations. And yes, the studies you chose were correlational. Didn’t one even say it was correlational in the title? Cannot recall. Review the statistical methodology used. I wasn’t cherry picking a few sentences...I just grabbed a couple quotes here and there to illustrate my points. </p>
<p>No, the pandemic isn’t driven by testing methods. There’s real illness. I understand it’s hard when you haven’t been inside the hospitals and haven’t seen the disease course.</p>

        <p>When taking about CT in relation to PCR (which is what I was talking about) it’s cycle threshold.</p>
<p>I read it.  I’ve seen the interview where he talks about it.  I know what he said.  </p>
<p>You didn’t make any points to counter.  You picked sentences out that you thought supported your position and misrepresented them.  You’re not arguing in good faith and don’t understand PCR, so it’s not worth going over again.  Don’t forget, YOU responded to ME originally and offered your two cents.  </p>
<p>I haven’t contradicted myself once.  I’m using official sources to counter the MSM narrative that isn’t based in reality. </p>
<p>I linked to his feed because he constantly posts about the same things.  It only takes a minute to find what I’m talking about.  I’m providing multiple sources that it’s clear you aren’t bothering to look at.  </p>
<p>You also singled out Fox as a way to dismiss 7 other sources you have yet to address.  </p>
<p>The numbers being reported daily are absolutely relevant.  They report it as if they many people are dying within a 24 hour period and it’s completely dishonest and keeps the fear ratcheted up.  </p>
<p>You were cherry picking.  </p>
<p>Yes, the pandemic is being driven by PCR testing.  It’s a real illness that isn’t even close to as bad as they are claiming, and the information I provided the shows this.  They are counting each positive test as a “case” when most people are not even symptomatic, and that goes against what then definition of a “case” is in medical terms.  </p>
<p>I have been in and worked in the hospitals (which are not overflowing), I know multiple
Nurses personally and which are in my family that all concur it is not as bad as they say. My sister has tested positive as well as many of my employees, and at least half a dozen older friends.  Everyone came out unscathed with only cold symptoms if anything at all.  Yes it’s anecdotal, but it is consistent with the vast majority of what people are experiencing.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure you understand PCR; I haven’t seen a single sentence from you actually explaining what it is in your own words to signify any level of understanding. You also seemed pretty adamant that even your studies analyzed via correlation weren’t correlational so I’m not sure you get the statistical methods used in the sources you provide. </p>
<p>I’ve made plenty of points, and you can’t counter them. That’s okay that you can’t, though. I’m absolutely in good faith. You’ve contradicted yourself in the sense that you’re saying the data show X, and seem to have full faith in the data, but when I show the data also indicate Y, you respond by saying it’s not true. So you clearly pick and choose which data points are relevant. I wasn’t cherry picking your sources. Go re-read them. I only highlighted certain points...cutting and pasting the whole article would be wasteful. </p>
<p>I didn’t dismiss your other sources; I did mention the Fox News, but I also acknowledged the LA times article and agreed it is a problem when over-reporting happens. Also showed evidence of under-reporting and after I provided it you asked for an example as if I hadn’t provided it. </p>
<p>Well I’ve seen young and old people die, and the nurses I work with agree it’s just as bad as it’s being depicted. So maybe it’s safe to assume that anecdotal, individual experiences are not necessarily indicative of the overall picture, regardless of whether our anecdotes are positive or negative. It’s great that you haven’t experienced loss, and you’re lucky because others have. And it’s not just the vulnerable. And the ones who end up severe aren’t ONLY outliers. So to act as if this is all overblown and propagate unscientific claims based on said evidence isn’t helping anyone, especially those who HAVE experienced more severe symptoms. You’re lucky, and that is great for you but doesn’t logically follow that the pandemic itself is overblown.</p>

<p>You haven’t made a single point.  You’ve just claimed I’m wrong without actually explaining how or providing any concrete evidence to the contrary.  Your ignoring citations and cherry picking sentences.  You are acting in bad faith.  </p>
<p>The people with severe symptoms are elderly with underlying conditions or younger with underlying conditions.

        <p>Yet once again, you fail to provide evidence to the contrary. I’ve explained, if you review, what PCR is. If the word test bugs you, use methodology or some other synonym. </p>
<p>Okay, I haven’t made a single point. That’s definitely true if you re-read the thread. There’s no original statements or content there whatsoever. </p>
<p>Once again, I never said that there weren’t outliers. My point has never been that there aren’t. But COVID itself has harmed people that would not have otherwise been harmed had it not existed. I don’t know why it’s so hard to grasp that. </p>
<p>The way you interpret data isn’t accurate. Statistics aren’t something you just interpret at will. </p>

        <p>Yes, and that's the point. There has been a MASSIVE gaslighting campaign against the American people. It's frustrating, it's exhausting and it's infuriating. Everything we considered "normal" just a year ago is now "fringe." Questioning everything is now being a "conspiracy theorist." They're trying to convince us we are insane so we stop questioning them.</p>

        <p>Thank you for writing this. I am glad that I am not alone in the sense that everyone has lost their fucking heads. </p>
<p>I never did care for other people and I hated all this garbage before, but now I'm aggressively angry because not only is it getting shoved in my face, and my actions are being limited now, but we are also losing so many of the rights, freedoms, and values that we have worked so hard to achieve as a species. </p>
<p>We are supposed to be the most progressive, democratic, liberal place on the face of this planet, but so many are running around like headless chickens. All it took was some shitty Chinese virus for us to behave like china. </p>

        <p>I sometimes worry that I am the crazy one for not being scared. Every day I go on Facebook and I see one of my friends who I know in real life spouting doom and gloom and mask-shaming just like what you would see on Twitter or Reddit. I see people in my county wearing a mask while in their cars alone, jogging alone, hiking alone, or riding a bike. I witness retail workers shouting at customers to pull up their mask if it is falling below their nose because they are so scared. People are trying to condition me into feeling like a monster for wanting to go for a walk outdoors without a mask on or wanting to gather with family and friends. Because I am not buying into the hype, I am a crazy and selfish "Covid-denier". It has become a cult that has destroyed our society and way of life.</p>

<p>There are 'mask break' areas which double as smoking areas.</p>

<p>There would be a 100 people in a tiny space with their kids... and smoking... no masks.</p>

        <p>So it sounds like Universal is pretty strict about masks. I know Disney banned drinking and eating unless you are seated in a designated area. Does Universal allow drinking and eating while you're walking around? I always thought Universal was less strict for some reason. I suppose they just aren't in the news as much as Disney.</p>

        <p>Well, the 2nd Thessalonians says that in the end times God will send a strong delusion to those who don't love the truth.  Maybe this is it? </p>
<p>Seriously, it's like everyone has developed a case of narcissism.  They use their fears as a reason to justify controlling everyone else while all wrapped up inside themselves, letting everyone know what a good person they are.  If that's not the work of the devil, I don't know what is.</p>

<p>Keep speaking your truth though... I've been at this since the beginning and members of my family who were doing the full-on Thursday clap, and buying into it all at the beginning (thinking I was insane not to) have finally seen through it</p>
<p>People <em>are</em> afraid, but always remember, if they see others standing against it they are empowered to do the same...from acorns grow oak trees after all</p>
<p>I think it was Liverpool where one gym refused to close and the other gyms ended up doing the same in solidarity - <em>that</em> is what we need to see more of!</p>
<p>Yup Wales, Scotland both under some kind of lunacy worse than England - for something so <em>bad</em> even Krankie Sturgeon was caught breaking her own rules 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>That alone should tell people <em>something</em> - same as Ferguson who caused the panic going off to boff his mistress while the deadly 'pandemic' had us all locked down, lol</p>

<p>But you're right, I should post on Facebook. I just know though that members of my family and a few friends will definitely scold me at the least or cut ties with me at the worst, as they're in the NHS and are taking things super seriously (probably to hide the fact that they know this shit is overblown).</p>

        <p>Lol I was actually a bit sad when that bollocks ended...I was playing sheep sounds on a speaker in the window 🤣😂🤣</p>
<p>(You can probably tell my patience for all this has never been high) - I have had some ok Drs but I've also had appalling ones and I'm not one for virtue-signalling at the best of times so it was a 'no' from me</p>
<p>Hmmm I can understand your reluctance a bit more...but you could well be right that is why they are doing it...maybe just stick to how lockdown is affecting other health services and the impacts lockdown will have long-term - that's not really something most sensible people could argue with, and those in the NHS wouldn't (shouldn't) feel attacked by that</p>
<p>I wish you luck...as I said as a fellow UK'er I do agree with your feelings on this except I am certain it's those going along with it all that are losing the plot not us, lol</p>

        <p>This rant really sums up my whole vibe. I wonder how many of "us" vs them there are? Genuinely curious how our numbers are lining up. Maybe we should just all go off the grid and start a new society</p>

        <p>&rt;what would be the point? </p>
<p>I agree. there is no point. So focus on living your life and not falling for the plandemic. the happier you are about living your life, the more you would convince people. Angry facebook rants won't at all.</p>
<p>&rt;I feel like screaming in the smug, masked faces of the finger-wagging cunts that continue to perpetuate this fucking apocalyptic narrative.</p>
<p>I'd say this is ok too, but I suggest doing it in person. Protest. A cathartic yell and in person contact feels way better than online yelling.</p>
<p>Especially don't do it on facebook or instagram or any of those places</p>

        <p>I sometimes worry I really am going crazy. Like if this is the future of how we do things, with the government controlling our every move, it’s just not worth any semblance of safety. The fact that a barely tested vaccine with new technology is treated like liquid gold while 50+ year old treatments like HCQ and ivermectin are going to kill everyone, and no one questions the motives? Fox is brainwashing people but not CNN and literally every single other major news network who are basically propaganda machines for the pharmaceutical industry and Democratic Party. </p>

        <p>Nearly all of us at work want to be done with the mask but it’s become so compliant and 1/3 or more on morning shifts are chin strap or hook nose. One manager doesn’t wear his properly as they say and says stay 6’ from me it’s off and any closer I put it on. 
If it’s a airborne viral bs like they say basic air flow and science of that means we will all get it or have.</p>

        <p>you read my mind: i walked outside after work today, ripped off the face pad, and thought to myself, "we're all living in a massive psyop."</p>
<p>and i've been thinking this since March. today was a beautiful, bright, brisk winter day, and nothing was amiss. cold air filled my lungs, sunshine lit up my skin, the wind rustled my hair.</p>
<p>and it made me think, if this thing is so bad, why can't i see it? why can't i hear it?</p>
<p>a virus so deadly we have to shut down the entire world as we knew it to crush the curve.</p>
<p>a virus so deadly that you don't even know you have it unless you get tested.</p>
<p>where are the bodies? no, where are they? i demand to see them! you promised me millions of dead bodies back in March - where are they, huh? bring out yer dead! you said there would be dead people! you fucked over the entire world, you better show me some dead bodies!</p>
<p>if this were truly a pandemic, why can't i hear sirens all the time? why don't i see ambulances rushing all over the place all the time? why haven't the hospitals been overwhelmed yet? why are the nurses and doctors learning tiktok dances instead of treating sick patients?</p>
<p>if this virus is so deadly to people over the age of 75, why aren't they being vaccinated first?</p>
<p>if this virus is so deadly, why don't i know anyone who's died? i don't even know many folks who have been sick. what the fuck? i thought i was popular! why does everyone else know a dead person except me?!</p>
<p>if this virus is so deadly, and i go out all the time without my mask, and i wee in public bathrooms, and i go in to work and i fly on planes and i go on business trips, and i see my friends and family (the sane ones), then why haven't i gotten sick since last December?</p>
<p>if this virus is so deadly, and we all have to get not one but two vaccines, why will we need to keep social distancing and mask wearing after we get vaccinated?</p>
<p>usually, seeing is believing - well here, not seeing is not believing it - you shouldn't believe it because there's nothing to see here.</p>
<p>i'm not a conspiracy theorist but we're living in a massive psychological experiment. we're all being gaslit. we're all being lied to.</p>
<p>you're not insane, sickboy - they are. we're the sane ones. we just have to try and keep our wits about us. for how much longer, i don't know. i'm just going to keep swimming. stay strong and the only way out is through.</p>

        <p>There are a few reasons people are going along with this:</p>
<p>1.) When they started beefing up the unemployment benefits, some were making more money to stay home. So you'll find those people are the ones that are most critical of opening things up because it was in their financial interests.</p>
<p>2.) It's exciting to some people. It's a form of entertainment to get all scared (but in a fairly safe way since you kind of know you'll be ok).  Like watching a scary movie or walking through a fake haunted house.</p>
<p>3.) Socially isolated people arent pressured to go out and socialize. They have an excuse to sit home and play video games alone.</p>
<p>4.) Trump hasn't taken it "seriously", so they automatically have to have the opposite opinion as him. Orange man bad....</p>

<p>"There are periods of time when I've genuinely been unable to comprehend that this is reality. This is so utterly insane and terrifying I've legitimately been unable to comprehend it for short periods of time. It's like a horribly written dystopian fiction novel, with the obligatory nods to Orwell and a mixture of pandemic theatre and Idiocracy."</p>

        <p>I have flipped flopped on how serious covid is for the duration of the pandemic. I strongly lean towards it being bullshit but I follow the rules for the most part anyway. I dont really know which side is right all I know is what we have done so far hasnt worked and there is no signs of this going anywhere. The hysteria people have been whipped into is unreal. Lockdowns are causing such misery and consequences that seem worse than the virus. At some point ill have to say fuck it and put the mask away, but what if Im wrong? Do I risk my reputation and look like a selfish asshole if all this turns out to be real? I cant be the only one feeling this way.</p>

        <p>I strongly identify with your post as well. These are REALLY frustrating times. I have no plans on taking the rushed vaccine and if after it's been widely distributed things are still like this that's when I will feel 100% justified in saying "enough is enough".  The main thing I cant wrap my head around is basically the entire world thinks this is a big deal...so maybe it is? From my perspective it doesnt seem like it is, but im just a guy who read some shit on the internet. If I ignore everything and my parents in their late 60s caught it and got really sick I would feel like a major asshole.</p>

        <p>Take it from someone who is literally clinically insane, no, you are not going insane, they are. The only way "normal" people go crazy collectively is through panic - justified or unjustified - combined with some sort of peer pressure or groupthink. It's that simply, no brainwashing required. Just some vague reason to panic plus some vague threat of social repercussion and people will simply brainwash themselves. Them not having ever experienced "real" insanity makes it that much worse - for mentally ill people, the first episode is often the worst one because they have no idea and thought they were normal.</p>

<p>Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: </p>
<ul>
<li>Symptomatic at a rate of 18%</li>
<li>Asymptomatic at a rate of 0.7%</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Estimated mean household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) was significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001), although there were few studies in the latter group. These findings are consistent with other household studies (28,70) reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission.</p>

        <p>I'm just curious. You say that it's not that bad because of the 99.7% survival rate, but if every american got it then about 1 million americans will die. Do you not think a million dead americans is serious? Thats more dead than from cancer. Already covid has killed at least 300k. Thats the second or third highest cause of death this year, with masks and shutdowns. I agree that we need more relief going to people to help with the financial burdens. Why is wearing a mask such a big problem for you? I don't want to wear a mask forever but just for a year or so? I too am feeling cramped, but wearing a mask isn't a big ask. I'm genuinely trying to understand why this stuff is so hard to understand or do. People who want shutdowns also want larger relief for people and small businesses. We don't want finacial strain, we dont want people dead, there can be middle ground like wearing masks and federal relief. Locking people in their homes for years is crazy. Wearing a cloth covering when in public is such a small thing to do to protect your family. Do you make your kids wear seatbelts? Do you disagree with seatbelt laws? More people have died from covid than from car accidents this year. If you dont wear a mask also stop wearing seatbelts. By comparison not wearing you seatbelt kills a way smaller percent of drivers than covid kills people.</p>

        <p>Stop with the seatbelt and mask comparison. Completely different things. I am not forced to stop living my life If I don’t want to wear a seatbelt. I can simply not wear one and the chances of being pulled over for it are insanely slim, and if it does happen I can continue about my day. Nobody is telling me to wear a seatbelt or I can’t go anywhere or do anything. But no, suddenly you don’t want to or can’t wear a mask and you can’t do anything. Can’t get groceries. Can’t shop. Can’t enjoy recreation activities. Can’t travel. </p>
<p>Stop with this “it’s such a minor thing” bullshit. For many it’s a gross violation of their personal beliefs and freedom. For others, they cannot wear them for medical reasons and have found their lives destroyed by the mandates and stores that won’t accept medical exemptions. Just because it’s easy for you doesn’t mean it’s easy for everyone, and it’s not a minor thing. </p>
<p>“To protect your family”, you realize masks don’t do jack shit right? Your little cloth or surgical mask you take on and off over and over is doing nothing to prevent viral particles, and may even be increasing your risk of catching or spreading something due to poor hygiene practices with it. And besides, your side was all over the “masks don’t protect the wearer” argument, so do you believe that? If you do, then your masks won’t protect you and your family from anything. If you don’t, then what does it matter if we’re wearing ours if yours will protect you? Either way your logic has a huge hole in it.</p>

        <p>There are people who tell you to wear a seatbelt. Its actually a law in most places. A lot of people thought it was infringing on our rights when they passed these laws. That means the gov. Is telling you you need to wear them. There was a study that stated that there isn't evidence that wearing a mask protects the person wearing it, there has been a study since showing the evidence that it does protect the wearer. The original study wasn't wrong just inconclusive. If you actually have a medical dispensation to not wear a mask you should be able to not wear a mask but you should wear a face shield. This is only with a direct dispensation from a medical professional not someone saying i can't breath. I agree that just throwing a mask on and pulling it off can be bad for viral spread but proper mask use has been unequivocally proven to be effective against covid 19. If you sanitize before and after using your mask and wash them after every use it is effective.  Its not that hard buy a bunch of masks and rotate them. Also the effective rates of masks goes up significantly when both parties are wearing masks. Im not sure on the exact effective rate but no mask to no mask is 70% mask to no mask is 30% and mask to maks is 1.4% so you not wearing a mask does affect me but wearing my mask helps me even if you dont, just not as much. Any other questions?</p>

        <p>You do know many deaths recorded aren't even tested but are put down as covid? You do know the rt-pcr test is completely worthless? You do know that masks are totally useless? You do know that asymptomatic spread has been proven to be false? You do know upwards of 650k die every year to flu? You do know up to a billion are infected by flu every year? All facts. Sorry to kill your illusion. </p>
<p>Why are cases going up even with mask mandates and distancing? Is it because of increased totally unreliable testing? 🤔 yup. </p>

        <p>Just to answer a few questions. I do believe that some of the covid deaths aren't from covid. Currently the covid death toll is 300k+ and this years excess death rate is 200k+ so lets say that the numbers are wrong why were there an extra 500k deaths this year?  Rt-pcr tests are quantitative but qualitative.  If you don't know the difference look it up. I don't know about the asymptomatic spread and would have to see your study about it. The highest death count for flu in us is 68k. That is less than 300k. The flu death rate is lower because people get vaccinated. I dont think you understand public health. You are just incorrect about a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>The rt-pcr test is absolutely not what it should be used for. As evidenced by the creator of the test saying so. I don't need to look shit up when the inventor says so. Lol.</p>
<p>Oh and flu and other respiratory diseases are down, why is that if the masks and distancing works that covid is not decreasing but increasing or am I missing something?</p>

        <p>I have watched the video of the creator of rt-pcr test. He clearly states it isn't good for quantitative testing but works for qualitative testing. Look up the difference if you don't understand why a qualitative test is helpful in our situation.  This is a direct quote from the study you linked
     "Previous studies have shown that asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were infectious3, and might subsequently become symptomatic4. Compared with symptomatic patients, asymptomatic infected persons generally have low quantity of viral loads and a short duration of viral shedding, which decrease the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-25. In the present study, virus culture was carried out on samples from asymptomatic positive cases, and found no viable SARS-CoV-2 virus. All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious."</p>
<p>The study you provided doesn't state that asymptomatic people can't spread it. Just read the article. It's clearly stated. I'm not saying im smarter than you just that you may not understand completely how this stuff works. I didn't untill i met my gf who is in the public health field. You clearly didn't understand the article you sent. Please be a little more open minded.</p>
<p>Covid isn't going down because it is more infectious than other respiratory diseases and there is no vaccinate population. The fact that other problems are down shows that it works. The projection without masks or shutdowns was 2.2 million. We are way less than that. Please take a class on public health or understanding data.</p>

        <p>Skew your thinking all you like, thats the problem and why these groups exist. Because people only see what the media them want to. </p>
<p>You understand we are all to wear masks and social distance because we have low viral load which can't be spread but we are treated as such? You see no problem with that? Or you see this as a lock down reason? What??? Haha. Ridiculous.</p>

        <p>The article you linked too disagrees with what you are saying. Either that article is correct or you are wrong. Why is wearing a mask such a big deal? How hard is it to wear a mask. There are groups like this because people like you can link me an article that they think proves their point and not understand that they didn't understand the article. It's not even misinformation, it's misinformed people. I don't know about lockdowns, i know if the lockdowns were more broad, lasted longer, and taken seriously we would be better off than we are, you can look at the article you linked for prrof of that. Wuhan did a strick lockdown and had strict quarantine rules and now they are case free. The article you perhaps read gives you all of the information you need. You either didn't read it or don't understand.</p>

        <p>"The citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan recruited nearly 10 million people, and found no newly confirmed cases with COVID-19. The detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases was very low, and there was no evidence of transmission from asymptomatic positive persons to traced close contacts. There were no asymptomatic positive cases in 96.4% of the residential communities"</p>
<p>"Findings from this study show that COVID-19 was well controlled in Wuhan at the time of the screening programme. After two months since the screening programme (by August 9, 2020), there were no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan"</p>

        <p>It is stating that in this study of 300 asymptomatic positive people(this doesn't mean everyone was infected. See article)there was no evidence of transmission from asymptomatic positive peresons to traced close contacts. This isn't a positive claim that they can't.  Keep reading it. It explains later on why they think that is. Spoiler alert, it isn't because asymptomatic persons cant spread it. You again don't even understand what the quote means. Please read it again. Maybe ask for help from someone in the public health field. Have you taken any epidemiology courses? Maybe that will help?</p>

        <p>I know I will get banned but I just wanna say, I can't believe this many people are upset about a piece of fabric (coming from a person that gets panic attacks wearing a mask). We are not gonna have to wear masks forever, but unfortunately due to our cases exploding we will have to wear them longer than other countries. </p>
<p>If you found out the mask did nothing wouldn't you feel better knowing you at least tried to protect others? I guess not. Also there is a different between protesting for human rights (with a mask on) and visiting your family for Christmas, by the way. </p>
<p>This sub is depressing.</p>

        <p>What if I told you the CDC study and several other studies have shown masks don't do anything. What if I show you a clip from March of Dr fauci telling people they're idiots for wearing masks</p>
<p>And yet bots like you think just wearing a mask is the big deal. </p>
<p>No, it's morons like you and city politicians that have no clue what the science is but latch onto the fad of lockdowns, mandatory masks, social distancing etc which has all been debunked.</p>
