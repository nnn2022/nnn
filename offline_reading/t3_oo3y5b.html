    <strong>People seem more happier and start to greet eachother more when only a few or literally nobody wears a facemask</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since I've seen nobody walking with a mask anymore in the city I live, I've seen more people smile and people start to greet eachother more back when everybody wore a mask I could not experience that there was no more people greeting eachother or smiling it's like people became less social, I wasn't even been greeted once during that time, now since almost nobody wears a mask people start to greet me more and I've seen a lot of people smile again and I really appreciate it even more and it makes me much more happier than even back during pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>This is like a sign that mask has a psychological effect that makes us anti-social.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you.  Mask wearing provides more anonymity, more dehumanization. </p>
<p>When the state I live in lifted mask mandates, my child and I went shopping shortly afterwards.  She was SO elated to see faces in public, smiling faces, and commented a few times to me how happy she was about it.  I have rarely seen that kid so happy as she was that day, not in the last year and a half anyway.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's probably true.  I was thinking about that very thing the other day actually when I was at a park with my daughter, watching the kids play.  I figured I won't be able to do that much longer because people will think I'm a creep or worse.  The world we live in is so sad now.</p>

        <p>Local city forum: "Vehicle seen driving slowly by a school near 3pm, man looked like he was looking at kids"..</p>
<p>I think back to the time when I was asked by my friends to pick up their kids after school.. me driving buy slowly obeying speed limits of 15km/h in a school zone, looking for where I'm supposed to go, and looking for the boy and girl waiting for me outside...</p>
<p>hahah</p>
<p>Couldn't do that now though, because schools have kids locked inside and must get notice if anyone other than the parent is picking them up, must be id'd signed in, etc.</p>

        <p>I purposefully retracted any engagement with anyone in a Mask. I wasn't going to participate, enable or condone it, or do anything to normalize it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was hard to do, because I didn't want to go to the level of a douchebag, but I couldn't reward "how do you do" and 'good morning" or any other back and forth with people that would help to normalize The Mask in  my society.</p>
<p>For me, it didn't make me anti-social, as it was a strategy to completely wipe out anyone with a Mask out of my life. I never even looked at them for 12 months. I looked past and through them.</p>
<p>I hope they felt isolated.  I hoped they felt that some humanity was lost.. that's what they got for supporting coercive measures and the guns of the State against me and other free and Perfectly Healthy People.</p>
<p>Now with Mask mandates lifted, I still have to do the same as they continue to wear Masks everywhere I go (still 99%), they still are invisible to me - while they look at me in horror and fear - for being free</p>

        <p>I saw the exact same thing. Before I moved to the godforsaken city of San Diego I lived in a nice community in Washington. I say community because it felt like one. Every time I was out I had friendly chat with people. It was a happy place.</p>
<p>When the mask mandates happened it all changed. Not only did the friendly communication completely end - people's body language changed. They suddenly shuffled, stooped over a bit. Eyes at the ground, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>Truly dystopian.</p>
<p>You aren't imagining it; it's called <em>social</em> distancing for a reason... You may have noticed it is just part of a larger pattern of division being pushed by our media &amp; government. </p>
<p>The division they push, along with the lies, propaganda, censorship, force &amp; coercion they are using in regard to their policies is how we know they are nefarious in their intent. If only everyone else could see what is so painfully obvious...</p>
<p>But screens have a powerful hypnotic effect, and a majority of people are in a trance. They're stuck in a cult-like state, with all of their frustration with what's happening being directed toward "antimaskers" and "antivaxxers."</p>
<p>It's a classic example of a scapegoat psychological operation in action... and it's working. It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a minority, using dehumanization propaganda.</li>
<li>Do something terrible.</li>
<li>Blame the minority for the terrible thing that you did.</li>
<li>(bonus) Use <strong>fear</strong> to short-circuit the logic circuits of your population, who might otherwise see through what you're doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also -- if you didn't see this yet, it's <em>incredibly relevant</em> to your point:</p>

        <p>Just seen that video, She just made my blood boil, if someone said something like that while I was there I would literally give a slap to the face at that point I wouldn't even care if I got arrested.</p>

<p>Yes I've noticed it too, first I thought they were only controlling the mind but when you look closer you start to notice they control emotion too. </p>
<p>I never experienced a dystopian feeling before but ever since the mask mandate when everybody was wearing a mask it felt like there wasn't any social interactions anymore and it felt weird to socialize it's like all the human connection was gone. </p>
<p>But when it was lifted off suddenly the interactions felt more comfortable and it actually felt more comfortable communicating with people it was suddenly a happy vibe </p>
<p>The only thing that worries me is if they are gonna slap everyone back into dystopia and that they would create this type of loop controlling everyone's emotion</p>
