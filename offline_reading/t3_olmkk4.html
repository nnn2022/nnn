    <strong>2021 US fall/winter restrictions predictions thread</strong>
    <p><p>Now that LA county has reinstated it's indoor mask mandate, the floodgates have opened for other cities to start reinacting restrictions and mandates. I'll list some ideas below, and i want to know your opinions on the likelihood of these happening:</p>
<p>• The bay area reinstates an indoor mask mandate</p>
<p>• Orange County reinstates an indoor mask mandate</p>
<p>• LA County reinstates an outdoor mask mandate</p>
<p>• Schools go back to distance learning only</p>
<p>• LA County closes theaters, gyms, theme parks, and/or indoor dining</p>
<p>• LA County begins implementing vaccine passports</p>
<p>Or the wild card option: • mass non-compliance and protesting forces LA county to lift their ill-advised mask mandate renewal.</p>
<p>Obviously I kept this local since I'm from CA, but how do you see this shaping up for the rest of year in your part of the country?</p></p>

        <p>Most blues states and almost all cities will have masks by winter. Schools will, too, regardless of state. Lockdowns are unlikely, but restrictions are a probable in blue states.</p>
<p>But it's guaranteed that it will all be blamed on the unvaccinated, despite the fact that the vaccines a) don't work, and b) induce ADE in most people who take them.</p>

        <p>Someone in another thread made a great point about "blaming the un-vaccinated". The media narrative is that it's a bunch of white conservative Trump supporters, but at least in LA county, the largest percentage of un-vaccinated is in the black and Hispanic populations. Kinda breaks their narrative a bit, and puts them in an awkward spot.</p>

        <p>It 100% breaks their narrative. Let's be real, how many white Trump supporters are in LA? But them admitting minority communities are unvaccinated is probably considered racist.</p>

        <p>I believe the plan in the U.S. is something like this: state and local governments will reinstate various restrictions in populous areas this fall/winter (masks, curfews, perhaps lockdowns, or some combination thereof). Naturally everyone will be upset about this...but by far the angriest will be the vaccinated. After dutifully following all the rules for a year and half and then getting a taste of freedom only to have it snatched right back, they will not be happy:</p>
<p>"Wait a minute--we locked down like good citizens, we socially distanced, we wore our masks, we went and got our shots...and now we're still restricted, and not only that, but we have the same exact restrictions as the filthy unvaccinated?"</p>
<p>And the collective government response will be: "Look--the dirty unvaccinated are still out there among us, spreading covid and doing evil things like participating in society. And since we can't readily differentiate who's vaccinated and who's not, I'm afraid we'll just have to implement broad sweeping restrictions on everybody. That is, unless, of course...&lt;sly grin&rt;...would you guys be okay with a domestic digital certification system? Not a domestic <em>passport</em>, gosh no! But rather, a digital health <em>certificate</em>. Different from a passport. That way we can easily differentiate who's healthy and who's dirty, and that way all you good citizens who follow the rules can get your normal life back. Perhaps that's better than punishing everybody. What does everyone think of that?"</p>
<p>And after two years of emotional abuse and psychological torture, many vaccinated will say: "Yes! Yes! Dear God, yes! Whatever it takes to get back to normal, please just do it already! Where do I sign up?"</p>
<p>And the government response will be, "Well...okay then...it is our duty to enact the will of the people, after all."</p>
<p>And that is how the game is played. They don't come right out the gate with their totalitarian measures...instead they terrorize the population until the population begs and clamors for it themselves.</p>
<p>There are some hitches in the plan...namely, that the vaccine buy-in hasn't been nearly as high as they envisioned. They can't credibly assert that this is the will of the people when half the people haven't bought in. And the fact that they have fast-tracked the talk of boosters has started to make even vaccinated people leery, wondering what exactly the endgame is supposed to be. They have overplayed their hand, so to speak.</p>
<p>But...I do believe this is the plan from those pulling the strings, and this is how they see things playing out.</p>

        <p>Considering flu season begins when the seasons change they will all be labeled Covid just like last year. Anything to falsely promote lockdows and the evaporation of liberties. It has nothing to do with health or safety and everything to do with control and eugenics.</p>

        <p>How funny is it going to be when we have the same spike as last year, but on a larger scale, this winter? We're seeing it now in the UK, where cases are higher now than they were last summer.</p>
<p>It's sad the UK is the poster child for vaccine failure bc there's is worse at hiding symptoms, but C19 spread is def higher in the US than they say it is. It's just the vaccines hide the symptoms, which is not good because they're not killing, just putting reverse evolutionary pressure on it.</p>

        <p>Führer Newsom will reinstate lockdowns the week after he wins the recall. Oct. 1 at latest. That's my guess. Any sooner and he risks losing in the recall election. </p>
<p>Counties will do it on their own until then.</p>
