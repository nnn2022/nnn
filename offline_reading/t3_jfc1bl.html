    <strong>We don't care about "positivity rate" anymore??</strong>
    <p><p>So, why in any logical way, would we care AT ALL what the percentage of positive tests are?</p>
<p>Literally all that would show is that healthy people don't care to go get a test, sit out on work for days, spend their money.... And now it's just people who ARE ACTUALLY SICK going to get tested.  THIS IS LOGICAL RIGHT?</p>
<p>I feel like I'm losing my mind with the utter nonsense being pushed out there....</p>
<p>OF COURSE only sick people will bother to get a test!  Thus OF COURSE your "positivity" will climb as healthy people stop going for a pointless test.</p>
<p>How is that supposed to scare me again?  Yet the media blew that narrative up for a solid few weeks.... But even the most basic logical thought about it shows it's utter nonsensical claim.....</p>
<p>How do SO MANY people not have the most basic shred of critical thinking skills to see through that one?? Someone tell me I'm not crazy....</p></p>

        <p>You're not crazy.  I still wonder why so many trust the positive results absolutely.  PCR test: a test you take when you're not feeling sick to tell you that you are sick, gives out false-positives, and of a virus that still has yet to be isolated.  </p>
<p>Such strange times we live in.</p>

        <p>The PCR tests are definitely making someone rich at the publics expense. The CDC claims it has isolated the virus though: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html</p>

        <p>I'd say only hospitalizations and deaths matter, but when you have people going to the hospital for a broken ankle and test positive, and when you have people who died <em>with</em> the virus, take those figures with a grain of salt too.</p>

        <p>It’s just another scare tactic. There are still plenty of people out there that believe that the death chance is something like 99.8% (though it’s actually the opposite), and that’s part of how the news and certain individuals spreading this information get attention.</p>

        <p>They publicly made fun of Trump when he was explaining this 5 months ago. These idiots can’t or won’t comprehend 5th grade math and yet somehow think they have all the answers. You’re right, it is insane.</p>

        <p>I see a lot of information on people daily who tested positive. The entirety of their symptoms so far  never gets more serious than a a 38 Celsius fever, tiredness that lasts a few days  or a sore throat and stuff like that. For most people it's just loss of taste/smell (which is irritating more than it is worrying) headache, throat-ache, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore muscles etc. That's it.</p>
<p>I have yet to get a person who went to the hospital and among my entire group of colleagues we havent seen a single file of a person who died of covid. And we see a lot of files every day.</p>
<p>Registered cases don't mean anything. It really doesnt</p>

        <p>If only sick people go to the doctor, the positivity rate for being sick....would be 100 percent. Why in ANY way is this a useful metric?? Its not. Yet they scare and fearmonger "tHe RaTe islS RiSiNg!"....</p>

<p>No, that's not logical.</p>
<p>Why would you think a rising positivity rate meant that the population getting tested had fundamentally changed, rather than that there were more infections? </p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>

        <p>It could mean either. Claiming it for sure means one of those things and not the other, as the media does when it uses positivity rates to fearmonger, is irresponsible.</p>
