    <strong>My Very 'liberal' sister in Marin County, California hates the mask too. It's not always about Left versus Right.</strong>
    <p><p>She walks regularly, and sees plenty of people in the park, outside, still wearing a mask.  She even gets accosted sometimes, but she's been around that block and can handle herself fortunately.</p>
<p>Oh, that's just outside San Francisco if you didn't know.</p></p>

        <p>It's Def being turned into a political thing on purpose to create animosity and divide us so we can't unite and see our government plundering our economy and our society. Divide and conquer.</p>

        <p>That's encouraging that she can actually see past her hatred. I was a big Trump hater in the beginning. I can't really say I had TDS, I wasn't frothing at the mouth like a lot of people but I thought he was a massive jerk. I got over it a year in. He was a much better president than what we have now. I'm not affiliated with any political party and I really hate it when people start screaming OMG you're a trump supporter! It's like you know what I'm not but so what if I was? So fucking what? Get over yourself and stop acting like we are on the playground it's embarrassing at this point LOL</p>

        <p>Exactly. I think its becoming increasingly clear that Trump was a tremendous president. Perhaps the best ever. </p>
<p>He understood exactly what masks represent, and why they should be avoided at any cost. It was inspiring. He even caught COVID after shunning the advice of the so-called "experts" and ended up in the hospital getting all sorts of advanced treatment and he was fine a week or two later. And when he was secretly vaccinated eearly on, he didn't make a big deal out of it. </p>
<p>That's how you handle a scam pandemic.</p>

        <p>Well, it's <em>possible</em> that she is kind of like you in that regard, but I doubt it.  We stopped talking politics long ago, but I accidentally saw her facebook rant the night Trump was elected in 2016, and she was furious to say the least.</p>
<p>But she has always been a fun loving person, likes to meet people, likes kids and dogs, all that good stuff.  I was just texting with her; she thinks people somehow <em>like</em> to be afraid, I said I think that's part of it but it's also virtue signalling, to which she agreed.</p>

        <p>I guess what I don't understand is Trump has been a huge New York democrat all his life it seems and then all of a sudden runs under republican. What if he just stayed under democrat....would all of these idiots have lost their shit and frothed at the mouth or just defended everything he does? Because I've seen with my own eyes people defend Biden knowing that he's running this country into the shitter. My perspective is coming from a moderate. I don't vote D or R.</p>

        <p>Good for her but something tells me she is going to keep voting for politicians that want to keep masking and make vaccines mandatory. Whether you like it or not, it is left vs right.</p>

        <p>I’m left of center as well, and I’ve always thought that Covid was never severe enough to justify all the mandates. It sickens me how it’s become such a political issue in this country.  From what I understand about the climate in other countries, there is still tension between those who are more afraid of Covid and those who don’t take it as seriously, but it’s not an indication of someone’s overall political views as it is in this country.</p>
