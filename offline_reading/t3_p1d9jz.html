    <strong>Best approach for getting through to covid cultists?</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve started to realize how futile it is explaining data and facts to people who are still falling for this absolute nonsense. Someone mentioned asking these individuals questions instead of informing them is more likely to get them to have a breakthrough (not infectionü§™) on their own. </p>
<p>Everyone learns things and has realizations in their own time, I understand that. I‚Äôm just getting a little impatient with these people at this point, as I‚Äôm sure many of you are as well. With the scary events unfolding around the world I really believe it is imperative that we do not stay silent. </p>
<p>My question is, have any of you tried this approach and what kinds of questions do you think -or have you found- are most likely to elicit some critical thinking? </p>
<p>Thanks everyone and keep fighting the good fight!! </p>
<p>Much love from Chinada‚ù§Ô∏è</p></p>

        <p>You can't. It's a cult. You present them with data and they'll move the goalpost. When they run out of goalpost they move into emotion manipulation. Then they'll start shaming... etc etc</p>

        <p>You remind me of myself when I was young. A noble truther naturally desires to spread the word to warn people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is levels to this shit. So someone who is mind controlled thru the TV, stands no chance of being able to digest the data. It sucks, I know, but I now understand why they wanted eugenics.</p>
