        <p>I am truly sorry for what you're going through.</p>
<p>Here's how I keep sane:</p>
<ol>
<li>Church and faith: if I were not a Christian who was surrounded by enlightened believers, I would have gone insane.</li>
<li>Biological family: assuming that they are not members of the Borg Collective.</li>
<li>Exercise: run, jog, swim, etc</li>
<li>Hobbies: learn a language, learn to code, learn pottery, read books, etc</li>
<li>Be a freedom fighter: don't play by their rules - you are not a hapless victim.</li>
<li>Contact like-minded people on this sub with whom you can have frequent Skype meetings. It's not the same, but at least you know that you're not alone.</li>

        <p>Move if you can. If not, go outside. I’m at the beach today with my mom just lounging in the sun and it’s wonderful. Water is way too cold to swim but the temp is around 80 today so I jumped at the chance to make the most of it. I swear just going outside for long enough makes you feel a thousand times better than sitting inside.</p>

        <p>What helps me is living as normally as possible.</p>
<p>Walk into stores without your mask and don’t succumb to any retail workers asking you to mask up. </p>
<p>Speak your mind on social media. Don’t be afraid to be banned. </p>
<p>Any and all actions of resistance build up your soul energy and release the negative/helpless emotions.</p>

        <p>Visiting this sub for one, sometimes I get a laugh but most importantly it reminds me there's still sanity out there.</p>
<p>Another thing I've done is call people I would normally bump in to every so often, but haven't seen since the lockdowns. In my case this would be folks I work with. Normally I'd get to stop and chat for a few minutes when I'd see someone I'm casual friends with, but now that we all work from home its been months. I took the initiative to call them and catch up that way instead. I've only actually called two or three people in the last few months, but it definitely boosts my day.</p>
<p>Maybe there are some people out there you're not keeping in close touch with that you could catch up with over a quick call! Just make sure to avoid talking about the plague. I always try to direct the conversation to literally anything but talking about covid.</p>

        <p>Be active, be social.  Find people you can spend time with in person, people you can touch, hug, smile at.  Get outside and exercise, actually get your heart rate up, work up a sweat, get the lungs going.  These are the most important factors in a healthy life.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are, but even in the heart of NYC there are bars opening underground for those who can find them.  Outside cities there are communities and people who want to be together, you just need to find them.</p>
<p>I don't know how to help with the income bit, I'm a programmer and thus mostly unaffected there, but we still, as a family, get out every single day, and see friends and other kids as often as we possibly can, because that's what I need to be healthy, and what my kids need because they're kids!</p>

        <p>I ain't going down without a fight. Fear is one of their main weapons...And they can't fucking scare me. </p>
<p>I cope by knowing that they are going too fast and will fuck up and lose.</p>
<p>They try shit like this every 100 years or so. And they always fail.</p>
<p>They will fail again.</p>
<p>Stop focusing on the negatives. </p>
<p>Knowing too much isn't for everyone. You need to either adapt to your surroundings and evolve or Darwin's theory of  natural selection will remove you from the gene pool.</p>
<p>Be strong and don't let the elite globalist pedos win by using fear tactics.</p>
