    <strong>Latest fear strategy - “super responders” to the virus</strong>
    <p><p>Was talking to my Dad yesterday (he’s full doomer) who watches the news religiously (UK).</p>
<p>He told me to be careful because the latest news is that the virus is “ineffective” in some people but in others it is fatal, regardless of age. And that although the deaths are not as high as predicted, thousands are left with chronic severe fatigue problems and other permanent issues after having “battled the virus”.</p>
<p>To me it is clear that this is a massive COPE from the media and establishment as they cannot deny how docile this virus is any more. By making people feel that they are playing Russian roulette that they could be a “super responder”, and promise death or permanent loss of taste, smell, and energy, they can keep the fear train going to help them justify the seemingly increasing (?) lockdown measures and the expansion of government oversight in our lives.</p>
<p>Just thought I’d share this, it seems they won’t go down without a fight.</p></p>

        <p>This is true for all diseases.</p>
<p>Some people die from peanut butter and others from sunlight.  Some people have to live their lives in a bubble.</p>
<p>You don't know what you will be until you've encountered the virus.  It will always be a risk. However, we don't hide the rest of society for these cases.</p>

        <p>I sat with clients, sharing air with them in a poorly-ventilated room, no masks, no PPE, five days a week, for six hours a day, from November when we guesstimate the coronavirus arrived in the US, util mid-March when our business closed. I'm not young. I'm immuno-compromised. Most of my clients were older--50s, 60s, 70s. None of us got sick.</p>
<p>Because I worked so closely with people, and because I have immunity issues, I tended to have a 10-day stint every winter where I was flat out in bed with a horrible flu. I just considered it an occupational hazard. Oddly, this past winter, I did not get sick at all. </p>

        <p>This is the exact scenario I try to indirectly frame for people who are still worried to get them to think critically. The ridiculousness of how this thing was spreading many months ago and no one gave a shit until the media started reporting on it. </p>
<p>“Can you believe we were all going out to packed bars literally every weekend from January when the first case was in Washington all the way til mid-March when everything closed? But none of us died from COVID?”</p>
<p>Some friends I told this to, I could see the gears in their brains start to turn and they were like huh.. maybe it isn’t that big of a deal?</p>

        <p>This is true! I remember vividly because at first I was one of the terrified. BECAUSE I was obsessively watching the JH coronavirus tracker. I did think we were all going to die. I was super nervous my last few weeks at work.</p>
<p>And nobody else gave a crap! It wasn't until we closed that most of my colleagues were like, "Huh? What? What's going on??!" THEN it began.</p>
<p>THEN I used my brain and my powers of observation to realize that, hey, I hadn't gotten sick, none of my coworkers or clients got sick, and nobody I even knew was sick. Not even mildly sick.</p>
<p>I chose not to go back to my old profession when they reopened because now they are all sitting ducks for contact tracing bs. I found other work that pays a lot less but it's worth it.</p>

        <p>I did the same thing early on. I didn't trust the numbers from China and saw images/videos of some crazy stuff happening. I didn't believe China would go to such extreme measures and tank their economy unless it was worse than they let on.</p>
<p>During this time, predicting chaos coming, I stocked up on food and water while the media was saying anybody who was was a crazy prepper.</p>
<p>Then one day In March it all flipped. The media was saying we are all going to die and the stores were raided for toilet paper and other things. Nobody cared about the virus until they were told to panic, now here we are. Nobody seems to remember when the same people calling for endless lockdowns were saying "its just the flu bro" 5 months ago.</p>
<p>Early April when the data came in (not from China) I realized it basically is just a slightly more contagious flu. </p>
<p>Now, I sit in my house not wanting to leave. Not because I am afraid of the virus, but because leaving is such an unpleasant experience with the masks and the stupid rules everywhere. I am always looking over my shoulder thinking some crazy person is going to assult me for unknowingly breaking some weird rule. We need to drop restrictions and start going back to normal. I can't live like this, and I know I am not the only one who feels that way. Living under a boot is worse than death to me.</p>

        <p>It's crazy how common this progression seems to be here. I was paying attention to the data in February. I was telling everyone to prepare and getting called crazy. Then once the data started coming in I realized we were wrong and I go back to being the crazy one somehow.</p>

        <p>Yes. I've been very fond of saying that this thing didn't just start infecting people because we started testing them. But that is the only thing people see in their minds - positive testing surges. It's the availability bias, plain and simple.</p>

        <p>The incredible moving goalposts. Every time one corona narrative is debunked, they just move on to fearmongering on another one. First it was millions of Americans were going to die, then it was Americans were going to die without vents, then it was the Kawasaki narrative, now it's super responders and people being crippled for life (lifelong effects somehow documented in like a month, lol). Three or four weeks from now it'll be something else.</p>

        <p>I’m certainly not gonna ask others to lock down because there is a very small chance I might develop chronic fatigue syndrome from this thing. </p>
<p>Also you can remind him that “the chances of me dying from covid” and the “chances of me being a super responder” are for all intents and purposes, equivalent statements. What we care about is deaths not loss of taste or smell. The argument doesn’t change one bit.</p>

        <p>Oh no, I might lose my sense of taste! How horrible! It's not like millions of people around the world still manage to live fulfilling lives despite much worse disabilities. If blind people, deaf people, amputees, people with chronic illnesses etc can live a satisfying life, I think I can somehow manage with a few less tastebuds. </p>
<p>If I was 100% free to do whatever I liked from now on I would absolutely surrender whatever amounts of smell, taste and energy are necessary to do so! I can't believe people would rather spend a year or more locked inside away from everything they love over a small chance they couldn't smell things anymore.</p>
