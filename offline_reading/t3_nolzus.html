    <strong>I sell mirrors in the city of blind. - Saint Kabir</strong>
    <p><p>I feel this alot all the time but I'm thankful for the people in this sub for making me feel that I'm not alone. I was born on this planet without anyone's permission and I will leave when it's my time, don't I have the right to do what I wish with my own body and my own consiousness in the meanwhile?. </p>
<p>Earth is equally mine or rather earth is no one's, we are just passengers of time who are here to observe, learn and live our lives on our own terms without anyone telling what's beneficial for me by other humans when they themselves are not happy with their own lives.</p>
<p>We live in a society and law and order is necessary for our collective progress and well being but unfortunately some dark and power hungry people run this planet as if they own goddamn farm. Rather than using power and money for the benefit of life on earth it is used to take control, for personal agenda and to spread outright evil. </p>
<p>It makes me cry thinking how humans are destroying this magical heavenly home of ours and how very few people are aware of it. For what I ask? Nobody is here forever and we all have to leave everything behind when we die. Death is an impartial god.</p>
<p>Why is human condition defined by "Suffering" when we are the most intelligent animals on this planet?. Everyone is in pain one way or the other because the system is designed as such, nobody wants a happy free thinking population. Nobody wants to respect each other's opinion as half truths.</p>
<p>I am really glad that there are people in this community who are going beyond the acceptable spectrum of discussion set by the society and trying to find the root cause of the mess we have found ourselves in.</p>
<p>Stay strong! Stay united! Keep fighting the righteous fight!. </p>
<p>We all are one.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, That's all I had to say üôè</p></p>
