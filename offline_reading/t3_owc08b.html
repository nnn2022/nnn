    <strong>Question, what can we do?</strong>
    <p><p>As the title says, what can we do to help keep things from getting out of control, and in the long run preventing the tyranny occuring from growing? </p>
<p>All I know of is protesting, but odds are media/cities will ignore those (France's peaceful protests didn't do much to change outcomes from what I saw), not wearing masks nor receiving vaccines, and helping wake people up from the delusions the media is fooling them with.</p></p>

        <p>I feel like we are in the ‘grooming’ phase of a bad relationship and they are watching to see if we will comply easily. A few things to do that are easy: Don’t patronize businesses with stupid requirements, don’t buy from online stores with stupid requirements, get involved in local politics (like school boards), turn off the news and don’t give in. </p>
<p>I think if they move forward with extreme ideas here in the US the response will be much larger than France and elsewhere.  If you look at the numbers, we are not a small minority.  There are more ppl against this $hit than they would like you to believe.</p>

        <p>Educate yourself. Engage in debates. Take in new information, talk to those who disagree not just here where we confirm each others ideas. </p>
<p>Then go out, defy. Challenge these norms, ask people if they believe it. Ask them why they comply. </p>
<p>Share the knowledge and empathy you gain with close ones, pass it on, let it grow. If you want more then organise with demonstrating. Go to meetups. Spread the word louder. </p>
<p>Further still? Find a platform, use it to reach out. Broadcast your views, know your arguments and stick to them. Seek debate. Don't aim to win, aim to educate and persuade. </p>
<p>There is no us and them. There is no AV v Vaxx. Its all spin. Its all narrative to divide. </p>
<p>There is truth and there are humans. 
We are all humans, we all deserve the truth. We must uncover it working together and learning from each other, not seeing who shouts loudest. </p>
<p>Truth and co-operation is what frightens power the most, it's their Achilles or kryptonite. We must find it together.</p>

        <p>You have to ask WHY are they doing all of this now? What could this possibly distract us from? Could it be the hyperinflation of the US Dollar? https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1</p>
<p>I truly believe this is the real reason for everything we've seen these last 18 months. Currency debasement was what caused the collapse of the Roman Empire causing the Dark Ages, which reduced the standard of living for everyone, which caused the Bubonic Plague that wiped out 2/3 the population of Europe.</p>
<p>This time, the hyperinflation is happening globally all at the same time. Everyone needs to own PHYSICAL gold and silver in order to protect themselves and benefit from the coming wealth transfer. Anyone without gold and silver will suffer and those with it will become very rich.</p>

        <p>Sure, there are many different forms of it. Think far ahead and imagine what you will use it for. 1oz coins are fantastic for bartering if SHTF, and 99.9% pure investment grade bullion has the best resell value. It's a good idea to diversify your holdings in both gold and silver and also in size. An excellent place to start is https://findbullionprices.com/closest-to-spot/ so you can get the most number of ounces for your currency.</p>

        <p>It's now seen as anti-science and logic to question any statements from scientists, experts, and the media. However history had a <em>long</em> list of events where none of the above were correct in what they were told.

<p>Most of these aren't experts but organisations or political figures. I'm unsure if that really counts. </p>
<p>The only one related to medicine is smoking, but <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Dr.+Wilhelm+Carl+Hueper+%E2%80%9CIf+excessive+smoking+actually+plays+a+role+in+the+production+of+lung+cancer%2C+it+seems+to+be+a+minor+one.%E2%80%9D&amp;t=ffcm&amp;atb=v165-1&amp;ia=web">the quote doesn't even exist online</a>, meaning it's fake. </p>
<p>So this source you used is weak when one out of the 23 is related to medicine, but even then, was false. </p>
<p>Ironically, the Scientist they quoted was amongst the first to point out the dangers of asbestos. (You spelt it as abestos)</p>
