    <p><p>“When do you think we can go back to normal?”</p>
<p>In my experience, they almost never answer.</p></p>

        <p>I see this opinion a lot but with all due respect I’m not so sure if it’s accurate. </p>
<p>There might be and probably is an element of that, but I think most of them are just lazy, hateful and unintelligent and have no real political views whatsoever. They just want to feel superior to others while having their pathetic antisocial lifestyle validated by the internet because they claim to care so much about old people, even though they actually don’t at all. It’s the most transparently stupid and feeble-minded thing I’ve ever seen in my life. They want the chance to be authoritarian while doing absolutely jack shit to change anything for the better in society.</p>
<p>I’m 100% against communism don’t get me wrong, but I’m not certain that’s exactly what we’re dealing with here.</p>

<p>Maybe some of them are, you’re probably not wrong, but I’m still convinced being an antisocial loser has more to do with this than communism. Maybe it’s a little bit of both. Sounds like a match made in hell so who knows. </p>
<p>All I know is I want to ask all of them this because arguing can be fun when you know you’re going to win.</p>

        <p>You can view all the trolls who come here most if not all post extreme left wing and pro communist things... seems like your giving people to much credit. And most commies are lazy anti social losers who don’t wanna work hence why they support a system for anti social losers who want the government to pay their way rather than work.</p>

        <p>Fair enough lol. I’m not giving anyone credit one way or another, just stating my observations. I’m moderate politically. Definitely not far left or far right. I’m pretty much a slightly-“left leaning” moderate when it comes to fiscal policies and very libertarian when it comes to everything else. Gay marriage, guns, abortion, go for it. I’m pro-freedom 100%. I’m also ok with my tax dollars going to help poor people and building roads and stuff.</p>
<p>You’re entitled to your opinion of course but I really think this goes beyond the concept of communism when it comes to coronavirus bullshit. Again no disrespect but that is too narrow of a way to look at it.</p>

        <p>No the concept of communism is the ruling class has all the wealth and everyone else below them are useful idiot slaves who all are “equal” under the Sham of “everyone is equal everyone gets a fair share” but that “fair share” is the bear minimum while only the ruling class gets the lions share of riches and spoils while everyone else gets the bare minimum but the equal amount.

        <p>I disagree that's where we're headed because everyone is well aware of the wealth transfer taking place and there are no talks of wealth distribution or everyone getting a fair share as you say. I would more so say we're headed towards a full on totalitarian corporatism. A state where the Amazon's and Google's literally have more power than the government and thereby control the government.</p>

        <p>I have no faith in either. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. All I was saying is a more apt term for what's going on is corporatism. Capitalism is dying, but not in favor of communism. It's fuck no matter what you want to call it, it's the great reset shit.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of the selected puppets are using a fake model of communism to push this new agenda it’s a new model based on it. Of course it’s a ruse and no one is equal, but there are a lot of people who buy it hook line and sinker and think communist governments or ideals were actually for the people. And I’m not talking about people like woody Guthrie and Pete seeger but selected puppets.</p>
<p>But the big government and big corporations are one and the same the USA is a corporation we are just cattle to them.</p>

        <p>Agreed with everything you said, lmao - totally miserable and want to marinate in their couch all day without having any accountability to themselves. Thank you for spelling it out for what it is, lmao. These people didn’t want to put in the effort before when it was “normal”, so they sure as hell arent trying to do a single thing while enjoying the new normal of collecting handouts and not leaving their homes, or showering for that matter lmao. I’ve had to distance myself from a few friends like this because they’re lazy, selfish, unmotivated and miserable. They want everyone else to be the same way. Funny how they act like we’re the ones who are selfish LOL. No sorry we actually want to LIVE our lives. More people are dying over the depression/trauma/economic issues than the actual virus - those people trying to prolong this are the real selfish ones. Thanks OP!</p>

<p>What do you make of the articles saying we still need to wear masks and social distance even after being vaccinated because they’re not 100% effective and you can still spread it, or that they might not work as well against the new variants?</p>

        <p>The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing hospitalisation in those who receive it but not at preventing you from being infectious.</p>
<p>So whilst significant numbers are not yet vaccinated, those who have been are being advised to maintain some level of caution, although they can probably relax a bit once it kicks in.</p>
<p>Chances of it not working against new variants are considered low, especially as there are many different vaccines so even if one wasn’t effective others should be.</p>
<p>Scientists have also said they should be able to alter the vaccine to work against any conceivable mutation</p>

        <p>Definitely once everyone has been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Once elderly and vulnerable then a phased removal of measures, probably initially still restricting large indoor crowds and encouraging mask use. After some restrictions are lifted if hospitalisations are low no reason to keep going until there’s none.</p>

        <p>Not everyone will want to be vaccinated though, and some people I would assume can’t be because of health conditions (I don’t know exactly how that works  because I’m not a medical professional but I have heard of people being unable to get vaccines before.) Also Pfizer and Moderna aren’t approved for children under 16. This is the operative factor.</p>
<p>If society is at say, 60 - 70% percent vaccinated, and it’s readily available everyone who wants and is medically approved get it, AND cases and hospitalizations are at a lower and manageable level (like during a standard flu season) can we drop everything and go back to actual, 2019 normal?</p>

        <p>We can go back to normal when we have a working vaccine and most of the country vaccinated. I'm not an expert on that exact point, but I'd guess it's around 80% vaccinated.</p>
<p>"You never get an answer" because you don't <strong>want</strong> an answer, you just want to play the persecuted role and make believe not wearing a mask makes you edgy. The people out here wearing masks want to go back to normal too-that's why we're wearing the goddamn masks and slowing the spread of this virus.</p>

        <p>Hello, "doomer" here. We can go back to normal once idiots like you actually listen to reason for two seconds and stay inside for a few weeks and if you must go outside, wear a mask aka a piece of fabric, and take the vaccine which, surprise, isn't micro chips sent to control you by Bill Gates or whoever the fuck you want. staying inside is not hard, a mask is not a muzzle, mind control device, or what ever you idiots think it is, and the vaccine will take three seconds to take and you'll be done with it, effectively saving hundreds of others which can also be done by doing the two other very simple things listed above. You guys say that "they said just stay in for two more weeks at the start of this year long pandemic" and it would have only been two weeks or maybe a month if you losers actually followed very simple rules.</p>
<p>Now I ask you a question that most idiots fall short on answering. Why can't you follow these very simple rules?</p>
