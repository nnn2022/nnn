        <p>the gym just told me that they’ll get fined $15,000 if a health inspector comes in for each mask not over the nose. he also said that him along with all the workers and basically all patrons don’t want to wear them. sounds like extortion to me</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask to stop virus laden moisture particles from getting to/from your innards is like building a chain link fence around your yard to keep out mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Said that to my doctor last week.  She had a sudden change of attitude.  Actually thanked me for wearing a mask "anyway".</p>

        <p>In reality there are many factors that lead to people's deaths.</p>
<p>The psychological impact of seeing everyone running around in masks alone will cause excess deaths.</p>
<p>It's called the nocebo effect.</p>
<p>The depression, anxiety, and absolute hysteria that the media and politicians have been causing leads to  more deaths.</p>
<p>Had we never had lockdowns or mask there MIGHT have been 1.9% more deaths due to covid-19.</p>

        <p>Yeah i would take a close look at their definition of “mask mandates” and the method they used to remove the effects of all policies that accompany mask mandates.  They can just call the entire policy suite “mask mandates” and the dummies populating the US would equate all effects to mask wearing.  There is really no point arguing science with covid zealots now, its just religion to them.</p>

        <p>They apparently didn’t control for any of the other policies (and natural changes in behavior) that would precede, accompany, or follow a 
 mask mandate. </p>
<p>Literally all they did was establish that there is a small statistical decrease in the growth rate for covid deaths after the mask mandates were implemented. </p>
<p>This data does not establish causation, merely a correlation. This is NOT evidence for their usefulness.</p>

        <p>&rt;Mandating masks was associated with a decrease in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates within 20 days of implementation.</p>
<p>Booolsheeeet</p>
<p>You can pull up charts of cases and deaths and they do not correlate to the timing or compliance level of any mask mandate. The curves look the same as places that had no such mandates.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Allowing on-premises restaurant dining was associated with an increase in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41–100 days after implementation and an increase in daily death growth rates 61–100 days after implementation.</p>
<p>What a load of shit. Associated with? 41-100 days after? Well, you know somewhere in there. WOW.</p>
<p>Did they test for protests and political rallies? How about Sturgis? Hanging out at the beach? Surely they see this in states and countries that never closed their restaurants. No? Interesting.</p>
<p>OR, it could be totally fucking random with respect to this one potential spreading mechanism, indoor dining, and instead correlates to season/weather/climate among other factors that have nothing to do with lockdowns and masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;the models did not control for other policies that might affect case and death rates, including other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and variances granted by states to certain counties if variances were not made publicly available. Second, compliance with and enforcement of policies were not measured. Finally, the analysis did not differentiate between indoor and outdoor dining, adequacy of ventilation, and adherence to physical distancing and occupancy requirements.</p>
<p>This is fucking magical thinking, that it's "policy" that determines how a virus spreads. It's like this paper's conclusions were pre-determined, most likely requested by politicians.</p>

        <p>So I looked up “statistically significant”. It doesn’t mean what intuition would lead to. It’s a way to explain to possibility of the same results occurring randomly, vs a null hypothesis. It doesn’t mean it was a “significant” impact on the outcome of the study.</p>

        <p>Yes but that isn’t the smoking gun you seem to imply. It means there was enough deviation that randomness doesn’t account for the reduction. It doesn’t matter if it was 3% or 50%, just there was a positive reduction in cases from the masks. </p>
<p>This is important because the masks do not effect the economy. You would have a strong argument that the cost to the economy vs a minor reduction is a reason to not implement. This study just points out there is only a net positive effect. It’s an even stronger pro-mask argument because it also effects the economy in a positive manner by allowing more businesses to stay open vs shutdown during a lockdown.</p>

        <p>I didn’t intend to insinuate a smoking gun.  Either by mistake or on purpose the the use of “statistically significant” is very misleading, purely by ignorance of statistical terminology.  Myself included, I had not known what the P-value was. People are going to read this study and believe that statistically significant is in reference to the outcome, when in reality it’s the chance of randomness. </p>
<p>Yes technically there was a net reduction, however does at a max of 1.8%, did the cost outweigh the benefit?  This is an subjective discussion but I say absolutely not.  EVERYTHING that the governments have said the last year about masks over a 1.8% difference I feel is horrible for those who felt they were safer.  “Masks save lives” does not carry the same meaning when the numbers show only a 1.8% difference.  To be honest and I’m curious as to your view on this take, I think it’s good news that masks barely made a difference!  In so that they are so insignificant we don’t need to fear not having them available or being worn.  I say that sincerely, people knowing masks did next to nothing will help us focus on more productive measures of health.  Thanks for your reply!</p>

        <p>People tend to think small and locally. Who cares, I’m only around 10 people.  Numbers like this, even a very small percentage, really take on new meaning when it’s hundreds of millions and not hundreds.  My take is 1.9% is huge overall and potentially life altering to millions of people.</p>

        <p>I see where you are coming from however would it not be more accurate to use what the current numbers are? As of today 29,037,654 (<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-town-by-town-covid-cases/34879297">source </a>) have had COVID-19.  That number multiplied by 1.018 would equate 29,560,331.  A difference of 522,677.  Again same source, 525,673 have died in total. That means, oddly enough, the case-fatality rate is 1.8%.  535,135 would be potentially the case without mask mandates. A difference of 9,462 more deaths. Over 336,000,000 that is not much of a change.  </p>
<p>Again, the following discussion is opinion as above are just the numbers. Albeit, death is far more than just numbers.  The following numbers matter significantly as well though.  9.5 million job losses ( <a href="https://www.epi.org/indicators/unemployment/">source</a> ) 4 million small businesses shut their doors ( <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc-staff/small-businesses-chapter-11-permanently-closed-covid-19-2020.html">source</a> ) and a 93% increase in mental health issues ( <a href="https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/Spotlight%202021%20-%20COVID-19%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">source</a> ).  I truly just view this realization of the lack of efficacy in mask mandates enables more effort to be out towards other preventive methods.  Thank you again for taking the time to discuss your thoughts,  I appreciate civil discourse!</p>

        <p>Everyone of the other numbers you used could have been improved by mask wearing. Extensive and early mask mandates could have reduced or eliminated lockdowns improving both social interaction, the resulting job loss and the economy.  There is the added benefit by reducing cold and flu spread (which still dramatically effect the economy due to lost productivity and sick time).  I’m not sure why the other figures are part of the mask argument anyway since we’ve pretty much established the other restrictions caused those. They would be the same or worse if no one wore a mask because they were caused by the lockdowns and closings. </p>
<p>Looking at the mask as a zero net drawback I don’t understand the argument against it. It’s been proven to not reduce oxygen, to not increase CO, to not effect exercise, to not effect most forms of asthma. In fact about the only problems occur with super young children (choking hazard) and a few extremely rare medical conditions. And the people with those conditions already practice social distancing as a result anyway.  Honestly the biggest and close to only drawback at this time is the amount of trash they generate. </p>
<p>I can understand the multi step and varied means to an end to combat this. What I can’t understand is why someone is still willing to write off a positive change to the better, even a small one, as part of that process because something else is more effective.</p>

        <p>Short response for now! I’ll try to summarize each point as well as I can.  If masks worked we wouldn’t need any other measures.  Please provide me sources for the claims about not impacting breathing, especially asthma and CO2.  Also child development needs to see facial expressions.</p>
<p>It by far not a net zero draw back.  Remember, we’re not wearing them properly, touching the front, moving them, wearing them in the rain.  Your argument makes the assumption absolutely nothing else has changed with the implementation of masks when that’s just not the case.  The campaign of “masks save lives” is just misleading.  At the start, Fauci said they were pointless.  The social drawback of now attacking others and treating the masks as the ultimate response.  </p>
<p>Do you not agree that the masking campaign has been over played when now we see the outcome was at best a 1.8% change?  I can’t name any other scenario where they’d be such large campaign to say “X” is life saving to them find out by only 1.8%. </p>
<p>Masks have their place in the operating room and for those showing symptoms of illness.  Not the general public.</p>

        <p>Well shit.  This is on me because I was on my phone and winging it.  The report data set is using percentage point changes not percentage changes.  That means my and your examples don't apply.  The percentage point change was 1.9%.   Not the percentage change.  I'm going to assume that since you also had to look up  statistically significant that you don't deal with statistics on a regular basis either and came into this in good faith...and not that you knew that the 2 percentage terms are vastly different.  Now I don't have access to the datasets they used or the software to run the  weighted least-squares regression model so I'm going to give an example.</p>
<p>You are donating 6% of a total towards something.  This changes and you are now donating 4% of a total amount.  The percentage point change in this case was 2.0.  However the percentage change was not.  In this example lets say that amount was 10,000.  Donating 6% was 600.  The change to donating to 4% now makes that 400.  The percentage change here is a 33.3% reduction.  Suddenly this report makes a TON more sense.  There was no 1.8% reduction, just a percentage point change of 1.8 points between the two sets.  Now I have to go edit my previous posts too, damn.</p>

<p>Not bothering with child development.  Child development at that age occurs mostly in the home where masks wouldn't be worn.  And anyone thinks they are taking their baby shopping or out to eat for 5-6+ hours at a time never had a baby.</p>
<p>Not really going to bother with Fauci either.  Both of us are well aware that the rest of the discussion he had, at that time, was to not wear (or stockpile) a mask because the US was running out and already experiencing shortages in first responders, hospitals and clinics.  I can excuse some uncertainly either way from the very start of a pandemic especially when they weren't even sure if it was transmitted through air or surface or something else.</p>
<p>Well, that was fun but I'm afraid it's at an end.  Without the dataset to compare an actual reduction to there's no point in continuing.  It was good though, made me review statistics and do research in a way no one should this early in the morning.</p>

        <p>I just read up on percentage vs percentage point, very good find thank you.  If I find time to look for the data set I’ll DM you them! Thank you for an interesting conversation, take care.</p>
