        <p>I dunno. That would track if the pharma companies were motivated by ideology above profits. Pfizer in particular keeps getting fined for cutting corners to turn profits. So my gut says they'd want to keep as many gullible idiots buying their stuff. Killing people en masses would he against their best interest. It could still happen via fuckup, but I doubt that's their actual goal. </p>
<p>What I see happening is just a larger scale version of a shyster going "don't you know that sunlight will kill you? Here, buy an umbrella for fifty bucks"</p>

        <p>Well thats basically the main pivot point of belief for a lot of the kind of people around here. Are the wealthy elites evil? Or just greedy? Personally I lean evil but I see the argument on both sides.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theory ranges on a continuum.  So for instance there are the theories on false flags which many say sound too crazy.  But then if you look at history, many examples of false flag attacks to further a govt ideology are well documented, for instance in Germany during the rise of the nazis.  So is it really so weird to think our govt might do it as well? And consider  August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack incident, indeed our govt already has been caught lying about stuff to further a political agenda.  Consider that govt rules were recently changed to allow lies and propaganda to be legally distributed from our intelligence agencies to the people of the USA.  So there's a lot of the rabbit hole that has some documentation and credibility, but it's ugly and the average human would rather not think about it.  It's only when you get to some of the more out there stuff like baby blood drinking and reptilians that you can really say there is no direct evidence for it.</p>

        <p>And if you want to get <em>really</em> tinfoil-y, when the swamp starts getting exposed form something legitimate, for example having underage prostitutes trafficked and referring to it as 'cheese pizza' like the ancient meme, they might make a false flag to get people convinced that the claim was actually that they were running satanic rogues out of a specific pizza parlor, so that they can discredit the people who caught them.</p>

        <p>Actually although I would not be surprised of lots of politicians are scum, I was never super convinced of that conspiracy theory.  Me and an old friend over the years have developed many code words just for fun, one of them even happened to be 'napkin' and referred to my white dog that her dog like to play with and 'chew' on.  One time her dog slightly hurked up on my dog and hence my dog got the nicknamke 'napkin.'  Just because someone has code words does not mean they are pedophiles.  It could be a joke or maybe they were referring to other political bs that politicians are often up to.  I am sure someone could grab all my emails and assign worst case 'meanings' to my code words and jokes and invent quite a dramatic story out of them if they hated me enough like certain people hate the dems.  And maybe the dems are total scum, i would not exactly be shocked, but a few code words for who knows what is hardly the smoking gun that republicans might wish it was. Also the only pedophile ring historically that i have seen uncovered happened to be a republican one ironically and those people were caught and legally went to trial.  That's another reason I don't trust the pizzagate stuff, it's obviously political and any movement that tries to paint ONLY the dems as scum is IMO already a misdirection, there are plenty of scum on both sides of the fence and the biggest scum are the ones that don't care about either side.</p>

        <p>You can see how this could quickly become like ouroboros eating its own tail.  They will push more shots as more variants come up but variants will probably always be faster than shot development and if more shots make people even MORE prone and targeted by the variants, then they will be continually be digging themselves into a deeper and deeper hole.  And you don't have to look to conspiracy theories to guess why, regular old science can easily show the potential dangers for those who are willing anymore to engage in actual science.</p>
