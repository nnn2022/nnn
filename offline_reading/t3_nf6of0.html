        <p>I’m exhausted and so frustrated with this black and white thinking... That any amount of skepticism means you are anti vac which now = racist, selfish, qanon, etc. I’m extremely “far left”, but I don’t want the shot. I’m a healthy 30yo F and because I would rather bolster my immune system, I’m some kind of piece of shit? I would happily mask around other people who are immunocompromised and unable to be vaccinated, but I simply don’t feel like I need or trust this shot. I’m reading about all of the women who now have irregular periods, and its being ignored. I’m also not about to trust j&amp;j who had to pay out billions of dollars in settlements to women they KNOWINGLY gave cancer. I’m also being forced into another less paying position at work for this. My employer keeps saying they aren’t forcing me, but telling me that me not being vac is “unsustainable” ... how is that not forcing me? This is rambly but I’m just venting. I have hardly anyone I can talk to about this.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry this is happening to you, I feel the same way. While I’m definitely not far left (more moderate) I probably have acted this past year like what people in this sub would call a “doomer” I wore a mask and respected lock downs.... I don’t regret it, I think me and my husband made the best decisions we could with the information we had. And it all came with a price. What’s opening my eyes is I’m really terrified of the way this vaccine rollout is being pushed and coerced on people. All our family is telling us to get it and it’s safe. When we ask why they think it’s safe, they have no idea it just is... Everywhere you look is a vaccine push. We don’t have kids yet, I’m not willing to risk my fertility or god knows what other long term complications. All those liberals who don’t want to take off their masks because theyre “afraid of looking like a conservative”... it almost feels to me like a lot of people on the fence are getting this vaccine because of this reason as well. Societal pressure. (Not all of them, I’m not generalizing a whole group of people, and also half our family are Republicans and have been vaccinated) It just seems like there has been such a hate campaign on conservatives that people behave in a certain way just to be the complete opposite of what someone might view as conservative. Which apparently is anything they view as “asshole” behavior automatically makes you a republican now?</p>

        <p>You have the right to be cautious and choose.  The rest of my immediate family felt they were doing the right thing by getting vaccinated.  All three of them have been having vision problems after their 2nd shot.  Needless to say they are all concerned and I am angry.  Yet that got downvoted in another community?  My grandparents had no complications from their second shot.  I know they are incredibly excited to get it because they are at-risk and haven't seen family in so long out of fear of getting covid.  There is nothing wrong with that and anyone who wants it should have access. People not at risk shouldn't be looked down on for waiting until it develops a longer track record, full fda approval, or any other reason.</p>
<p>I don't know if the science is good on masks or not, but I always wear one everywhere to be courteous.  I wash my hands like crazy.  I avoid touching my face.  I got a hand sanitizer in my car.  I don't go anywhere unnecessary.  I usually get my groceries delivered. Etc.  I do all of that and then get villainized for being skeptical of this vaccines safety.  I'm fully vaccinated otherwise, if polio has a sequel I'd be first in line for a test vaccine.. that's a different story. If anyone wants to get it, do it, then go home and allow your neighbors not to without telling them they are an idiot anti vax trumper.</p>

        <p>&rt;    All our family is telling us to get it and it’s safe. When we ask why they think it’s safe, they have no idea it just is...</p>
<p>I’m curious about this, what are the sources that make you feel like it is safe or isn’t safe? The CDC has a readable explanation of the safety protocols and how the covid vaccines were tested. If you don’t trust the CDC, can I ask who or what you do trust? I fully understand being skeptical, I just also wonder what kinds of things are or aren’t reassuring to people who are skeptical of the vaccines at this point. For example, I have trust in FDA clinical trials, so seeing that data assuaged my fears about the vaccine, particularly when compared to the mortality/risk of actually getting covid. </p>
<p>Fyi I’m asking this in good faith, I genuinely want to understand your position. While there are truly crazy people on both sides of this issue, I believe they drown out the vast majority of the middle who may have legitimate concerns.</p>

        <p>I have faith in time and evidence. I’m not going to take peoples words that there are no long term repercussions when there is no evidence of it because it hasn’t been in play that long. These are not FDA Approved, or even what we have considered in medicine to even be a vaccine until now. These are authorized only for emergency use. They did no studies on pregnancy, people with autoimmune disease, children, or even people with previous Covid infections. We are changing all the rules for this thing, and discouraged from voicing concerns and I find that alarming. I hope in a few years we have solid evidence that these are perfectly safe and everyone who took them is doing well.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! The FDA emergency approval let the vaccines through with only two months of phase 3 data as opposed to the usual six months of data. I believe that pfizer and biontech have both now applied for full FDA approval (since they now have six months of data), which could happen in the next months. If they get that FDA approval, will you feel more comfortable at that point? While of course a few years would be great, we have to balance the known risk for vaccines (which has been pretty good so far) and unknown risk for vaccines (obviously unknown, though usually vaccine adverse events occur in six weeks) against the known risk for covid infection (2ish percent mortality, etc). Basically, it’s a balance, and I’m curious if full FDA approval will tip the scales for you.</p>

        <p>You can read on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research">fda website</a> the length of time it typically takes for trials. I found that in 3 seconds on google. Why do you think phase 3 trials only take 6 months?</p>

        <p>I misspoke, youre correct. The six months of data is for a biologic license application, which secures full approval.  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/05/07/pfizer-and-biontech-begin-the-process-of-seeking-full-fda-approval-for-their-covid-vaccine.html">source.</a> Typical times for FDA approval are tricky, because rarly is there a bunch of extra funding and global collaboration on making a new drug. There are several factors that have gone into compressing the timeline for this vaccine, one of which has been the strong early safety and efficacy findings. The FDA has a good outline of why the vaccines were approved under the emergency use authorization <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">here.</a> I’m still curious if full FDA authorization will make you feel comfortable with the vaccines?</p>

        <p>I guess it’s not that black and white anymore to me. I used to think that’s what it would take..  1. I am personally concerned with first hand accounts of some pretty awful side effects as well as concerned with the VAERS data. 2. I have generally found the push of this vaccine to be disingenuous. Between the censorship and the demand for everyone no matter the circumstances to get vaccinated... it just seems odd to me. Not a lot seems to be based in fact and logic in my opinion. For example based on the what I have researched, we should not be injecting pregnant women, people with autoimmune disorders, anyone’s who has had Covid, or anyone under the age of 18/16... and we’re doing all of those things for some reason. That’s my intuition, someone else’s intuition might tell them something different. I am not saying I’m right, I have no medical qualifications, but I try to only listen to people who do... and there are plenty of doctors that have concerns if you start looking into it. </p>
<p>And as far as your comment on the reasons for compressing the timeline, I get that. It was an emergency for at risk populations in my opinion (most in this sub might disagree) but none the less, it’s still not approved whether there was a good reason for the emergency authorization. It should be treated like an emergency drug for those who absolutely need it... and I feel it’s not being presented that way... because it’s not. There are already stories of people losing their jobs over this, college kids who might not be able to attend their school in the fall when their risk for this virus is proven to be almost zero if we’re talking data. Again, it just doesn’t seem like we are using logic.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I do agree with you that certain populations need to be more aware of risks and complications for this vaccine, but I think it’s important to also take the evidence we do have in good faith. For example, early data has shown that the mRNA vaccines do not have obvious safety concerns to pregnant people <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983">source. </a> I also feel that it is disingenous to be highly concerned with possible unknown outcomes for a treatment (particularly when preliminary data indicates that these vaccines are safe), without also being equally as concerned with the very legitimate and well documented effects of covid. Doing so seems to me to be illogical.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you don’t trust the CDC, can I ask who or what you do trust?</p>
<p>This is a good question. Quite frankly Im easy to trust others, as long as I can understand their motives.</p>
<p>The issue here is, the pharmaceutical industrie has incentives beyond health. The global agenda currently undergoing has motives beyond health.</p>
<p>There is simply too much shady shit going on within these structures (CDD, WHO, Governments, WEF, UN, UNESCO, WTO, IMF....) for me to trust any of these.</p>
<p>But with this Corona Crisis, its really obvious. Starting with a completely missused diagnostic tool the PCR test. Even if they didnt flat out used a ct thats bound to create a massive amount of false-positives, the testing of asymptomatic people is simply not how the pcr works. Its fundamentaly flawed as it is used and very obvious to anyone who understand how pcr works.</p>
<p>I really dont want to go beyond this point, because it is the core of it all. But even if they hadnt fucked this up completely, there is so much more going on thats straight up wrong and very dangerous that I cant but distrust any of these "high-calibre" institutions.</p>
<p>Screw distrust, its proven that they are fucking with you.</p>

        <p>I’m also in the same boat as you. Unlike many people on the sub I actually am concerned about catching Covid because I believe it’s a man-made virus designed to inflict harm. But I’m also not one bit comfortable with the idea of the vaccine. The amount of shaming going on of those who are not vaccinated is getting crazy.  I’m scared to tell people that I’m not vaccinated because then you are associated with being a conspiracy theorist nut job. I don’t understand though how everyone has so much faith in for-profit pharmaceutical companies. I’ve just felt so alone with my thoughts and beliefs on all this.</p>

        <p>Getting the vax will not give back normal. Wearing the mask will not give back normal. Even if restrictions are slightly relaxed for you, you'll live the rest of your life knowing the authorities can change their mind and reimpose them at any time. Nothing will give back normal, ok? Don't negotiate with terrorists.</p>

        <p>I am a liberal. Always been a liberal. Left wing or whatever you want to call it. I believe in human rights, personal liberties and Foucault is one of my favourite writers. </p>
<p>How is it that now being a liberal means trusting multibillion companies to track your health status and giving away the choice to allow or not an emergency approved vaccine into your body?</p>
<p>I've had ALL the mandatory jabs and more before Covid. I paid for jabs I didn't need just for the sake of it. But this shit is shady. And now it seems that 99% of the people that used to be in my political spectrum actually trusts the government and don't care much about how fucked vaccines passports are at all. </p>
<p>Not even in my wildest dreams I thought that I will reach a day where my political views would be closer to "right". But this is not actually right-wing. </p>
<p>This is "I don't want a global dictatorship" wing.</p>

        <p>That describes my position entirely. For as long as I can remember I have been anti-authoritarian but not exactly libertarian. The people whom I considered smart in high school, however, all zealously follow anything that comes from a government official and viciously attack anyone who questions authority. Now that I think about it, there were several instances in which I should have known this years ago.
These people who want health restrictions, VaxxPorts, etc. may be left wing like myself, but they are far from liberal. They're borderline totalitarian and I can't stand how actual progressives/liberals are smeared as far-right fascists these days. I feel unwanted in my own country.</p>

<p>A lot of us here feel that way. I'm not an ant vaxxer but getting this vaccine which hasn't been around that long is dangerous especially if you aren't elderly or if you have a serious health condition. Although I'm not as hardcore as many on here (I have no problem wearing the mask tbh although it does seem dumb wearing it at the gym when no one is near me anyway), I'd much prefer to wear a mask for awhile if it gets me out of putting an experimental drug into my body. If people want to do it, by all means do it but I'm not putting something with limited data into myself.</p>

<p>I am in a similar position. I actually had Covid and was terrible for my health. So, I only wear N95 masks when going to hospitals or crowded places, in the UK is not mandatory wearing them outside so it's easier to avoid the "I am by myself wearing a piace of cloth" stupidity.</p>
<p>Between my natural immunity and this vaccine, I'd rather stay with the first.</p>

        <p>To be honest with you if you and your partner aren’t able to be on the same page about how important this might be - then perhaps this wasn’t meant to be - I’m going to guess that this was probably some kind of test (fucking narcissistic world today) that probably went something like - “well if you can’t do this little thing for me, I must not be that important to you” ... I’m sorry if that is what happened but seriously a good partner would be loving and understanding that this is important enough to you to support you and at least attempt to see things your way, but in the very least respect how you feel about it... certainly not make something like this an ultimatum - you not her would have to live with any issues...</p>

        <p>I don't know how to handle it anymore, I live in Michigan, one of the most far left states at the moment. I am a student, it is only a matter of time before vaccines are forced upon us. 3 of my peers already got the virus, at age 14. Mask mandates are starting to lift, but I have so little faith at this point that it will all just be a huge trick and they'll be even harder when "the next wave" comes out. I've been stuck inside for a year because nothing is open and I can't even leave to go to school. This is <strong>not</strong> the way humans are supposed to live, and it is government supported. Everywhere I go on the internet is just pro-Fauci pro-Covid pro-government. This is the only place where anybody has enough common sense to deal with this. The minds of my family have not been corrupted, but it seems like everyone and their mother nowadays is just glued to the CNN or Tiktok waiting for the next bad news to praise. Sorry for making this really long winded but I just had to get it off my chest.</p>

        <p>I live in Michigan as well and I've just stopped conforming. You can too. Can't go to school, you can at least go outside, go for a bike ride or walk. Don't let doomers bring you into their cult. Also check out church of covid on reddit. It's hilarious and therapeutic</p>

        <p>I can’t not conform. I’ve tried it, I just get screamed at by power hungry staff. I only conform at school because that’s the only thing that matters that I don’t want to fuck up. It’s better imo to just suffer 7 hours a day than 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>There's not much "experimental" about the vaccines on offer right now. To continue calling it that does a disservice to the community around you that, again, you are a member of.</p>
<p>There's very few jurisdictions that are literally forcing people into compliance. Your hyperbole is not going to make that a reality.</p>

        <p>Tell that to my mom, dad, and sister who got it and are having complications a month into their second shot.  Rushed. I'll wait at least a few months since they had a delayed onset.  Go from a phase 3 trial size of less than 80k combined between pfizer/moderna to giving the whole world its first widely administered rna ever?  As far as I'm concerned this is the trial right now.  It's only cleared for emergency use so get it if you feel you need it.  Pamphlet clearly states there's no data on long term or undiscovered reactions yet.  I wasn't on the fence until my entire family reacted badly.</p>

        <p>Had a haircut yesterday. My barber is pretty left wing, but a nice guy. I remember him telling me back in March 2020 that it was all bullshit. Now he mocks "conspiracy theorists" and has had his second jab. When I told him I wouldn't be having one for the obvious reasons that we're all aware of he started asking me about never being allowed out of the country and how I would cope. I simply said I'm not being bullied or coerced into any medical procedure, especially one that's a trial. This is all so frustrating because he knows the virus isn't as bad as they say but he's getting it so he'll be allowed on holiday and "to protect others". Maddening.</p>

        <p>I think getting the vaccine is a choice that you can make. I chose to get mine and i’m happy with it - I wasn’t forced into it. Is it possible that the vaccine is bad for me in the long run? Yeah, there is a chance, although I consider it small. Is possible that the vaccine will protect me and others from spreading the virus? Yeah, I believe so. I made a choice to believe that my friends who went to medical school are right about the benefits of it, and decided that it was for my benefit to get one. If people don’t agree to it it’s their choice, but it shouldn’t be a shitshow because of it, it should just be people making their choices. In the end, there is no “right” choice - because being right is different from person to person, place to place, and time to time</p>

        <p>Somewhat, yea. On the internet their voice is the loudest but from my experience, most people just want this to be over with. There is an option, if you believe in it, to protect yourself via vaccine - I don’t care whether you do it not, but the option is there. If someone thinks that the vaccine won’t protect them, and end up dying from the virus, it was their choice - same way that I chose to get vaccinated, and may die from it if there is some malicious intent behind it, or pure negligence. Either way we are getting closer to the end of it, until the next one 😌</p>

        <p>It's annoying, but I'd imagine it's to make customers feel safe. We do have a significant number of crackpots in this country who have said they're going to lie about their vaccine status.</p>
<p>Anyway, people aren't <em>wrong</em>, per se. Usually for pandemics, you relax control measures when you see at least 2 weeks of no substantial new cases. A lot of businesses are independently choosing to follow that model. I dunno if I agree, but it's within their right.</p>

        <p>Couldn't agree more fellow brother/sister. I'm living here in Ontario and I think it's a complete disaster. Not to mention I've been working with small business owners for the past 7 years so I see it firsthand. I have literal clients that are a few mortgage payments from going completely bankrupt. </p>
<p>The next thing that's going to burst is the  Ontario  housing market in Toronto / GTA. Once people start not being able to make the mortgage payments, and loans start defaulting... We'll have our own version of the 2008 housing crisis.</p>

        <p>Here in SW Ontario and I totally agree. I never in a million years thought this would be happening here. We are dreading that the schools might require our small children to be vaccinated before being able to attend in school classes again. I guess it'll be home schooling from that point but that to me is not acceptable and this is a true sinking feeling of government overreach.</p>

        <p>So yesterday my husband goes to the pool store to buy a bunch of chemicals to open our pool and the pool store is still requiring masks and my husband asked them how long this was going to go on and they said well they didn't feel safe yet and he said well when do you expect you will feel safe and they didn't know. And my husband told them that this would be the last time he shopped in that store and he proceeded to tell them all the things that he has purchased over the past 6 years a new pool heater, pump, filter, cover, winter cover and all chemicals. And that stops today. He said "So you have fun being safe, I'll be shopping shop place else." Haha I thought that was excellent! Show your support our lack thereof with your money!</p>

        <p>Wow clearly you don't have a pool because there's about a million online pool stores that I can save a ton of money at my husband was trying to be nice by shopping at local and supporting the local business. I've been trying to get him to buy online for years so now I guess I finally get my wish. There's no shortage of places for me to shop</p>

        <p>I'm not virtuous or superior. I've just got common sense, which is apparently sorely lacking in these parts. As soon as this ends I'm gonna go back to not caring about what other people do or say until it starts affecting me &amp; my loved ones again. 👍</p>

        <p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”</p>

<p>I've heard this referred to throughout this shitshow and I always come back to it. It's quite fitting for these self appointed asshats who finally have the license to tell everyone around them what to do. They've always wanted to do that anyway so it came naturally to them when the gov't basically gave them permission to become the hall monitors of other people's lives.</p>

        <p>It isn't elimination of free speech. You're not being criminally prosecuted or forbade from saying things; people are <em>objecting</em> to your speech and removing you from their curated spaces, as is within their right to do. Assuming you're being removed from these spaces due to anti-mask and anti-vaccine rhetoric, it's because that discourse is harmful and counterproductive; the rest of us want to get society back to normal and there is a loud, vocal minority that is actively sabotaging that effort while going, "I'M HELPING!"</p>
<p>Originally, I came here to change minds. Now I come here to watch people. At some point, it became clear people don't want to be <em>right</em>, they want to be <em>mad</em>.</p>

        <p>Oh, so sorry, but you're dead wrong (probably as usual). Had multiple deaths in friends' families and among family friends. I've never been afraid for myself; I've been afraid for those around me and worked to protect those close to me. You call me an unthinking coward, but you're afraid to do the bare minimum to protect other people and bring this pandemic to a close, because it's <em>inconvenient</em> for you. I'm not the one who has growing up to do here.</p>

If someone told you it was a really good idea to jump off a bridge would you do it? This is exactly the opposite of what I want my children to do. Think for yourself, ignore peer pressure.

        <p>I feel like I’m being held hostage. My choices are either putting random bullshit in my body, or continue covering my face forever. It concerns me that people are “happy to get freedom back” like do they not realize how stupid that sounds? I feel like we’re so close to the real normal but we’re still so far away. I already know I’m going to need YEARS of therapy to undo all the damage that covid has done to my mental health. I still think 2019 was a year ago. I’m just so sick and tired of all of this.</p>

        <p>As a "doomer" hopefully I can explain at least <em>my</em> thinking when I say, "happy to get freedom back."</p>
<p>For me, following guidance was for two things:<br>
1. My safety.<br>
2. Others' safety.</p>
<p>It was never about "following the rules" or not getting kicked out or anything.  </p>
<p>It's like if you go into a library. You're quiet because you don't want to disrupt others, not necessarily just because of the rules.
If you go to the library with a friend, you might be happy to finally leave so you can talk freely.</p>

        <p>Thanks, but I was specifically answering a question OP had.</p>
<p>However, I'm confused by your last statement.<br>
The continuing idea from the previous paragraph (shouldn't, shouldn't, shouldn't) carried to the last statement (there's no noun specifically stated there) suggests you're saying people, in order to earn your trust, <em>shouldn't</em> be debating others' opinions, and instead <em>should</em> be censoring, shaming, and name calling.</p>

        <p>nitpick grammar much?<br>
obviously it was another sentence started after the period, even if it wasn't properly done.  </p>
<p>we <em>should</em> be free to debate other options, but <em>instead</em> the norm has LITERALLY become censoring, shaming &amp; name calling.  </p>
<p>you really gonna ignore   </p>
<p>&rt;and they sure as hell shouldn't have a record of being convicted criminals.</p>
<p>?  </p>
<p>because these vaccine companies DO. and essentially so do the governments pushing this.<br>

<p>A tip for online or text-only interactions:<br>
You should always first assume a positive intent, both at work and in your personal life, until shown otherwise.</p>
<p>I don't think I did anything like name-calling, trolling, or even using jokes or sarcasm, so I'm not sure why you assumed I was doing anything other than understand the situation.</p>
<p>&rt;the rest of my statement still stands.</p>
<p>I was providing clarification to OP on a question they had, only.  </p>
<p>I am not, however, interested in having a discussion with you, specifically, because you jump multiple steps ahead (providing a false dichotomy) and assume my intent/response ("putting words in my mouth" AKA creating a straw man).</p>

        <p>I'll address this in two parts, separately, and then be on my way  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>honestly, fair enough. I've been kinda used to people being douchebags online so much these days I've assumed guilty til proven innocent which is not okay. for that, I am sorry.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you've missed the plot entirely and as I already stated, I assumed it was nitpicky, but I was incorrect. that doesn't make any difference to the rest of the reply, which is in fact grounded in reality. you absolutely don't need to conversate with me, I interjected into the convo mainly because I assumed you were being a dick about grammar.<br>
which was wrong.<br>
^(but I do still think you seriously need to do research because your views are insane.)</p>

<p>To clarify, my comment about you making assumptions (false dichotomy, straw man, etc.) were based on your <em>other</em> comments, not on your comment regarding nitpicking.</p>
<p>&rt;but I do still think you seriously need to do research  </p>
<p>Feel free to provide said research. I've searched for things multiple times throughout this whole thing and have found nothing particularly damning—interesting, sure, but not wholly damning.<br>
However, bias is a thing, so I may have inadvertently looked over important information.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry about your mental health and hopes things get better soon. But as someone else has said it’s not being held hostage. The only noticeable difference in my life besides wearing a mask was not being able to get my groceries past 10pm. If you live in the US I promise you there’s worse things you’re putting in your body, and if you go into your pantry and start reading labels unless you really go out of your way, there’s gonna be stuff you don’t know what it is.

        <p><strong>ATTENTION SUB REDDIT USERS</strong> </p>
<p>I thought you were all tinfoil hat, trump supporting, sister kissing, conspiracy theorizing goof balls. Before I came here. </p>
<p>Now that I’ve come and I’ve scrolled and read and done some research... I’ve come to the incredible conclusion THAT: </p>
<p>You are all, in fact, normal people expressing your thoughts on the matters wholesomely and whole heartedly. Given any community there will be extremist and people making the rest look bad and I think that’s what gets cherry picked from here to be broadcast. </p>
<p>In the few days I’ve spent reading posts and comment threads I’ve deduced a few things: </p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. I just think there’s some real authentic thoughts circulating out here and it’s refreshing to see original ones for once. Everything else is so played out. </li>
<li>I can poke holes in the logic of ‘YOU MUST-ers ’ but reading a lot of these comments here I just find myself going... ‘yeah, honestly tho’ and that to me is far more persuading than having hoards of peer pressure tell me what to do. </li>
<li>places like this are becoming increasingly harder to find. The peer review we need and we need a place to professionally discuss our opinions. Otherwise it’s easy to dismiss us. </li>
<li>it seems like the people who post here just offer opinions and the real haste and anger comes from the ‘anti anti-vaxxers’ who come in thinking they’re going to give you the ol Harvey Specter and completely shift your way of thinking. If you’re going to try that, could you at least be less of a colossal ass-hat? Thanks. </li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways that’s about it. Looks like I’m going to go down the rabbit hole on this one too! </p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>LMAO! Thats hilarious.</p>
<p>Doesn’t even make sense. Putin is peddling mRNA vaccines and attending the World Economic Forum to plot the Great Reset just like all the other world leaders. </p>
<p>One of the biggest lessons of all this has been that the vaccine cartel is above nations. No government (except Belarus?, maybe one or two others) appears to be exempt from the authority of the supranational vaccinocracy. Geopolitical and ideological divisions seem to have no relevance to their sphere of influence</p>

<p>We do our best to be better and do better... 🙏. As for peer review I'll admit to occasionally posting a few less appropriate posts (especially when I started on this sub). Mods corrected my actions and I've been more respectful since. I've also removed the occasional comment or post thanks to some 'peer review' on here. 
Glad you're onboard. Welcome!</p>

        <p>You'll find this is more of a reasonable, moderate group despite what the media (and the rest of Reddit...) tells you. The people here generally are pretty supportive and I think that's because we know a lot of people don't like us (especially me....a conservative, Zionist Jew). People here seem more tolerant than other people on Reddit.</p>

<p>They CHOOSE to wear masks.  When they're ACTUALLY sick.  And they do it out of COURTESY, not out of cowardice, not to virtue signal.</p>
<p>Also, one other tiny detail... I'm not Japanese.  I <em>LOVE</em> the Japanese, don't get me wrong- I'm a massive weeb with a cabinet full of Gunpla and a katana over my fireplace.  But I don't emulate everything they do, nor should I have to because you're afraid of a ~99.9% recovery rate.</p>

        <p>As a vaccinated person, I'm embarrassed by all the people saying stuff like:<br>
I'm vaccinated but I'm going to keep wearing my mask outside so nobody thinks I'm republican/conservative/antivax/etc.</p>
<p>Like .. you spent all this time following guidance just to.... make up your own rules?</p>
<p>Not to mention this isn't even a partisan issue.<br>

        <p>Pretty much agreed. Only reason to continue wearing a mask at this point is if you're;</p>
<p>(a) unvaccinated, and/or</p>
<p>(b) believe we need a stronger baseline to relax restrictions (such as 2 weeks of no new cases)</p>

        <p>As a vaccinated person, I still wear my mask because less than 40% of the population is fully vaccinated (in the US). The chances of me spreading it are low as a vaccinated person are low, but nonzero. There’s a significant amount of people who legitimately (not bc microchip or becoming magnetic or whatever else conspiracy I don’t have the patience to entertain is today) can’t get the vaccine. I’ve seen plenty of people posting that they are just going to lie about being vaccinated and not wear a mask. And for me personally, especially after switching to contact lenses, wearing a mask doesn’t bother me in the slightest. Unfortunately sayings it’s nonpartisan doesn’t make it true when one side spews misinformation to play into peoples confirmation biases, it’s disgusting and  It SHOULDN’T be a partisan issue but here we are.</p>
<p>And since I’ve unfortunately stumbled across this subreddit today I’m just gonna address my inbox now.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic a 5k run was my absolute max, in the beginning of a pandemic I was running with an N95 and my max was still 5k. If you can’t breathe at the grocery store you might wanna work on that because the bigger issue isn’t the mask.</p>
<p>“But government tyranny” there’s far worse issues, even surrounding this pandemic and corruption with it, than a private business asking to see a passport. Is it tyrannical when you get carded to get into a bar?</p>
<p>“Lel remember when Faucci said masks don’t work” yeah I do and that was dumb, id hope it was to prevent panic buying but even if he was that daft; the virus was a complete unknown at the time and it’s science. The science changes as more is known about whatever you’re studying, you don’t discard it because the first person made an error.</p>
<p>“But it’s just the flu”. No. It’s not. Are there deadlier viruses out there? Of course. Has the flu ever caused you a delay in getting into the emergency room? The numbers y’all are finding are the numbers you want to see. If you’ve found yourself clicking around google for a better graph or numbers because the one you found prior didn’t “look bad enough” you’re part of the issue and I really wish you’d take the time to self reflect.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe I’m the wrong one. But if I am I gotta carry around 2 extra pieces of paper. If y’all are wrong you can kill people. You have every right to think I’m a sheep as I do to you, and the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. Maybe we’re both wrong but why chance it? This could’ve all ended during the first (and IMO the only real) lockdown but y’all couldn’t behave then bc your freedom. Well you really showed us a year and a half later where’d that  2 weeks of sticking it to the man get us. And before you say lockdowns don’t work, they do. If people follow them. </p>
<p>I’m wasting my time in a subreddit with 70k people who flocked together because they shared an ideology. I wish you all the best I really do and strongly encourage you leave this dangerous echo chamber or at least consider a mask for a little longer indoors. </p>

        <p>Being partisan has more to do than 2 people in the entire country. 83% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans (give or take 10% depending on the poll) plan on getting fully vaccinated. That’s well outside of a reasonable margin of error. </p>
<p>Or if you’d like a more controlled environment direct to politics, as of last Friday 100% of dems in both chambers are vaccinated. At least 44.8% of Republicans are vaccinated.</p>
<p>No reasonable person can believe it’s not political. You can push blame to media but the line between media and politics couldn’t be more blurred.</p>
<p>Virtue signaling about a vaccine is annoying, but this pity parade isn’t gonna get us to open up faster.</p>

        <p>Let's compare that to a classic partisan issue like, say, gun control...  </p>
<p>81% of democrats say more strict<br>
73% of republicans say same or less strict </p>
<p>Almost 2× as many R (27 -&rt; 52) agree with roughly the same amount of D (81 -&rt; 83), making both majorities on the same side of the same issue.</p>
<p>About congress, 44.8% is just the <strong>House</strong> (R), 92% for Senate, which makes 53.8% of Congress (R) vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Yeah sorry I misread, the article I found was comparing the R house to all of D Congress, a little deceptive. 53.8% compared to 100% isn’t anything to scoff at though, and the citizen population also reflects those numbers.</p>
<p>As for your other point I’m not sure what you’re trying to say, I lost you in the 3rd paragraph.</p>

        <p>&rt;The chances of me spreading it are low as a vaccinated person are low, but nonzero.</p>
<p>Do you take comparable risk reduction measures for other risks because they're nonzero? Do you wear a helmet everywhere in case something falls out of a tree or off of a building, or wear a 5-point harness instead of a regular seatbelt in your car? Of course not, because there's some realistic threshold below which you consider a risk to be acceptable. Just saying a risk is nonzero doesn't justify reacting to it.</p>
<p>&rt;And for me personally, especially after switching to contact lenses, wearing a mask doesn’t bother me in the slightest.</p>
<p>Good for you, but many people are bothered by masks, and you don't get to dismiss them because you personally don't mind it.</p>
<p>&rt;“But government tyranny” there’s far worse issues, even surrounding this pandemic and corruption with it, than a private business asking to see a passport. Is it tyrannical when you get carded to get into a bar?</p>
<p>You don't have to allow yourself to be injected with something to get ID to get into a bar. The idea of needing a "passport" to go into a store is laughable.</p>
<p>Not even going to respond to the strawman arguments.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe I’m the wrong one. But if I am I gotta carry around 2 extra pieces of paper. If y’all are wrong you can kill people.</p>
<p>No, if you're wrong, we lock everything down, ruin the global economy, cause worldwide shortages in everything from food to computer chips, erode people's freedom, force "nonessential" businesses to close down (in many cases permanently), cause massive unemployment and inflation, inflict widespread damage on people's mental health, prevent people from going to the hospital resulting in cancer and other diseases going undiagnosed and untreated, and spend billions of dollars developing and distributing vaccines, all for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate.</p>

        <p>The deliberate stigmatization of "Conspiracy Theories" by mass media has rendered the public completely defenseless. Tyrannical elites are openly rolling out a totalitarian global holocaust and Americans are so thoroughly mind-controlled that they are eagerly volunteering for lethal injections cooked up by psychopathic war criminals without a second thought while perceiving anyone who might hesitate to perform medical experiments on toddlers and babies to be a mentally challenged danger to society.</p>

        <p>I never said either of that, all I'm saying is that it's obvious the vaccine isn't intended to kill you. Take the vaccine or not, it's your choice, but the idea that the government is using the COVID vaccine for "population control" doesn't make sense. Personally, I am waiting for the FDA to give full approval for a COVID vaccine until I take one. If the government really wanted to kill people, they'd spike the public water supply with toxic chemicals.</p>

        <p>Because the more COVID spreads, the more it can kill. With a vaccine, there is a fixed possibility of death. Even if the whole world is vaccinated, that probability most likely won't change. </p>
<p>If COVID spreads across the world, it will evolve and become more transmissable and deadly, leading to a higher probability of death. There are other problems too, like long term health issues that can arise from having COVID.</p>

        <p>Safety studies are years away from completion. We absolutely do not and cannot know what the long term (or even mid-term) side effects are for quite some time. What if we injected everyone in the world, and it turned out that, say, 50% of vaccine victims die of cancer within 10 years? That would kill about 4 billion people. We have absolutely no way of knowing that something like this or worse will not happen. That's why you are supposed to prove experimental medicines to be safe FIRST, BEFORE you unleash it on the entire world population, and not AFTER.</p>
<p>And we already know the injections are MUCH deadlier in the short term than any "vaccine" ever peddled to the public. More people have died after receiving the experimental COVID injections in the last 4 months than were reported from <em>all</em> other vaccines <strong>combined</strong> between 1997-2013.</p>
<p>To inject that shit into children, (who aren't even at risk <em>at all</em> from COVID) as many are currently doing, is absolute sadism and a clear-cut case of attempted infanticide. Anyone who attempts such a thing should be sentenced to life in prison.</p>

        <p>I just found someone posted "Why are my posts getting immediately removed? I'm not posting any anti-vax or conspiracy comments". Then I found his testimony (that was also deleted)....</p>
<p>&rt;"I had my 2nd vaccine 4/27, wasn't anxious since I barely noticed the first. Within 2 hours, I was sweating profusely. I went to bed and woke up the next day with mild fever, chills, aches and a raging headache, as if I was doing a handstand the blood had rushed to my head, but continuously. After a few days, symptoms lessened, and after one week lessened even more. However, its more than 3 weeks passed, and I am still having mild symptoms of brain fog, hot flushes, fatigue, headaches, feeling spaced out, and low energy. My doctor thought I might have covid, sent me for a pcr test but came back negative. Doctor thinks it is immune response triggered by vaccine. She prescribed Ivermectin 5 days, which I am on day 4, its not common or even recommended by cdc to prescribe but she said some of her patients had long covid symtpoms improve with it, and since long covid is an immune response she thought it might work. Its also been researched and prescribed in other countries. Headaches lessened a bit with medication, but still getting the other symptoms. My worry is that for some people, the vaccine might be triggering long term immune responses that don't go away quickly. This should be being reported but its not, and its frustrating that government seem to be saying oh the vaccine side effects are only a few days and mild. I wish you better"</p>

        <p>Yes. This is human nature in action. We tend to upvote positive things, or things that we can directly relate to. Visit literally any tech support forum and, unless the problem is affecting <em>a large number of people</em>, you'll often find that the posts die without a single reply and with zero attention. I'm not the one missing the point here.</p>
<p>The fact that negatives aren't reaching the front page frequently means that nobody is experiencing those negatives on a large scale. If a significant % of the vaccinated were getting nosebleeds, that sure as shit would be voted to the front page. The hives one reached the front page because that's <em>unique, interesting, and has pictures</em>. This is pretty standard for reddit.</p>

        <p>J&amp;J has a decent history of fraud as well. IMO, so far it seems the people that have been the quickest to line up for their jab are the ones that regularly line up for the ~~almost totally~~ ~~useless~~  annual flu shot so already have a lot of trust in pharmaceuticals.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, big corporations in general have a long history of not looking past the current quarter. Think of cars that had a substandard part that saved a dollar, but was guaranteed to cost $$$$ in warranty claims.</p>
<p>Then, the pharma high ups might not care about the fate of the company. They will be just fine. They might have their little nest egg. And if the company crashes, well, they can go whining to Congress for a bailout, complete with golden parachutes--which they'd very likely get.</p>

<p>She also just quickly posted up a twitter screenshot of someone talking about "If masks don't work then how did we have so few flu cases!" </p>

        <p>Why is nobody looking for accountability with Covid?  Why has WHO not come up with conclusive evidence on where it started?  And if it was in China - why has no government looked for them to make amends with the whole planet? 
This is not an anti-Asian rant - I am referring to the Chinese government - the country.
I can’t believe that there has still been no acknowledgement of where it all started and an actual apology of some kind.</p>

        <p>Yeah I wonder this too sometimes. Especially considering this isn't the first time a novel virus has emerged from their extremely unsanitary and animal cruelty laden wet markets. How many more times does this need to happen for something to finally be done to force them to make their markets sanitary and safer? </p>
<p>And there was even a brief amount of time where even mentioning this virus originated in China was somehow taboo because it would imply racism. Like, wtf? Humans are so stupid.</p>

        <p>I'm from Argentina</p>
<p>We are in lockdown again, prob permanent until warmer months (nov/dic), supposedly deaths have been ramping up. But my take? is that the data is highly manipulated so to find a way to avoid paying the debt interest or get more money to win the next election, of all the countries this one should have been the one with people rising up against its government, but politics -like in the us- is like religion here. </p>
<p>A famous guy also died days after the vaccine here, the grandma of a close friend also died a couple of weeks after the jab, but she was really old so there's that. </p>
<p>Because the elections, all the parties discourse have changed into who can administer the state better in order to give more vaccines, our progressives are 24/7 fearmongering but the right wing globalists do it too, but differently (ie we must increase vaccination so economy can revive). </p>
<p>I did say that between the broken down economy, the international influence, our natural resources and weakened population, this country is going to be the first ones to be intervened and balkanised in the following decades, feels bad.</p>

        <p>Here's what I don't understand months ago maybe even a year ago there was a Chinese woman from the Wuhan lab on Tucker Carlson who said that this virus was from there was that just dismissed? Was I the only one that saw that? I thought it was common knowledge that it came from the lab I mean I'm glad that it's coming out but I thought it was already out and no one cared</p>

<p>and who knows what else they added without telling us, what about the nanobots and parasites that have been found under the microscopes of independent researchers, huh?</p>

        <p>Good question! If there were nanobots or parasites in the shot that would be awful. But who would have put them there? And why? Is it likely? Let’s think about it.</p>
<p>All the COVID vaccines distributed in America (where I live and got my shot) Have to be cleared by the FDA to be administered. So the only way anything like that would make it in would be if the US govt. is in on the conspiracy.</p>
<p>And that might be conceivable- but the same vaccines are also distributed in other countries as well, and if any of those countries did their own independent test on the drugs the received they would find the nasties and the whole plot would be out.</p>
<p>So in short for contaminated vaccines to be distributed the governments of multiple countries would havre to cooperate and communicate in secret without anything ever slipping or leaking. If one person in the conspiracy is bribed or something all those governments go down in a massive scandal. Is it reasonable to believe that all these countries would risk that? And what reason would be strong enough to unite all these different governments to do this?</p>
<p>TLDR: Contaminated vaccine distribution would require a perfectly executed conspiracy of a truly massive scale, and the general rule of thumb for conspiracies is that the larger the scale the more likely they are to be exposed.</p>
<p>It’s just... it strains believability.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. Some people were injected with... benign saline, instead of a vaccine? Why is that indicative that our shots are filled with nanobots and parasites?</p>

        <p>I don’t know where all these people came from thinking this sub thinks nanobots are in the vaccine - since about 2-3 weeks ago this place suddenly became disproportionately memes and a lot of these fringe ideas - worse lacking legit research - a month ago it was research papers and mixed opinions (but generally negative) on safety and efficacy of vaccines masks and lockdowns - I think you and I disagree on some things here but this is not one of them</p>

        <p>My dad won’t let up on the vaccine. He’s “joking” about it but he won’t stop. (He’s a great dad in all aspects except for this covid shit, he has SEVERE diagnosed health anxiety and the pandemic really affected him mentally) it’s getting to the point where I might blow up on him one day about it. Any advice? </p>
<p>I’ve told him I’m not even in the “I’ll NEVER get the shot” camp - I just want to wait a year or longer to see what happens and see if ANY health professionals will acknowledge the weird menstrual changes post vaccine and do something to stop that from happening. He seemingly can’t affect that, and keeps making passive aggressive “jokes”.</p>

        <p>It’s honestly one of the main reasons I won’t get it. That and how horribly sick people are after the shot. I understand how immune responses work, but what a lot of people are experiencing is extreeeemmmmeee. Being sore and a bit achey for a day? Maybe a very slight fever that breaks with medication? Normal. Having a 104 or higher fever that won’t break even with meds and feeling like you’re dying? Abnormal response that should be considered an adverse affect. Never has a vaccine, including my yearly flu shot, made me that sick. I refuse to believe that’s normal and to be expected from a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I mean, the vaccines are all STILL In their clinical trials. You're rightfully concerned about a potential long term side effect that has been observed and want to wait to see what information can be gleaned during the trial prior to consenting to getting it. That should be it. </p>
<p>If your dad respects you as an adult and your ability to make informed decisions for yourself, then he should understand. But if logic doesn't work, then just tell him you will get it eventually and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Good luck!!</p>

        <p>Since I have to go through all of the horrible stuff the haters are saying to us, this means a lot to hear people saying this kind of thing.  I agree 100% on what you said though, it's like the world collectively went insane but at least we have this to keep ourselves sane and hopefully make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>Thank <em>you</em>.  This is first time I have been a mod and it I know that this sub a lot of the time at face value is just a bunch of memes but I think most people who like the sub recognize that it represents a lot more than just that.  I hope that some day the original purpose of the sub will no longer be necessary and it seems like we are finally seeing signs of that.  </p>
<p>But even when that happens I think that this will remain as an important part of Reddit where people seem more like the kind of people I know in real life as opposed to type of partisan extremists that are portrayed in the media that get us all riled up.</p>

        <p>Question from an honest "doomer":</p>
<p>I know, from watching this sub, there has been a lot of talk about how we'll wear masks forever and slippery slopes and such.</p>
<p>My state is lifting mandates and, last I went to the most popular grocery store nearby, maybe 50% of people (employees and customers alike) were wearing masks.</p>
<p>Are you thinking...<br>
There's another stage after this and that lifting these mandates is because this was all a test run?</p>
<p>There's another stage after this and lifting mandates is to give a false sense of security before <em>another</em> wave of lockdown(s) happen(s)?</p>
<p>Or are you just glad mandates are lifting at all? And, perhaps, you were prepared for the worst that didn't come to pass?</p>
<p>[I'm very aware this could sound like a troll question, but check my history and you'll see I'm just interested in seeing other perspectives]</p>

        <p>I'm glad mendates are lifting but very worried by the precedent that was set. </p>
<p>There is no solid evidence that masks or lockdowns work and plenty of data that points in the opposite direction. Governments and the majority of the population let hysteria rule over reason which has resulted in an enormous amount of damage. There is no sign that the right lessons have been learned. This makes me worried for the next seasonal viral spike or just any new challenge to society in general. </p>
<p>Modern society is ruled by fear and herd mentality. A change is necessary.</p>
<p>The whole vaccine passport side of the current hysteria is also still a real threat to basic human rights.</p>

        <p>It's too early to say, because we've a long way to go until the next flu season. We'll know when cold weather returns, whether any of this is permanent-ish or not. (But not truly permanent, because a precedent has been established)</p>
<p>The more immediate concern is whether every major employer (and school) will start requiring vaccines. Certainly there are a lot of people reporting in with those stories. Assuming that takes hold with no resistance, what's next? Not being allowed to take any form of public transit, not being able to visit any doctor or hospital, etc.</p>

        <p>One possibility I've seen discussed here is that the lifting of mandates is temporary so that when "cases go up due to less mandates" they have a reason for even more intense lockdowns and mandates being imposed. "Lifting mandates and lockdowns was a mistake because look at how many people died when we did that." Safety, safety, safety narrative per usual. So, then, more intense vaccination coercion, chipping, passports, tracing, can't go grocery shooping unless vaccinated, etc....</p>

        <p>I think more likely they know summer is relatively benign and might as well give us some taste of freedom and i hope it ends there but there are many ways this could go...  too many to list...  but as stared above i think vaccine mandates (and ids) are worse than “lockdowns” and what really need to be fought.  The illusion of freedom for those who so easily complied...</p>

        <p>Yes the vaccine pushing is far more dangerous than anything we faced yet, I know this isn't over (especially being a working unvaxed right now) which is why I'm always keep up on what's going on every week still because every time we turn our heads there always seems to be something else they're trying to pull. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if this is some sort of temporary freedom to set something up for the Fall which will be even worse but if enough people say no it would be stopped in its tracks. This can not go on with the conscious approval of large numbers of people.</p>

        <p>New measures will come with the so called new strains, real or not. </p>
<p>Personally i don't believe the "scientists" know what to do, it's a constant trial and error based on info governments give. If there's a political interest behind these sages of science (tm), or behind the "measurement tools", or the info available is not representative of reality, and so on and so on, in the end we are at the mercy of those who control all the institutions that shape our views of the world, what's real? i don't know anymore but what i know is that if tomorrow scientists say you have to put a dildo inside your butt to save your granny, many will follow.</p>

        <p>So fascist authoritarian Israel has decided to scrap their vaccine passport system and is ending all the restrictions soon. I guess the damage is already done if they managed to coerce the vast majority of their adult population into getting the vax. Hopefully this is a good sign, that other country's passport schemes will fall apart as well. Although, I have a feeling it's going to be a rolling basis of removing restrictions and putting them back on, come every flu season. I'd love to be wrong and that this was just a hellish totalitarian aberration that won't happen again, but I'm highly doubtful. Now that it's turning to summer and restrictions are slowly disappearing, people who have suppressed their immune systems are coming out and interacting after a year, it's almost certain that there will be a worse flu season this fall which will likely be consolidated into the new strains of covid by the media.</p>

        <p>Went to the store unmasked for the first time. And /GASP I'm not vaccinated lol. I'm pretty sure everyone knew that though since my young kids were also without masks.</p>
<p>I was never completely anti-mask. I'll wear one if a store requires it. It's fine and IMO not a big deal AND I'll wear one if I am sick/coughing out of courtesy now, but dang it was nice feeling NORMAL while out and about again. It was nice actually seeing more entire faces in stores again.</p>
<p>It was nice seeing people that walked in with masks on, see everyone without one on pull theirs down (noticed 4 ppl do that).</p>

        <p>Since my state dropped the mask mandate last week, I still see most people wearing masks at stores. I went to Target and only saw 1 person without one. Same thing at Harris Teeter. Went to Aldi and everyone except me was wearing a mask. My husband says it was the same at Walmart. People are so attached to their masks.</p>

        <p>Must be nice being so sure of your own beliefs that you don’t trust doctors or scientists. Next time your kids get sick or hurt, don’t go to the hospital, can’t trust em, right? Or do you only compartmentalize your beliefs when it’s convenient for you? If you don’t believe in doctors or medicine or science that’s fine, but don’t utilize those services if you believe that.</p>

        <p>Or.. how about keep wearing your mask if you want. Go get your vaccination if you want and worry about yourself and stop worrying about what the rest of us are doing. I know I know. It's hard not being a busy body and sticking your nose in to other people's business, but... I'm sure you can figure it out.</p>

        <p>I am so tired of this.</p>
<p>Every time I leave the house, my partner (vaccinated) asked me (unvaccinated) if I have my mask (in our state it’s recommended unvaccinated wear masks indoors) bc he is so scared I will not wear my mask and somehow contaminate him. Whenever I tell him I don’t have covid he doesn’t believe me. I’m constantly baffled at the stupidity. </p>
<p>I’ve been following all of the rules for the past year+ aside from getting the shot bc I see through the bullshit. </p>
<p>If one more person tries to explain to me how I’m selfish bc i could unknowingly infect someone who is immune compromised and kill them, or how I am the reason covid will never end I am going to loose. my. shit.</p>
<p>I am praying every day (not even religious!!!!) that those blindly quoting npr can one day reach enlightenment and realize it’s the goddamn government who is fucking us all. </p>
<p>anyways, i’m glad i found this place. end rant.</p>

        <p>I’m just going to be honest, I’m terrified.
My parents, grandparents and closest friends are vaccinated and the last friend who isn’t is determined to get hers even though I’ve tried to convince her not too.... 
I even fear going near fully vaccinated people as I have suspicions they’re covering the new variant with the consequences following the vaccines or if they could pass something onto me.
I really want to be a mum someday and this pandemic scares me mainly on that aspect.... I feel like I’m crazy and I fucking pray I am but I just don’t know what to believe anymore 😔</p>

        <p>I'm gonna be getting the vaccine soon I really don't want to. I'm 15 so I don't have much control over if I get the vaccine or not, and I couldn't imagine telling my mom, she'd be pretty angry. She knows i'm into conspiracy theories and I keep telling her things like "don't worry I don't actually believe any of it, I just think it's cool" when I do in fact believe many of the conspiracies I tell her about. I've also had kind of a "spiritual awakening" as of late, and I've really woken up to the evils of our world. And it makes me think, what is so transgressive about not trusting the government to inject something into my body? Especially a vaccine that isn't fda approved and is being created by shady companies, and a vaccine with so many incentives surrounding it like free (fast) food, a lottery ticket, etc. which makes me wonder why they'd have to do all that if the vaccine was truly safe. The world is just so backwards, I hate it. Sorry this was so long. I could really use some advice on how to convince my parents to not make me get it. I'm writing an essay-ish thing that will hopefully convince them but I assume they'll just brush it off as conspiracy nonsense.</p>
<p>Update: I compiled a list of reasons why i dont want the vax, its well thought out and full of good sources. I read it to my mom and she admired my adamance, she said she’ll talk to my dad and think about it. She says shes proud of me for caring about my health. I think it went pretty well 😁</p>

        <p>Do your best with words, but if reason won't work, just promise you'll throw an absolute shitfit if anybody tries to force a needle into you. "I will literally bite anybody who comes near me, so be prepared to hire a lawyer." That would probably make most parents think twice. Or threaten to run away, or ... you get the idea.</p>
<p>Ask them what's more important, your freely-given love and respect, or willfully violating your PERFECTLY HEALTHY bodily autonomy just to assuage their own personal fears - which might have major ramifications for your relationship with them going forward? Are they prepared to accept personal responsibility if you should have a bad, even fatal reaction, to a statistically completely unnecessary treatment for someone your age?</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

        <p>Went to Home Depot today. I’d say 70-80% still wearing masks even though they don’t have to. I had mine off in return line and a young couple behind must’ve seen and took theirs off. It’s ok to emerge! Public service!</p>

        <p>I have a question about the FDA approval for the vaccine and idk where else to ask it without being called a science denier. 1. When is even expected to be approved? And 2. What would be the repercussions of it NOT passing approval after it’s been given to so many people</p>

        <p>The study has been unblinded and thus tainted - I’m on mobile but this is mentioned in the Pfizer study - can link later if anyone doesn’t believe me - Pfizer said so themselves ... 2023 is when the clinical trial is supposed to end but the study says it must ethically unblind the study and would need to start a new one to determine long term safety so I would say 2023 is actually the soonest possible but likely longer IMO</p>

        <p>As far as nothing being done if it’s not approved, do you think an approval could even be trusted... is it likely for it to be fudged not to cause a public panic? Or would they just straight up not approve it?</p>

        <p>(OP I added to this thread in a different reply)... but Jesus Christ look what our society has become ... we have people coming to supposed “conspiracy subs” to get actual insights - afraid of being labeled, censored, or banned - you hear that? People fear dissenting against the vaccine and others are still smug enough to come here and act like we are an unscientific cult - Jesus Christ</p>

        <p>I actually don’t really think this is a conspiracy sub, more of an alternative perspective. And definitely away from the “hive mind” that is going on elsewhere... one thing I have noticed though, everyone who is concerned about the safety of the vaccine comes with facts, data, and sources. Everyone who is for everyone taking it only is able to say, it’s safe, your selfish, your a science denier.</p>

        <p>I'm Canadian here, but recently Ontario started allowing people in my age group (early 20s) to get the vaccines. We're still in lockdown because Ontario has an even worse government than most states, but that's a different story.
Due to the insane real estate costs, I still live with my parents and pay rent unofficially. They told me that I must get the vaccine if I want to live with them. I definitely don't want to get it and don't want other people coercing me to put things in my body that I don't want. I don't have any other options for places to live. What should I do?</p>

        <p>When it became a weapon for the left. I remember those first few weeks, no one knew what to expect or how to deal. Lockdowns were a great idea, if you had no idea what was going on. But once we started to figure things out, the lockdowns and control measures continued. Restaurants and shops closed because of these restrictions. Once we figured out the most at risk were elderly, we should have opened up business and kept the mask mandate. But they didn't and now unemployment is sky rocketing and inflation is insane. Great job, idiots.</p>

<p>Exactly. I obviously wasn't a fan of lockdowns when they first started, but at the time I understood the need for them as a <em>temporary</em> measure until more could be gleaned about COVID - specifically how it spread, where it spread and how best to mitigate both of those.</p>
<p>Well that data has been out for months now and yet, nothing has changed. At least here in Ontario. We're in our 3rd lockdown and we're officially now losing this Summer <em>again</em> despite all this data that shows the current approach is next to useless. I hate it here.</p>

        <p>Follow up question, if I may? People who were originally gung-ho about restrictions, why did you feel the need to have mandates instead of suggestions? </p>
<p>In Feb 2020 I was very keen on government <em>guidelines</em> (providing advice and up-to-date info about the virus) but not on actual laws prohibiting movement/activities. Why do people feel the need to have these things enforced by law?</p>

        <p>I wasn't scared of getting the virus myself, but I thought there would be coordination problems that would keep the population stuck in a pandemic. The idea at the time was "When this virus is all gone within a few weeks, it'll look like this was all for nothing." Then time revealed that it didn't matter what we did, so we might as well have let people live their lives.</p>

        <p>I'm probably not the most interesting one since I was never fully against restrictions but I realized how ridiculous it was getting with things like you cannot travel a certain amount of miles outside from your neighborhood, how you cannot go to a gym even if they restrict the amount of people inside, and how restaurants, theaters etc had to close (except for to go!) for some quite some time when again they could have compromised and based it on limiting the amount of people inside. My favorite piece of bullshit was how at my job you aren't likely to get Covid if you are next to someone for less than 15 minutes but 15 minutes or more, fair game!! I just think I'm a reasonable person and okay with compromising but so many things in my state (California of course) were wack. One of my favorite things about this was how landlords cannot evict so people who typically mooch off the government or just work whenever can continue to do that knowing damn well they can live rent free for some time not caring in the end that if they don't pay that when this all ends, they will be evicted. There was an episode of Judge Judy about this. Landlord couldn't get rid of tenants from Hell who were living life up during the pandemic knowing they were untouchable.</p>

        <p>So while the USA opens up more and more everyday and I see social media posts of people getting back to REAL normal... Here just across the border in Ontario our government has announced the <em>worst</em> reopening plan i've ever seen in my life that doesn't allow gyms and restaurants to open until late July <em>at the earliest</em>. And even then, they're going to still be laden with restrictions. </p>
<p>Even in Quebec they're planning on reopening restaurants and gyms before the end of the month. </p>

        <p>I hope it gets better for you. The world has higher expectations of Canadians. The world expects the worst of Americans so we already know what we can either try to put on a show to impress people 
( fake), or to just be ourselves and figure "fuck it" and  know people will roll their eyes at us.  You're like the smarter sibling who was expected to go become a doctor vs we were the ones who our parents just said "you do you" to not knowing what else to say.</p>

        <p>But that's the thing is Canadians put on a show too. That whole "nicest/most polite people in the world!" thing is such garbage. It's not authentic since most Canadians have no problem shit talking the rest of the world... Specifically the USA to pump up their inferiority complex egos at any moment.  </p>
<p>You guys are a global superpower for a reason. And obviously you get more global media attention because of it. We're not a global superpower and are out of most global media attention... But the same shit happens here too I can assure you.</p>

        <p>Both your links are from last Fall when the USA was in the midst of the 2nd wave and when mask mandates were heavily enforced in many states.</p>
<p>Now the CDC and the president himself have said you can take your mask off and many states have ended their mask mandates... And people have been taking them off gauging from what i've seen from the Americans I follow. </p>
<p>Not sure why you're so keen to die on this hill. This sub is against the <em>new</em> normal. Normal to me is still what i've experienced for 25 years of my life. And I can't wait to return to that.</p>

<p>So then masks were normal, and still are btw</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're vaccinated, you can stop wearing them. If you're not, don't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many states have, but a lot of these states dont have many vaccinated, like Texas. They're essentially fucking backwards. And just because many states got rid of their mandates doesn't mean people stopped wearing facemasks. Unlike you sociopaths, everyone else do not need a legal reason to wear a mask. We have this amazing thing called empathy (it's when you put yourself in others' shoes). We also don't wanna die a slow, agonizing, painful death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gauging? Do you mean gagging? You're so full of shit. I've been wearing mine since the start, so has the rest of my family, friends, and classmates. None of us have gagged on them. In fact, I'm positive no one has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, what's normal to you isn't normal. Know why? Because the majority aren't doing that. Doesn't matter if it's normal to you, you're still not normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, because of you jackasses, we won't be able to return to that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So why is it that you guys are this fucking stupid?
Do you not know how to vet sources? Do you not know what a credible source is? Do you just not know how to do actual research?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like, what is it? You and I have access to the same information, yet you still live in fucking lala land.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you're vaccinated, you can stop wearing them. If you're not, don't.</p>
<p>How exactly are you going to verify who is and isn't vaccinated? Lol. I'll stop wearing it regardless. </p>
<p>&rt; Unlike you sociopaths, everyone else do not need a legal reason to wear a mask.</p>

<p>&rt; Like, what is it? You and I have access to the same information, yet you still live in fucking lala land.</p>
<p>Yeah sorry to disappoint, but I actually have done my research. And have sought information from legitimate sources. But you seem to just be here to throw a tantrum that people think differently than you so i'm not sure it's worth even bringing them up.</p>
<p>Anyways, there's a difference between normal and abnormal. Considering we're in a pandemic, these are abnormal times where were taking abnormal precautions until we get back to the normal that's been the norm since, you know, the dawn of man. </p>
<p>'Normal' is not treating everyone else like they're virus ridden plebs to the point where we can't even hug anyone. If that's the normal you want, then keep doing you. But the rest of us will happily look forward to true normal. And yes, we will return to that. Seems like you want to stay in this weird abnormal new normal for some weird reason. Whew, couldn't be me!</p>

        <p>If you haven't read it, I'd highly recommend "Weapons of Math Destruction". I would certainly class Ferguson's model (and a lot of other models that have been made over the last year) as highly dangerous models. I believe that poor statistical/mathematical literacy has played a huge role in the "pandemic". While some people may dismiss this as irrelevant or unimportant to the main points of restriction to freedom of movement, my body my choice etc (which I also feel very strongly about), I think it's vital that everybody understands the extent to which data science has controlled (and will control) our daily lives. Just wait for the vax passports to come out to see an example of data science being used for evil rather than good. Just wait until some inscrutable black box of "machine learning" decides you are a dangerous health risk and cannot be allowed to go somewhere because the model says so. This isn't another "AI is taking over the world" panic post. The computers aren't the problem. The people using them are.</p>

        <p>It's been a combination of poor mathematical literacy and the "cult of credentialism." People think that because people in academia or government positions have a Ph.D. or an M.D., everything those highly credentialed people say must be true. Ferguson has been a crackpot for years with models wildly overestimating epidemic spread, but people took his 2.2 million figure as gospel because of his degree and his position.</p>

        <p>i managed to make it all this way but now i'm a lead in a play, and the director is batshit crazy. I have to either get vaccinated or perform in a mask, and i don't know what to do. I've always wanted this role, but not at the expense of compromising my health. </p>

        <p>I work in a tax office in our county’s courthouse. I collect business license and payroll taxes. I am only required to wear a mask when a taxpayer comes into our office to file taxes, register a business, etc. We keep our office door locked because our office is walk-in style; we are not separated from the outside. We also spray everything that any taxpayer touches with Lysol when they leave. I think that’s overkill, but that’s another story. Yesterday, our Judge Executive, the highest ranking position in our county, signed an executive order rescinding the mask mandate for the courthouse, which basically means no one has to wear a mask inside the courthouse anymore. However, my boss sent us an email this morning saying that she is not going to listen to the Judge and we are still going to keep on doing the exact same procedures I mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, my sister, who works in the County Clerk’s office (which is similar to a DMV) doesn’t have to wear one when dealing with the public. I don’t know what any other departments in the courthouse are doing.</p>
<p>For the last few months, I have grown more and more sick and tired about mask-wearing, like many of you on this sub already are. I have also thought numerous times about quitting my job, not only because I’m not a fan of taxes in the slightest bit, but also because of the pro-new normal atmosphere of my office. I work in close proximity with four other women, all of whom are fully vaxxed (I am not vaxxed and have no desire to be). One of these women really confuses me: she wears one of those big thick masks that liberals like to wear (although not all day) and frequently uses hand sanitizer, and is a mask nazi that is triggered by noses, yet she expressed sympathy for Rush Limbaugh’s death a few months ago. I highly doubt anyone who is sympathetic for Rush Limbaugh would be as attracted to masks as she is. She is also responsible for about 90% of all the problems I have in the workplace.</p>
<p>But now that my boss is still wanting to continue the same charade that we have been doing for the past year when it comes to dealing with the public, this may be my breaking point. I’d really like to quit, but at the same time I don’t want to seem like an unemployed slob to everyone, including my parents, and I don’t want to run out of money, either. I’d still like to have a source of income that doesn’t require complying with Covid theater and where I can still have weekends and holidays off.</p>

        <p>I just read the stupidiest comment section ever about side effects. Basically, someone commented: "The UK reported 650681 side effects from Astra Zeneca vaccine and 786 deaths. Go check the info for yourself, it's in the government's website".</p>
<p>A bunch of people answered: "GO AWAY CONSPIRANCY THEORY YOU ARE KILLING GRANDMA!!1!!1!!!!!! FAKE NEWS!!!".</p>
<p>So, I obviously went to the UK's website and ... THE GUY IS RIGHT. I can't believe people just don't know how to Google or how to download a pdf!</p>
<p>Come on, if almost a million side effects and almost 1000 deaths isn't enough, I don't know what it is. And this is only the REPORTED side effects/deaths. Can't even think about what the real number is. This shit it fucked.</p>

<p>I am 100% sure that even posting the link from the FUCKING OFFICIAL UK'S GOVERNMENT WEBSITE I would be permabanned from all the official Covid subs for reporting this.</p>

        <p>Interested to hear what predictions everyone has for the rest of this year. I honestly don't even fucking know anymore but I'm a cynical bastard so I'm banking on restrictions staying in place to some effect (in the UK). Supposed to be having our wedding in October (got legally married earlier this year) and I'm honestly finding it hard to get motivated at all to do anything planning-wise because I'm convinced the barrel of cocks that make up our government are going to turn around and fuck us again over some scariant or "rise in cases".</p>
<p>I'm also worried a bunch of the vaccinated are going to mysteriously start dying off during winter and it's going to be blamed on us. What do you all think is coming next?</p>

        <p>This is biological warfare. Predictions IMHO:
1. Rise in adverse reaction events to Vaccines. Summer/fall 2021
2. Secondary events possibly including shedding, AIDS in the vaccinated, 2022
3. further health crisis including lockdowns... This time isolating the vaccinated / or all as precaution 2022
4. Zombieland... ? 2023
5. Rebirth of humanity (the great awakening) 2024/2025

        <p>It's clear they can't keep most restrictions going during summer when the virus is mostly dorment and despite any PCR positives they might find hospitals will be empty. I assume they'll try to keep some form of mask mendate because it doesn't "cost" anything along with silly restrictions on large events. They'll praise the vaccines for the dormant summer season and with the next winter spike there will be lots of talk about new mutations and the low vaccination rate to explain the lack of efficiency of the vaccines. That along with another lockdown or a lighter version. Obviously the spike next winter will be really tame in terms of severe cases and deaths as it's the third round for most regions but with uncertainty of new mutations and PCR tests picking up lots on non-cases they'll have enough reasons to play it safe. </p>

        <p>Cytokine storm is caused by a dysfunctional immune sustem (part of the reason obese people are more likely to have worse outcomes). Previous exposure to the virus or it's spike proteins likely won't increase the chance of a cytokine storm and might reduce the likelihood.</p>
<p>I personally don't suspect the vaccines are dangerous besides the damage the spike proteins cause (which can lead to significant problems but they would show immediately) and them possibly driving viral mutation. I mainly think they are an enormous waste of money and should only be given to those at risk similar to the flu shot. Vaccinating the entire population (twice) is just a huge pharma scam. Obviously only time will tell who is right or wrong here. I've been wrong before.</p>

<p>Basically that, my guy.</p>
<p>I'm in a place (in the USA, mind you) where the fanaticism is so great, that angry mobs roaming around, hunting down "anti-vaxxers" is a very real possibility in such an event. That is of course, assuming our state dictator doesn't declare martial law and have the NG do it.</p>

        <p>Idk about that but I'm sure a lot of people started freaking out after they stopped using the AZ shots in Ontario.</p>
<p>And now I'm reading that they are mixing up the shots so people are freaking out thinking they might still be getting the AZ shots.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to come here and say that I was just in Target where masks aren't required and it was GLORIOUS! Being Minnesota, I figured most people would still be wearing masks, but it was really only about 50% and of that group, most were elderly. </p>
<p>On Monday I noticed Subway didn't have the sign on the door, so I didn't put my mask on. Everyone that came in behind me did, though.  (I have to add that I do like that the people preparing my food have a mask on - does that make me a doomer? lol)</p>

        <p>I'm not an anti-masker but Jesus Christ I do miss my fucking freedom. I'm fully vaccinated and I follow the mask rule 24/7 but to no avail my province (Nova Scotia) is still in a lockdown and will be for the next month or so. 
I AM going insane.
I want to see my family members, I want to travel. At this point there is no fighting this virus with lockdown and masks. Without vaccines the cases will keep rising after the lockdown is lifted, cases will shoot back up then they will put us in another lock down for god knows how long.
Why the hell is every other place in the world lifting the restrictions except for NS?
I feel like the premier and Dr Strang are acting like over protective parents.</p>

<p>No hate, but this just isn't true (well, the part about cases shooting up - the Canadian government going for another lockdown could easily be true). Depending on what you mean by "lockdown," many places lifted their lockdown measures before vaccines were available or widely distributed with no rise in cases relative to places that continued lockdown measures. See r/LockdownSkepticism for more on this.</p>

        <p>We need to focus on moving on and NOT respond to pro vaccine or trolls in this sub. Maybe everyone already said that. But they are just a distraction and mostly have ill intent to disrupt and cause trouble. I'm guilty I will admit but plan to just downvote and move on</p>

        <p>Last night I went to a bar for the first time since lock down with my husband and two friends, I saw my sister while out and went to say hello but was told that if I said hello to my sister I would have to leave. So I just waved from a distance and it was fucking awful not being able to speak to her. Then we was asked to sit outside to which there were 3 chairs at our table but there was 4 of us there, this meant that my husband had to stand. The staff came over and said that he had to sit on his own at another table as you are no longer alloud to stand outside.</p>
<p>At this point I slammed my drink ont the table and called the staff member a communist cunt and stormed off. My friends are really embarrassed with my behaviour but at that point I was just so fed up. I just can't take this shit anymore.</p>

        <p>What's so unbelievable about it? I'm not very proud of it but I've told grocery employees to fuck off and left the establishment and my cart when they harassed me about mask wearing. Some places are honestly insane about it.</p>
<p>If you're curious, one time I was just fiddling with my mask and glasses in an attempt to defog them since I couldn't see. The other time I had the mask completely on my nose and was told to pull it up more. Unfortunately some of these miserable cunts just get off on that shit.</p>

        <p>Please help. I’m trying to figure out what to do here. My state just lifted their mask mandate for everyone June 2. My workplace (retail store) just said vaccinated employees don’t have to wear masks anymore a couple days after saying that they were going to make us all continue wearing masks “for your safety”. I’m in a bit of a dilemma because I KNOW they can’t ask me and I KNOW they don’t do anything, but myself and other employees think they are just trying to see how many of us are vaccinated currently. I’m relatively new so I don’t want to rock the boat but if we’re not badgering customers and enforcing it for them, why does it matter if I’m vaccinated or not? They’ve tried guilting/pressuring us into getting the vaccine and the store manager has even gone around and asked employees if they’ve gotten it and if they haven’t, he badgers them asking them why not... </p>
<p>So do I “protest” by taking the mask off or “protest” by keeping it on? Lol</p>

        <p>This is possibly the worst course of action you could take. HR doesn't care whatsoever about your privacy or medical freedom unless whatever violates those things also opens the company up to legal action - plausible, threatening legal action, not PastaBod taking them to small claims court.</p>
<p>HR is not your friend.</p>

        <p>From what I understand the longer the programming the deeper the problem.. Also age plays a factor. Children are much more malleable and resilient, adults much less for both programming and deprogramming. (Wife has background in mental health/trauma).</p>

If THAT time-period doesn't result in a truly epic death-wave, I'll re-assess to some extent but still hold-off because I'm not really sure how long it'll take for the prions to eat through enough of people's brains to turn them into zombies.

        <p>Here’s what’s going to happen….The vaccine will create a variant and start killing the vaccinated. And they will blame the unvaccinated, saying it was our fault that the variant happened, and that’s why all these people are dying. Then they’ll round up all the anti-vaxxers and take them to “quarantine camps” or whatever they’ll call them. To protect the rest of the world from the variant.</p>

        <p>Just level with them. They ask you if you're vaccinated, say no.  They ask why, explain how the whole thing is a big hoax put in place by the elites to control humanity and reduce the population.  If they aren't total brainwashed sheep, they'll understand.</p>

        <p>Sorry to break it for you, but due to the covalent bonds and electron config of iron in Hemoglobin there’s no way for your iron to be magnetic. Therefore no, if there is magnetism, it’s of another origin.</p>

        <p>False, it was found that hemoglobin actually had magnetic properties whether or not it was carrying oxygen(the BOLD signal effect). When it’s not carrying oxygen it becomes more paramagnetic than oxygenated blood. Normally, the iron in your blood doesn’t respond to magnets because it’s broken up into very small quantities in your blood, but like I said, from a concentration it is quite possible for the magnet to stick to the area of concentration. As for the electron configuration of iron in hemoglobin, there are 4 unpaired electrons which gives it it’s ferromagnetic properties.</p>

        <p>Dude, insignificantly paramagnetic is considered non-magnetic. If blood would be magnetic enough, you would not be able to use MRT devices without being ripped apart or suffering irreversible damage. Plus plasma is diamagnetic and represents a much bigger percentage in mass than hemoglobin. Therefore forget about, your point doesn’t sustain. The videos are either fake, which I tend to support or there’s another effect underlying.</p>

        <p>My Osteopath (young and fit, mid 30s) just told me that she is having severe side effects after her second dose (UK, so probably Oxford or Pfizer).</p>
<p>She has been suffering tremors, neurological symptoms and I could tell she was feeling week in general. She also told me that she wouldn't have had the jab if it wasn't for the preassure of the clinic and her job.</p>
<p>I have had Covid and then long covid so I can tell that those weird symptoms are like long covid itself. The funny (!) part of it that doctors have <strong>NO IDEA</strong> why or what is triggering neurological symptoms in some long covid cases. Neither they know why some people have them as a jab side effect.</p>
<p>So, basically if you have neurological symptoms after Covid or the jab, the Science TM has no answers neither treatment for you.</p>

        <p>I’m tired of everything. I’m kinda happy to be a conspiracy theorist like the rest of y’all but I read into everything and get paranoid af. I’m sure it’s legit, because we’re fucking living it, but I’m tired of it all. I’m tired of being scared, I’m tired of being controlled, I’m tired of covid this and covid that, masks, vaccines, vaccines, masks. I’m tired of this crazy fucked up world. I know I have my coworkers and the rest of you crazy fuckers but fuck, I’m scared. I know all I have to do is basically throw my phone in the ocean but at the same time I’m addicted to it lmao. We all hate the “we’re all in this together” bullshit, because it’s an overused phrase to get us to comply with the covid shit, but in our case I kinda believe it because we’re levelheaded and most of us have since the beginning. We actually see through this bullshit. It’s scary af but at least we’ll be somewhat prepared for it. Just leave me alone with my gun and ammo stock and I’ll be ok lmao. I know these restrictions are magically lifting after a year of telling everybody that this is all planned political bullshit, but it’s sad that the first plan was that only vaccinated people were rewarded and now it’s basically everybody gets to do whatever they want so <em>yay!</em> 😒😒😒😒</p>

        <p>So I'm an outsider looking in on this sub, very much disagree with 99% of the views expressed here.</p>
<p>But there's no denying the last couple of years has been rough on EVERYONE.  While I largely agree with the lockdowns and social distancing, there's no denying that it has come at a great cost to our collective mental health.  Humans are inherently social creatures.  You may want to consider talking to a therapist, or re-connect with family and friends.  Reddit isn't a sufficient substitute for real human contact.</p>
<p>And to be honest, I am a bit confused on the last part.  I think society returning to normal is a good thing for everyone.  Isn't "everybody gets to do whatever they want" basically the foundational thesis/argument this sub is founded upon?</p>

        <p>I was just mocking the fact that we’ve been wanting things to be left alone this whole time but the government’s been denying everything and continuing restrictions until recently. Like they’re suddenly the good guys. Lol</p>

        <p>But to me it seems like you've setup an impossible scenario for government officials.  You disagree with them putting restrictions in place, but then also disagree when restrictions are lifted?</p>
<p>In my opinion, it's only logical that as immunization numbers rise, restrictions should recede.  This is movement in the correct direction as far as I'm concerned.  I think there's large parts of the population that will never get vaccinated no matter what the government does.  We can't stay locked down forever waiting for a thing that will never happen.</p>

        <p>"30 years of hard science" (yeah right) with nothing to show but unsuccessful attempt after unsuccessful attempt. Wouldn't these vaccines already be the standard if they were so "safe" and "effective".</p>
<p>And it's always so funny to me when random ass people like you comment saying "erm its perfectly safe". Why the fuck would anyone here take your word for it? Are you special or something? As if a random reddit comment is going to make someone decide "gee well this stranger said it was safe so I guess it is". I hope one day you can break free from your delusion.</p>

        <p>Name one fully fda approved mRNA vaccine - Pfizer and moderna aren’t fda approved. Cant? Link one study that looks at the Pfizer or moderna vaccine’s effects over the course of a year. Cant? Well neither can we, we just don’t rush headlong into the unknown for something so barely threatening for most people... Ok, so can you at least tell me you read the EUA applications for either of the two of them and still determined they were “perfectly safe” ... because if you did read them you would know they are not “perfectly safe” and they carry risk just like all vaccines ...</p>

        <p>Admittedly I haven't been following this aspect, so maybe somebody has already thought to do this - but the easiest way to demonstrate the effect (which this lady was close to doing with the bracelet), would be to tie a magnet on a string and suspend it near the arm. The movement of the magnet (and deflection of the string) toward the injection site would be very obvious that way.</p>
<p>I would just find it hard to believe there'd be enough magnetic material in a single injection, to make it happen. A single shot is just 0.3mL, right?</p>

        <p>This makes sense though.  Menstrual cycles are often affected by the other women you spend time with and there is a lot of indications that the vaccines are disrupting women's cycles so it seems more likely to be that v. "shedding".</p>

        <p>From what I can assess (and my wife had huge concerns about this), shedding isn't verified yet. I believe the vaccinated will only spread the 'problem' (spike proteins) via body fluids; essential this is a massive AIDS crisis in the making. There's still a lot of missinformation and unknowns as this is still an experimental clinical trial.</p>

        <p>Went into a store without a mask for the first time in a year today and it felt amazing. I live in a super liberal state so I was expecting to be one of the few not wearing one but there was quite a few which was a nice surprise, there was even a lady around my age who gave me a big smile. It was really nice to actually see people's faces again, hopefully soon my job will drop the mandate soon so I can ditch the masks for good</p>

        <p>Would it be possible to start a thread of the testing done on the vaccines that we KNOW of? </p>
<p>I mean, we all know they’re emergency approved. Pending (?) full approval. </p>
<p>I understand what that means to an extent but am cloudy on some parts. Like what steps qualify full approval? Are we waiting on dosing results months down the road? What kind of tests <em>have</em> been done and where are those numbers? </p>
<p>I want to make data available and would like to form an opinion. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>

        <p>That is very Orwellian. Wow, I only need this random mRNA modifying substance in my body and then I may get within 6 feet of my friends and live without muzzle? Thanks.

        <p>J&amp;J was being seen as the dodgy one but I'm wondering if it was just because of some viral advertising by Pfizer/Moderna.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the non mRNA ones would seem a lot safer.  Who knows though.</p>

<p>This is what I have found too. If I end up having to get it due to my job (I've been with my employer for years and have a lot invested...) I'll get that one but I'm going to try to get the letter due to my "sincerely held religious beliefs" that I'll have to explain that I have.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know of any well researched theories (by our side lol) as to what is actually in the vaccine?</p>
<p>I was talking about the vaccines with a friend the other day. My thinking was what if the vaccine could mutate genes/chromosomes to somehow make you more prone to “control” (somehow lower testosterone or mess with hormones) and then you could pass on these genes potentially ruining your entire blood line with the mystery vaccine.</p>
<p>This is just my quick hypothesis. TLDR: vaccine could degrade “alpha” genes into “beta” genes. Now all your offsprings grow up to be beta men and beta women, and so on.</p>

        <p>It's a good question, and a job for abductive reasoning (given the near-impossibility of any well-funded reverse engineering effort, to prove independently what the payload of the vaccines are. For starters you'd need samples from across the world, to even prove that the same ingredients are being used everywhere. What if India is receiving a completely different product, for example?)</p>
<p>I won't post my reasoning here because this weekly thread gets more attention from trolls than the membership proper. A shame, but I guess the mods are too busy with all the usual posts to spend much time here.</p>

        <p>How much would it take to do at least just a basic sanity check on the contents of the vaccine? Couldn't you just send it as a sample for high throughput sequencing, which is not that expensive, and then just see that it contains the advertised S-protein coding mRNA? I guess there may be some messy details involved in preparing the sample, since the vaccine contents are not stable. And I'm not sure you can get mRNA sequenced? So I'm not sure how hard it would be to get the mRNA transcribed into protein, or reverse translated or whatever it's called, to DNA. I imagine maybe just buying some enzymes and pipetting some shit together.</p>

        <p>No...the vaccine is a mRNA vaccine which means it will teach your cells how to make a protein which will trigger an immune response without using the live Covid virus, it’s honestly safer than the regular vaccine. It won’t mutate your genes or chromosomes, it doesn’t even affect your genes that’s a DNA virus which we aren’t using.</p>

        <p>Let me assume that you're correct here even though I don't think you are. </p>
<p>My next question would be.....</p>
<p>Could you please produce a clear data driven cost benefit analysis for these lockdown decisions showing that the damage they avoided is much greater than the damage they caused. So much greater in fact, that it would be demonstrably justified in violating the Charter Rights of Millions of Canadians. Also, why hasn't any government on the planet produced any such kind of report? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

        <p>Texas is a bunch of huge, liberal cities, all of which are at or over 50% vaccinations, and then a bunch of small, podunk towns where spread isn't a huge concern. Put 2 and 2 together. The places with all the people in them are vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Rule 3 states that this is an inclusive community. How can it be inclusive if there are posts that form a political agenda? We have people who have different views here and you can not be “inclusive” if there are posts that conflict with the values of users on this subreddit. Its pretty annoying trying to flip through posts trashing “the left” when you’re just trying to find others with the same mindset when referring to COVID related perspectives.</p>

        <p>There are still a lot of liberals here in spite of conservative tilt.  We don't allow political posts that aren't connected to covid buy it would be better if people at least dialed back the derogatory stuff like "libtard" too.</p>
<p>It would be more productive to criticize policy v the people as well.</p>

        <p>Let me get this straight. Different viewpoints make you feel unwelcome. What does that say about you? What would a solution look like and accomplish? How far should we go in limiting speech to make people feel welcome? Do you think there might be a solution on a personal level, namely the person not feeling welcome due to presence of differing viewpoints, that would pose a better solution to the problem?</p>

        <p>There's actually a few here, each of which seem to be legitimate beliefs held by many members of this sub. I have seen separate groups of users arguing that vaccines do indeed contain microchips, that they do, in fact, result in magnetic vaccination sites, etc. That they result in deformity and alteration of DNA. You guys are pretty nuts.</p>

        <p>Just because this sub allows discussion of more esoteric theories doesn't mean they are supported by the majority of the sub. I personally think it's highly unlikely that the vaccine is a ploy to implant chips or sterilise society but that doesn't mean I don't want people to be able to discuss the possibility and I can't exactly prove without doubt that they are wrong.</p>
<p>Making a strawman out of a couple of the wilder statements found on this sub and using it to dismiss the main arguments is just lazy.</p>

        <p>Now I see why you didn't link them, it's because they all have less than 10 upvotes, some are even at 0 or below. Most are full of comments explaining why OP is wrong.</p>
<p>Obviously, they don't represent the subreddit. You are taking a tiny tiny minority of this subreddit, and trying to use that to argue that this whole subreddit is, in your words, "nuts". That's blatantly dishonest.</p>

        <p>Ah, you’re forecasting if we do nothing. I mis- interpreted. </p>
<p>I don’t care for your forecasts, doom and gloom. I’m looking for evidence here and now as to why we need this shot ASAP. Because a 99.9% survival rate -until we get something fully tested, analyzed and verified- seems like a pretty good reason why we don’t. Take care.</p>

        <p>Well because we know what the mortality rate is and more importantly the rate of people who will need hospitalization in order to keep that mortality rate at the currently observed level. Idk why I'm explaining this shit it should be obvious by now and it's not speculation it's basic math. Unabated the disease would have overwhelmed the healthcare system and then basically we would have more than 7 million dead because that mortality rate is where it is at because the appropriate medical services were available. </p>
<p>I guess you could make the argument with 60% of adults immunized you could rework the math and say it wouldn't have the same affect and I guess you would be right but you would also be leaving a gigantic host reserve for the disease to ping pong around and mutate just resurface later if and when immunity wares off.</p>
<p>In any case the vaccine isn't gonna hurt you and you aren't some hero for avoiding it and if they are trying to create an underclass with a vaccine well then I guess you'll just have to get your shot so they let you out of the gulag. At least it's a little easier than changing your ethnicity...</p>

        <p>It is how this all started. They said that we just needed to wear masks and "social" distance for 2 weeks and then this would all be over. We are now more than a year in and still counting, and there are more restrictions than there were during the first 2 weeks of the "2 weeks to flatten the curve".</p>

<p>Also, I doubt that many people here want to "pet" human cattle like you. Literal cattle can be fun, but human cattle is just sad.</p>

        <p>Not allowed to travel, curfew, not allowed to meet other people, forced to wear a muzzle, not allowed to run a physical business; this is Orwellian.

        <p>Oh, I don't think this is normal, but it's not Orwellian. This is Same Shit, Different Day with pandemics. The Spanish Flu caused the same shit to happen back in the turn of the 20th century.
