        <p>I remember these. </p>
<p>And I remember people rejecting them very violently. I've said this multiple times in these subs, but many experts came forward even back in March, with evidence that the virus was simply not the threat people were making it out to be. And nobody listened or cared.</p>
<p>If anything, things have worsened since then. The calls for more lockdowns and restrictions continue. It doesn't seem like anything except <em>maybe</em> the vaccine will sway the panicked masses right now.</p>

        <p>Said vaccine is the point, "stay locked down until vaccine"! But what the misguided proponents don't understand is that no vaccine is a panacea, especially not this one. And even if it was, it takes a long time to actually get it to everybody. And even if it didn't, the precedent of indefinitely suppressing all personal freedom and civil liberties to "fight a disease" has been set. So, uh...</p>

        <p>Sometimes I feel like the situation is hopeless, but then I remember that at least this time 50% of the population doesn't buy this bullshit. 9/11 everyone bought it hook line and sinker and it was a decade before a sizeable percentage of people started doubting the official narrative. With this covid fiasco, at least we have half the population questioning it right from the start. So maybe they will not be able to keep up the charade on this one for very long. Maybe this time the false narrative will be massively exposed and they won't be able to get away with it.</p>

        <p>I want to believe it is at least 50% because there is clearly a partisan divide. But I just came across a video that made me lose some faith in that high of a percentage. Apparently, there's a woman who is a virologist in China who claims to be a whistleblower and defector. Fox News showed the video, and the comments are really disappointing. It's like people have no critical thinking skills at all anymore. These are people I expected are against lockdowns and the other dystopian crap, people I thought knew that the virus has a very low mortality and the higher mortality rate only skews towards infirm and elderly people. People I thought understood that the reaction to this virus was not only overblown, but insane. But nope...there they are with complete cognitive dissonance. They are praising that woman as hero when she's saying the most absurd bullshit that sounds like it could come directly from CNN and the rest of the fearmongering liberal media. She is literally on there saying that she wants people to know how dangerous this virus is and that it's a threat to the survival of the human race. What in the actual hell? Right away, you can tell she is full of shit and is an obvious CCP disinfo agent posing as a defector to gain Western trust...but there are hundreds of idiots believing here and not realizing they are looking at a wolf in sheep's clothing.</p>

        <p>I feel that the left/right divide is largely arbitrary and/or artificial. Our values and ideals are too nuanced, at least in our natural state, for the same reason we come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors: Earth is a diverse planet and we require many different adaptations to survive. This isn't some "diversity" virtue-signalling, this is evident in how easily clones and monocrops are wiped out by disease. Their immune systems, and thus their weaknesses, are the same. Same basic principle applies to values and ideals. Different problems, different priorities.</p>
<p>The partisan hard-liners weren't born that way. They were created. And I would argue that most don't actually believe whatever bullshit they claim to believe, like the Chinese "defector" on Fox News, but it doesn't really matter. After a certain point, it's like dealing with a literal zombie: whether the individual is still "there" deep down is irrelevant because they're too dangerous to reach out to. And needless to say, they're dangerous for society as a whole. Aside from the obvious risks to individual security, privacy, liberty, etc....collectivism - whether one party or a whole whopping two - actually puts us at risk of extinction by limiting our ability to evolve and adapt to various threats. The same way being too genetically similar is unhealthy and unsafe. In a way, collectivism could be considered a sort of sociocultural incest.</p>
<p>If there are two sides in this battle, it isn't left versus right or even socialism versus capitalism. More like authoritarian vs libertarian,  collectivism vs individualism, centralization vs decentralization, accelerated extinction via one-size-fits-all policies forced upon millions of people vs allowing individuals, families, and local communities to enact policies tailored to their particular wants and needs. The "dumb" conservatives could be considered the true progressives in that our "selfish" individualism provides us with the real diversity necessary to survive diverse situations. Of course there are authoritarian conservatives, and those who resist change to the point of failing to adapt, but those examples are why I find the liberal/conservative dichotomy somewhat tenuous. Both parties are boots in a set, and this stomping of the people into homogenous goo is the real threat to the human race.</p>
<p>Same with the various "rival" news channels, like Fox News and CNN: just advertising different boots of the same set. I'd say they're all wolves in sheeps' clothing, but that's an insult to actual wolves and sheep, both majestic animals in their own right. It doesn't surprise me at all that Fox News would follow the lead of CNN, especially during such a convenient "crisis" as this fairly mild pandemic. Both companies are sponsored by millionaires and billionaires corrupted by power and looking to further consolidate that power. Likewise, I find it hard to believe that the US elites and Chinese elites are truly at odds. They both have too much to gain by working together to fuck over their citizens.</p>

        <p>I'm on the fence about who was at fault for 9/11, but I will say this: The folks who believe no one died and 2000 people just disappeared are why no one takes "conspiracy theorists" seriously.</p>

        <p>Look for the press conference from (FEMA?) on why building 7 collapsed. Supposedly a fire in a corner of the third floor of a what, 50 story building.</p>
<p>Then watch the video of the collapse again.</p>
<p>Then search your memory for whether you've ever heard of a high-rise building collapsing completely from a fire, any fire (there's some good yootube videos of high-rise fires). </p>
<p>Never, the answer is never.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself, when was the last time three buildings in one day did that. Never, the answer is also never.</p>

        <p>The only way a "lockdown" would work is if everyone stayed at home, indefinitely, until everyone died.</p>
<p>Do a little reading about how viruses work. They have known and predictable behaviors, and this one is acting just like every other one.</p>
<p>You could stay home for a decade, go outside and catch a virus.</p>
