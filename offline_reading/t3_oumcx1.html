    <strong>With all the rumors of impending lockdowns across the US in the next month...</strong>
    <p><p>I think it would be a good idea to find a way for NNN to act as a resource for means of surviving while refusing to comply with their demands. The first thing that comes to mind is a post/site where we can add to a list of businesses that don't enforce mask/jab mandates. As an online community, we could help each other know where to shop, eat, etc. in our local communities.</p>
<p>Of course we could all continue to walk into our nearest big box store unmasked to buy our groceries, but I just think of how long I can get away with it before some major confrontation finally happens. Last year I was resistant to it the whole time, but would usually comply with putting on a face diaper instead of getting kicked out. This time, I refuse to back down under any circumstances. With the threat of forced vaccination, this isn't a joke anymore.</p>
<p>One of the reasons these elites have power over us is because in our modern world, like-minded "problematic" people like us don't have the infrastructure or organization to really bring the fight to them since we generally don't live in localized neighborhoods/communities. Think about it, how many of you can truly say you know more than a few of your neighbors, much less rely on them for support against tyranny? Compared to previous generations, its pitiful how disconnected we've become. So finding a way for us to help support the local businesses that are brave enough to not comply with mandates is a mutual relationship that could help both the consumer and the small businessperson have a route to freedom. </p>
<p>Feel free to share any other ideas you might have. This is just the most important one I can think of.</p></p>

        <p>they are basing this whole new string of lock downs on a Indian study using a vaccine the us doesn't use. and it was peer reviewed and rejected. The lengths they will go to are disgusting.</p>
<p>the CDC should be investigated</p>

        <p>Problem is, anything that could have the means to investigate it are just as corrupt! We the people using nothing but our own resources is all that stands in the way of their absolute tyranny</p>

        <p>I hear this sentiment being echoed by folks who complied the first time around. Enough is enough and no oversight committee or government agency can be trusted at this point, it's up to We the People to do something about it.</p>
