<title>UK friends. Any live streams out there or planned streams where I can watch people deliberately disobeying the lockdown orders? I’m just a dumb curious American and want to watch how the police handle stuff out there.</title>

        <p>Thanks for these!</p>
<p>That Sainsbury's video is so disgusting on so many levels I'm not sure where to even start</p>
<p>There is NO SUCH THING as 'an exemption certificate' for the pig to even follow up on</p>
<p>All that manpower for one guy who was actually in the right over everything he said - it truly is like talking to NPC's</p>
<p>Oh and <em>how many times</em> did Billy Big-Balls and Blondie fiddle with their masks?</p>
<p>We are supposed to 'respect' these people - respect is earned and they have earned every ounce of vitriol that comes their way over this</p>
<p>Props to the guy remaining respectful and calm</p>
<p>Scary thing, this is Sainsbury's and from what my mum tells me (I'm stuck with Tesco) they are v relaxed over people not wearing masks, they remind people over the tannoy that many disabilities and conditions are invisible and to be respectful of those not wearing a mask for that reason (ironically you actually hear it in the video!)</p>

        <p>Same here, I've not been asked once in shops (not that I go much but even so)...my son goes most nights and since March he's only been asked 3 times...he just says "I'm exempt" end of discussion</p>
<p>This cop wouldn't back down, even with the evidence shown to him he was wrong!</p>
<p>Definite power trip - bullied at school with no friends is my guess, lol</p>
