    <strong>I will never judge someone for getting or not getting the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>That’s been the weirdest part of this entire year. Personally, I really don’t care if you’re up to date on your vaccines. That is a personal choice, and especially for the series of Covid vaccines released for experimental usage, it’s a choice to make. </p>
<p>If you want to take the vaccine because you think it’ll make yourself and the people you care about safer, then you should have the choice to make it. I don’t think anyone should criticize you for that choice. </p>
<p>Same goes for the people who choose to not take the vaccine. It’s a choice for someone to make, and the government and these health institutions shouldn’t have to coerce you into a certain decision.</p>
<p>This is an experimental vaccine, with limited tested research, and only a year of development, for a virus that mutates frequently. A vaccine with this many flaws and gaps in research should be a choice.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just me (and the majority of this community), but I feel like there’s a lack of respect for other people’s differences. Choosing to get the vaccine doesn’t make you a mindless sheep, and not getting it doesn’t make you a neo-Nazi. What happened to stopping generalizations and stereotypes? </p>
<p>A lot of people (especially on the pro-lockdown side) like to look at the world as black and white, because it makes things so much easier. There’s no need to critically think when the world is divided clearly into right and wrong. However, these people (and this is to all the lurkers out there who dislike this subreddit) need to learn that an individual isn’t responsible for anyone else’s health except their own, and it has never been any other way. Just start respecting other people’s choices, and I’ll respect yours.</p></p>

        <p>I’ll say now what I’ve been saying since the start of it all. If you want to wear a mask, good. Wear one. If you don’t want to wear a mask, good. Don’t wear one. If you want to get a vaccine, good. Get it. If you don’t want to get a vaccine, good. Don’t get it. </p>

        <p>Yeah. If you don’t wanna wear a mask don’t. If you don’t wanna wear a seatbelt don’t. If you wanna drive drunk at 100 miles an hour through a. School zone do. It’s about civil liberties after all.</p>

        <p>You don’t know the difference between rights, civil liberties, and privileges do you? You know how there’s no amendment about driving? That’s because it’s not a right. Hence rendering it to much more scrutiny. We can have a discussion about limitations of rights and liberties if you’d like though</p>

        <p>I will judge people for getting the gene therapy (they are NOT and NEVER WILL BE vaccines) because we are already getting evidence that they are uniquely dangerous and no one should be risking their lives getting those gene therapies.</p>
<p>Blood clots, strokes, etc.</p>
<p>No: Take the risk of getting CoVid. If you are HEALTHY and not over the age of 50, your chance of dying from CoVid is extremely low.</p>
<p>If you are HEALTHY and OVER 50, your chance of dying from CoVid is low unless a stupid family member allows you to be put on a ventilator. Count me in that category of 'stupid family member' for allowing them to do that with my Mom.</p>

        <p>My condolences. I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>I saw a comment once that some patients were put on tranquilizers with the ventilator which is horrific. I wonder how often that happened and how much it contributed to the initial panic.</p>

        <p>I got the shot, but only cause of my job. I had a feeling that the military would start making it somewhat mandatory and, lo and behold, I already saw an example of that a few weeks ago. There was an opportunity to go to Spain for a temporary mission and what do you think the first caveat was? Yup. Had to have the shot. However, I’m not deluded enough to think that every last person in the world needs the shot or that forcing it on people is the right thing to do.</p>
