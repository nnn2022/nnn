    <strong>Anyone changed political stance from this? Opinion From An Expert Economist Nobody Ever Asked My Field Of "Experts" Why Lockdowns Were Extremely Stupid</strong>
    <p><p>I came into 2020 believing I was a democrat and now that 2020 is over I strongly dislike the entire party. Tons of people I know feel the same.</p>
<p>After seeing the hypocrisy of the democrats, especially with masks(Newsome, Pelosi, Pritzker, Cuomo, De Blasio) all being caught  blatantly and deliberately now following their own mask laws and then  shaming other people they lost any and all ounce of credibility they had. The democrat party as a whole is collapsing.</p>
<p><strong>All of their geographical areas they hold are collapsing.</strong> NYC, California, Oregon, Washington, Chicago, Denver, Austin TX, etc all being choked by lockdowns, high taxes, high homelessness, cost of living, Antifa riots and hard drugs. </p>
<p>I don't see how the party itself can reverse what they've set in motion they are not going to last. They've decided to take the stance of the totalitarian, which never wins in the end. No political party or group  in history was able to make it work. Which is why Hitler, Mussolini and  all those people ended up dead or in prison.</p>
<p>I believe wholeheartedly that the left will lose much more from this year than they gained, and altogether will fall apart from the decisions they've made this year. Losing whatever good will they had built up for decades and ultimately becoming the hated party. I think the collapse of their states and cities will prove most costly as they will have no strongholds anymore.  </p>
<p>In Battleship you remember how the goal of winning was not to neccesarily hit the opponent the most, but rather to hit critical parts of their ship to win? You could score 3 serious hits and win very quickly.  I'd say the left tanked their own economies to sell the Covid fear thing to get Trump out and go along with the Twitter mob, and that play was equivalent to them sinking their own massive battleship they had built up. </p>
<p>Conservative areas on the other hand cities have actually improved in many ways, although unemployment is an issue it still is FAR FAR better than liberal areas, and the people are happier which will go a long way to actually have a stable economy post 2020. <strong>Ultimately I think the left is done</strong>. What say you?</p></p>

        <p>I find the Republican party so distasteful I am not going to switch teams but I am completely disgusted with "my" side and how they have handled the pandemic.  My #1 beef is that the entire concept of "public health" went out the window only to be replaced by a lazer focus on virology. Public health is so, so much more than stopping the spread of infectious disease.</p>

        <p>Your beef with their focus on public health without consulting people like me or other experts is also my issue. Millions more have already died than Covid due to economic destruction. And millions more will still die long after this year from starvation, suicide, drug overdoses, child abuse, etc. The left and blue checkmark brigade on Twitter cares zero about people like this because it's not the virtue signal of the month. </p>
<p>Sometimes the enemy of your enemy becomes your friend. Just like Russia in WW2. We fought together because the Nazis and Imperial Japanese were such a big issue we needed to fight together. That's where I see the current left at. They are out of control and need to be stopped or freedom and America as we know it is done. You don't have to like the Republicans as a party(neither do I) , but voting for anyone no matter what letter is the next to their name, who supports freedom and the constitution is always a safe bet. </p>
<p>Thanks for the comment!</p>

        <p>I was a democrat turned libertarian in 2010 and now I'm actually curious about maybe joining the republican party. My values and beliefs still are more under libertarian but I'm fiscally conservative and what I see the democratic party doing is hurting this nation vs helping it.</p>

        <p>Same I voted straight R for the first time in my life. I have democrat friends that did the same. I think it truly was rigged because either there are millions who hate Biden but dislike trump even more or the system was absolutely rigged.</p>

        <p>💯 on both of your comments. Especially the ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ analogy. I didn’t think I’d be on the same side of the Trumpers but here we are. The Democrats have become exactly what they protested against the most - totalitarian dictators who rule by fear and eliminate all dissenting ideas.</p>

        <p>Exactly this. I hated Trump in 2016 and voted for Gary Johnson. I <em>still</em> think Trump is largely a boob who cannot get out of his own way. </p>
<p>But I still sure as hell voted Trump in 2020 after seeing what his opposition was: riots, censorship, cancel culture, and totalitarian techno-fascism. </p>
<p>I still want to know what Trump did that was so fascist, exactly. He said some mean things, overturned Obama's executive orders (many of which truly <em>were</em> fascist), and gave me a nice tax cut. Frankly, Trump sucks at fascisting, or the Democrats couldn't have cheated in 4 cities and stolen this election.</p>

        <p>The concept of actual public health went out the window long before COVID. Corporate executives and government officials on either side of the aisle have never really cared about us, still don't, and probably never will. The only difference between 2019 and 2020 is how quickly they turned up the the heat.</p>

<p>All these artificial taxonomies are just ways to corral people into herds, and it's certainly played a role in our path to here. I'm against voting, but if you must vote, be an issue-voter. That's responsible citizenry</p>

        <p>I don't know man. I feel so alienated and alone with all this, I hate the tribalism, I hate all of this. There's some things about the Republican party that are straight up repugnant to me and I can't put up with it. I also clearly can't put up with the lunacy of the democratic party either. It's just insanity all around and there's very little comfort or peace in just calling myself independent. I don't have a place in this madness.</p>

        <p>Remember you don't have to be a republican to be anti modern democrat. Think of it as a higher level. Above both parties. Pro freedom and pro Constitution. To me that is the apex of the potential of human society. Right now whatever we are living in is devolving back into the dark ages of the 12th century. The only answer is more freedom and less government and rules. Whatever side supports that is the side you are on for the time being.</p>

        <p>As someone who is starting over in a new state, and starting over making new friends, it's especially precarious because it can be so tribal. I try to be accommodating to everyone but it's like you have to tread carefully so as to not reveal your hand. Don't get me wrong I've made some good acquaintances with good people already, but there's always that fear that I'm talking to some freak who expects me to wear my beliefs on my sleeve and we have to be lock step in line with them. There was a lot more of that back in my home state (NY) but I'm still on guard.</p>

        <p>&rt;Ultimately I think the left is done-zo. They will try and censor more, and double down on their authoritarism next year, but people are getting tired of their stick and they are starting to sense it</p>
<p>Honestly I don't see it. I see people getting more and more comfortable with state control. And the state is more than happy to oblige.</p>

<p>Not sure where you live, but this definitely isn't the case in the majority of the country. People are MORE uncomfortable with state control and totalitarianism than ever before. Reddit and Social Media don't represent reality. Business owners, and entire industries are now fighting back. And winning in many cases. Big difference from where we were in June. I'm seeing politicians get barbequed on Twitter by the vast majority of people on both sides now. Huge difference from just a few months ago.</p>
