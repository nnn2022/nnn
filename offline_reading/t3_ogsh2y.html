    <strong>Why is the world so WERID right now??</strong>
    <p><p>What the fuck is going on in the world at the moment?
Things are NOT NORMAL.</p>
<p>The Q shit, year-long "lockdowns", the Capitol thing (that is being overblown), the odd election, the Arizona audit, the eternal "two more weeks" thing, the "virus", the political madness in Australia and Canada, the Taiwan shit, the price of GFX cards, FUCKING ALIENS AND UFOs DISCUSSED OPENLY IN THE NEWS, insane vaccine experimental hysteria and medical tyranny, "mask mandates," misreporting of news in national and international media (looking at the BBC with the thousands of thousands of people turning up to protests in London and them claiming it was a few hundred for an obvious example), Twitter bots on overload, national guard in D.C. for a solid 6 months straight with barbed wire fences, African politicians who have rationality and incredulity about vaccines and the virus who end dropping dead, an attempted coup in Venezeula, oil pipeline shenanigans, exploding oil pipelines; and now the fucking president of Haiti, a liberal democratic country not too far from the shores of the United States, is assassinated in cold fucking blood for no rhyme or reason by a team of foreign Goddamn mercenaries?</p>
<p>OKAY, someone tell me -WHAT- the --FUCK-- is going on. I have a very bad feeling in my gut. Something is very very very very bad and we're not being told about it. Is there some kind of shadow war going on between intelligence agencies or something? What is happening? What the Goddamn fuck is happening?!</p></p>

        <p>Boom. This sums it all up. "New normal" is simply rebranding of the Great Reset / Agenda 2030. They just had to use a different term because it would be easily identified by conspiracy theorists if they had went with the real name.</p>

        <p>There's ways something going on. You're just starting to pay attention. The Arab spring was worse. And there's always stuff going down in Africa. </p>
<p>Before the Arab spring there was internal wars in the ME and unrest in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries. By the way, the Baltics are the real paradise of this world.  </p>
<p>South America is probably more stable than it has ever been. </p>
<p>This shit never ends, and the good guys are not who you think they are.  Everything in books is bullshit that at best are narratives that try to fit into moral codes.  </p>
<p>The only real difference right now is that USA and western Europe have problems too.  Though those problems are small compared to elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree. I have never felt this way before but now im seeing increasingly disturbing articles that are pushing the vaccines way too hard to NOT make people suspicious. Before covid i legit wouldn't have thought twice about my government  and society screwing me over. I was ready to get vaccinated until my mom got clots right after her shots and i kept hearing story after story of friends, aquaintances, and other peoples horrible side effects and seeing article after article of bad reactions that werent just "i felt bad but got better" legit neurological issues and enflamed/enlargening of organs too. </p>
<p>And thats just the covid bs. I was absolutely baffled that i literally saw the government openly talk about ufos and no one even so much as batted an eye. The rest is just wood on the fire that has seemingly become of the world we live in.</p>
<p>Before 2020 I wouldnt have been here, before 2020 id have told you everything was fine but seeing my stance change like it has in such a short period of time really makes me think its not just me. Im legit fearful of the divide that im seeing in our fellow humans accross the globe right now and im honestly lost. So lost that im risking being banned from god knows how many sub reddits to try and relate to someone about these feelings instead of getting torn apart for having concerns and thoughts that dont go along with everyone else.</p>

        <p>Yes I also feel it. I cannot express it, therefore I'm so thankful for the intellectuals who can put it in words for me. I even feel estranged of people who don't feel that something extremely weird is going on. </p>
<p>Someone told me last year that in the UK they used the tools of NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming) to make the population follow the agenda. Does anyone know about that? That would explain why the brainwashing was so effective this time. I cannot even speak normally about these things with the people around me. That's why I came here. </p>
<p>But on your list up there, the Taiwan issue is the most scary. If that thing blows up, we are in full world war mode. It is unimaginable! But it always was like that, that's the world. Our generation in the West just had a really lucky 70 years of a peace streak. I think Steven Pinker said unprecedented lengths of peace. One day it must end. </p>
<p>I cannot believe I'm actually writing these lines. How quick it came.</p>

        <p>Agree, I really see the potential. I studied modern Chinese history, especially the Cultural revolution, lived in China, spoke with people about these times. Horrifying. Khmer Rouge, Stalin, etc. Full mind hack. And as a German I always struggled with the issue, how could they let that happen. But now I understand more and more, how the propaganda worked on the majority of Germans and the rest who saw through it, were in the same dilemma, we feel right now, I guess. Ousted, censored, fined, publicly shamed, denounced, labeled etc.</p>

        <p>We're only making ourselves mental. Some of this is growing pains as the world tries to evolve, but really just gets further from paradise. Ask yourself, why is there no vision of the future that is better than the present day. The world is, in a sense, in a depression. The visionaries have chosen the dream of the needle, hoping ersatz realities will suffice.</p>

        <p>The issue I have with this thinking is that Christians have been predicting “The End” times for two millennia now. Early Christians were thrown into complete chaos when these predictions didn’t come true. It’s way too easy for people to interpret everything around them as obvious confirmation of “The End.”</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that life for most of humanity has never been safer or richer, people are being drawn into some bizarre virtual reality where they’re unable to realize just how comfortable and safe things are now.</p>
<p>It’s more accurate to see all these predictions of the end of humanity as all the same - whether it’s global warming, the singularity, nuclear apocalypse or the second coming.</p>

        <p>I believe that religion like politics or is another way to divide and control the masses. Also I agree in someways that the world is safe I guess but it’s all relative. How are we safe really though? It’s kind of a false sense of security. People believe they are safe because no one is running in their house and killing them and raping their wife or whatever but the wealth it’s being stolen from the people putting more and more people into poverty all the time. The only thing that has changed is the way that people are being hurt so that is why people like you are willing to say that things are safe for now it’s because you’re getting fucked and you don’t even know it</p>

        <p>Nope, in the past it was baseless speculation because obviously the below has never been possible on a global scale before:</p>
<p>_
Revelations 13</p>
<p>16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
_</p>
<p>There has never been a period in history where this has been possible globally. And yet here we are,  for no rational reason, jamming through vaccine passports leading to this exact prophecy of people not being able able live a normal life or transact without either the vax, or a mark to come (Bill Gates patent no. 666):</p>

        <p>Yeah people disagree on who the antichrist is or will be. There's clues in the bible, one eye, no desire for women, etc. I do believe the Pope is most likely, office of papacy but these are things others can present arguments on. Some even think it could be an "alien" sent to 'save' mankind.</p>

        <p>The Pope will likely be the False Prophet, and the False Messiah (sorry, Messianic Jew here, lol... we don't refer to him as the Antichrist) will be someone from Europe who looks like the Catholic depictions of Christ... Because who better to deceive the masses than someone than someone who looks <em>exactly</em> like who they're expecting?</p>

        <p>Fauci is one of the false prophets.  Examine "Scientism" and "Church of Covid" as a phenomenon.  My brother recently joked that, "I used to think we'd be better off without religion... but then I realized that people will fill that void with something.  SJW stuff is a religion now.  Covid is a religion."  There are many false prophets.</p>

        <p>Y'know, it's funny. I see a lot of other christians on this sub that talk about the end times, but most seem to get their eschatology from the Left Behind series. Antichrist isn't an individual. Every single time Antichrist is mentioned, it is reference to a collective of those that reject Christ. Now, in Revelation, there is the Beast, and there is the Man of Lawlessness, but neither of these are described as THE Antichrist. Does the Bible say the Antichrist is a person? Or does it say that the spirit of the Antichrist is already here? Where does it say an Antichrist will be revealed after 3.5 years? Well, Daniel 9 has the prophecy of the seventy weeks, but does it ever say there's a gap in the seventy weeks? How and why does Dispensationalism insert this gap of 2,000 years??? </p>
<p>Maybe look into Dispensationalism's origins in the 1830's. The current widely accepted doctrines of eschatology were not held by anyone in the church until the nineteenth century. If that surprises you, check out a couple of the links below. </p>

<p>This teacher does an excellent job comparing and contrasting eschatological views using the Bible alone. Scroll down the the lecture series "When Shall These Things Be?" and listen to some of them. At the very least, it might be worth looking into other views of scripture to see if there's anything you can learn or refute. </p>

        <p>I can assure you that none of my views come from the Left Behind series lol. Just picturing their Nicolai Carpathia made me chuckle. It's about the same vein as VeggieTales.</p>
<p>Also, my comments were referring to thr technology being in place for a 1 world government and human tracking which is explicitly stated in scripture.</p>
<p>But I'll check your links out.</p>
<p>Another poster today told me about r/Bibleconspiracy check that out and maybe share your links there too to spark some discussion</p>

        <p>I would counterpoint that in Judaism, even in Christ's time, they understood the False Messiah to be a singular person. He is explicitly referred to as the Son of Perdition, the Man of Lawlessness, etc.. To get a true understanding of Biblical eschatology, you have to read it from the perspective of the people who wrote it, not looking at it from a 21st-century Christian lens.</p>
<p>Satan doesn't trick people by lying to them outright, he does it with half-truths and slight twistings. Dispensationalism is bogus. What G-d said is what He said and it never changed. You just have to dig deep to get to the root of it and learn it from the bottom up. What we're taught in the mainstream Christian church is the surface layer.</p>
<p>Check out Joseph Good. His teachings on Jewish eschatology will blow your mind. (As far as credentials go, the guy is one of the few Gentiles in the world directly involved with the rabbis who are working to rebuild the Temple in Israel.) http://jerusalemtemplestudy.com or you can listen to his weekly teachings on Facebook for free at Hatikva Ministries.</p>

        <p>The world was never normal and not weird, if your eyes was open pre 2019 you'd see what's been building up to what you see today. Whatever the forces may be is on the move now and it's been a long time coming for them. We were comfortable in our illusion living in ignorant bliss trying to achieve the American dream. It was a dream alright and everyone fell for it. The wool is being pulled over eyes and we're seeing reality more for what it truly is. </p>
<p>Its crazy how well they brainwashed the masses and turning them into tools. The people that hated nazi the most are probably willing to go nazi without even knowing. There's so much to be said.</p>

        <p>Yep, I've been digging into it and my theory is that the course of America was diverted from its natural growth into a progressively more federally-centralized and controlling oligarchy with the likely assassination of Patton and the creation of the OSS, and then cemented later with the assassination of JFK. This has been coming for the better part of a century.</p>

        <p>Yuri Bezmenov was a KGB defector and is cited often because he appeared in a Call of Duty trailer. He is legit, but there are other defectors that provide much more insight, such as Anatoliy Golitsyn, Viktor Suvorov, Ion Pacepa, Bella Dodd, and Stanislav Lunev.</p>
<p>Also, on a side note, don't believe this story about a Chinese spymaster defecting to the US and saying COVID was an accidental lab leak - we've never had a defector of that level, EVER, and his story is way too favourable to the CCP and is probably damage control. Why defect to China Joe's America when the US is losing it's dominance in the world stage? In this kind of environment, if his defection meant anything he would be dead. I think COVID was released on purpose - but that's just my opinion. (end rant)</p>

        <p>Great Reset as SickestBiscuit points out. Basically enslavement of the human race by a bunch of luciferian/archon/sociopathic billionaire assholes. I was a conspiracy theorist for many years and had a bible prophecy and conspiracy blog when I was a Christian fundamentalist [I deconverted but I think Revelation 13 is coming true, and see Jesus as a teacher who had many teachings adulterated] God/Source told me not to take the transhumanist poison.</p>
<p>Everything us conspiracy people warned about 20 years ago, I got into it during the era of 9-11, is coming true. The Bible prophecy as well but I see this as more encompassing in my present religious beliefs, we are looking the controllers and dominators [read the book Ishmael by David Quinn] taking things to the utmost extreme for the enslavement of the human race and trying to own human beings and control them. They are the purveryors of death. Even the Bible warns about those who will "destroy the earth". </p>
<p>I believe the vaxx is evil and cuts the connection to the divine. Treat all with compassion. I know not all may agree with my spiritual beliefs, but this is my belief and it gives me grief beyond measure. Surely God/Source will understand those who had it forced on them like children and vulnerable. They want to literally own and control you. They see humanity as just fodder for them to do whatever they want. </p>
<p>Some of us saw "beyond the matrix" years ago. I even had a time when they almost sucked me back in, I wanted to be rational, giving up "conspiracy" but I knew too much to have that happen. I was called crazy for years during the era of the bible prophecy/conspiracy blog.</p>

<p>I was talking to a friend, trained in demolition, shortly after, and he told me that it didn't happen like the MSM was saying.</p>

        <p>I'm just a bit confused when people say it like has somekind of compound that like affects our souls. I can understand the spiritual implications of a vaccination like the one we have. Our "spirit" per say can be affected through the implications and health effects of a vaccine.  The just the mark of the beast, literal soul alteration stuff that goes over my head.</p>

        <p>Yes like that. I don't think one compound in the vaxx does it, it's how it operates, invading the human genome, altering and basically rendering a complete body system, the immune system in effective. Taking the vaxx is also submission the beast too, and for me even the one fact they want to experiment on children is a spiritual reason alone to refuse and not submit. I am high risk and could easily die of Covid [whatever real virus there is] and still plan to refuse.</p>
<p>Note: I have taken all other traditional vaccines, but do not want the Covid vaxx, which operates totally different.</p>

        <p>Its just the next step in man-made-evolution.</p>
<p>The powers that be have their ideas on how humanity should develop, but unlike you and me they actually have the power to influence us into getting were they would like us to be.</p>
<p>Think of it as a family with a dominant father planning for vaccation. The kids would like to go to the beach, the mother would like to visit her parents in the land, the father wants to go to the moutains. We are currently driving towards the mountains.</p>
<p>What exactly that is, Im afraid no one knows. But you get a good idea when you closely follow the most influential people and institutions. If I had to sum up what I think is happening, here it is:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The powers that be want more power. Whether it is for mere selfish reasons or if they use a rationale alá  we are destroying nature and have to stop it, idk.</p>
<p>What constitutes power? Ressources. Its always about ressources. Be it actual ressources like gold, silver, uranium... or more abstract ones like land or people.</p>
<p>How do they reach those goals? By controlling the flow of money and information. They want to control your access to ressources and yourself. And these "crisises" are the perfect set-up to further their own goals.</p>

        <p>They are some being sold at retail for $600 and then people immediately sell them to someone else for $1200-$1400 on eBay. People program bots to monitor the web sites and immediately buy as many as possible like the second they come online. So as a mere human it’s almost impossible to get them without waiting outside a store all night when they say they are getting a delivery next day. Or pay the eBay scalper prices.</p>

        <p>I would say almost a year approximately. It’s just like that. They are used for gaming, video editing, and crypto mining among other things. You can basically print $ with them. But if you pay double the price it may take a year or more just to break even.</p>

        <p>It occurred to me a few months back that all of this might be some sort of "trial run" for an upcoming actual crisis. Perhaps the governments of the world are aware of some impending threat, such as an asteroid, or a supervolcanic eruption (Yellowstone), which they aren't capable of preventing. So the idea is to softly ease the general public into a sort of "police state lite" in order to gauge the reaction of the populace, as well as get people used to the idea of being forcibly locked down.  </p>
<p>This is just one hypothesis among many, of course. This one is technically less critical of the government, being that it, to some extent, inherently assumes that they actually <em>do</em> have the best interests of the citizens at heart. Which I generally believe to not be the case. Although, on the other hand, it could go another way too. I wouldn't put it past the government and other such elites to be making preparations to save themselves while they're distracting everyone else with all of this COVID insanity.   </p>
<p>I'm also not sure how easily these kinds of events would be to keep under wraps. Although I reckon astronomers and geologists could be muzzled to a certain extent, but it would only be a matter of time before word got out one way or another. Someone would crack, or maybe an amateur would piece things together. But going by the current reaction of the masses to what's been going on for the past almost two years, even if someone did come out and tell everyone, they'd just be censored and discredited as "conspiracy theorists" anyway.  </p>
<p>Kinda sounds like some sort of plot to a late-90's or early-2000's disaster porn movie, but these are strange times we're living in, so who knows?  </p>
<p>Again, I don't really think this is the case. Ranks pretty low on my list of possibilities. It's just something that came to mind is all.</p>

        <p>it is all about money and power in the first place. they want to reduce the population and re-educate the rest that is alive &amp; intelligent, to form a new world. </p>
<p>the world as we saw it before 2019, was pretty shit. everything rose in prices, salaries stood the same or got weaker. depression and anxiety went through the roof. people would call in sick a lot and let the health insurances cover. then we have rising ages everywhere. especially in developed first world countries. those people get older and older 100+ years, eating that pension,  and hanging onto health insurances etc, for their health.</p>
<p>zombie companies that operate under the limits, that neither have income nor go bankrupt, taking loans from banks that they have trouble paying off. <br>
everything combined resulted into a massive economic collaps so that everyone was unhappy. there is literally no country anymore to escape to, which have good living standards.  </p>
<p>so the UNO, WHO, BIGTECH etc. have teamed up to set these things once and for all.<br>
and with evil measurements. the majority of useless consumers have to be eliminated.<br>
those who do not contribute to the society are mostly the first who are not intelligent and would rush for a vaccine that is clearly not approved. because they do not read. and they know that. the majority around 90% do not read. and is uneducated.</p>
<p>this is the target. a world cannot function if more and more consumers exist. you cannot put a few people to carry thousands of them because they are the only smart onces. and it doesnt contribute to evolution. we cannot evolve as human species and drive innovations further if we are surrounded always by lesser intelligent species.</p>
<p>this why they have to go. a smart person can recognize all this propaganda. <br>
we will have new and good technology coming up, that will blow our minds. they exist but cannot be let out just yet. it is for the people that survived this apocalypse.<br>
and intelligent people dont do crimes which will lead to a very fair world. there will be rules applied to our system, that will be respected no matter what. </p>
<p>this is were the one world government comes into place. 1 dictator government that will rule and set the things right. democracy has never functioned because of the inequality of peoples intelligence. the 10% who have high capacities and know how to shape a world, have no right to speak because the 90% dumbasses are electing some idiots. and this shaped our world today how it looks like. in a complete degenerate one.</p>
<p>if you follow history, you can see how communistic countries always were strong. people were living happy and equal lives. because some of them had incredible intelligent and good hearted leaders. the whole nation cried and went to a funeral when one of these have died. non of that you can see in todays world of democracy. and non of them shaped our countries for the better.  </p>
<p>in a good functioning world, there needs to be a dictatorship, which is not evil. which is strict, but also good hearted. so if you do bad things of course you will be punished. but if you be just a normal, helpful citizen, that is where you get rewarded. and if there are many like you, then you have a perfect country with zero crime rate and evil. everyone enjoying to help eachother instead of stabbing their back. </p>
<p>and this is why the old world has to go once and for all.</p>

        <p>For over a century, blocks of ice have been falling from the sky, most the size of a small rucksack.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was noted before the advent of aviation, so it is not caused by planes.</p>
<p>These ice blocks are called Megacryometeors, and they have been falling more frequently since 1950.</p>
<p>The Tunguska event (a massive explosion in Russia in 1908) has been blamed on a Megacryometeor. Imagine the panic if that happened over a major city? Chelyabinsk saw a similar event (on a smaller scale) in 2013...</p>
<p>It’s been theorised that there is some kind of ice structure in the sky, and our emissions are causing it to melt, hence the falling ice blocks.</p>
<p>If this crazy theory is true, then it provides one key motive for lockdowns: by restricting travel, they reduce the amount of heat produced by cars/planes etc, and can slow or even halt the fall of Megacryometeors.</p>
<p>It’s completely insane to even think of this theory, but the idea of a global vaccination campaign for the common cold would also have seemed pretty insane if someone mentioned it in 2019.</p>

        <p>Hahaha. It’s okay, all the normies got through this wake up phase. Just remember: Nothing Can Stop What Is Coming. If you took time to research deep and read the actual Q drops, you’d understand, but here goes: The deep state (DS) is being destroyed from the inside out. This world was on a fast track (yes the world) to being run by the global elites (cabal, if you will) to control the entire world under a one world government (The great reset)</p>

        <p>Well what’s happening now is the destruction of said plan. See the Rockefeller’s had a Lockstep plan, basically what we’ve lived for the past year, that was meant to control the masses. Propaganda on the news, falsifying numbers, playing on fear. What the Q movement was, was a psyop to wake the people up to the bigger picture (which by now everyone sees that something ain’t right). This was nothing to do with reinstatement of trump or anything. What you’re witnessing is the end. The truths are coming out, the plan is slowly being shown to the world, and if you’ve noticed, all the elites are panicking trying to push the narrative of “Qanon, domestic threats, racism, white supremacy” all while attacking anything that stands against them. Why do you think not a single “Anon” or even the infamous “Q” hasn’t been locked up? Why do you think they keep trying to attack something they claim to have debunked?</p>
