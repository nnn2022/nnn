        <p>Hi. Doomer here. Have dined out exactly once, when positivity rates were at their absolute lowest, so.. yeah, gross mischaracterization there.</p>
<p>Anyways, the reason you don’t see ppl interacting with these sloppy memes is because they’re poor attempts at hyperbole and do little other than to point out the fallibility in our already weak and compromised regulations. Had we a proper lockdown from the get-go, we wouldn’t be in this position. But keep at it, I’ll continue to capitulate and live life indoors - gestating a comorbidity rn and have to take extra measures seeing as half the population believes their wishful thinking/next level snark somehow renders them immune.</p>

        <p>Ah right. The classic "if only we had a REAL lockdown". What is a REAL lockdown? I know in my county we shut down at the very start. Everything was shutdown. For a while. Couldn't even have people over. And virtually everyone complied. Slooooowly reopened...and bam! Here we are. </p>
<p>What is so magical about lockdowns? It only delays the inevitable. If you manage to lockdown a healthy population (which btw, the WHO is AGAINST doing as a primary measure) you now have a population free of Covid...but ripe for exposure to it. As soon as you begin to lift the lockdowns, you allow exposure to all people because none of them have immunity. So all you've done is delay infections, which is good if that was your goal! It gave you time to prepare. But no, instead we've become terrified of anyone getting Covid is all. Cases should not be scary.</p>

        <p>A competent lockdown would have eliminated the near-exponential transmission of the virus from host to host. It’s not magic - it’s biology! Don’t give a virus a host, and it won’t be able to survive. It would have had to be draconian and possibly global, but eradication was absolutely achievable in the early days, which we were able to show by flattening the curve. Our metrics were probably too lax however and the utter failure of contact tracing (in the US) compounded the issue. </p>
<p>Likewise reopening was probably premature and we did not think beyond the point of “flatten.” Sadly human nature for too many is to become utterly complacent and/or apathetic to the point where we are apparently ok with thousands of  preventable deaths each day. </p>
<p>Personally I can’t fathom that mentality and I completely disagree that this situation we find ourselves in (here in the US) was “inevitable” - although I’m thankful that we have some hope in the form of improved treatment and now the vaccine(s).</p>

        <p>I'm gonna get downvoted cause of the sub, but you still shouldn't even be sitting down at a restaurant. Unless they're spacing everyone out appropriately (which most restaurants don't seem to care because they gotta fit as many people inside to rake in the shekels), it's honestly better to just get take out. Now if you don't believe in the virus it can't hurt you just like how libs not believing in guns makes them immune, but that's up to you.</p>

        <p>I see you haven't been around children. Have you tried getting a child to wash their hands? How confident are you that a kid at school between the ages of 5 and 12 are regularly washing their hands? I'd wager that the probability that any kid has washed their hands after using the bathroom is 50/50. Now what happens in a class of 30 kids and only half have washed their hands?</p>
<p>Kids are disgusting germ factories and even if yours is the cleanest kid on the planet, they're still at the mercy of their schoolmates and friends</p>

        <p>We begin with the implication that what a person wants is not relevant when considering whether or not they should wear a mask. Then we move onto the implication that masks are effective, so effective that they should be worn at all times.</p>
<p>Except when sitting down at a restaurant. Why at that time? "Because I'm hungry and want to go out to eat." Finally, Observe the collision between what the OP wants versus their belief that others' wants are not compatible with the need for mask usage. This is commonly known as hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Important Note: If you reject these assumptions, then the OP's argument becomes even MORE logically incoherent.</p>

        <p>The entire point of OP's statement was that wearing a mask and eating at a restaurant, without a mask, do not work toward the same goal. They are in direct opposition to each other.</p>
<p>Masks are effective, and with social distancing, hand washing, etc. can stop the spread of the virus. People should not sit down to eat at restaurants, because it increases the risk of spread of the virus. This risk is reduced when social distancing/patios/etc are put into place, but it's still present. However, because people whined and cried enough, restaurants and such are still open (for dine in), and it's kind of hard to eat food with a mask on?</p>
<p>The compromise is the restaurants remaining open and available to seating, and taking the risk/reward as just a risk/reward scenario. </p>
<p>Honestly I think we just read what OP said different ways - I read it as "we have a compromise between people who wear masks and people who want to pretend nothing is an issue to keep economy going or something" and you maybe read it as OP goes out to eat and compromises his wants with wearing a mask?</p>

        <p>You’re joking, right?  Almost all of these restrictions have been done via executive order.  I’m not aware of any that have actually been passed by the legislature in any state.  In fact, many have expressly gone against the will of the legislature or beyond the scope of emergency power legislation (e.g by declaring a new emergency the day after an old one expires).  You can debate the relative need or merits of any of the restrictions, but it is absolutely indisputable that these have almost exclusively been done by executive order</p>

        <p>You said “there are lots of people who have a say in our laws, that’s how a democratic republic works”.  It is hardly the definition of a democracy to have huge portions of the country run with functionally zero input from the legislature for a year+.  Your counter seems to be that they must have listened to their big donors.  That makes it better how?</p>

        <p>Jesus, such a tangent to go on over one line in my comments that has very little to do with my point. </p>
<p>My point in bringing up that there are multiple influences in making these laws is that seating at restaurants is a compromise. In my state, dine in eating was prohibited in the beginning of lockdown then was allowed to continue when restrictions started to be lifted. I assume this was because it financially hurt a lot of people, including those who can get ther governor on the phone. Don't ask me to defend politicians being at the beck and call of the wealthy. As I tried to post to an above comment, I. DIDN'T. MAKE. ANY. LAWS.</p>
