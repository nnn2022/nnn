        <p>In total 16 000 infected, Ca. 300 COVID19 patients at the most and total 278 dead in Norway.</p>
<p>Yet people think the virus is deadlier and supports stricter restrictions. If that helps, why don't we use the same restrictions in the flu seasons?</p>

<p>I'm wondering why there were no lockdown for the flu in 2017 when there is a global lockdown for COVID19 in 2020.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>What the article says:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The flu killed 1,700 people last season.</strong> Now is the time to get vaccinated to avoid this winter's country plague.</p>
<p><strong>The number who died in last year's flu season was twice as high as in an average season, the National Institute of Public Health states.</strong></p>
<p>- The fact that so many died last year shows how important it is for people in the risk groups to get vaccinated, says senior adviser Ragnhild Tønnessen.</p>
<p>Exactly how many Norwegians got the disease last year is not known. Many "he gets off" at home in his own bed. However, <strong>130,000 people were diagnosed</strong> by a GP or emergency room and an estimated <strong>6,000 became so ill that they needed hospital treatment.</strong></p>
<p>Last year, a flu virus called A H3N2 ravaged.</p>
<p>- It is a virus that is known to affect the <strong>elderly the hardest</strong>, explains Tønnessen, who points out that even healthy elderly people have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from the flu.</p>
<p>Most hospitalizations and deaths last season were <strong>among people over 65.</strong></p>
<h2>Elderly, pregnant and chronically ill</h2>
<p>Tønnessen's call is crystal clear: Everyone in the risk groups should get vaccinated. This applies to the elderly, people with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, respiratory diseases or weakened immune systems. This also applies to those who live in care homes and nursing homes and pregnant women.</p>
<p>- Pregnancy is in itself a risk factor. The risk increases throughout the pregnancy, and the disease also poses a danger to the newborn child, she tells NTB.</p>
<p>The <strong>risk groups make up about 1.5 million people in Norway.</strong> The good news is that an increasing proportion of these are getting vaccinated. 28 percent of them were vaccinated in the 2016-2017 season, compared to 23 percent the year before. The elderly in particular take up the challenge, a total of 38 per cent of those over the age of 65.</p>
<h2>- Think they can handle it</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, it is far from the health authorities' goal that 75 per cent in the risk group protect themselves with vaccines.</p>
<p>- There are some who think they do not need it. Many people think they can handle the flu well and do not understand how seriously ill they can become. Old age in itself is a risk factor for complications. You can get lasting health problems. Vaccination is a safe, easy and cheap measure, says Tønnessen.</p>
<p>Very many of those who get vaccinated have been encouraged to do so by their GP or others in the health care system. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health therefore encourages people in the health service to spread the message and contribute to more people taking the vaccine.</p>
<h2>Several virus types</h2>
<p>Last year, it was the A H3N2 virus that dominated the season. Normally there is a mix of several different types of viruses, and the authorities do not know which ones will bother us this year.</p>
<p>- We monitor the viruses that are in circulation. Throughout the summer, there have been occasional cases of flu. It is too early to say what will come, says Tønnessen, and says that the high season sometimes comes during Christmas, other times closer to the winter holidays.</p>
<p>The vaccine covers several different types of virus and provides good protection. Taking it, however, is no guarantee of avoiding getting sick, we must believe.</p>
<p>- Some who are vaccinated still get the flu, but they get a milder course of the disease and have a lower risk of having serious outcomes and developing pneumonia, she says.</p>

        <p>Finally found another website called resett.no the other day where people like us are welcome and who don’t believe the virus numbers etc. The sheeple in Oslo sadly won’t wake up before it’s too late, I like Oslo but thankful I don’t live there.</p>
