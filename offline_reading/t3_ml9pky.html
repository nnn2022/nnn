        <p>&rt; Also if you’re young and have probably already had the virus... why would you? </p>
<p>One of the reasons we and other nations are experiencing our most recent rise in infections is because you can be reinfected after a couple months. </p>
<p>&rt; Why is this vaccine being pushed for so very, very hard?</p>
<p>Mainly because people are afraid of viral mutations, the more people whom are vaccinated the less chance the virus has to mutate into something worse. </p>
<p>&rt; why do most people outside this sub not seem to be asking that question?</p>
<p>I think it's an odd way of thinking about vaccination campaigns. If the goal of the campaign is to get the most people vaccinated as possible, why would you stop the marketing before the job is done? You don't just stop once the most vulnerable people are vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You can be reinfected after having the vaccine too; both the vaccine and having had the virus previously reduce reinfection, so if you’ve had one, why would you need the other?</p>
<p>The virus is mutating regardless - in fact, surely vaccinating more people would force the virus to mutate into something worse, something that resists the vaccine?</p>
<p>No vaccine has ever been pushed for this much, even for infections far worse than coronavirus.  Why is the goal of the campaign to vaccinate everyone?  Just vaccinating the vulnerable would be enough to reduce covid to a flu-like status we can deal with while going back to life as normal.</p>

        <p>&rt; You can be reinfected after having the vaccine too;</p>
<p>I mean I guess if you're being pedantic, you could possible be reinfected within a short timeframe of getting the vaccine. Or if you want to be even more pedantic, yes you will eventually need to revaccinate, although we don't know if thats going to be in a year or in several years. </p>
<p>&rt;  so if you’ve had one, why would you need the other?</p>
<p>The antibodies you get from the virus can last from a few week's to months, the vaccine can last from months to years. </p>
<p>&rt; The virus is mutating regardless</p>
<p>Yes, and we wish to slow the mutations, you do that by slowing infection rates. Viruses mutate, it's what they do, were just trying to make the odds better. </p>
<p>&rt; surely vaccinating more people would force the virus to mutate into something worse, something that resists the vaccine?</p>
<p>Vaccinations can cause mutations, but they generally don't spread. If viruses actually survive in a vaccinated host, it's usually at level low enough to be under the viral load needed for transmission. </p>
<p>&rt; No vaccine has ever been pushed for this much</p>
<p>None that you remember, the vaccine campaign to inoculate people for polio was huge in America. Of course this is highly marketed, it's the first major pandemic in the age of major globalization. </p>
<p>&rt; Why is the goal of the campaign to vaccinate everyone?</p>
<p>Mainly to stabilize globalized markets and trade. Post globalization countries need to not only worry about their own infrastructure, but the infrastructure of their labour sources, manufacturers, and suppliers. </p>
<p>First world nations are going to be okay, but a worse pandemic could break the third world countries we rely on for material and labour. </p>
<p>&rt; Just vaccinating the vulnerable would be enough to reduce covid to a flu-like status we can deal with while going back to life as normal.</p>
<p>Except it's deadlier, more easily spread, and comes with a host Secondary conditions that takes up healthcare. </p>
<p>America could possible get back to normal I'd we had a decent healthcare system. However, we were dealing with hospital overflow before the pandemic. Just the flu challenged a lot of hospital's capacity levels pre-covid. If we were to get back to "normal" without taking preventative measures wed likely experience a healthcare collapse.</p>

        <p>Deadlier</p>
<p>&rt; COVID-19: There have been approximately 2,862,858 deaths reported worldwide. In the U.S, 555,619 people have died of COVID-19 between January 2020 and April 6, 2021.*
Flu: The World Health Organization estimates that 290,000 to 650,000 people die of flu-related causes every year worldwide.</p>
<p>More easily spread </p>
<p>Pretty self explanatory, covid has a longer incubation time, and there isn't any natural immunity as it's from a new virus, so there's more opportunity to spread. There's also speculation that the virus can stay in the air for longer, which goes some ways to explain super spreader events that aren't usually associated with flu. </p>

        <p>&rt;Its the first major pandemic in the age of major globalization.</p>
<p>HIV-AIDS: <em>am I a joke to you?</em> </p>
<p>&rt;but a worse pandemic could break the third world countries we rely on for material and labor</p>
<p>Lmao at your saviour complex. Third world countries did much better than most rich first world countries, that too with less restrictions. Look at the top countries in deaths per capita. </p>
<p>They figured out that this “pandemic” is nonsense and the virus is harmless.</p>
<p>You obviously just repeat whatever woke doomer propaganda tells you.</p>

        <p>&rt;    because you can be reinfected after a couple months.</p>
<p>This is a lie. Reinfefction has been confirmed maybe 5 times, all with immune diseases. </p>
<p>&rt;    the more people whom are vaccinated the less chance the virus has to mutate into something worse</p>

<p>&rt;    why would you stop the marketing before the job is done?</p>
<p>Basic human psychology. You tell people they MUST do a thing and they start to resist. Convince them it's safe, effective and useful instead.</p>

<p>Lol, preventing the spread of the virus reduces the environmental exposure from a new host, thus limiting it's need to adapt to survive. Pretty basic stuff.</p>

        <p>Both Pfizer and Astrozenca ran trials of about 15,000 people prior to approval. That's a decent-sixed trial. </p>
<p>They didn't test with pregnant women or under 16s - and that's why the vaccines weren't approved for those groups. </p>
<p>The <em>only</em> standard testing that was missing, was for side effects beyond 3 months and given (1) the number of people the virus was killing or making very sick (2) the fact that virtually all vaccine side effects show themselves within 6 weeks, this was an excellent relative risk.</p>
<p>Obviously researchers are <em>still</em> looking at how the roll-out is going to check for effects, that's not exactly "using us as guinea pigs".</p>

<p>Sure, it's a risk you can take. If you're in a high risk group, you maybe should. Personally I'm not satisfied with less than a couple of years of safety testing.  There are many other ways to reduce my already relatively low chance of getting infected and the risk of serious complications is very low for people in my demographic. The risk of long term health effects from the vaccine is likely also low but if I get vaccinated I trade my low/moderate risk of exposure to COVID for a certainty of exposure to the vaccine. But you what's right for your own situation. We're only against mandatory vaccination and vaccine passports here.</p>

        <p>Certainly, the risk of death may be low in your demographic. The risk of you being an asymptomatic carrier and putting others at risk is substantially higher. Anecdotally, I have a friend In her 30s, who was previously a regular 5k runner who caught covid in March.  She has no pre-existing conditions. She managed to walk about a mile for the first time last month. I would be worried about long covid effects, irrespective of age. </p>

<p>For many people here the vaccines, and especially the notion of a vaccine passport is the "New Normal" that we're fighting against. Requiring proof of vaccination to do things is not normal. Internal passports are normal in China, and wee in the soviet union but it's not free normal for free countries. If we have our way, it never will be. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You mention anti-vax sentiment in your post. I'd like you to read this little paragraph I wrote. Its about one of the concerns about the vaccines, specifically the possibility of the pfizer vaccine causing sterility. I don't expect you to change your mind-in fact it'd be stupid to do that based on something an anonymous stranger said online-but I hope you'll come to appreciate that we have real concerns about these particular vaccines:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's the scientific case against the vaccines in a nut shell:</p>
<p>The vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize a portion  of the viral envelope called the spike protein. Part of this spike  protein is a amino acid sequence that's identical to a sequence in a  human protein called syncytin-1, which is required for the development  of the placenta. The concern is that by training the immune system to  recognize this sequence, it'll cause an immune response to the fetus.  This concern was first raised by Dr. Michael Yeadon, the former chief  science officer at Pfizer specializing in allergy (so not an  immunologist, but someone whose work does require a good understanding  of immunology, who also has intimate knowledge of Pfizer's drug  development practices). There's a good explanation in this article <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/14/fact-check-no-evidence-covid-19-vaccine-causes-infertility-women/3884328001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/14/fact-check-no-evidence-covid-19-vaccine-causes-infertility-women/3884328001/</a>  which purports to debunk the story, but actually confirms all the key  details while providing a good overview of the science and a rebuttal  from Pfizer and other experts. Obviously there's no consensus that the  Pfizer vaccine sterilizes people, but I think there's good reason to  worry it might. The article also uses the common sleight-of-hand of  using "no reason to believe..." and "no evidence that ..." to be the  same as "good evidence against." In fact there haven't been any good  studies on the vaccine and pregnancy, so obviously there isn't any data  to prove it. This is exactly the same rhetorical trick that was employed  back when health authorities were claiming that there's "no evidence  masks prevent transmission of COVID."</p>

        <p>On the subject of vaccine passports, there is definitely a discussion to be had about the pros and cons, and I quite understand the problems that people have with them, in particular if they were made mandatory in some way. Personally, I am concerned about how they could disadvantage young people or pregnant women or others who cannot yet be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So lets put that to one-side and agree that there is a good-faith debate to be had there.</p>
<p>Moving on to your scientific case against, I'm afraid that whatever health concerns you <em>could</em> raise withregards to vaccination, infertility due to problems with syncytin-1 is not among them.  Michael Yeadon is up there with Andrew Wakefield with his misuse of science.</p>
<p>There are a couple of good articles that are worth reading that set out the situation.</p>
<p>Reuter did a good overview fact-check here, with sources linked: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-syncytin-idUSKBN2A42S7">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-syncytin-idUSKBN2A42S7</a>.</p>
<p>There's a more polemical, but actually very thorough debunking here: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/it-was-inevitable-that-antivaxxers-would-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-make-females-infertile/">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/it-was-inevitable-that-antivaxxers-would-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-make-females-infertile/</a></p>
<p>Michael Yeadon and Wolfgang Wodarg's main claim, as you say, is that common sequences between the  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and could lead vaccines to  trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1. </p>
<p>In fact there is a a nine amino acid sequence with 66% sequence identity between syncytin-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike. Does that sound like an impressive match? </p>
<p>It's a quite a big protein - what are the chances of a rough match between a sequence in it and loads of proteins in the human body?</p>
<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_croxford/status/1334593620863823892">Twitter thread</a> from immunologist Andrew Coxford is worth a look. He found similar degrees of matching between amino acid sequences in the spike protein and the protein actin (found in muscles and many other tissues), collagen (probably the most important connective tissue protein) and haemoglobin - and there are many <em>many</em> others. </p>
<p>If that level of similarity caused an erroneous immune response, infertility would be the least of our worries.</p>
<p><strong>More simply</strong> - if an immune response against the spike protein meant an immune response against syncytin-1 that would also mean tthat pregnant women who catch COVID-19 would also become infertile. We haven't seen increased infertility or pregnancy loss  in women with COVID-19.</p>
<p>All in all, then this 'scientific objection' simply doesn't hold up to scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>Which leads to the obvious question - who is promulgating this stuff - trying to convince people like you and me - and why? Weird isn't it?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thorough reply. I looked through the articles you cited, but didn't find anything that suggests that Yeardon's claims are implausible. I think it's common knowledge that his concerns are not shared by most researchers since otherwise they wouldn't have given the EUA to the vaccine, but to me it still seems reasonable to take Yeardon seriously. The question isn't are fertility problems likely, it's are they plausible, the answer still seems to be yes.</p>

<p>&rt;There are a couple of good articles that are worth reading that set out the situation.<br>
&rt;<br>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I looked through the articles you posted and the sources they cite. They're both much the same as the USA Today "debunking" I posted, though the Reuter's one linked to some articles that helped me get more familiar with the literature on COVID 19 and pregnancy. It's worth pointing out that some studies <strong>have</strong> found a link between COVID 19 and adverse outcome that are not the result of the infection itself. Here are a few:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270341/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270341/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Current data suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least uncommon,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270341/#bib4">4</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270341/#bib5">5</a>  and the clinical course of infants born to infected mothers varies in  the two publications. <strong>Serious illness was reported by Zhu and  colleagues;</strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270341/#bib5"><strong>5</strong></a> <strong>however, all of these neonates tested negative, so the cause of their illness remains unclear.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195406/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195406/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Indirect adverse neonatal events stemming from maternal illness due to SARS-CoV-2 were shown in one series.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195406/#bib2">2</a>  Six of ten infants had abnormal early clinical findings, including  respiratory distress, fever, thrombocytopenia, or transaminitis, with  one infant death. Although all nine tested infants had negative results  for COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036645/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036645/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Perinatal  2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing  problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress,  thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death.  However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>It seems that at least some studies have found problems in neonates even though the disease does not seem to be passed from mother to child. The cause of these problems is unclear. I'll admit I don't have time today to do more than scan through these articles and didn't read them fully, so if I mischaracterized any of their conclusions, forgive me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This Nature article cites an article that I find much more concerning, though it's unpublished and preliminary.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00578-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00578-y</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Baud’s unpublished data suggest that in a small number of  cases of COVID-19 in pregnant women, an inflammatory response — the  body’s defence against the virus — damages the placental tissue in the  same way as lung tissue can be ravaged. In three cases, he observed,  babies whose mothers showed these placental changes were born with brain  damage.</p>
<p>Also I'm not an immunologist and don't know a lot about antibodies, but common sense seems to dictate that the immune response from the vaccines is not identical to the response to the virus; otherwise, why do people that have already been infected need a vaccine and why do the vaccines have different rates of efficacy? If so, we cant conclude from the fact that COVID related problems with placental are rare that COVID the vaccine will be the same.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: I'll try to find time to address your other points later today or tomorrow. Again, I really appreciate your response. I'm tired of this forum being nothing but shouting insults.</p>

        <p>Thanks for these. I think there's enough there to show that babies born to women with Covid are more likely to be poorly at birth, to those born to healthy mothers. </p>
<p>You might find this https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016158/ interesting as it attempts a group analysis of the other studies.</p>
<p>Here's a long quote: </p>
<p>&rt; Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at increased risk of preterm delivery associated with increased iatrogenic preterm delivery. <strong>The explanation for this risk is the need to end the pregnancy due to maternal diseases, such as severe pre-eclampsia and pneumonia, which are more frequent in these patients and lead to more labour inductions. [A]</strong> A unique and novel finding in our study is the association between premature rupture of membranes at term and SARS-CoV-2 infection. PROM may result in immediate risks and subsequent problems including maternal or neonatal infection [25]. One of the possible explanations we found for this association is the activation of a series of mediators and biochemical pathways of inflammation in the premature rupture of membranes and premature delivery that are also found in SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as macrophages or IL-6 [26]. The studies demonstrating the influence of IL-6 on preterm delivery are a strong basis for studying this association [27]. Cytokines are vital in regulating immunological and inflammatory responses. <strong>Among them, IL-6 is of major importance because there is evidence that circulating IL-6 levels are closely linked to the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [28]. There are already treatments that are indicated based on these findings [29].</strong> [B]</p>
<p>&rt; We observed a significant increase in the stillbirth rate in the univariate analysis alone. The role of inflammation mediators in these deaths could be the subject of a line of research because it is known that women without SARS-CoV-2 infection who have a pregnancy loss, have significantly higher amniotic fluid IL-6 concentration levels than those with a normal outcome [30]. We found no differences in mortality or early or late neonatal morbidity related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure in our study, unlike reports from other series [31, 32]. .There is a higher risk that the children of SARS-CoV-2 infection mothers enter the NICU, with prematurity being one of the determining factors. All newborns were followed for at least 14 days by the different neonatology units of the participating hospitals, without any case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection being detected in that period.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>To date, there has been indirect evidence on placental involvement which would explain our findings [33, 34]. [C]</strong> Our results derived using multivariable analyses confirm those of the cases series published at the beginning of the pandemic that described preterm deliveries and premature rupture of the membranes [21, 31, 35]. </p>
<p><strong>[A]</strong> - so some of the figures poorly babies are because the baby was born early because the the mother was very poorly.</p>
<p><strong>[B]</strong> - IL-6 (Interleukin 6) is one of those signalling chemicals that sets off a huge number of changes in the body when the body is under attack by severe infection. Any of these changes could be effecting the unborn child</p>
<p><strong>[C]</strong> - this is the interesting bit, in terms of supporting your hypothesis - I've read both citations 33 and 34 and they suggest that among all the other changes going on in the mother's body - there can be problems with the blood vessel formation in the placenta - but again, note that these studies looked at the placenta closely and there is <strong>nothing in them that suggests abnormality in the syncytiotrophoblast layer - the part of the placenta that syncytin-1 is involved with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>So where does that leave us?</strong></p>
<p>Having been through this, I think think the sensible conclusion is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is no part of the viral spike protein that is unusually similar to syncytin-1, so there is no evidence that a vaccine would target that element of the placenta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women who are ill with Covid are more predisposed to have poorly babies. That's often because the babies are taken out by caesarian early because mum is ill. However there is also evidence that the growth of blood vessels within the placenta can also be abnormal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But blood vessel development isn't mediated by syncytin-1 - syncytin has a very specialised function in forming the thin layer separating foetal and maternal blood supply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeardon basically pulled a theory out of his bum based on a similarity between the spike protein and syncytin-1 that doesn't exist. This was then seized upon by people looking for a scientific reason to reject the vaccines. Unfortunately or fortunately, it looks like pseudoscience.</p>
<p>As to your other points - vaccines have different levels of efficacy largely because the method of delivery is different, the mRNA has to be wrapped up in a biochemical package that allows delivery into the cell. Its getting this packaging and delivery right which is so tricky. It's why you have to store the Pfizer/BioNtec vaccine at -70C  —  the others, not so much.</p>
<p>Regarding the different kind of immune response between vaccination and infection - its a fast moving area and we don't know all the answers. The simplest answer at the moment is that for <strong>prolonged</strong> protection against the virus, it is best to get multiple challenges to the immune system, so for most the double-shot is recommended. So even for people who have had Covid, an additional shot would be recommended - and to keep things simple it's best to get the double-dose (I haven't reseached how the new single-dose vaccines work).</p>
<p>However, it is - as I say, a fast-moving area. Hence articles like: https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n308 'Covid-19: People who have had infection might only need one dose of mRNA vaccine' - based on two small studies.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the vaccines haven't been approved for use in pregnant women yet - regulators will be looking into exactly these kind of factors and may well decide that 'nope, there's something going on here, best not to'.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that the vaccine will somehow magically render non-pregnant women infertile.</p>

        <p>Is it possible to find places that only use the spit test? Sure they may be collecting DNA but that’s easy to get if they want it anyways. I’d rather not put my own body at increased risk.</p>

        <p>making a statement and providing "evidence" for it is quite literally arguing a position, but I guess tailoring expectations about others having that kind of fundemental understanding is appropriate in this sub.</p>
<p>thanks for the kind words at least, haven't been tested but this vaccine should help prevent the need for that. I sincerely hope thay literally every other unnecessary luxury item in your life with carcinogenic chemicals doesn't give you cancer as well.</p>

        <p>In that case it's worth knowing that the mRNA vaccines have got absolutely nothing to do with your DNA. It doesn't alter it, it doesn't integrate with it. All the vaccine does is provide the  instructions needed for your cells to manufacture viral spike proteins for a few days, rather than injecting you with pre-manufactured viral spike proteins.</p>

        <p><em>wearily begins typing as if it will do any good</em></p>
<p>https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/10/moderna-trouble-mrna/  CTRL-F 'nasty' for extra lulz</p>
<p>Read the whole article, it gives some insight into Moderna as a company (a billion dollar investment firm disguised as a biotech company  https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3488  ) and the use of mRNA as a vaccine delivery tool in general (mostly abandoned other than a couple collaborative companies who also have nothing approved or even in widespread human trials, far as I can tell   https://www.biospace.com/article/moderna-s-not-the-only-one-a-look-at-the-mrna-market/ ).</p>
<p>They've also tried on zika, rabies, cancer, etc.  All failed.  It's proven technology all right, just not in the way you mean.  As it turns out, the <em>real</em> problem is getting it where it needs to be without damaging anything else, which is a fairly important hurdle, wouldn't you say?  The rare successes they <em>have</em> managed in trials have been at such a low dose the vaccine itself is virtually useless (is that why vaccinated people still have to wear the muzzle? Hmmmm.)</p>
<p>You know what this vaccine roll-out looks like to me?  A sop to Moderna.  A bailout that <em>isn't</em> a bailout, so to speak.  Lots of money in that outfit, and so far, they've produced shit in a brown paper bag and hemorrhaged an unknowable amount of cash in the process. </p>
<p>I'll save you the time and just post this in your stead: "ItS nOt PeEr ReVieWed!!1 It'S JuSt aN oPiNiOn PiECe REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I NeEd WiTnESSeD AfFaDaVIts FrOm AlL ScIeNCe MeN BeFoRe I QuEStIoN tHe TeEvEE!!!"</p>

        <p>I did read the entire article, and I will say I was not familiar with the history of Moderna as a company. I will acknowledge that they were criticized by reputable organizations in the past, as you pointed out. </p>
<p>Your next points, however, are not valid. It's true that there were some initial challenges with mRNA vaccines as far as efficacy and tolerability, but that's not the case with the COVID-19 vaccines.  Both the Moderna and Phyzer vaccines underwent the same rigorous testing that all other vaccines have had to, and they've proven to be both extraordinarily effective and safe. The rate of mild adverse effects is slightly higher than with some other vaccines, but the benefits FAR outweigh these small risks. Your theory about this being a front to bail out Moderna is absolutely absurd. The amount of money tied up in Moderna is peanuts compared to what the federal government has spent on this vaccine roll-out. Not to mention the fact that they're only one of several companies with approved vaccines.</p>

<p>No, they haven't. They simply have not. No matter how many times you say it, it won't be true.  Not unless one of the companies you mentioned has also perfected time travel to get through the typical 10-15 year testing process imposed on all vaccines.  They haven't done that, have they?  Because if time travel is on the table we need to worry more about Terminators and less about what is basically the common cold.</p>
<p>I'm getting tired of typing this, but the only way to test a drug's side effects over, say, five years is to shoot it into someone and wait, you know,  five years.  There's no other way.  Has this vaccine been tested this way?  Have any of the mRNA vaccines been tested this way in the last three decades?  No, and no again.  Why?  Because the initial side effects at useful doses were far too dangerous.  Not 'Ooosh, that's kinda itchy' type dangerous, either;  "Damn, my liver just quit working" type dangerous.  The fact that this doesn't raise any red flags is staggering to me.</p>
<p>&rt;The amount of money tied up in Moderna is peanuts compared to what the federal government has spent on this vaccine roll-out. </p>
<p>OK.  Is this supposed to refute my point about the Feds bailing out Moderna?  Think about it for two seconds...do you reckon any of that Fed money went to Moderna?  Maybe a little?  OK, you can quit thinking, it's 2.5 billion (1 billion in 'research aid' and a 1.5 billion dollar purchase order)  2.5 billion to do, as I see it, one of two things: A: Either shoot the population up with a potentially harmful, inadequately tested drug <em>or</em> B: Shoot the population up with a watered-down version of a potentially harmful, inadequately tested drug.</p>
<p>Shit, <em>I</em> could do that for a lot less than 2.5 billion.</p>

        <p>Well for one, to limit the spread of the virus. And before you regurgitate the meme that the vaccines don't limit the spread, that's not true. The initial clinical trials of the vaccines did not look at transmissibility as an endpoint but we now know from observational data that they do in fact dramatically reduce transmission. </p>
<p>Secondly, your point about "99% survival rate" shows a complete inability to understand statistics. Sure, the mortality rate for the average person is "only" a fraction of 1%, but what does that actually look like when you extrapolate for the entire population? It looks like 555,000 dead Americans in 1 year. Is that an insignificant number to you?</p>

        <p>&rt; What I’m saying is that Covid doesn’t warrant the extreme response we have experienced. It is a statistically insignificant number of deaths.</p>
<p>I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on what constitutes a "statistically insignificant" number of deaths</p>
<p>&rt; If you’re from the medical field, why are we quarantining the healthy?</p>
<p>What do you mean by quarantining? Do you mean imposing restrictions? This is to reduce the spread of the virus. Healthy people can spread the virus to high risk individuals. And even if we wanted to only put restrictions on "unhealthy" people, how would we do that? Aside from the obvious unfairness of this, it would be impossible to define who would qualify let alone enforcing it.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are we mandating masks when 90% of the population aren’t using them correctly (e.g. reusing the same cloth ones multiple times a week without washing them).</p>
<p>We have good evidence to show that masks reduce the spread of respiratory droplets and viral particles. You're correct that reusing a cloth mask is not the most effective way to use them. It would be best if every member of society wore a properly fitted N95 at all times in public, but we can't let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are we developing a vaccine using a technology that has very little clinical trial data.</p>
<p>mRNA technology has been around for several years and is well established. It's true that there have been few MRNA vaccines widely used before COVID, but that would be a silly reason to not use the technology. All types of vaccines were new at some point. The data we have so far about the mrna covid vaccines shows that they are extremely safe. You might argue that we don't know what possible long term health effects the vaccines could have, but I would point out that we also don't know what the long term possible effects of COVID are. Actually, there have already been some reports of pretty serious lasting effects from COVID infections, even in young healthy people.</p>
<p>&rt; Why does the the virus need a marketing campaign if it really is so serious?</p>
<p>The virus does not have a marketing campaign. Many people, like myself, find it important to spread awareness and education about COVID because we're trying to preserve human lives. One would think this stuff is common sense that doesn't need to be said, but unfortunately there are large portions of the population who either don't grasp the seriousness of the situation, or simply don't care. </p>
<p>&rt; I don’t deny the fact that sars 2 exists, but from the numbers I’m seeing from our own government and from the amount of pushback I get from questioning the efficacy and need for a vaccine somewhat bolsters my argument that it’s all bullshit.</p>
<p>I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but this is textbook conspiracy theorist logic. Do you really believe doctors like myself are all conspiring to trick the public into thinking the pandemic is worse than it really is? Why would we do that? And how would we have organized such a massive effort without anyone finding out about it?</p>

        <p>This is how you stay uninformed. I posted a link and you refused to read it to educate and better yourself. The JJ vaccine literally does not use MRNA in any capacity to deliver instructions to your body. Read the link. It LITERALLY explains this. Instructions does not equal MRNA. That is something you have made up.</p>

        <p>It's been in various levels of testing for 30 years and has yet to work as a vaccine for anything due to side effects.  The side effects that appear right away are so bad, no one has ever gotten around to testing what the long-term effects might be.</p>

        <p>You implied it:</p>
<p>&rt;Its been rushed and already is showing many side effects.</p>
<p>But according to your link:</p>
<p>&rt;These types of reactions reflect the normal immune response triggered by the body to the vaccines. <strong>They are typically seen with most types of vaccine</strong> and tend to resolve within a day or two.</p>
<p>So, what was your point? Seems like the side effects are expected and normal, not the result of being rushed.</p>

        <p>There is a website from the UK government that showcases all the vaccine deaths and side effects. Last time I checked (last month) there was 600 vaccine deaths with a couple of thousand listed side effects.</p>

<p>I literally cannot find it which is incredibly frustrating. If I come across it I will link you the website.</p>

        <p>For you to have a point you'd have to demonstrate how that is any different from any other vaccine. </p>
<p>Also understand that there are likely very, very few "vaccine deaths," only deaths that follow vaccination. <em>Maybe</em> they are caused by the vaccine, but we're talking 600 out of 31 million, that's roughly the normal death rate of the human population. So all that would indicate is that vaccinated people die at the same rate as unvaccinated people: hardly evidence of danger.</p>
<p>By the way even if the vaccine caused 600 deaths, that's like... a 99.9998% survival rate. Many times greater than the virus itself. If you are worried about dying from the vaccine, mathmatically you should be absolutely crippled by fear of COVID which is thousands of times more likely to kill you based on that number.</p>
<p>If "experimental vaccine" scares you, "novel virus" mathmatically should make you the ultimate doomer. It's absolutely bonkers to simutaneously hold the belief that the virus is no big deal and the vaccines might be dangerous.</p>
<p>I can understand thinking that both are not dangerous and therefore the vaccine is unnecessary. But it doesn't make sense to fear vaccines and not the virus itself. Contracting the virus is demonstrably more dangerous.</p>

        <p>That's still a 99.993% survival rate, much safer than contracting the virus. And again, that is assuming that all of those deaths were directly because of the vaccine, which is not proven. They are only measuring deaths that take place following vaccination. Coincidences are bound to happen.</p>
<p>The bottom line: if an unproven 99.993% survival rate scares you, you are mathmatically worse than any doomer.</p>
<p>Sorry but in terms of letting things in my body I'd rather it be something developed by human scientists than an unthinking, unfeeling microbe that multiplied and mutated inside of a bat and that has likely killed 100x more people.</p>

<p>The same can be said of the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;I mean hell, there have been a noticeable increase in miscarriages since vaccines came out. Who knows what kind of damage it could do to fertility?</p>
<p>For all you know they're because of COVID itself. 
"Who knows" is silly. It's not like scientists are stupid. What would be the biological mechanism by which the vaccines damage fertility? People know and can figure that stuff out. 
You're applying doomer logic to the vaccine the way they apply it to COVID. What makes you any different from them?</p>
<p>&rt;Also, the Covid death rates are a complete wash, they are inflated due to the flawed 'within 28 days' setup.</p>
<p>By a similar logic, "vaccine deaths" are also inflated. </p>
<p>You are just being a doomer for the vaccine instead of the virus. No different, no less flawed. </p>
<p>Take a step back and realize that neither are likely to gravely harm you: but, the reality is that there is a highly prevalent and contagious pathogen out there that IS likely to make you very sick for a long time and make you a carrier to make the people around you very sick, as well as widely available medicine that prevents that from happening. Seems like an easy choice to me.</p>
