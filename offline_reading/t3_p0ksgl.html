    <strong>Tried to post this in askscience and my gf can't see it on her phone. Been removed and I have no notification</strong>
    <p><p>How is the covid vaccines that use mRNA not gene therapy?</p>
<p>I have been googling and trying to make sense of why; when you google that question the answer is "no, genes are DNA". I read a few articles trying to explain that they are different and how mRNA is a copy of DNA which I completely understand. I've known this since highschool. Isn't a piece of a gene still a gene?</p>
<p>It's a copy of it, still genetic material, a.k.a. a gene. I just want to know and I can't find an explanation that makes any sense. What I did find was this article about the future of mRNA and gene therapy. It refers to mRNA as a therapeutic. It talks about using it as a vaccine and it is from 2017 no bias, just science. Google if mRNA is a gene and it just explains that it is a copy of DNA. So to me it seems kinda obvious that mRNA is therefore a gene as well. So how is this vaccine not using gene therapy? It is obviously using genetic material to create a therapeutic response in a cell, part of the definition of gene therapy originally. Now it seems there is an argument that is not the case. That they cut the definition in half cause This is from medline.gov, I'll put the link in the bottom</p>
<p>"Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. In the future, this technique may allow doctors to treat a disorder by inserting a gene into a patient's cells instead of using drugs or surgery. Researchers are testing several approaches to gene therapy, including:</p>
<p>Replacing a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy</p>
<p>copy of the gene.</p>
<p>Inactivating, or "knocking out," a mutated gene that is functioning improperly.</p>
<p>Introducing a new gene into the body to help fight a disease."</p>
<p>That last one is super interesting, to me from what I can tell the covid vaccine which uses mRNA is gene therapy. It clearly fits the definition above.</p>
<p>The only thing I can figure out is that this argument is purely political, and based on not making sure the covid vaccine is not classed as gene therapy. I don't want to talk about that. Please explain the science backing this cause I can't find it.</p>

<p>Edit: I am now muted on askscience for asking how this post is about arguing semantics. So this is gene therapy then</p></p>

        <p>Oh ya I love comparing duck and Google all the time. Just to understand what everyone is seeing. Its laughable even using Google and just googling is mRNA a gene. It clearly tells you it is a gene copy so therefore a gene. Just insane how people are so committed to not understanding science</p>

        <p>I try to give some the benefit of the doubt, as they could be more busy with their kids, since I don’t have any I have more time to watch documentaries and stuff most people would consider too boring. </p>
<p>But when people have been literally saying this stuff almost 2 years (well really longer) and they still turn a blind eye, that’s just willful ignorance, or “useful idiot”, which they don’t know what you mean if you even say that</p>

        <p>That's amazing, and it isn't going through any of the proper gene therapy testing, only vaccination testing. This is truly dangerous and we are crazy for being skeptical?</p>

        <p>This is important. The definition of words in the English language are being changed to suit an agenda. We have already seen the definition of vaccine change without anyone apart from people in this group noticing. I honestly think keeping hard copies of things is important now to argue legally.
