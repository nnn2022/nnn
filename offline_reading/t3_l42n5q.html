    <strong>This is a strange time (R/Vaccines rant)</strong>
    <p><p>This is a world gone upside down lately. </p>
<p>BANNED from posting for just commenting in r/Vaccines replying to someone who was genuinly concerned about the risks of the new vaccines, </p>
<p>I commented 'Have you at least looked at the risks of this? It sounds pretty scary' and got banned instantly. </p>
<p>I messaged mods asking why, and I got no reply. Instead the mods muted me. </p>
<p>Just for asking. </p>
<p>Just for commenting, saying wait a minute, have you thought about this.</p>
<p>If people can't even have a discussion about the safety (or massive lack of) these vaccines, that says all you need to know. That says more than any debate ever could. </p>
<p>They are UNSAFE (most of you here already know this, but just ranting). </p>
<p>not to mention the fact that dozens of people have already died as a result of the covid vaccines, and thousands more injured or debilitated. And this is just the short term, instant effects. </p>
<p>We can only imagine the medium to long term effects of altering our DNA, and diminishing our immune system so our bodies attack our own cells. </p>
<p>I feel this is no beyond just 'something interesting that's happening' and moving towards being active genocide. </p>
<p>We won't be silenced, and every time one of us gets 'muted' or silenced in one group, we'll shout even louder in many others. The people are now wide awake</p></p>
