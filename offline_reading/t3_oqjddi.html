    <strong>So I went to the hospital today</strong>
    <p><p>I had a shitty past year not just because of this "new normal", but also because of pretty intense cardiac problems. I'm only 20. I spent the last year in and out of hospitals which is what woke me up and made me realize that this pandemic is blown out of proportion in the media. It was always calm and pretty much empty.</p>
<p>Anyways let's get to why I'm posting. Today I had to go to the hospital in a hurry for very low blood pressure (I'm okay now) and one of the first questions that the nurse asked me was if I got the vaccine recently. Not a question about Covid. A question about the vaccine. The "cure". She thought that I was another case of "rare" vaccine side effects. She really seemed worried and it felt genuine. Keep in mind that I got there in an ambulance it wasn't just some headache or something.</p>
<p>And then you got the doctor a little bit later asking me if I'm vaccinated. I just said that I wasn't. Then she started saying the usual crap of "oh no the variants" and everything. It felt like just another Faucist telling me the same arguments that come out of the media. Just fear mongering. She talked to me as if I had a cognitive issue or something. Told me to get Pfizer asap. </p>
<p>Just goes to show how polarizing the pandemic is even in hospitals. The very people who should know the most about it and experienced it first hand don't even seem to be on the same page when it comes to covid or the vaccine. And today is just one example of this. I got other little stories like this, but this is the first one related to the vaccines. Granted, a nurse is no doctor, but I think that stuff like this shouldn't be overlooked. Especially with all the whistleblowers that we heard about. </p>
<p>I'm very glad I found this sub by the way. You guys are great.</p></p>

        <p>I work in a hospital and have through this whole ordeal. The ER is not indicative to how busy a hospital is or how many beds are empty. Sometimes the ER can be crazy for no other reason than it's 4am on a Sunday. But what I can tell you is that I haven't CT scanned or x-rayed a single patient that displayed typical covid lung that was seen on the original wave. Infact I only saw about 6 patients presenting with 'ground glass opacity'  during the winter rush 7 months ago. Most of the cases in the winter were 'pneumonia' that were cleared with anti-biotics,  meaning it was most likely caused by mask wearing, But we're still counted as covid, termed 'covid pneuomonia'. This delta variant is complete bullshit, my hospital has zero covid patients, April 2020 there were over 200.</p>

        <p>There is no law that says media has to tell the truth. </p>
<p>There used to be back in the day, a law that made it so news reporters would have to clarify if they ended up being wrong about something. I believe that was repealed in the 70's by nixon or someone. </p>
<p>Now they just repeat shit over and over and hope people are dumb enough that they wont take 15 minutes out of their busy ass day to read a newspaper, a book, or even multiple articles about one subject on the internet. </p>

        <p>Probably should have done that, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. It's pretty much the first time that something like this happened and I understand that they are told to talk about the vaccine. I was just a bit bothered by the way the doctor talked to me about it.</p>

        <p>In my clinic, people are about 2/3:1/3 vaxxed:unvaxxed.   Even the physicians (I'm one of the unvaxxed).  In our environment, we all respect each other's decision. We work with a  high risk population and we recommend vaccination all the time, whether or not we personally have it.  If somebody expresses reservations about it, we walk through the risk benefit with them.  Maybe they get it, maybe they don't.</p>
