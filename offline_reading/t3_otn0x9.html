    <strong>I don't want to live</strong>
    <p><p>Very personal rant but no other sub will understand </p>
<p>I literally have no future. I was forced to waste half my in school which ruined my already horrible mental health that I inherited from my dad even more. I have been strongly antiwork and antinatalist before this scamdemic and this circus reinforced those things. My deep and absolute hatred for 99.9% of humanity was once again validated</p>
<p>I don't seek anything in this life, not anymore. I dread everyday. I would have ended myself long ago if I could but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it and I especially don't want to leave my pets</p>
<p>They took everything from me. All the last opportunities I once had are gone. I lost everything. I may only be 19 but nothing will ever change, humanity will never change. Everything has been going downhill these past years and everyday it gets worse. It won't get better. There is no good in this life</p></p>

        <p>Live just to piss them off. Sure, they've ruined everything and the future is shitty and bleak but you know what? FUCK THEM. Fuck the New World Order and fuck whoever did this. </p>
<p>Your purpose is to get more dogs (maybe get all the dogs) and live your life as a giant fuck you to everyone who sucks. </p>
<p>Then get a few cats, some chickens, a turtle, some fish and if you get a duck just after it's hatched, it will imprint on you and ducks are very cool, friendly, fun little buddies.</p>

        <p>Absolutely pessimistic. I live in a VERY liberal town, and everyone here is crazy about masks. It gets hopeless at times. Especially since I'm younger and have a lot more life to live., Experiencing the aftermath and effects for probably the rest of my life.
At least older folks got a longer portion of their life to actually live!</p>

        <p>I like to just think of life as a rollercoaster ride  , I’m indifferent to most things , just strap the fuck in and ride this bitch good or bad until the ride is over. </p>
<p>Quick background , been flatlined twice, once in 2000 &amp; again in 2001 , didn’t give a shit about life or anything in it . I never thought I’d live this long, but after that second time I realized that if I didn’t care if I died .... well shit ... it gives me the opportunity to live my life anyway that I choose. Once I quit trying to live my life by everyone else’s standards I started to enjoy this beautiful disaster that is life . Sometimes you just need to adjust your point of view , I gave myself the power to do anything I wanted .... because the worse that could happen was death which was something I had already accepted. I use to think that saying “life is what you make it was bullshit” but my life is mine , my decisions are mine, and my consequences are mine .... nobody else’s... I literally doubled my life expectancy already. I like to tell people that when I was at my lowest &amp; had nowhere to turn for help , I didn’t find god , but I found myself . </p>
<p>I think that’s what you need to do , find yourself because whether you realize it or not you are lost. The only one who can figure out where you are or where you are going is you &amp; only you . What worked for me might not work for you , what worked for someone else never worked for me. I can give you understanding of the place you are mentally but the truth is , it’s solely on you to fix you</p>

        <p>Hey there, buddy, let me tell you something.  Lots of people go through something like what you are going through.  Though, the pandemic has to make it suck about 10x worse (lucky you).  But let me assure you that there are brighter days ahead of you.  19 is a tough age.  You still have a lot of shot to figure out.  Society kicks you around and doesn't give you the respect you deserve because of your age.  But, it does get better!  I'm 47 years old now and I have been through some really rough patches, but overall, my quality of life has kept going up Year after year.  When I was 19, I was doing my laundry in bathtub, eating ramen and living off of other people's garbage.  Life gets a lot more interesting and fun in your 20s once you have a few things worked out.  This time will pass.  I predict this Covid bullshit will end 4-9 months from now.  It gets better</p>

        <p>we might have an idea, what if we start a new nation, where we control instead of elites, and then make some good, and seek something, there is nothing but what we make for ourselves, and we need to try to make something good for our future, if everyone just thought this, we wouldnt have the technology for you to send this message, the electricity to power the tech and more, so you have alot to live for</p>
