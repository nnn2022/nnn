    <strong>JC Perez is a name you should know (along with Luc Montagnier)</strong>
    <p><p>I believe these studies/articles are clear enough for a majority of people to interpret, and they call into question a lot of things that are on our minds. There is an effort to discredit the authors without addressing their work… so here it is (some of it).</p>
<p>https://www.granthaalayahpublication.org/journals-html-galley/38_IJRG21_A06_5434.html</p>
<p>“The paradox is that the vaccinated people are made more susceptible to infection by variant viruses in epidemic circulation. It is a well-known ADE effect in RNA viruses which risks being catastrophic particularly for nursing staff.” 
Luc Montagnier.</p>
<p>“The paradox is AN OBSERVATION FACT: those vaccinated against the Cov19 spike protein are more infected with the new delta, lambda variants, etc. These variants are the most distant from the SARS-CoV2 Wuhan initial strain so are in the ideal conditions to induce ADEs.” 
Luc Montagnier.</p>
<p>What is an ADE?
ADE: Facilitating antibodies, ADE (antibody-dependent enhancement) or VAED (vaccine-associated enhanced disease). An ADE stricto sensu where facilitating antigen-antibody complexes bind to the FcgammaRII (CD32) receptors of the membrane of immune cells (mainly monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, sometimes B lymphocytes), which promotes their infection by the virus involved.</p>
<p>The existence of facilitating antibodies in COVID-19: In other words, heterotypic antibodies at low levels (resulting from the covid19 vaccine) are responsible for ADE in people infected with a virus serotype (variant) different from the first infection (original sarscov2 strain targeted by the vaccine.).</p></p>

        <p>Also: https://www.granthaalayahpublication.org/journals-html-galley/34_IJRG21_A06_5435.html</p>
<p>The growth of long Fibonacci structures in the shape of "podiums" for almost all of the variants studied (UK, California, South Africa, India, etc.) suggests the probable folding of the spike mRNA in the form of a "hairpin”, can strengthen the cohesion and the lifespan of this mRNA.</p>
<p>Three final conclusions:</p>
<p>One fact is certain, the two mRNAs of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines will result in a low functionality of the spike vaccine because by doping these sequences in CG rich, their designers, in search of greater STABILITY of these RNAs will have built sequences which, as soon as they are inserted into the human host, will seek to mutate, like SARS-CoV2 variants, towards CG ==&rt; UA forms in order to improve their STABILITY and their LIFETIME...</p>
<p>Secondly, using new biomathematics theoretical methods (Master code and numerical standing waves), and comparing the spikes of the two vaccines of Moderna and Pfizer, we conclude a very probable difference in stability and shelf life of the two respective mRNAs of these two vaccines. However, current “State of the Art” analyzes will only reveal that their two protein sequences are strictly identical. By having modified their synonymous codons using different strategies, no-one can guarantee that the quantity of antibodies generated and sensitivity to variants will be identical in the two cases (Kustin et al, 2021).</p>
<p>Despite the immense progress of Biology, the RNA universe remains today full of unexplained mysteries. However, it is said, as we will see, that it could have constituted the first crucible of life. This is why we will have to exercise the greatest caution, on one hand in the face of an mRNA virus such as SARS-CoV2, but even more in the face of the unpredictable evolution of new vaccines, themselves based on RNA.</p>
<p>We must note the great ADAPTATION power - at the global scale of their genomes - of the most infectious VARIANTS such as the BRAZIL 20J / 501Y.V3 variant (P.1). This is very worrying for the VACCINES &lt;==&rt; VARIANTS run: We demonstrate how the Brazilian variant P.1 which becomes uncontrollable in Brazil in April 2021 has a level of organization of long metastructures of 17,711 bases covering the genome which is 3.6 more important than that of the 2 reference genomes SARS-CoV2 Wuhan and worldwide D614G. We suggest that this high level of overall structure of this variant contributes to the stability of this genome and, possibly, to its greater contagiousness.</p>
<p>Finally, we could propose a causal link between vaccines and variants as suggested in (Megawaty Tan et al, 2021).</p>

        <p>The layman(like myself) will be a bit intimidated by the jargon but it is great that you are spreading studies by scientist who understand the ramifications of ADE and how it affects virus evolution. I think what we all want to know is if ADE pressure will create deadly variants and if so for who? historical events like vaccines making Marek’s disease in chickens lethal raises concern, though, I’m not educated enough to know if that is even comparable. </p>
<p>I realize the likely answer is that no one knows which is why these studies should be at the forefront and not buried by censorship.</p>

        <p>What’s wild is that the articles aren’t stating that ADE is causing the variants, but they are suggesting that there may be a link to the vaccines causing variants, and then those variants having potential to lead to ADE</p>
<p>To me, that’s scary as fuck</p>

        <p>This is actually a helpful article on ADE:</p>
<p>https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/antibody-dependent-enhancement-and-vaccines</p>
<p>HOWEVER: The reference to COVID vaccines in the above article should be taken with a grain of salt because they emphasize the safety of these vaccines (no stage iii yet!) and also emphasize the importance/safety of a proper vaccine introduction process on their site here, which clearly contradicts their own COVID basic safety statements:</p>
