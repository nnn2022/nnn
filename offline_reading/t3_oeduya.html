    <strong>Imagine spending all four years of high school and college online without ever stepping foot into the campus because of “lockdowns”</strong>
    <p><p>That’s the way it’s looking like. I have a classmate who did their generation education these past 2 years and never once set foot on campus. If this keeps on for two more years then there will be a generation of students out there that never got a normal high school or college experience. </p>
<p>Social media was already making social skills a hard skill for those born into it but this pandemic has done more damage for social development.</p></p>

        <p>Some kids have gone their whole life without meeting another kid or seeing anyone but their parents without a mask. But somehow this is acceptable to save the one old person on death's doorstep who'd rather pull the plug than have young people suffer like they have.</p>

        <p>If you're talking about socializing infants, the youngest you can normally be to go to preschool in the US is four. Which is optional and normally seen as a way to build early social skills. Pretty sure there have been plenty of children throughout human existence that gone at least 1.5 years with little to no interaction with other people, assuming that amount of time and age would even matter. I spent a lot of my early childhood in treatment with non hodgkins lymphoma so I would love to see if an infant wearing a mask has more developmental issues than I had as a toddler. I woke up choking on my swollen lymph nodes and was air lifted to St. Jude. If a mask early in my development could have hypothetically prevented that or any of the subsequent chemo I don't think my parents would have objected or have been ostracized. I was forced to grow up coming to terms with the fact that I almost died from something uncontrollable, preventable, or predictable. You're worried about a little kid wearing a mask. Fuck yourself.</p>

        <p>There’s no science to justify closing schools or vaccinating kids for a disease they’re not susceptible to. I think that’s one of the biggest crimes against humanity committed by the doomers</p>
