    <strong>U.K - Involuntary Euthanasia in NHS hospitals. W.H.O`s Covid19 protocols that turn hospitals everywhere into institutionalized genocide camps to fuel the pandemic.</strong>
    <p><p>Ment to talk about this for a  while, and this piece of information came at the right time.(source: <a href="https://twitter.com/Elizabe32413720/status/1389146156169637890?s=20">https://twitter.com/Elizabe32413720/status/1389146156169637890?s=20</a> ). It exposes U.K  but same thing repeats pretty much everywhere around the world.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now this here is just a part of Covid19 pandemic protocols role.The others are:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1)   To be misused by national and international media, reporting in a manipulative way just one part of the story , in order to spread fear and control masses.</p>
<p>Manipulative reporting: "Morgues/Crematories full of bodies, no room, ZOMG trucks full of dead, LOOK we are showing you videos"</p>
<p>Pandemic protocol:  If in a normal day, you have let`s say 20 bodies at the hospital`s morgue, after you apply the pandemic protocol, all those bodies are to be baged and carried out immediately as they have been tested with Covid19 and represent a danger. So what would usualy take 1-3 days to  happen, creates now trucks full of bodies like in Italy, New York, crematories overrun like in China, and more recently India.Pandemic protocols also ban you from performing normal funerals in some countries, like let`s say India. If you normaly take your dead and burn/bury them, now they 'steal' it from you claiming that it`s contagious and dangerous for you to do that  so they will do it, gathering all the bodies in one place.This part of the pandemic protocol creates those absurd media news that so many believe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2)    To transform usual deaths into Covid19 cases. If before the pandemic doctors were reporting worst co-morb as main cause of death, now the protocol tells them to put Covid19, as autopsies are banned and cannot be proven otherwise without one.This also encourages them to care even less about you, as malpractice law suits are not possible anymore in alot of cases.So if an inexperienced doctor or who simply doesnt care about you, wants to get away with it .. you are Covid19 positive.This further leads to wrong diagnostics and wrongfuly applied treatments.So many died beeing denied treatment for previous conditions, because they were Covid19 positive, so they were 'treated' just for that leading to premature death.</p>
<p>Example: If someone is shot 10 times, still breathes after the surgery and then they find him with Covid19 while in ICU .. guess why he died. It`s an extreme example of course , or is it .. ? Abnormal deaths, like suicides, are skipped autopsy if Covid19 positive.  A man falling down the stairs in his own home, spliting his head open, was passed as a Covid19 case, implying that Covid19 made him lose balance. Peoples with 3rd degree burnings on 80 % of their body, died from Covid19 as main cause. Terminal phase cancers are number 1 Covid19 deaths, as all of these peoples  "could`ve lived alot longer if not Covid19." Woman with broken spine denied treatment because there was no Covid19 test available, died same night at home.And cases like this go on forever, becoming a Covid19 statistic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>3) Systematic elimination of those in need of constant healthcare and medicine. If a city has 5 normal hospitals, protocols say that you must transform some (lets say 2) into Covid19 exclusive hospitals.The normal patients are to be redirected to the other 3 hospitals or at home if doctors decide it. By doing this you get two things:</p>
<p>a)    Those 3 hospital become overcrowded and their capacity to treat patients is seriously affected, leading increased waiting time for patients and human errors from doctors as they get exhausted.This also inevitably to unnecessary deaths.The other 2 hospitals stay empty for months, waiting Covid19 patients.(those videos with tik tok nurses you`ve seen all around).</p>
<p>b)    Those sent home, and those that get restricted access to medicine, become critical, as it was normal to happen.They come back at the hospital, but this time they also are Covid19 positive, leading to everything i mentioned in part 2</p>
<p>By doing this, you create a never ending self sustaining system that generates Covid19 deaths from normal patients.</p>
<p>Please notice that when this whole pandemic started, Covid19 hospitals all around the world were empty for months, even tho you were told that "bad virus bad", proving that there was no virus since the start, and those future Covid19 patients are the normal ones that got worse and were tested positive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So by simply applying the pandemic protocols designed by W.H.O, and misusing RT-PCR testing, you manage to create the perfect plausible pandemic.</p></p>
