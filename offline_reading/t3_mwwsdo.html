    <strong>How do you tell someone you don't want /want to wait for the vaccine when you feel pressured, or do you just lie and say you did ?</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like this has been posted somewhere but I can't find it so I'd like to start a discussion.
Everyone is eating the propoganda and the peer pressure to get the vaccine is starting to come on strong. I'm a healthy 30 something year old I'm not elderly. I don't want nor need the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don't want snarky replies like "my body my choice," I am debating on saying how I want to wait until it is FDA approved, like any other vaccine. But I don't want to start annoying debates or feel ostracized so I may just lie and say I got it.
But at the same time, do I give them that satisfaction? that "they won". I think just going along with it but knowing myself that I didn't risk my body is good enough to "pretend to be part of society."</p>
<p>Whats your solution? What do you tell them, or will you lie and say you got it?</p></p>

        <p>I told my parents that I was glad they got it, but covid is a very low risk for me and I want to wait until more research is done on long term effects. It helps that they know about how fucked up big pharma is, particularly the J and J baby powder cancer lawsuit.  </p>
<p>The best way to deal with emotional people is to stay patient, kind, but firm. Recognize that masks and the vaccine make them feel safer, but be firm that the mask and vaccine don't make YOU feel any safer. You feel safe enough already.  </p>
<p>Some people just never grow up, though. Good luck, friend.</p>

        <p>In the interest of social justice and equity, I'm waiting until people in minority and oppressed communities have as much access as privileged communities. I don't want to perpetuate centuries of racism and oppression by getting my shot before similar-risk minority and lower-income individuals are able.</p>

        <p>Think the tide is already turning. One of my co-workers who got it as soon as she could asked me if I was getting it and I said no. She confided in me that she wishes she didn't rush to get it, said she hasn't felt right since her 2nd dose. Surprised me. I'm so use to getting lectured and treated like I'm a toothless moron.</p>

        <p>I tell them I'm not participating in a clincal trial and if they want to be a viral warehouse producing synthetic spike proteins not represented in nature at any point in time that's their choice. </p>
<p>It's amazing this "liquid gold" vaccine has had instances of actually being empty syringes injected in people like at Arlington, VA Kroger, <em>such a tight knit secure system to keep us safe...</em> </p>
<p>Amazing how the ones with the most intimate knowledge (healthcare workers) are still refusing to vaccinate. Interesting that politicians (the old crows being in the susceptable age range) are continuously seen not following their own guidelines and dining indoors maskless. It's obvious a "vaccine" is akin to a "gold star" for a 3rd grader, which falls in line with the escalated infantization of western society.</p>
<p>You can also lie, because they don't know, and it would be illegal for them to find out unless you personally told them. <em>But normalizing this is not good</em></p>

<p>This is actually not a lie if you say to yourself:  If I hit over $900 million dollars of net worth than I am planning to get it.  So with this pre-condition you are not actually lying.  But dont tell anyone else about the precondition, that is your own personal secret.</p>
