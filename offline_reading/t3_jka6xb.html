        <p>I’ll get downvoted for this, but I actually thought the lockdown was pretty relaxing for me as an individual. 
Of course, it fucked our collective economies, brought many people, livelihoods and business into ruin and domestic violence cases sprung up, but for me, I enjoyed every second of the lockdown. Being able to sleep ‘till 2 pm, minimal duties and responsibilities. Felt pretty good living life as a NEET.</p>

        <p>There’s nothing wrong with acknowledging that the lockdown was good for you as an individual. Honestly, good for you. What’s fucked up is a person who benefited from lockdown claiming that we should all be grateful for this “extra time with ourselves and our family”. </p>
<p>It’s like this woman I knew once who thought that only her way of doing things was the right way. As soon as she changed her mind about something, THAT became the only right way to do things. And anyone who did differently was bad or evil or wrong. So pro lockdown people remind me of that tbh.</p>

        <p>the lockdown is pretty cool for me as individual as well. i think it made me realize more than ever where i stand on this "extrovert-introvert scale". </p>
<p>but all these news about</p>
<p>the elderly dieing alone 
or</p>
<p>limiting amounts of wedding attendees
or</p>
<p>crushing food supplies to third world countries</p>
<p>or events, gastronomy and art branch being destroyes </p>
<p>or paranoid people wearing masks in cars by themselves</p>
<p>or nasty politicians enjoying their power games</p>
<p>made it clear sonethings not going right</p>

        <p>My job never stopped so I was working at home whilst not being able to enjoy life. Everyday is exactly the same. Even now that we're in the office off and on it's still chaotic.</p>

        <p>And that's fine.  Lockdowns work out okay for some people.  But even if your lockdown has been okay, you have to be pretty self-centered and oblivious not to understand why they may be an issue for other folks.</p>
