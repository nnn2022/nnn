    <strong>Covid vaccine financial incentives, could they be construed to be a "perverse incentive" in a court case?</strong>
    <p><p>Is it plausible that covid vaccine financial incentives (payments for you to get the jab) could be construed as a "perverse incentive" in a court case, where the person who received the covid vaccine suffers harm, severe health issues, or death?  Legalese "perverse incentive" is <em>Anything that incites, or determines somebody to take action in order to receive that incentive, usually resulting in damaging circumstances afterwards.</em> per <a href="https://thelawdictionary.org/perverse-incentive/">Black's Law Dictionary</a>. It is well understood that Uncle Sam has granted blanket immunity to big pharma in the manufacturer and distribution of said vaccines, which also conveys immunity from litigation for harmful effects of the covid vaccine. But state governments and private businesses which offer fnancial incentives are not granted the same federal immunity. State governments may have granted themselves immunity as well, as seen when kids were forced back into classrooms last year. I know the state I live in granted themselves immunity from prosecution. But what about private corporations that receive federal or state funds and distribute those funds basically as bribes to the sheeple? The federal government is prohibited by law from <em>directly</em> bribing or offering financial incentive to take unapproved experimental medicines. So the feds pay the states or private employers, who then offer or pay the bribes, or "financial incentive". The employer has an already established contractual agreement and obligation with the employee. If the employer now gives you, the employee $100 to get the covid shot, and you suffer a severe health complication, hence the "perverse incentive"; would the employer be liable since you can't sue big pharma or Uncle Sam for this mandated abomination?</p></p>
