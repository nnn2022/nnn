        <p>Now do blackrock, vanguard, goldman, chase, hsbc, any large financial and banking company for that matter. </p>
<p>It's funny when people say shit like "lol why would the elite so this, the economy is on its knees". No, the normal people are on their knees. The ruling class are making a killing.</p>

        <p>They don't understand how the economy actually works because society is economically illiterate and most of the entire field of economics is fraudulent.</p>
<p>I'll look for BlackRock, etc. One thing of note is that they control 10T in assets. Everyone likes to talk shit about the guys in the OP (Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos), but they:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>control less important economic activity (oooh, delivering bugman consoomer shit to your home for $0.10 less than before) than groups like BlackRock (literally manipulating the real estate market to the point that millions of middle class people leave the middle class as they cannot afford a home and fall underwater in home debt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>control orders of magnitudes in less assets (Amazon or Google is 1T in market cap, whereas a BlackRock again controls 10x that).</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street collectively own (at least a piece of) everything. </p>
<p>And I mean, <em>everything</em>. Look up any company, look at the holding companies and you will find they are literally in everything:</p>

        <p>i agree with you that economics is entirely fraudulent. it's just another layer of falsehood that the masses take for granted. if anything this whole covid situation has proven so much "conspiracy theory" of the past and made it very obvious and real.</p>
<p>didn't realise you created this table, thought it was a repost or something. good work, i would be interested if you did do one for the entities i mentioned.</p>

<p>That's a very interesting effect to me. Truth tends to be "sticky". Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. If people have truly been awakened, then the past couple of years may have been somewhat worth it.</p>
<p>I actually didn't create that table though. If you follow the link in my top comment, you'll see where I got it from.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to expand on the economy thing.</p>
<p>The monetarist school is just propaganda for the old regime, and the right wing free market people are just controlled opposition. Anything relating to physical economy is suppressed. The actual policies that would truly help (NAWAPA, reinstate Glass-Steagall, etc) are suppressed. And likely, technology that would make energy creation or transportation cheaper is suppressed, as those lie at the very core of the real, physical economy.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve already shown that the Federal Reserve, taxes, and the national debt are shams. As this comic shows, the GDP is a sham. The economy is increasingly made up of activity that does absolutely nothing, as was the case in Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>In b4 "tax them!" </p>
<p>The Federal government runs about a 25-50% deficit every year. That means that the government does not really operate on taxes. Instead, it operates on private bank usury. The banks get rich from our national dependency on their loans, and we tax citizens just to pay the interest on these loans.</p>
<p>Instead of the taxes being used to pay for the government, they are used to extract money from YOU and put it in the pockets of the money-creating private banks that control the system. You are CATTLE on a TAX FARM.</p>
<p>Here's how the system actually works.</p>
<p>Privately-owned central banks:
  1. generates fiat currency out of thin air
  2. lends fiat currency to government at interest</p>
<p>Government:
  1. borrows currency from privately-owned banks at interest
  2. disperses the borrowed fiat in any and all ways it can even remotely justify without causing an open revolt, but it still owes the debt
  3. taxes its citizens in perpetuity to pay the interest-bearing loans.
  4. continues this cycle while government debt (at all levels) increases until <code>(Annual Tax Revenue) = (Interest-only Payment on the Debt)</code>. </p>
<p>Redefinition of terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>"New Normal" = Same as the old normal, just more transparent</li>
<li>"New World Order" = the actual Old World Order</li>
</ul>
