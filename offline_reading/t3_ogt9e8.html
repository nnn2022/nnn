    <strong>Urgent Care Visit and No-Contact Procedures</strong>
    <p><p>I went to an urgent care clinic last week to have a cyst looked at. As soon as I walked in, the receptionist asked if I had a mask I could put on. I sternly said no, and she begrudgingly went into her desk and grabbed one and handed it to me. I put it on halfway, and she just kind of stared at me like "WTF dude". She asks me if I had a smartphone to which I lied and said "Nah, what's that?" She rolled her eyes and handed me a clipboard with a registration form. She told me to go back to my car and fill out the form. I told her I didn't have a car (I actually did walk there) and lied by saying I had to sell it after losing my job due to Covid. I waited twenty minutes dicking around on my phone in the waiting room, and when the nurse came to grab me, he was only partially wearing a mask. When I asked if I could take mine off, he basically said in so many words "Yeah man, idgaf". Ditto for the doctor.</p>
<p>I feel it necessary to fight these absurd "protection" measures at all costs. Sharing a pen isn't going to create a granny genocide. And if it was, why are shared clipboards acceptable? Unfortunately, hospitals and medical facilities are one of the few places that we are at the mercy of and simply going to a competing organization will yield the same result. </p>
<p>Also, for all of the naysayers, my blood pressure was jacked up when I had my BP taken with the mask on, but when they checked it again immediately before discharge, it dropped down to healthy levels, almost an hour after undonning the mask. I was told that I am full of shit by multiple people, especially family, when I said that masks cause my BP to spike. This is now the second time this has happened. And before you mention White Coat Syndrome, consider that before Covid I never had blood pressure anywhere near as high as it is while wearing a mask. Coincidence much?</p></p>

        <p>I went up two flights of stairs wearing a mask and was instantly out of breath. In the meantime I can run 10k no problem without a mask. Masks do make you weaker.</p>

        <p>I was working out with a mask for a few months with a HR monitor on and could see my HR. It was crazy crazy high . No mask and it’s so much easier to run and lift and my HR doesn’t scare  me.</p>

        <p>I liken your experience to when I last went to nike outlet. Grabbed some shoes &amp; looked for a seat to try them on. I went all over the store. No avail. Went to the front &amp; asked if there was a seat somewhere for try-ons. Was told no. I tossed the shoebox on the counter ripped my mask off &amp; left.</p>
<p>Fuck a mask mandate.</p>

        <p>On a similar note, fitting room closures are incredibly stupid. You can't try clothes on in-store but you can take them home and return them at a later date.</p>

        <p>Didnt know that. It's really unbelievable. I'm so behind in all this.  Ironically I haven't shopped for clothes to even need a dressing room all of last year or this one. Now I understand the bullshit rationale for fedex taking the balls off the pool table at my former job.</p>
<p>EDIT: wait a minute you mean to tell me people have to try them on elsewhere where more blasé &amp; less caution will be taken &amp; then come back to recop for fitting failures? This shit is too over the top.</p>
