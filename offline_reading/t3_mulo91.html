        <p>So first off the author doesn't work in infectious disease.</p>
<p>The author makes simply innacurate statements like</p>
<p>&rt;Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter (the virus is 1000 times smaller), SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 doesn't travel as an isolated virus, it travel in aerosols and droplets which can be stopped by masks</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505369/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505369/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Fine particles contained 8.8 (95% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding.</p>
<p>They also assert that 99% of cases are asyomptoatic which is unsourced and not supported by meta-analysis suggesting it's more like 17%</p>
<p><a href="https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030">https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030</a></p>
<p>The only real analysis of whether masks are effective at preventing the wearer from spreading the virus (which is the reason they are being suggested.) comes from a single meta-analysis that actually finds in favour of masks, but the author criticises it's methods.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620311429">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620311429</a></p>
<p>&rt;Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection, with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar.</p>
<p>This meta-analysis is not the only one looking at this question, but the author cherry picks this one in particular and ignores others that find masks are useful at preventing transmission.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(20)31043-9/fulltext">https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(20)31043-9/fulltext</a></p>
<p>&rt;Wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection</p>
<p><a href="https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00475-6">https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00475-6</a></p>
<p>&rt;The result of this meta-analysis has shown significant reduction in infection with face mask use</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is trying to extrapolate and infer associations where they haven't been demonstrated, paraphrasing but they have a source that says masks eliminate human-human connectivity, and then infer that this results in 'low contact frequency' which is then associated with worse health outcomes. This is not good science, you cannot just join the dots like this and assert there are associations where none have been scientifically investigated.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure he was first on the chopping block had Trump won in 2020.  Fauci was one of those people that was able to get front and center and if he would have been fired before the election, it would have hurt Trump.  It was a no win situation.  But I would have still fired the fucker, publicly, during a national address.</p>

        <p>First source I looked into in that paper: </p>
<p>"In early publication the WHO stated that “facemasks are not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons” [14]. In the same publication, the WHO declared that “cloth (e.g. cotton or gauze) masks are not recommended under any circumstance” [14]."</p>
<p>Referenced WHO document: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>
<p>No such quote found in the said WHO advice stating "facemasks are not required..."</p>
<p>Nor could I find the quote regarding cloth mask recommendations.</p>
<p>Not looking good for sole author Baruch VAINSHELBOIM</p>
