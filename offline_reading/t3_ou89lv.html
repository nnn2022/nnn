    <strong>“But he was vaccinated “</strong>
    <p><p>So today at work we found out one of our supervisors got covid even though he was vaccinated . We waited for two hours outside the building to figure out if we could even work today. Even though we all live pretty close to the office , it’s a rural area so there’s not really a choice not too, our other supervisors and union rep were no where to be found . </p>
<p>Despite being the office doomer who can’t stop talking about how “the delta variant is 250 times stronger than regular covid “ and trying to hide her smile of glee at the idea of making everyone , including the vaccinated people , wear masks again she was no where to be found . One of the unvaccinated people she’s been hounding pointed out that if it was him she would have been there . </p>
<p>Eventually one of our sups showed up , who had been working all week with the guy who caught covid ,and it was decided from our boss and Union ,that we still were going to work , we didn’t need to get tested ,or have the office cleaned , and from now on wether you’re vaxed or not need to get to wear a mask . </p>
<p>The phrase that kept being repeated was “but he was vaccinated , how could he get covid”?</p></p>

        <p>It's garbage.  People can still contract and spread it.  It's sole benefit is reduction in severity, but even that is suspect.  The absolute risk reduction shows that the base risk for severe Covid is already miniscule.</p>
<p>There's nothing to recommend the Covid shot to anyone except those over age 70 or who have multiple severe disease states.</p>
