    <strong>My Doctor told me yesterday, 'If you refuse to wear any old face covering to the surgery, you can have your blood test in the car park'</strong>
    <p><p>This was possibly one of the weirdest and most depressing visits I've ever had to the doctor. I spent about 20 minutes debating some of these issues we debate here, which were met with all the standard responses you'd expect. 
I said 'do you seriously think that it's rational to take a blood test outside in the rain as opposed to in here in a sterile environment?' She said yes, because it's protecting you and me from the virus' She said she knew several healthy people, who had dropped down dead from covid. I said 'just covid, no underlying issues?' 'Just covid' she replied. But then the several people she'd just mentioned, became two and both of them happened to be ex military, just like she was, just like the other doctor is. She said, 'I don't know how to convince you that this thing is real' But I had never at any point suggested that it wasn't real. All I'd said was, 'I have an exemption card, issued by the UK government, which says I don't need to wear a mask so I'm wondering if I need to wear one to come to the doctors today' 
The whole experience left me reeling with a mix of emotion, disinformation, gaslighting, mind fucking and a distinct lack of oxygen.</p></p>
