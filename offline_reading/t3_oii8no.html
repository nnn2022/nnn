    <strong>It’s all about the patents</strong>
    <p><p>I just listened to a medical doctor tonight talk about alternative treatments for Covid.  He was talking about how the FDA censors doctors and how they control what can and cannot be prescribed in rather scary detail.  Basically the FDA and CDC “self researched” covid vaccine with SARS COVID back when it was around.  They patented their findings and now are using them to profit immensely. Fauci included</p>
<p>The FDA will NEVER acknowledge anything other than a vaccine as a possible treatment for Covid because they will lose the EUA for the vaccines.  Most medical groups have been instructed to prohibit doctors from prescribing anything like Ivermectin with threatening them with losing their medical licenses.  This is why you never heard anything except from smaller doctors or those who have forsworn medical groups.</p>
<p>Just wanted to pass this along.</p></p>

        <p>I have thought about this so many times over the months, I work in healthcare and I kept thinking why are we not talking about treatments at all? We're just letting people sit at home until their lips turn blue and then come into the emergency room at the last minute. At one point this is what they were recommending, just stay home if you can and ride it out. That was actual advice they gave I remember it! It's as if they don't want people treated they only want you to take a vaccine it's the craziest thing ever. I found a doctor near me who has a protocol for treating it and gives virtual appointments and I also found another website that has doctors listed by state who will prescribe prophylactics or they will prescribe certain drugs if you have covid and you need them. Never in my life have I heard such craziness. Not being able to go to a doctor and get assistance, just being bullied into taking an injection.</p>

        <p>To <em>anybody</em> questioning things, none of this makes any sense.  If you add up the little things you see that just don’t make any sense, this is absolutely a snow job on the world’s people and it needs to be over and we need justice.</p>

        <p>April 2020 - In Victoria and Queensland Australia they reclassified hydroxychloroquine a poison and made it a criminal offence for any unauthorised person to supply it. Comes with a fine up to $16000 and up to 6 months prison. A dentist and a dermatologist are authorised... But a gp is not.... But who would someone with covid potentially seek medical assistance from? Pfft..</p>
<p>As soon as Trump put it out there that it might have something to do with treating the virus that was about to shut down the world economy, TPTB moved quickly to make sure as few people as possible would have access to it. Very telling. </p>
<p>What this showed was the politicians are not interested in ending this at all. So every single measure they try and implement after that time, is bullshit. Every last thing from masks to lockdwns. These people need to be voted out, and maybe even be held responsible for neglegence, or outright corruption. These idiot politicians either don't know the facts, or they do know the facts and choose to disregard them and do whatever they need to to progress their own agenda.</p>

        <p>And in countries where the FDA has no authority? Wouldn't countries with no vaccine manufacturing, but who can easily produce generic versions of existing drugs, be all over a cheap, effective treatment?</p>

        <p>Adding on this this because I was tired last night and forgot this part.  He said he PERSONALLY knew of 20 VAERS cases that were either altered or deleted and that his collection of doctors (numbering in the thousands) could come up with over 100,000 names/VAERS case numbers that were either deleted, or altered to show the client recovered when they did not.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
