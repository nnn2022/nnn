        <p>Which is why, before this whole hoax kicked off, we never had adequate testing nor widespread usage of cold and flu viruses. </p>
<p>They just weren't necessary. By the time you feel sick, get to the doctor, and get a flu test, you're already halfway through it. No major medical treatments were necessary because you felt crummy for 2-3 days then were back to normal. </p>
<p>There's a reason it was called the common cold. It was just commonplace to have it. </p>
<p>Now people have lost their minds and seemingly have no problem tossing their liberties and their bodies to the whims of politicians and pharma.</p>

<p>The flu vaccine was 17% accurate. And if you were lucky enough to get the 1 in 6 chance of being adequately vaccinated, it still wouldn't stop the spread. </p>
<p>The flu kills thousands. Older people at the end of their lives. Nobody lives forever. The average lifespan in the US is 78 years. The average age of someone who dies of wuflu is 78. Wow. That's coincidental. </p>
<p>Also the death rate in the US for 2020 was 0.9 per 100,000, same as the 3 prior years. Where did 600,000 deaths come from? Curiously deaths from cancer, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes all fell last year. </p>
<p>Nobody's dying of covid they're just reallocating the numbers. </p>
<p>&rt;If you were healthy, yes. Unfortunately, Covid is much more aggressive than the Common Cold but is in the same family. </p>
<p>Then why is the death rate last year identical to previous years? Why did the average life expectancy in the US <strong>RISE</strong> by 0.25 years during this horrible pAnDeMiC? </p>

<p>Unemployment went up by 10% last year. 1 in 10 lost their jobs. Many small businesses had to close their doors forever. Children were prevented from going to school. Amusement parks, concerts, museums, and all other recreational activities were canceled. Testing was mandated by most schools and many employers. And now we're looking at possible mandatory experimental genetic therapy shots (that don't prevent, treat, cure, or mitigate transmission, per the manufacturers) just to hold a job.</p>

&rt; The flu kills thousands. Older people at the end of their lives.</p>
<p>The Flu Vaccine regularly updates, as does the virus. It is a constant battle over the two, with the virus usually winning. </p>
<p>It doesn't only kill older people -- It is also harmful to babies and those who are compromised or unhealthy. </p>
<p>&rt;The average lifespan in the US is 78 years.</p>
<p>Lowest of the rich nations, yes, I know. </p>

<p>I wasn't specifying Covid, but the Common Cold. </p>
<p>But can you share your data on these claims? </p>
<p>&rt;Curiously deaths from cancer, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes all fell last year. </p>
<p>A benefit of being allowed to stay at home and not work as hard. Work is stressful for many lives, as I'm sure you're aware. </p>
<p>&rt;Unemployment went up by 10% last year. 1 in 10 lost their jobs. Many small businesses had to close their doors forever.</p>
<p>It's a problem, yeah. </p>
<p>&rt;Children were prevented from going to school.</p>
<p>The youth have it rough. Not only does Covid shut down their schools, but so does Climate Change. They won't forget these things.</p>

        <p>90% of your responses here have been nothing but deflections and whataboutisms. </p>
<p>I love how people who have been living in fear of the very fucking air they breathe now have the gall to dismiss valid concerns about an experimental injection.</p>
<p>Riddle me this, Einstein.</p>
<p>-Where's your data on long term studies with this mRNA vaccine?</p>
<p>-What were the results of animal testing and how was the composition of the mRNA vaccine altered before implementing trials on people?</p>
<p>-Why does this vaccine have more deaths and adverse effects than any other vaccine before it if you think its the safest option to take?</p>
<p>-Why is the immune system not a viable option instead of the vaccine if 99% of the average population recovers without hospitalization and largely without symptoms?</p>
<p>I hardly think refusing a rushed, experimental "vaccine" that's being aggressively marketed through propaganda, promise of free doughnuts and fascistic coercion tactics compares to shutting down the planet for something that, in your own mind, can be defeated by wearing a fucking bandana over ones mouth.</p>
