    <strong>I Don't Need The Vaccine For a "Disease" of 99.7% survival rate. In Fact, No Healthy Person Needs it. It's That Simple.</strong>
    <p><p>You doomer clowns, just go on r/covidvaccinated and see for your blind selves. Literally, every other post there is about the harmful side effects of this rushed "vaccine" which people have been experiencing for more than many months now. How fucking stupid you have to be to inject yourself with a rushed "vaccine" for a so called "disease" which has a 99.7% survival rate? </p>
<p>Are you that fucking dumb? Basically, you people's logic is, "We should gamble and take a vaccine who's long term side effects aren't even known, because it will save us from a virus which is already guaranteed to save us 99.7%."
This is your logic. And what's your argument to us? If we dont want this what I like to call "slave mark" (in regards to obedience to your master fauci). "B-b-but you'll spread the virus to other people!" You little fucks are telling Me that when this is the same vaccine you have been proudly fantasizing and injecting in yourselves with, which never even got approved by the FDA! Yes. And yet, I'm the conspiracy theorist? </p>
<p>The vaccines that you are worshipping are causing side affects in people, and you want to know the funny part? The long term affects aren't even fucking known! You guys praise science that they have made a vaccine in less than a year, yet even FDA didn't approve this vaccine. And to add a final nail in the coffin, even Pfizer's CEO still hasn't gotten his fauci ouchie yet. When in fact him being the CEO he should have gotten it first. You guys lack simple common sense and don't see the signs around you. Yet, we are the villains?</p>
<p>All this that's happening is a joke and an overblown meme virus. It was never about a virus, rather all these mandatory vaccines and again I'll reiterate for a fucking "disease" that has 99.7% survival rate is not justifiable. At all. All these lockdowns, destruction of the economy, people losing jobs and mental sanity being destroyed has ruined more lives than this "virus" itself. You doomers are just being lab rats for fauci and the government, and obediently giving away all your rights thinking the government actually gives a fuck about you. They don't. If they did, they wouldn't have destroyed the economy, kids/adults mental sanity in staying locked home all day and fearing each other. Where I live, you can't even buy clothing or a simple thing as a pen anymore as it all comes under "non essential" items. Wtf does a pen have to do with all this? It was never about a virus. It's all about control. Wake up before it's too late doomers.</p>
<p>Economic destruction, skyrocketing inflation rates, more restrictions and control is just on it's way.</p></p>

        <p>Bruh... those U.S. cities that 'don't have clean drinking water' are by and large run by conservative idiots trying to 'save a buck' that ends up costing the populace billions in harms to children from lead and other water contaminants.</p>

        <p>Consider the selection bias on the vaccine sub; people posting about extreme side effects aren’t the majority. There’s a lack of long term testing, meaning you can’t 100% trust it, but you still shouldn’t be afraid of dying from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The CDC. The average mortality rate is .3%. For young children and young adults I believe it’s 99.9% survive it. Over 80 is lower obviously but it rounds to 99.7 across the board. I don’t believe this takes into account someone with another condition which would effect their recovery from covid</p>

        <p>So people are lying when they said they’ve suffered long terms from the vaccine and they were healthy before?
Your still talking about some fraction of a % when we know for a fact lockdowns are contributing to 50% of the mortality rate because their stopping people form preventing the most common forms of death.
How do you justify that?</p>

        <p>What long term issues? I haven't heard of any. The most deadly one is the blood clot with a 0.0065% chance of happening, which is far less than the death rate you lot love talking about</p>

        <p>They aren't exactly reporting that there are people who have side effects for over a month either without going away. Look I get most people don't experience this, but most people won't die from covid either. And we still don't know the long term effects. We are literally in the experimentation phase, people should understand this when deciding to participate. It should be alarming they are pushing for an experiment without a control group. We have a year of the CDC, the who, faucci and everyone else being wrong every step of the way. It's sane and reasonable to question these vaccines.</p>

I’m aware a lot of people here think oh I’ll be fine but don’t think about others and how bad the virus can be to them.

        <p>It's clearly a political agenda. If we were following science, we'd never lock everything down. We'd protect the most vulnerable and vaccinate them only and those who want to anyways. </p>

        <p>So you have to lock every one down ? Its not possible to tell only the vulnerable to stay home and wait for a vaccine ? We know who the most vulnerable people are since at least 6 months. The death rate and even the hospitalization rate for everyone else is ridiculously low, especially in students and younger, so why the school closures ? Why did we sacrifices small business, mentally ill people and poor people AGAIN, going against every rational approach ?</p>

        <p>So only they lockdown and then young people spread it so it never stops. If we all just locked down early on done in a few weeks like New Zealand. Since we didn’t all lock down even if vulnerable people stayed in it would still be present and make people very sick they may not die but can still get sick.</p>

        <p>Yeah just lock down harder it will work for sure. Lockdown some more as soon as a case is found. We must eradicate this mild disease from the face of the earth even if it takes 5 years of lockdowns and force vaccinating people. 99.7% survival rate with vaccines available is unaceptable.</p>
<p>Who gives a shit if kids spread it ? They'll build immunity among them. If you're worried get vaccinated, you will be protected.</p>

        <p>I don't think you understand. I don't give a fuck about 0 cases, it shouldnt be a pre requisite to live normaly again. As soon as new zealand opens to tourist without stupid quarantines covid will spread again and then what ? Lockdowns for months ? </p>
<p>So what are the options ? Closing the country forever ? Mandatory testing and 2 weeks quarantine everytime you want to travel ? Does this sound reasonable for a virus that kills only 0.3% and for which a vaccine AND treatments are available ? </p>
<p>Next year 10s of thousands of people will die because of the flu. Should we lockdown for every single disease that has a risk of killing you ? 
People died, and people will die. Get over it, if the death rate was 5+% regardless of age then maybe this madness would be warranted, but for covid its just not.</p>

        <p>It is NOT the governments job to protect people.  I don’t know who told you that but that is not true.  The government is there to make sure our freedom and rights are upheld, and they have failed miserably.</p>
