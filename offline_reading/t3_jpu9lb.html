    <strong>Imperialism and Covid Totalitarianism</strong>
    <p><p>I began to see through all this nonsense when I realized the US war machine wasn’t hampered in any way. Before even the mask mandates and Covid hysteria my views were considered “conspiracy theories” and “radical” because I thought that maybe the US shouldn’t be occupying and sanctioning countries who never attacked them. I believe myself to be an anti-imperialist, and have an extra layer of bias as a muslim because I have a personal connection to many of those being killed and subjugated by the US military. All I want is for people to live freely and make their own choices, I don’t want people forcing their beliefs on me nor will I force my beliefs on others. The US military under the excuse of freeing people from the control of authoritarian governments, controls the people once they mass murder the country and remove the authoritarian government (its replaced by a usually even more corrupt and authoritarian government, for example in Afghanistan the anti-taliban government/militias have lots of pedophiles). Hence why I’m against this practice of imperialism regardless the excuse, it’s still using force to bend others to your will. </p>
<p>Returning back to Covid-totalitarianism, in the beginning I was fairly worried about what Covid would do to Iran considering how the media was screeching about it. I didn’t trust the media but there was so little information about it. On the other hand I hoped that the US may calm down a little due to having to deal with Covid. Well, both situations never occurred and instantly woke me up to that Covid was a scam, a psychological operation by the government to increase their control over us. Iran, the second most sanctioned country on the planet (North Korea is number one but is funded by economic powerhouse China) had a walk in the park with Covid, like EVERWHERE ELSE as I would soon notice. Nothing happened to stop the US military from continuing their genocide of Yemen  and occupation of many other countries. These same people who have no trouble ordering the mass murder through targeting of water facilities and food storage, sanctions, and just plain old bombs SUDDENLY care about “if we save just one life...”. This discrepancy was not lost on me and I understood that the biggest threat as always was the government. </p>
<p>Now I get if several of you aren’t aware of the crimes committed in our name worldwide. Many may have a mainstream view of the military, as just good guys here to save us from terrorism. But maybe during this time you’ll realize that the terrorists are the government and the massive monopolies which control the government. There are some who do independent reporting on US imperialism if you’re interested, such as Vanessa Beeley and The Last American Vagabond who was basically removed from YouTube but you can find him on bitchute. These reporters realized that the US imperialism wasn’t being slowed down in any way by Covid, which began their investigative work on Covid as well. I feel if we’re going to oppose the government’s crimes in destroying freedom we should oppose it from all angles, whether it’s against people we agree or disagree with.</p>
<p>For right now my focus is primarily on Covid totalitarianism as it’s even more widespread in its effect on freedom, and selfishly I would say because it effects me more. But these pro lockdown Covid masochists can never explain why the US military is killing all these people under the same orders of the politicians who want to “save lives”. This is one question my family and friends can never respond to, maybe they’ll use Madeleine Albright’s words “we think it’s worth it”. Well if they think it’s worth it to starve the young and kill the general population for some petty military and economic objective, why do these governments suddenly care about “saving grandma”?</p></p>
