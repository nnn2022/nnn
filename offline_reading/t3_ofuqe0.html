    <strong>What in the actual f*ck is going on now?</strong>
    <p><p>So, contradicting their earlier contradictory contradiction, our County Health Stasi just informed us that "we should all wear masks, even vaccinated people."  This came in the same presentation where they said that "Stay at Home Orders weren't needed at this time."</p>
<ol>
<li>Counties have no ability to create lockdown orders like this. The fact they even mentioned it is terrifying to me. I live in a blue county in a very red state. This actually wouldn't even be legal and would be viciously battled in court.  </li>
<li>Who's dick do I have to suck next to keep the Stasi happy?  I got my vaccination because my workplace basically coerced us into doing it. But apparently that's not good enough.  So I have to go back to wearing a fucking rag on my face all day and looking like a fucking hypochondriac imbecile even though I have the vaccine that they forced me to get and that made me so sick?  </li>
<li>If there is a political party that opposes this slide toward totalitarianism they will get all my extra cash in 2022 and 2024.</li>
