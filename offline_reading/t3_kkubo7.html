    <strong>Simple math will prove that your germs won't do shit to people.</strong>
    <p><p>In the US, around 30,000 people die of the flu each year.</p>
<p>Life expectancy in the US is around 80 years.</p>
<p>The US population is 300,000,000.</p>
<p>30,000 x 80 = 2,400,000</p>
<p>2,400,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.008</p>
<p>This means that 1 in 125 Americans (or less than 1% of Americans) will kill someone with the flu in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Even if those statistics are enough to make you wary of the germs you spread, you'd probably just extend someone's lifespan by a year or two. Keep in mind that before April 2020, people often said "it was just their time" when referring to people who died from the flu.</p>
<p>As for COVID-19, the pandemic will have only lasted one year, so if 300,000 people have died from the virus in the US, a little over 0.1% of Americans have killed someone by giving them COVID-19, which is only around ten times as many Americans as with the flu each year.</p>
<p>Also, even if the bubonic plague came back, I still wouldn't wear a mask because the people afraid of the virus would just stay home (and vulnerable folks should do the same with COVID). Hell, if the bubonic plague came back, I'd probably stay home myself, for my own safety!</p>
<p>There's also the thing with herd immunity. Even if only shopping once a month (for your own safety) is an impossibility (which it's not), being germophobic is actually killing more people than if we all pretended the pandemic doesn't exist (or coughed at spat on each other as much as possible, idk). If we don't all get sick at around the same time, the pandemic will last much longer, therefore killing more people. The "multiple waves" are actually caused by people's immunities wearing off.</p>
<p>Sorry, but neither authoritarianism nor "social responsibility" will never be logical to me.</p></p>

        <p>Here’s a problem with your math. Covid, WITH all the lockdowns and masks and social distancing and isolation and quarantines, is 10 TIMES as deadly as the flu is with zero restrictions. Without all these extra safety measures, the death toll would be significantly higher. The mortality rate of covid is likely much higher than 10x that of the flu. </p>
<p>Second. Bubonic plague still exists. It’s much less deadly than previously because we have vaccinations and modern medicine to save lives. Covid is more of a danger because we currently have no treatment, only a limited quantity of vaccinations. </p>
<p>Third and last point. The reason we need to flatten the curve is because that is what is ensuring that most of the young/healthy people who get covid will survive it because they have access to medical care and ventilators. This will lead to a higher death rate too. Our social responsibility to flatten the curve is not only about the old and vulnerable. It is to protect the rest of us who may get it and will need hospital beds to be available.</p>

        <p>First of all, 50% of people aren't socially distancing or wearing masks.</p>
<p>Second of all, I'm not anti-vax. Where did you get that idea?</p>
<p>Lastly, why would young people go to hospitals over a flu-like virus? COVID-19 is much like the flu; the vast majority of the deaths are of extremely old people (probably years away from death's door anyways).</p>

        <p>The ten times more deadly number is an incorrect statistic. It originated when the Who mistakenly compared the CASE fatality rate of COVID to the INFECTION fatality rate of flu. That, combined with the fact that COVID deaths with significant comorbidities are listed as pure COVID deaths helps inflate the death rate. Comparing the case fatality rate of both and adjusting for co-morbidities reveals that COVID and the flu are fairly similar, albeit the flu does have a vaccine and COVID does not yet. Or is just now getting one, which will help tremendously.</p>

<p>That's wrong. Vaccinations don't work on Bubonic Plague, because it's a bacteria, which the immune system fights differently than a virus. Bacteria work differently than viruses and attack the body differently. Unlike viruses, bacteria reproduce on their own, they don't need to hijack the body's own cells to replicate. Bacterial infections can be cured by antibiotics. </p>
<p>There is no cure for viruses, only our own immune systems cure them. The immune system is literally the only way to actually fight a virus effectively...that is all vaccines do...stimulate the immune system to make specific antibodies against a specific pathogen. Bacterial diseases we can use antibiotics on...and.that is what makes this truly a tragedy. It's the 21st century...no one has to die of tuberculosis, because it's completely curable. We have the antibiotics for it, and it can actually be eradicated, or brought down to negligible numbers. But every single year, between 1.5 million and 2 million die of it, and millions more are infected because the vast majority live in impoverished countries that these same sanctimonious pricks don't give a damn about.</p>
