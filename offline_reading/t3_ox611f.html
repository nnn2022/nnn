    <strong>Hear me out. I am 100% against what you people believe, but listen to me for a moment.</strong>
    <p><p>You complain about having to wear a mask for the 10-15 minutes you go to the supermarket, while Doctors on the other hand, wear them for hours on end, so I‚Äôm pretty sure your being a little bitch over a piece of cloth that you wear while you go for shit at Tesco.</p>
<p>You complain about a lockdown, during a global pandemic. Our ancestors would gladly stay indoors, wear a mask and try the fucking cure, but you people, act like we are being shoved in cages and FORCED to get the vaccine. You are not being forced. You‚Äôre being recommended it. The under-paid worker at GameStop isn‚Äôt FORCING me to pre-order, just recommending it.   </p>
<p>Please just realise how dumb you are being. Please.</p></p>

        <p>Well look at what the fuck you‚Äôre advocating for. We are not being forced? If businesses are locking people out of society until they take a shot paid for by Big Gov. it‚Äôs fascism and you‚Äôre a fascist. </p>
<p>Read the Nuremberg code dickweed. </p>
<p>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; </p>

        <p>&rt; You complain about having to wear a mask for the 10-15 minutes you go to the supermarket</p>
<p>Here in Europe we spent the last 6 months of winter not being legally allowed to leave our homes unless for grocery shopping and emergencies. How can you even still claim that it's "because of a mask" is beyond me.</p>
<p>&rt; You are not being forced. You‚Äôre being recommended it.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. They're talking about forcing you to take a swab every 48 days if you want to go to work here in my part of the world. Indoors dining, and pretty much everything indoors will be off limits for me starting next week. Air/rail travel too.</p>
<p>If they wanted to force it, they could here. They could make it compulsory by law. But they're doing this instead.</p>
<p>&rt; Please just realise how dumb you are being. Please.</p>
<p>You know, at least I'm talking for myself, we have <em>plenty</em> of doubts. We generally want to be wrong, because if we're right we're all fucked - included you, yes. If you think they're going to let you live after the injection, you're not reading the room. Maybe you haven't even tried to read the room.</p>
<p>Just a humble suggestion: there's plenty of info here. Why don't you just try and take a look, just to see how preposterous and ridiculous it is? Just to see how many times we predicted things that turned out to be 100% true - which is going to be near zero, right?</p>

        <p>What evidence would you need to see to understand that you are wrong?</p>
<p>The PCR tests captured the annual flu. The entire pandemic may have been a scam based on these tests. Is that sufficient evidence?</p>
<p>The man who invented the mRNA core technology, Dr. Robert Malone, is calling for a complete halt to the vaccination program until we ascertain whether antibody dependent enhancement (mass casualty event) is happening. Is that sufficient evidence?</p>
<p>Dr. Malone is supported by Nobel prize winning virologist Dr. Luc Montagnier, who is also concerned with ADE, the exact problem that killed or halted all coronavirus vaccine animal tests. Is that sufficient?</p>
<p>The most cited doctor in the National Library of Medicine in the field of virology, Dr. Peter McCullough, is calling for a halt in the vaccination program until we find out if the spike proteins are causing clotting disorders that will eventually kill everyone who took the vaccine. Is that sufficient? </p>
<p>Blood platelets have just one job: they search for things in your blood that are not smooth and round and then release clotting factors, assuming that sharp spikey thing they found is damage. Clotting factors can be detected with a d-dimer test. More than 60% of vaccinated patients given a d-dimer test were positive for clotting factors. Clotting is not a rare event with these vaccines. It's normal and when the clots are in brain, spinal or cardiac tissue, the clots are eventually fatal. Is that sufficient? </p>
<p>The former head of Pfizer's vaccine research arm, Dr. Mike Yeadon is also concerned about the spike proteins escaping into the blood stream, where they are, by definition, prions, which cause serious, fatal disease. Is that sufficient? </p>
<p>The countries with the lowest vaccine uptake are also the countries with the lowest covid numbers. Is that sufficient?</p>
<p>Vaccine adverse effects reporting agencies are reporting mind-boggling numbers of deaths and serious injuries. Is that sufficient?</p>
<p>Put all those things together. Is that sufficient to at least be curious about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines? </p>
<p>If there is NOTHING that can get you to think you might be wrong, you are practicing a religion and there is nothing we can do except exercise our freedom to not share your religious beliefs. Freedom is the most important value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I don't care what you do. Your life is of absolutely no interest to me. How about you return the favor?</p>

        <p>&rt; More than 60% of vaccinated patients given a d-dimer test were positive for clotting factors. Clotting is not a rare event with these vaccines. It's normal and when the clots are in brain, spinal or cardiac tissue, the clots are eventually fatal. Is that sufficient?</p>
<p>Can I have a link for this? I like concise reasons to not get it, this is one!</p>

        <p>&rt;You complain about having to wear a mask for the 10-15 minutes you go to the supermarket</p>
<p>No one is complaining about that dude.  </p>
<p>Let me guess.  Did you keep your job during this time?  Did you lose your business?  Did you see everything you worked hard to build up and accomplish just get wrestled away from you while everyone laughed and called you an asshole?  </p>
<p>Our ancestors sure as shit wouldn't have stayed inside like we did.  We have numerous precedents to prove that.  People needed to continue working and live their lives.  Like we do.  Like you do.  Our ancestors weren't complete and utter cowards shuttering themselves in for a fricking glorified flu.</p>
<p>But really the main thing for you to focus on and understand here is this: <strong>We have all lost something.</strong> Something very dear to us.  Something which meant a lot in our lives.  Our businesses, our livelihoods, our competitions, our art, our relationships.</p>
<p>Collectively, we have lost our freedom and independence.  We have lost trust in each other and in our government.  We have allowed authoritarianism to take over and shape our society.  It is a great shame.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are too young to understand this.  Perhaps you have never opened up a business on your own, or had your hopes and dreams crushed.  Maybe you will one day.  Until then, I suggest you have a seat and listen while some very intelligent and wise individuals educate you on why independence and freedom are so important, and how dangerous now society has become now that we have given that up.</p>

        <p>&rt;You complain about having to wear a mask for the 10-15 minutes you go to the supermarket, while Doctors on the other hand, wear them for hours on end, so I‚Äôm pretty sure your being a little bitch over a piece of cloth that you wear while you go for shit at Tesco.</p>
<p>First they "ask you" to do it for 10-15 minutes, then it is 30-45 minutes, then they "mandate" to wear it for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours until they tell you time to do it for the whole day.</p>
<p>Sure, it is a minor inconvenience until it becomes permanent; just ask the folks over in Australia how's that going with their never ending lock downs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Our ancestors would gladly stay indoors, wear a mask and try the fucking  cure, but you people, act like we are being shoved in cages and FORCED to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that our ancestors would tolerate what is being imposed right now. If that is the case, then I have a bridge over the Atlantic Ocean to sell to you. Secondly, we ARE being shoved into not cages, but quarantine even when we are healthy and are not sick. In addition, we are being FORCED to get the vaccine; look at what is happening with New York, California, New Jersey, France, Germany, Britain, and other parts of the world. They are being told, want to keep your job? Get inoculated! Want to enter a establishment? Get inoculated! Want to access government buildings? Get inoculated!</p>
<p>I'm not sure about you, but being told if you want to keep your job, buy food or enter a venue that you must be inoculated sounds like coercion to me!</p>
<p>If only Anne Frank and her family did the "Reich" thing and obeyed German law, and simply went willingly to Auschwitz, she and her family wouldn't have ran afoul of German law, and be arrested.</p>
<p>You sound like an educated individual, unfortunately, it appears to me you memorized what your teachers told you about history but lack critical thinking skills, deductive reasoning, never bothered to understand history, or to understand the warning signs of tyranny. Just ask the Australians about that one. I just thought I'd clear that one up before any one says I am miscategorizing the context of your statements.</p>
<p>It also appears you have no understanding of the implications of these inoculations, "mandates" or "lock downs" and is simply regurgitating what the MSM, government goons and their collaborators been saying to us in particular, that we are being selfish, we are anti-vaxxers, we don't care about others when that is further from the truth.</p>
<p>Enjoy your tyranny that you have welcomed with open arms for your grand-children, and their great-grand children, you have voted for it and they now most certainly deserve it, and they have YOU to thank for it.</p>
<p>edit: grammar, I know you don't have to repeat it, I suck at it.</p>
