<title>I have literally been called a loser, a moocher, someone who watches netflix all day, a liberal, etc.. I used to work two jobs and take 6 classes. I am a full time student who applies to jobs every day. Why am I being insulted for pointing out that work culture sucks for a lot of working poor people</title>

    <p><p>Last summer,I drove myself to my second job after working all night. I took 6 classes a semester. I am a full time student. I am not a bum or a loser or a mooch. I am so tired of being insulted on this sub. I have repeatedly stated that I value civil liberties, I have stated the lockdown cannot go on forever, I just wanted to share a perspective of why some people want to stay at home forever- their lives sucked and the work culture sucks for a lot of working poor people. </p>
<p>I have been insulted and had people say all types of incredibly rude and harassing things about me. </p>
<p>I am not liberal: I typically follow right wing and libertarian youtubers, I don't consider myself a democrat, I don't hate trump, I don't want a vaccine, I don't want to homeschool my future kids, I don't want to personally starve and abuse children in lockdown.</p>
<p>I just wanted to have a conversation about how stressful work was before the lockdown and how it affects a huge chunk of our population and that these people aren't simply going to go away.</p>
<p>I am not personally saying you should give me money, I don't watch netflix all day, I apply to jobs all day, I am a full time student and I want to participate in society. </p>
<p>I do not want UBI, I do not want welfare for everybody all day long, I do not want bernie to be president. I am sick and tired of being insulted. </p>
<p>If this sub is just a circle jerk to insult liberals and call people lazy (I am not a liberal, but still), then it's just the inverse of the pro lockdown circle jerk subs.</p></p>

        <p>I've noticed the disdain for moochery tends to be applied even when people aren't being mooches, or is conveniently dropped when the ones pointing fingers are mooches themselves.</p>
<p>Like, I get that the world is full of lazy second-hand-lives leeches and people get pissed about those who are coddled and never have to work an honest days work, but any slight criticism of capitism or suggestion that maybe there are entitled assholes on the right as well and suddenly you're the poster boy for the weakling loser class. It's dumb. It's like it's all or nothing. If you're well-off it <em>must</em> be because you earned it and had no handouts or assistance along the way, and if you're poor it's because you are lazy and expect everything handed to you. But the real world ain't so black and white.</p>
<p>I don't know about the attitudes you encounter here, and I know myself that I can pick on lefties (only cuz I feel so goddamn betrayed after a lifetime of listening to false promises), but I encourage you to keep commenting.</p>

        <p>I still remember a point in my life years ago in my college days working graveyard from 12-8, then going to 2nd job for 830-430, and also having an extracurricular obligation tucked in there too. Destroyed my sleep and health for a month and I vowed to never put myself in that position again, and I never have.</p>
<p>If you are living your life in such a way that suicide seems attractive and you have no time to enjoy yourself, perhaps scaling back and living a more minimal lifestyle is the way to go? I don't know your story, but anyone living in the west today who contemplates killing themselves cuz they're overworked could prob just do with letting go of a few luxuries and learning to make do with less. Again, don't know your story, but even homeless unemployed people are living life, ya know?</p>

        <p>You ask any adult, they will tell you about the shitty jobs they worked when younger. The goal is to gain education and skills to get into a career you enjoy. I also worked shitty jobs in high school and college, itâ€™s part of life.</p>

        <p>exactly. I have been called names. I literally am a grad student trying to survive. I worked a day job and a night job before this. I took 6 classes in undergrad before this. I am called a bum after getting yelled at my whole working life by people who live off alimony.</p>
