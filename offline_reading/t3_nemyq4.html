    <strong>My fellow Californians, please check in about masks</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in CA (in the belly of the beast SF Bay Area) and haven’t masked AT ALL since the CDC announcement last Thursday. Yes I’m usually the only one and I’ve been to both big and small stores, and restaurants - all maskless without problem. I’ve had 1 or 2 times where I encountered resistance but it was usually squashed by me just saying “the cdc changed the guidelines” and that was that. </p>
<p>How is everybody else going about this in CA? Since we’re on the extreme side of mask wearing over here, it would be good to share some solidarity behind enemy lines. Btw I know this is pathetic to the rest of the country who have BEEN moved on but what can I say behind the Blue Iron Curtain!? Talk to me Californians!</p></p>

        <p>I'm in the South Bay and ordered a drink at Barnes and Noble yesterday, walked all over the store and browsed with my mask on my chin whether I was sipping or not. No one said anything and I saw another middle-older aged woman also walking around with it on her chin, while her husband still had his all the way up lol. It's hard to know because it seems like it varies not even by region but by <em>neighborhood.</em> It's just sad to me that Californians can't wake up. </p>
<p>Someone I know the other day was blown away by a picture I showed her of people partying in Texas. She was like "what if they get covid?! They don't care?!" And I was like "we're in a BUBBLE." She hadn't even realized everyone else was moving on. People here like to assume everyone is like California.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m shocked most people here don’t even know that Florida or Texas are basically wide open. I show them the same videos, like the recent UFC in Florida where literally 17k people were indoors mostly maskless and it just got such a weird reaction. They just can’t compute. My wife’s cousin was saying they were most likely all tested to get inside and I was like NOPE.</p>

        <p>I’m just south of the Bay Area.....I’ve only ever wore a mask inside businesses. I’ve only been to the grocery store since the CDC announcement and i wore mask as did everyone else inside the store because it’s still required here unfortunately. The only thing I am noticing around here is that less people are wearing masks outdoors. On saturdays my oldest has softball and there are 4 games going at once so the field is packed and almost everyone is maskless!</p>

        <p>Is it required tho? I’m telling you, it just takes a few people here and there to get things going. Just gotta put your money where your mouth is and you can contribute to the reality you want by showing a little bit of courage. I’m not gonna lie I was super tense when I first did it on Thursday but it just gets easier and easier each time. Doooo eeeeiiit</p>

        <p>My city and county both have mask mandates but I believe at the county level they have said masks aren’t required outdoors as long you are socially distanced.
So yes technically masks are still required here. We are required to wear them at the softball/baseball games but nobody does and there is no one out there even attempting to enforce the rule. kids aren’t allowed to play on the playground either (the games are played at a local school that has 4 fields) but it’s always full of kids. My husband did walk inside Starbucks on Friday to pick up his drink &amp; he wasn’t wearing a mask. No one said anything.</p>

        <p>No, there's still a ton of them here, just a few of them left. The tech people are some of the worst, obviously not all of them but a lot of them have barely left their house and are still worried about covid. I liked the former San Diego mayor, it used to be so nice and now there's homeless people everywhere. It would be cool if he could fix up the whole state.</p>

        <p>Yeah they are working from home but a lot of them haven't even gone out on their own to see how dangerous it actually is. It's so crazy how many are still like "small masked gathering with friends!" or insistent on their kids staying at school from home. They just need to get out and see outside their house, people are out there still living life. Some are normal though and over the whole thing, I think the loud ones are just the ones everyone notices.</p>
