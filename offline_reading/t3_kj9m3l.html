<title>Question for British subscribers: Does it seem to you like the "mutant strain" narrative is just a way to separate the UK from the rest of the world in order to make people desperate to reconnect and possibly subvert Brexit?</title>

    <p><p>Really curious for thoughts of people with a lot of first hand knowledge of the situation. This was just my initial cynical first instinct.</p></p>

        <p>they just wanted to fuck people, ruin their Christmas after ruining their whole year. plus they need something to blame for deaths from the vaccine, so they'll blame this "new strain".. just like all the deaths were labeled as covid this whole year, people who will die from vax will be labeled as they've died from this new strain.. scam after scam, scam of the scams</p>
<p>also, probably not enough people were getting tested, so they closed the borders and now they want to test all the lorry drivers, so they'll have more of their false positive cases to justify more lockdowns</p>
<p>happy days</p>

        <p>70% more transmissible based on a mathematical model with no actual real world data or correlation. They mapped differences in the genome and then extrapolated from that how it <em>could be</em> up to 70% more transmissible then just accepted this as proven and started the propaganda machine just in time for a winter resurgence of respiratory diseases?</p>
<p>Seems suspect.</p>
<p>The pandemic is over; hence why they disappeared the nightingale. Unless they figured that ramping up restrictions of movement balances out the need for additional critical care beds.</p>

        <p>Something like that. Or just so people won't forge even for one day that they're meant to be terrified of this virus that only kills terminally ill people. </p>

<p>The mutant strain has already been shown to have no evidence behind it, but no surprise there</p>

        <p>There was possibly a Brexit element. But when UK politicians hysterically talk of a new 'out of control' variant that could be 'up to' 70% more easy to give grandma and shut down travel within the country from the most affected area....what else could the French have done?</p>
<p>It would look pretty weird to French voters if people in Dover couldn't travel up the road to London because deadly virus sad face, but the port remained open so the 'plague' could freely cross to their towns.</p>
<p>Obviously in reality the variant will have been all over Europe for months, they just don't know it as their sequencing capabilities are non existent. But don't let logic get in the way of political grand standing and a good opportunity to virtue signal by closing borders.</p>
<p>Totally coincidentally it also allowed them to scare people again about how Brexit might look, and we'd have to rely on the goodwill of the Luftwaffe to parachute in food parcels if we ever want to eat broccoli again.</p>

        <p>I'm convinced its just a way to push more people into getting the vaccine. Especially parents since this one supposedly gets children easier. Kids are last in line for the vaccine so parents will be told its their duty to protect their children. </p>
<p>I also think its to disguise the fertility issues that will be caused by the vaccine. Theyre saying that covid can affect fertility. A faster strain, of a virus that affects the majority as asymptomatic. 
Easy for them to say a few years down the line "oh you must have caught covid and had no symptoms and it affected your fertility"</p>

        <p>Personally I think they’re doing it to encourage the RNA vaccines. If they were the standard vaccines they would be ‘ineffective’ because this thing keeps ‘mutating.’ But a RNA vaccine will be able to combat mutations, or so they say.</p>
