    <strong>This whole situation is really worrying me and making me feel like shits never gonna change.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 26, live in Louisville KY (home of the Breonna Taylor riots) and like the title says, I'm really worried and feeling like nothing is EVER going to change. </p>
<p>Look. I'm asthmatic. I was really fucking scared of this virus in March/April. I was wearing a mask voluntarily wherever. I was taken off work from March 20th to May 20th, but in hindsight I regret it. </p>
<p>We have had a MANDATORY mask mandate since July. Cases have really been going up for a while now. I know all of this will end in due time, but goddamn. I worry that all these restrictions will go on for YEARS. It legit makes me scared to fucking death. Not from catching this shit, but the restrictions never going away. </p>
<p>Like I said I live in a red state, but a blue area. I don't know what to do. I don't wear a mask at work. They've gotten on me about it, but fuck em. I'm not going crazy because the fucking health department is on a power trip.</p>
<p>Sorry. I just found this sub. I needed to get it out somewhere. I'm on the verge of tears and getting a drug habit. Not even joking.</p></p>

        <p>We've had mandatory statewide masks in Indiana since July and have, supposedly, blown far past the April peak. Everything thinks it's because of dicknoses and kids going to bars. Nobody can process that the initial peak came and went long before anyone was wearing masks. Nobody can make the connection that masks have completely failed (again, if the data is real, which it probably isn't). </p>
<p>I still don't know anyone who got seriously sick or died.</p>

        <p>I'm in Indiana (in the largest city in the state, in fact) and I also still don't know a single person who has had the virus. Nobody in my extend family. None of my friends. None of my friends extended network. Not a single person. I feel like if we were really in a pandemic I wouldn't need the news media to tell me 24/7 for months. I wouldn't need reminded because half of my friends and family would be dead and bodies would be in the streets.</p>
<p>I've also heard a rumor that our governor is planning to lockdown again but that he was waiting until after the election. Not sure how true it is but I'm hoping it isn't. The masks have been annoying enough but at least here in Indiana things have been mostly back to normal for several months. I had some serious depression and anxiety back in March and April when the initial lockdowns happened and I don't want to revisit that.</p>

<p>"2nd highest cause of death in Indiana, eclipsing cancer" was the last headline I read. I know more people who have died of cancer this year.</p>

        <p>Something like 9-10 million die every year because of cancer. We’re at “1.2million covid deaths” (in quotes because dying with covid isn’t the same as dying from covid)... yet this common cold virus is what everyone chooses to focus on. Imagine if we took those resources and put them towards fighting cancer... I bet it would be cured before I die. But that won’t increase the profits of big pharma soooooo.....</p>

        <p>The fact that he didn't do it last Wednesday after the election results came out makes me a bit hopeful that he won't add more restrictions.</p>
<p>I'm just north of Indy, so I'm sure Hogsett will add new restrictions soon, but all that will do is drive even more Marion County businesses to close.</p>

        <p>Masks spread the virus. You “have to wear one to protect other people” but where the fuck has it been? Everyone re-uses them and they touch dirty surfaces where the “dEaDlY vIrUs” has been so you end up infecting yourself. If masks worked then the numbers would show it. It’s not a SmArT vIrUs that will only stop if EVERYONE wears masks. There would be a drop proportional to the percentage of people wearing masks if they worked.... but they don’t.</p>

        <p>Hello, Indiana resident here living in one of the most infected counties in the region and still barely know anyone who has gotten the virus. It's kind of ironic that they want to blame the young people even though they are highly resilient to the virus but are more vulnerable to the secondary effects of the lockdown.</p>

        <p>I actually have no idea. </p>
<p>For me here in the uk, I just don’t wear one, and I’ve never been asked. I’m not a very good liar, but if I was asked I would use a medical exemption as a reason. I’m under no obligation to prove that, I don’t need anything that says it, my word is enough. </p>
<p>At this point I’m so disgusted by masks, because they are seriously gross, and get anxiety at the thought of either being confronted, or actually having to put one on my face. I feel like that’s a good enough reason not to wear one.</p>

<p>Feelings will follow the behavior, if you will yourself to act. </p>
<p>I find it helpful to think about the sacrifices of the past, and how incomparably less severe today’s are. I’m not being asked to run into a hail of German machine gun fire on some godforsaken beach. I’m just…not strapping a piece of cloth to my face. And in doing so, risking the extremely remote possibility of Butch taking exception and punching me in the mouth.</p>
<p>It’s a risk I am compelled to take to do my tiny, tiny part in the ongoing fight for liberty.</p>

        <p>They have a mandatory mask mandate in Poland where my parents live. My dad literally never wears a mask and if somebody talks to him about it he says „oh it just slipped off”. It’s obvious bullshit but nobody can do a shit about, especially not the authorities. He says exactly that, if they ever want to fine him he takes it to court where nobody can prove anything.</p>

        <p>Man I hear ya. It’s been a rough go of it this year for sure and it’s confusing as hell. I definitely share your concerns about long term implementation of the masks and other future restrictions I’m sure coming soon. Keep your head up tho and on straight - don’t let them win. It’s a fine line between self medicating and addiction.  Control what you can and know at least half the country shares your concerns -so you’re not alone!</p>

        <p>I’ve seen this a lot, and I wish people would stop saying it.</p>
<p>Comments like this severely threaten SCOTUS’s legitimacy. SCOTUS isn’t nearly as partisan as the media and politicians would have us believe, but that doesn’t matter if the population can be convinced that they are. </p>
<p>In this specific situation, comments like this just give the left fuel to declare a SCOTUS decision for Trump illegitimate. That would be extraordinarily dangerous to the country.</p>

        <p>The most important thing to understand is that every single Justice, regardless of political leaning, will (correctly) prioritize the protection of SCOTUS as an institution over <em>literally</em> anything else. They must, because they have authority purely by our acceptance of that authority - if federal and state governments just said, “hey, we’re not enforcing your decisions anymore,” there’s nothing that SCOTUS could do. And for all its very, very many flaws, SCOTUS remains a critically important check on the other two branches - losing that check would be ruinous for the country. </p>
<p>Pushing the idea that SCOTUS will in any way favor one party or another because of past personal grievances delegitimizes their decisions - it suggests maybe they were wrongly decided and therefore needn’t be followed. </p>
<p>I know you’re angry, as am I, but: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have a pretty decent knowledge of SCOTUS and I have more confidence in them than you do, and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all you’re doing by expressing this particular thought (thomas will find against biden just because he’s pissed) is contributing to a popular opinion that may effectively force SCOTUS to find in favor of Biden rather than Trump, at least to some degree </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously courts are somewhat political. SCOTUS is generally better than most, because they no longer require <em>anything</em> from the other branches (no more promotions left). But actively politicizing the Court is an incredibly dangerous thing.</p>

I can't go on like this much longer either, do you know how much happens in a year? We're quickly closing in on it and now they're even going to take away Christmas. My family isn't getting any younger either. Sick of it all, this is our life and it's wasting away thanks to these clowns day by day. I'm in shock at how spineless everyone is.</p>

I guess you could apply not caring to anything here, people don't value their lives as much as we thought they might have in general.</p>

<p>I realize it is difficult to go through traditional channels for help these days.  But I would love to talk to you about what you are going through, and how to develop some healthier coping mechanisms so you don't fall casualty to addiciton.</p>
<p>I have... some first hand experience at this.  I have pulled people back, and I have failed to pull some people back.</p>
<p>Feel free to DM me.  In fact, I am praying that you do.</p>
<p>Chin up, kid.  This too shall pass.</p>

        <p>I don’t have the exact numbers on hand at the moment, but tens of thousands of college students have tested positive since returning to school in the fall, and the last I checked, only 3 were hospitalized. Many students are asthmatic, and the data would be much different if they were higher risk. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN26S38T">Here</a> is a news article with a study showing asthmatic people are not at a higher risk. In fact, it found that patients with asthma were 70% less likely to die from corona, so that should make her feel much better!</p>

        <p>From what I remember hanging out with doomers they dont equate asthma with severe comorbidity. The bigger ones are vascular problems and obesity. At first they werent sure but asthma isnt on the list of top conditions that increase your fatality risk. </p>

<p>If shes obese, that is the main concern.</p>

        <p>I'm in Kentucky, right across the river from Cincinnati. This is a very high-density and high-population area. But the only people I see wearing masks outdoors are people patronizing all these gentrified, high-end shops on our main street. On side streets, you never see masks.</p>
<p>In fact, even inside gas station convenience stores, most people don't wear masks - despite a sign on the door requiring them.</p>

        <p>From what has been making the rounds in the news this week, a vaccine seems to be well on its way. Hopefully it's safe to get when it's out next year but am curious about how soon they'll make getting it mandatory after it's out &amp; how hard a sell it will be to get us as a society to get a totally brand new vaccine. Some people will want to get it ASAP, others will probably wait to take a wait &amp; see approach. Some may decide to not get it at all.</p>

        <p>Same here. I'm an early adopter for tech products if I had the money &amp; could benefit from some totally new gadget but something going inside my body I would want to wait &amp; see how things pan out with others 1st. There will probably be plenty of reports to go around as time marches onwards after the rollouts.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel the same.  I live in a Canadian Province where there is 12 cases in 1 million.   No ICU or Hospitalizations  yet we have a ton of restrictions that seem never-ending.  Masks, distancing, 14 day quarantine if you leave the province.  And the general public wants more restrictions!  People are calling on the government to stop any incoming flights from out of the province.  I also have cried for hours over this and considered trying pot despite never touching the stuff in my life.</p>

        <p>I mean, obviously the virus was not going to disappear on November 4. It's a virus, not a sentient, politically-aware being.</p>
<p>Having said that, I am of the belief that the US COVID response was hyper-political from the beginning and the election will mark a turning of the tide.  Things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The election isn't over yet, no matter how badly Joey Alzheimers and his reluctant supporters want it to be, and no matter how many times Jake Tapper says it is on air.  PA really threw a monkey wrench into the works.  Still waiting for it to be officially called.  Anything that's going to happen "after the election" is on hold at the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID is no longer the main focus of the media.  It is secondary to all the "TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE!!!1!!" conspiracy theories.  The more "other" things the media has to fixate on, the less casedemic scaremongering there will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biden's <em>entire platform</em> consisted of two things: 1) "I'm not Trump",  2) "I'll fix COVID".  So they're going to have to do <em>something</em>, if they don't the media will eat them alive.  I think we'll see a quiet revision of PCR cycle thresholds and testing protocol (they will probably stop asymptomatic testing) during Q1 of 2020 and "cases" will go down.  Remember, <em>if</em> this is a ploy by the democrats, they cannot do it now, nor can they do it too quickly, that would be too obvious and they'd get called out.  It needs to be a gradual change so that fewer people notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The premature Biden parties, celebrations and gatherings in the street, of people who were calling Trump rallies "superspreader events" mere days earlier, are a blatant display of hypocrisy.  The media will never address this, but I think it will be a personal turning point for many people, much like BLM/George Floyd.  Personally, BLM riots being "okay" was what really turned me on to the fact that this is all nonsense.  I think there will be a whole new wave of skeptics because of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course it could be sheer coincidence, but does the timing of the Pfizer announcement not seem just a little <em>too</em> convenient to you?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I do fear that we may be in for a winter of more lockdowns and more bullshit.  But, I also think that the media focus will shift from the current "SKY IS FALLING!!1!" nonsense, to discussion of an actual exit strategy.  I also believe that the restrictions will be mostly gone by the start of the next warm season.</p>

<p><strong>Of course it was <em>political</em>. Donnie has no interest in policy or public health. That's why so many people have died.</strong></p>
<p>The election isn't over yet, no matter how badly Joey Alzheimers and his reluctant supporters want it to be, and no matter how many times Jake Tapper says it is on air. PA really threw a monkey wrench into the works. Still waiting for it to be officially called. Anything that's going to happen "after the election" is on hold at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>You think Donnie can still win?</strong></p>
<p>COVID is no longer the main focus of the media. It is secondary to all the "TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE!!!1!!" conspiracy theories. The more "other" things the media has to fixate on, the less casedemic scaremongering there will be.</p>
<p><strong>Sure is a lot wacky shit goin on these days</strong></p>
<p>Biden's entire platform consisted of two things: 1) "I'm not Trump", 2) "I'll fix COVID". </p>
<p><strong>Looks like that was a pretty solid platform, huh?</strong></p>
<p>So they're going to have to do something, if they don't the media will eat them alive. </p>
<p><strong>Yes, I expect that Biden's administration will mount a serious campaign to safeguard public health and stem the spread. If they don't, then journalist will certainly be reporting that</strong></p>
<p>I think we'll see a quiet revision of PCR cycle thresholds and testing protocol (they will probably stop asymptomatic testing) during Q1 of 2020 and "cases" will go down. Remember, if this is a ploy by the democrats, they cannot do it now, nor can they do it too quickly, that would be too obvious and they'd get called out. It needs to be a gradual change so that fewer people notice.</p>
<p><strong>Who knows, maybe that will actually confront the problem instead of telling people to take chloroquin and shove lightbulbs up their ass. Radical, I know...</strong></p>
<p>The premature Biden parties, celebrations and gatherings in the street, of people who were calling Trump rallies "superspreader events" mere days earlier, are a blatant display of hypocrisy. </p>
<p><strong>People are thrilled to see Donnie so thoroughly humiliated. With every passing day that he refuses to concede, it just gets better.</strong></p>
<p>The media will never address this, but I think it will be a personal turning point for many people, much like BLM/George Floyd. Personally, BLM riots being "okay" was what really turned me on to the fact that this is all nonsense. I think there will be a whole new wave of skeptics because of this</p>
<p><strong>It appears that no significant spread can be traced to the BLM protests for the simple reason that most people wore masks. On the other hand, Trump rallies, held indoors, where maskless Covid denies chant 'lock her up' have been important sources of infection. Of course the White house is also the cite of ongoing infections.</strong></p>
<p>Of course it could be sheer coincidence, but does the timing of the Pfizer announcement not seem just a little too convenient to you?</p>
<p><strong>You mean the German-funded vaccine? If the election isn't over (as you insist), then maybe it can help Donnie somehow</strong> </p>
<p>I do fear that we may be in for a winter of more lockdowns and more bullshit. </p>
<p><strong>Yes, I expect there will be more lockdown and many deaths</strong></p>
<p>But, I also think that the media focus will shift from the current "SKY IS FALLING!!1!" nonsense, to discussion of an actual exit strategy. I also believe that the restrictions will be mostly gone by the start of the next warm season.</p>
<p><strong>Lets hope so. Fauci says he expects the vaccine to be widely availible by April.</strong></p>

        <p>Trump is not going to save us, we have to save ourselves, all polititians are against us, left and right are two heads of the same snake- remember Trumps "you knew damn well i was a snake speech"? Q was a psyop to take the people that would have been against all this and get them to sit our thier hands and trust the plan, all this election rigging bs was pre-planned, whoever is in office- biden or trump- the agenda will move forward, in my opinion, unless we say no to this shit</p>

        <p>That's what I've been telling people on this sub, it doesn't matter who's in the WH, the agenda will continue regardless. Trump will not save you from this, neither will Biden. They're both puppets. I don't see a way out of this mess. Unless people start waking up posthaste, this will never end. Even then, there's too many sheep who refuse to wake up and drag us along with them.</p>

        <p>Yeah don't worry as long as people utilize common sense (something almost everyone is born with) and follows really simple and harmless rulesnand suggestions it could be over in months. </p>

        <p>Yeah its quite unfortunate. There is a problem with a very simple solution. People refuse the solution because they really think that either they are so high and mighty and above the "sheeple" and truly believe that the government really really wants to control us with masks. </p>
<p>On a different note I'm genuinely surprised that our governments aren't completely milking this by trying to outlaw cash or something stupid. They really could go all out and actually instill control on everyone but they are. What's the point in controlling a soon to be nonexistent population.</p>

        <p>In all reality we haven't been following it.</p>
<p>Not everyone has been masking up, that's the issue. If only 3/4 of the pop masks up and isolates that quarter who refuses are the ones who spread the virus. </p>
<p>Its a trust thing. If literally everyone used their brains this would be over in a month. They shouldn't even have to out up regulations. People should've isolated and masked up as a respect thing even if they don't believe they are effective. In no way is it harming anyone to wear it, it can be a mild inconvenience for some and very very few actually have reasons for not wearing a mask and those people could stay home and or take extra precautions yeah it wont be easy but its possible. </p>
<p>Again even if you don't believe in masks wouldn't it be a real zinger if you all wore masks to try and prove they don't work. Get all antimaskers to wear a mask and if the cases dont drop then you could very well be right and it could be an eye opener for the world and if the cases drop then look, you all did a service and literally everyone wins. Yeah its hard to realize you're wrong, I'm not accusing you or anything just generalizations. Most of the time the brain cant handle being wrong so sometimes people will take wild actions to circumvent or deny the fact that their wrong.</p>
<p>Again if everyone actually wore masks, and nothing happened you'd all be proven right but we won't know unless id it happens and what's the worst thing that could happen? Masks are the solution and believe it or not the sooner everyone gets to wearing them the sooner we wont have to be. </p>
<p>This whole situation with anti maskers is full of confirmation bias, example. "I think that our government is trying to control us by politely suggesting that we wear masks, so we wont wear them" then the numbers go up due to lack of mask wearers and then in turn the government has to make restrictions and laws "the government is trying to enforce masks on us for control! Dont wear them they are evil" and whatnot causing even more regulations. Its just making it worse for no reason. </p>
<p>This isn't an attack, I'm not trying to call you wrong or anything or anyone that I'm just trying to help give more perspectives on the ordeal because I want this to be over just as much as you people do but it aint gonna happen without action. Yeah this virus may not be as deadly as some, it may not exxagerated a bit but that doesn't mean its not important.</p>

        <p>Doomers believe that if everyone just "behaved" and wore a mask the virus would magically go away. They blame the spiking cases on the minority of people who don't wear a mask. In reality, the virus is gonna do what it does, burn through populations, and our efforts to lockdown and do all this hygiene theater just do nothing or drag out the inevitable at best</p>

        <p>No. Stop trying to twist this.</p>
<p>The vanishingly small fraction of people with health issues that render them susceptible to this minor bug are the selfish ones. If they're concerned, they need to take precautions to protect themselves.  THEY should be locking themselves into isolation indefinitely, not expecting the State to impose that on the healthy 99.9%.</p>
<p>Just admit that you WANT this to go on for years.  You don't give a shit about anyone dying from this.  You just want the dopamine hit that comes with being seen attacking the bad people.  This is just a means to your desired end, namely to live out a sad little collectivist power fantasy.</p>

Do you ever think about the impression that lurkers get when all the people who come to these subs thinking they are brilliant "trolls" post things that are so painfully childish and ill thought out.  You may do a better job of winning people to the anti-lockdown cause by being such a painfully poor thinker than even the most articulate post about the harms of lockdown could do.  If people like you support lockdowns, than they must be a pretty bad policy.</p>
