    <strong>Am I wrong to judge a group for being too pro-vaxx?</strong>
    <p><p>I liked this group I am in, the people are kind, and are giving, but they are freaking me out. They have not been a source of support through out this on this one subject.  I have been in for 4 years or so. I got scared and took down link on survey, I will have to deal with astroturfers I guess, but they sent out a survey asking everyone's vaxx status and even asked for the vaxx status of kids over 12 and then questions about kids wearing masks and more on RE.</p>
<p>It was deemed anonymous but I know from Facebooks and Zoom that at least 90 percent if not more of the group got the vaxx. I have felt too scared to speak my mind among them beyond trying to warn 2 behind the scenes who have kind of frozen me out, they had some side effects on their first shot, and telling one the truth who kept asking me, I told them not to tell anyone of my vaxx status but I suspect they know. My trust is gone and feel confused even about being there. I got tempted to write on the survey, "Liberals used to question Big Pharm not line up blindly" but I figure they would know it was me. My relationship is ebbing away with this organization inside my mind and heart because of this stuff, it makes me feel terrible. </p>
<p>Maybe I am too pendantic and too autistic, but when you feel afraid to talk to people about something, it does not help one's involvement in a group. I have two minds of thought, a] If this is a tribulation/collapse scenario---how could they have my back especially as I believe they could come to harm via the vaxx and they "believe in the system" so much, b] If this BS is really going to end one day, maybe I could just keep my mouth shut--they all took the vaxx there's no one to warn--and wait things out. I would only earn myself stress and ostracization and if this stuff does blow over, maybe I can be happy in the group again. I was formerly very happy with them all but this has made me feel like I am out on an ice floe. </p>
<p>The vaxxed in group have been meeting together already [outside]. Yes maybe I am dumb but I am scared of spike proteins and whatever real virus there is above PCR tests, and also scared of the blow back like if I did go hang out and they found out I was not vaxxed. I do meet up with a few one on one, masked up here and there.</p></p>

        <p>If you don’t like a group of friends because you don’t like their politics (yes, including, and perhaps especially, their take on the vaccine), ditch them. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life, and there’s plenty more people out there who would be far less toxic to be around.</p>

        <p>Yes that's something to think about. Thanks. They aren't negative people but if they followed this, with no question, it's changed my view of them. It's changed everything for me. If I am having to hide who I am, there won't be any closeness to come anyway. I sometimes wonder if there are other silents in the group like me, but not sure, I think now knowing the numbers of people who have said directly they got the vaxx it is very low.</p>

        <p>I can understand why people have different opinions, what's annoying is that it's unlikely any actual thought went into forming those opinions, so they believe something that isn't even their own view</p>

        <p>Just ask yourself- why do you want to be part of a group where you are afraid to speak up your mind and be yourself? Why do you need this stress and anxiety in your life? This doesn't sound like a kind group to me, sorry.</p>

        <p>I'm asking that question now and why am I so afraid? They have done a lot for me and were kind people so this makes this very hard to understand. I would feel better if I wasn't standing on my side alone in all this, why did they all follow? It's some disturbing questions. Yes I am thinking through things now.</p>

        <p>I would say this isnt a case of you judging them because they got vaxxed, but you judging them because after they got vaxxed the group dynamic changed.</p>
<p>Whether or not i find your fear of spike proteins realistic or not i can imagine not wanting to be the only "outsider".  Like the only childless friend in a friend-group full of parents. It just changes the dynamic.   </p>
<p>I myself am not scared of vaccinated people. I think it's dumb to get vaxxed so fast but grown adults can choose to do whatever they like. Most of my friends know I'm not keen to get vaxxedn ad kudos to them none of them have been too pushy. I try not to let if affect me.   </p>
<p>I think you're entirely right when you say "when you feel afraid to talk to people about something, it does not help one's involvement in a group. " <br>
My solution to this has been to just talk about it and not make a big deal of it and be honest to my friends saying "yeah i'm not getting vaxxed anytime soon. I dont think its worth it right now and i'm gonna wait a while longer." <br>
I've been lucky they reacted well. But even if your friends dont react well at least you'd be out of limboland i guess? <br>
Honesty in my mind is usually better but i get your worry of losing a friendgroup of four years.  </p>
<p>I hope you figure it out.</p>

        <p>Yes the group dynamic changed, all this lockdown and more has changed what the group used to be. I feel like I am hanging on to something of the past more then what exists now. Yeah I don't like being the outsider or the only "hold out". The reaction I got from the very few I opened my mouth too, and I did not unload like say don't take mark of beast blah blah, I said, I have health conditions, it's not for me, and said it is everyone's choice....and the reactions while not abusive were negative. I figure I won't push my views on people and will leave them alone and give me the same curtesy. With the few I did tell, two had adverse affects and I felt led to warn them, and one kept asking over and over and I gave in--subject I didn't bring up but they did. I have realize the distance has grown because I have felt afraid to talk about my real feelings, and the whole Covid scope has been untouchable. They are very focused on "being positive" which has some good factors but when you can't even share negative feelings about having 1 and half years of life taken away, it dampens close sharing. I already know the reactions with many if I was honest, I would get a barrage of why do you believe those conspiracy theorists etc etc which is what I heard from the two I tried to warn. I may wait things out but if we are in the time I think we could be that won't work either. It's too hard to know what the future will bring.</p>
