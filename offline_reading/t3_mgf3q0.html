    <strong>Nano-filament mesh electronics can be injected into the brain: 'Syringe-injectable Mesh Electronics for Stable Chronic Rodent Electrophysiology' (Dr. Charles M. Lieber, et al.)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
<p><strong>There exists technology to create ultra-flexible conductive mesh electronic nano-filaments which can be uptaken into syringes and injected into living tissue, such as the brain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This isn't science fiction. (Now indicted) Harvard professor, Dr. Charles Lieber and his team have published a paper on how to manufacture and inject these mesh electronics into living brain tissue (see below for the paper, and what got me started down this rabbit hole).</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is not a conspiracy post. I am not saying that such technologies are contained in any of the covid vaccines. I am simply providing the research illustrating what is possible.</strong></p>
<p>I've seen a number of videos online black filaments appearing in masks and covid test swabs. See, for instance: <a href="https://webmshare.com/play/ojoGL">https://webmshare.com/play/ojoGL</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=55&amp;v=v-wray3Nkvw&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=55&amp;v=v-wray3Nkvw&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> (there are <strong><em>many</em></strong> more of such videos online)</p>
<p>Now, whether these videos are depicting anything of concern is to be determined (the videos may entirely be a ruse, or, if not, the filaments may be nothing more than fibers).</p>
<p>However, the videos got me looking into the research of Dr. Charles Lieber. Now, if you don't know Dr. Lieber, he was a Harvard professor who has been researching implantable nanowire bioelectric interface technology for decades. Here is a link to his complete database: <a href="http://cml.harvard.edu/publications">http://cml.harvard.edu/publications</a>, and here is a link to an organization he's heading: <a href="http://meshelectronics.org/">http://meshelectronics.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Lieber was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related">indicted</a> last year for failing to disclose and lying about financial conflicts of interest with Chinese organizations while simultaneously receiving millions of dollars in funding from the NIH and the DOD. Big national security risk.</p>
<p>In my research of Dr. Lieber's works, I came across this paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jove.com/t/58003/syringe-injectable-mesh-electronics-for-stable-chronic-rodent">Syringe-injectable Mesh Electronics for Stable Chronic Rodent Electrophysiology</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Implantable brain electrophysiology probes are valuable tools in neuroscience due to their ability to record neural activity with high spatiotemporal resolution from shallow and deep brain regions. Their use has been hindered, however, by mechanical and structural mismatches between the probes and brain tissue that commonly lead to micromotion and gliosis with resulting signal instability in chronic recording experiments. In contrast, following the implantation of ultraflexible mesh electronics via syringe injection, the mesh probes form a seamless, gliosis-free interface with the surrounding brain tissue that enables stable tracking of individual neurons on at least a year timescale. This protocol details the key steps in a typical mouse neural recording experiment using syringe-injectable mesh electronics, including the fabrication of mesh electronics in a standard photolithography-based process possible at many universities, loading mesh electronics into standard capillary needles, stereotaxic injection <em>in vivo</em>, connection of the mesh input/output to standard instrumentation interfaces, restrained or freely moving recording sessions, and histological sectioning of brain tissue containing mesh electronics. Representative neural recordings and histology data are presented. Investigators familiar with this protocol will have the knowledge necessary to incorporate mesh electronics into their own experiments and take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by long-term stable neural interfacing, such as studies of aging processes, brain development, and the pathogenesis of brain disease.</p>
<p>There is a video within the paper depicting the process by which these ultra-flexible, injectable mesh electronics are manufactured, how they are uptaken into a syringe, and how they are subsequently injected into living (brain tissue). Here's the video: <a href="https://www.jove.com/v/58003/syringe-injectable-mesh-electronics-for-stable-chronic-rodent">https://www.jove.com/v/58003/syringe-injectable-mesh-electronics-for-stable-chronic-rodent</a></p>
<p>Give the paper a read and the video a watch. If and when someone calls you crazy for stating nanowires can be injected via syringe, show them this research.</p></p>
