    <strong>Today is "freedom day". There are PRISON CAMPS at UK airports. Introducing "Red list quarantine hotels" As the propaganda storm for another wave ramps up with t, the hate for "antivaxx" and "antimask" is reaching fever pitch. It's pretty clear where this is headed. God help us.</strong>
    <p><p>Today was meant to be the end of all restriction.  We were promised for months it was the beyond doubt the end.  Yet here we are, with almost no covid deaths and the majorty of people vaccinated, being told by the first spats of mps the restrictions will last "for the forseeable future" and that "winter lockdown may be inevitable".    I know we knew this would happen.  But it doesnt change things.   The propaganda machine has ramped up to such a degree, that its everywhere all the time.   Even  though the public simultaneously know that hospital admissions and deaths are so low as to be non existant. </p>
<p>We could have stopped this before it got dark, and some of us tried. But it seems the point of no return has been reached.  This can only end one of two ways, and both of those involve terrible things we thought we would never have to face again.  </p>
<p><strong>I know the sentiment is "UK needs to get its shit together" and I tried the entire time to resist this with all my energy, but it happened anyway.  For the people in places where resistance has been more effective and this has been avoided, those of us here who are still fighting need your support.  When this fully unfolds over winter please try to bring the free worlds attention to it.</strong></p>

<p>Society is divided and boiling over with hatred.<br>
The public will easily supportsending "antivaxx" and "antimask" there as they are bombarded with propaganda. the regiemn has in place to remove individuals who are resistant to propaganda or non-compliant. <br>
The vaccine is a very nifty will to make sure these a public list of all non compliant individuals isn't it?  </p>
<p>Vaccine passports are being rebranded as "covid status certificates" and set to launch during the "next wave to create an all encompassing survailence system.  </p>
<p>Propaganda is the only form of information and news that anybody people recieve, mostly state sponsored.   With any individuals contradicting it being censored and punished.  </p>
<p>Despite the reality being easily proven with very little speculation and backed by larges amounts of evidence, it is the propaganda that is reality.   Deaths are none existant, hospitalisations are non existent, covid is literally barely happening in the UK right now.  But, the media says we are facing a crisis, that surge testing should begin ETC, and thats what is believed.  </p>
<p>It seems inevitable the camps full of antivaxx plague rats will have outbreaks of covid that kill huge numbers of them.  </p>
<p>That will tell the public a) they were right to send people there and b) how the restrictions are keeping them safe.  </p>
<p>This is a few moves before checkmate.</p></p>

        <p>Is this because of the ‘Delta Variant’ that we’ve been hearing so much about in the US?</p>
