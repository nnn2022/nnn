    <strong>Why do doomers and social media platforms care what we say?</strong>
    <p><p>If we're all so "crazy" and spread "misinformation" as a small group, why would these doomers be getting so worked up about what we are saying? Why are they trying to get our subreddit banned? </p>
<p>That's like getting mad at a mentally ill homeless person walking up to you and telling you that every human has two heads. What do you do? Ignore their banter because their obviously a nutjob, right?</p>
<p>But that's NOT what we're seeing. These doomers are going out of their way to troll in this sub 24/7. Other reddit groups are randomly banning people for even being subscribed or being associated to NNN. </p>
<p>This question is aimed at all of the doomers and other reddit groups. What are you really scared of? That this sub is growing? That we might convert some people to our way of thinking? </p>
<p>Logically you shouldn't be scared of anything unless you KNOW we are making some really damn good arguments. We shouldn't be making waves if everything we say is complete gibberish.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no such thing as "misinformation". There's just INFORMATION and how people choose to perceive that information. Every. Single. Person. has an ulterior motive behind what they do and say. And it's usually to benefit their own self interest. This includes government and media. To think otherwise means that you just don't know human behavior. </p>
<p>This sub has one goal. Finding the truth and protecting the truth. What's so bad about that? There's always two sides of every story. Why do you not want to question science? If we didn't question science, then it wouldn't really be science then would it? </p>
<p>In a healthy debate, you don't discredit relevant information and you don't censor the ability to bring about new information. </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you tear¬†out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only¬†telling¬†the world that you fear what he might¬†say.‚Äù</p>
<p>We're so tiny compared to other reddit groups that have millions of members. You want to ban little ol' me? Why? Once again, what are you afraid of? üòâ</p></p>
