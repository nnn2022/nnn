    <strong>Are doomers all teenagers?</strong>
    <p><p>They keep saying the same thing over and over.   </p>
<ol>
<li>only their sources</li>
<li>boomer </li>
<li>science</li>
<li>conspiracy theorist</li>
<li>terrorist </li>
</ol>
<p>All of these are puzzling objections and I’m trying to understand the motivation behind them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Group think, obviously, but also looking for easy markers for their political enemies, ie, those who don’t use the same sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a boomer, though sometimes one has to admit when boomers get things right. Any honest attempt at truth would have to at some point admit where their political rivals get things right or wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously science is more than sources and includes a rational construction of ones own, using logic and meta analysis of method, other wise one is a parrot. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one seems like a desire for an explanation for a situation once a shift in explanation leaves a void.  Doomers being young have a hard time accepting phenomena like mass hysteria.  And any rational method with accept things like a shift in evidence that counter the original premise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one is the most alarming. Trying to label those you disagree with as evil has got to be a tell tale sign that there is some faulty reasoning going on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></p>

<p>Online classes mean you can just mute the bully or depending on the program make him into a pig with filters.</p>

        <p>You see them as teenagers because we remember being kids and acting like that.</p>
<p>What you forget, however, is that for two generations or more, kids have been taught <em>what</em> to think instead of <em>how</em> to think, and it stunts them in a perpetual adolescence.</p>
<p>So in a way, yes, they are all teenaters mentally, they run the gamut from 13 to late 20s</p>

        <p>Ohh by social media alone they’re ruined. Girls on Tik Tok thinking that they are celebrities for a few small videos that would be very minor things growing up when I did and I am 32. You lip synching to thirty seconds of a song and dancing is not a talent. I did that as a kid but we didn’t have camera phones so I didn’t become famous for doing Vincent Price’s part in the Thriller song at 14. Geez I would have tons of edgy short videos to do if I was 14 again. But we didn’t have that growing up.</p>

        <p>I really wonder about who your typical doomer is as well. </p>
<p>I'd say it's mostly males above 40 who aren't in the greatest physical state bcs of self-neglect, and now they are all scared shitless. They prolly don't have a social life either, that's why they don't give a fk about social distancing and lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I guess , it's like i was saying to the other user. To stock up on cheap virtue signaling and to play a martyr cos "they haven't seen anyone for over a yr". Those introverts were perceived as weirdos before ,but now they are introverts "bcs of the "greater common good" and want everyone else to be the same.</p>

        <p>With myself and my general social circle all falling into this demographic - no one I know and talk to really cares at all.  We all die in the end, and might as well go out and have a few beers while waiting.  There are definitely people who do though - but my experience is it is generally the older lefty ladies, schoolteachers being the worst.  Covid's ability to justify scolding and social control is catnip to the "slow down, you're playing too rough" crowd.</p>

<p>Absolutely it is. Every introverted loner feels like a hero today bcs they are at home all the time and are so happy that others have to do the same and don't like it. Nothing wrong with being loner ,i'm one too and don't really have friends ,but my girl, sometimes life just turns this way, but there is no reason to be jelly of others that have friends. Same with muzzles. Everyone is and was free to wear one 24/7 if they want too ,but forcing and shaming others for not to is something that needs to stop. </p>
<p>If i truly hate something about covid ,is how it gave everyone the ability to play hero out of the sudden and to overdose on cheap virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>As a teenager I've met and observed other fellow teenagers who I feel like could be labeled as a doomer. It's probably where I live though. </p>
<p>Remember that the loud and self-entitled ones always have the dumbest things to say and sadly our mainstream culture promotes it under the guise of fighting injustice and for equality. </p>
<p>As I Gen Z, sadly, many fell for that trap. Everyone, young or old, should be pointing their fingers at the ruling establishment and elite, the ones who own the world and have made it so we live in this sad reality.</p>
