        <p>Well that's like unilaterally saying all white people need to be cancelled. There's a bunch of sociopathic Jews at the top of the media and corporate pile, and there's the Israeli government. These sick fuckers aren't like the everyday Jews you're likely to meet, they're set up to get the mark as much as the rest of us. This is also more of turning their own sigils against them rather than simping on Jews; it associates the agenda pushers with the totalitarian fascist Nazis that they themselves are. If you don't want to wear a six pointed yellow star I doubt anyone here would take exception. I like the idea though, I was saying I would do this same time last year if they tried to force us (of course I was labeled as a crazy conspiracy theorist, I'll never learn).</p>

        <p>"Can't be too sure about those society destroying Jews."</p>
<p>Damn that's cold haha. I know it's hard to understand Jewish history given the amount of historical pandering and fabrication, but there was actual religious persecution, which accounts for a lot of that. The Jewish religion also is extremely demanding (think Amish levels), or at least it was throughout history. Because of that Jews would move to countries and pretty much start their own cities which is another reason they were pushed out. Can't really blame wanting to push a city that drains resources but has its own micro economy and doesn't participate in the rest of the nation though, that's part of the historical pandering right there. But it does go both ways. Maybe some Jews feel entitled to being greedy media execs or soulless lawyers because of the stories they've been told. But the sick don't get to speak for the sane. By all means hate the psychopathic Jews at the top. Those sick fucks don't even follow the same religion. Again no big deal if you don't want to wear the fat gold star, but generalizing an entire race of people keeps us separated in a bad way.</p>

        <p>So what's the winning strategy? Put all the Jews in camps? ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Being more divided is exactly what they want and is exactly what they're getting. I guess this wasn't worth the discourse.</p>

        <p>Well I'm not really sure what you're getting at with the not trusting Jew thing is all. Showing strength in the racial division department hardly helps anyone and plays into the current paradigm. I'm not going to throw anyone else under the bus because I'm afraid of what will happen in the future. We have to be better then them. I'll defend myself if I have to, but I don't see that as an inevitable outcome. I didn't say anything about uniting doomers, it's true that it's hard to break through the cognitive dissonance. But it's also true that our side is growing daily, everytime someone is injured due to a vaccine, everytime someone sees the hate for what it is. That's why we have to be better, otherwise there's no reason to want to join the 'losing side'. I'm not so deluded as you say, I'm preparing for whatever storm is coming, but it hasn't swallowed us up yet. I'm not sure how we got here from turning the sigils of our oppressors against them, but I don't think we should hate or generalize anyone unless they're clearly the opposition. People are still waking up to the insanity, and sometimes it's hard to tell who's hiding beneath a facade of acquiescence out in the real world.</p>

        <p>Hard to care any less for our co-opted political system. Red or blue has never done anything for me; anyone buying into either side is perpetuating the issue that both sides are owned by the same people. They haven't booted The amendments yet, just got to stay on the lookout. Best thing that we can do is preserve what media we have so they can't swoop them out from under us. The transhumanist and depopulation agendas seem to be in full swing, but it's also hard to say whites are actually being targeted. There seems to be more and more rhetoric, but that's just as likely because people on all sides keep feeding the fuck out of these racial divides. I don't care if that sounds wuwu but hate breeds hate.</p>
