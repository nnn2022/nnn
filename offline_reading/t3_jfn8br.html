    <strong>Its Time To Recall Gavin Newsom</strong>
    <p><p>Recall Gavin Newsom. I understand that we have to walk a fine line between politicizing this sub so I will stick to criticism of him on the basis of lockdowns. Gavin Newsom is quite possibly one of the most pro-lockdown governors in America. He was one of the first governors to lock the state down and California may as well be under lockdown still for the forseeable future unless something is done. He has ruled as an autocrat for months. He has gaslit us into believing his decrees are synonymous with science and the people are to blame for HIM locking us down. He has shamelessly moved the goalposts when it comes to lockdowns to the point where we now have a color coded system with near impossible standards to meet. When a county comes close, they are slapped down with so called <a href="https://reason.com/2020/10/09/infection-rates-in-neighborhoods-with-low-voter-turnout-many-bars-few-trees-could-slow-californias-reopening-under-new-equity-metric/">equity metrics</a> that effectively just discriminate against diverse counties. Now, Newsom is attempting to <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/gov-newsom-limits-gatherings-to-three-families-two-hours-or-less-no-singing/">control your interactions with friends and family</a> down even to your ability to sing. He is shutting down large amusement parks which are an important source of revenue for certain counties despite the success of reopening in other parts of the country like Disneyworld in Florida. He is keeping schools shut-with Cal-States claiming they will stay shut even for the Spring, and he is <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/521798-california-plans-to-review-coronavirus-vaccine-independently%3famp">undermining public trust in and threatening to delay the distribution of a vaccine for nakedly political reasons</a>. This is why it is urgent that you recall Gavin Newsom before it is too late. The petition has been enormously successful-way more so than previous recall efforts against Newsom:</p>
<p>https://recallgavin2020.com</p>
<p>Even if he is not removed from office, this sends a STRONG message that we do NOT want his new normal. It will force him to back down or face the wrath of his constituents or even his political allies. This petition must be submitted by November 17th. Make sure to follow all the rules when submitting it.</p>
<p><strong>tldr</strong> Newsom is a threat to civil liberties, our health, and the prosperity of the state and it is imperative that we recall him before the deadline of November 17th. We can do this-do NOT give up or people like Newsom have already won.</p></p>

        <p>Thank G-d I dont live in that trashcan of a state. I think that he deserves a militia operation like what was planned in Michigan. This tyrannical dictator is literally killing his people and making them homeless and doesn't care.</p>

        <p>As much as I hate him, I do want to refrain from talk of violence. It is FAR more effective to do this peacefully and show the state and country that even a hard left state like California isn’t havin it. Newsom being recalled could have a ripple effect on the whole world.</p>

        <p>Oh, for sure. I don't wish violence on him per say. I just think that if something like that happened at this point I'd just think "Well, he certainly had that coming."</p>
<p>Is there a way that I can register to vote in California from a different state?</p>

        <p>I voted for him I think and I just signed a recall petition. I've seen two people collecting signatures outside of stores in my town. I don't really vote on party lines, more so on issues, but public health tyranny is gonna be a no from me dawg. I actually started an antifa group in my town when I was younger (yes, there's no leader, but that just means anyone can form a group and claim they're anti facist). We had spaghetti feeds for the homeless because racism is a problem in my town. I've seen gay people get attacked and even the Mexicans are racist around here, but I don't think laws or violence can change it. People just have to be the change. As cringy as that sounds. </p>
<p>I love California because I can smoke weed in public and then hang out with a black Asian tranny in the park and then go to a drum circle and and then go kill a baby and then shoot some guns and then go drink beer and offroad pickup trucks, and then go to spanish mass on Sunday (I'm not even joking). But Gavin has ruined all of this. No ammo, no trucks, no freelove, no religion. No real progress on any problems. We are devolving. I might move, but don't worry, I will give up my hedonism and uncouth attitude to live at least a little bit free somewhere else.</p>

        <p>Californian here.  He needed to be recalled long before the Cooties came on the scene.  I signed the recall petition a few months ago as well as once in the last go round.</p>
