        <p>Don’t go to a 4 year college. They are <em>insanely</em> overpriced. <em>Especially</em> for post covid education. My biggest regret is having this degree in something I don’t want a career in and now Im carrying around $100k+ in debt for it that I’ll be paying off for the next 30 years (like holy fuck!)</p>
<p>If you really want to do something that requires a 4 year education then do it but that doesn’t sound like your situation. I’d recommend a 2 year technical school program if you just want to make money. Tuition is literally &lt;1/10th of 4 year programs. My friend did this for HVAC and now while I’m in $100k debt he’s saved up a fuck ton of money and has his own truck + a company truck and is just doing very, very good for someone his age (he’s only 21).</p>
<p>Or if there’s a hobby in particular that you enjoy and are good at you can try to make money off of that but that will likely take 5 to 10 years before you start making good money and you have to be willing to deal with that.</p>
<p>In terms of your living situation I don’t know what to say. Florida is waaaay better than other states in terms of protecting your rights and the economy is doing a lot better than any state that is in lockdown, but that doesn’t mean there’s an abundance of jobs. For low skilled labor, especially physical labor, there’s a huge amount of Latinos down here who you’d be competing with in the job market.</p>

        <p>This completely. I really wanted to go to a 4 year college but ended up staying at a junior college for two degrees. Regretted not getting the "college experience" but looking back, no way I'd want that debt. It took me a while of working but I'm making good money now for my area in a career, and instead of 100k plus in college debt, I have over 100k plus in savings and a nice car. Getting ready to buy a nice house eventually too, except I'm scared about what all this covid freakout is going to do to all that and the economy...</p>
<p>Oh and I live in Florida... it's going really well here so far. Still supposed to wear masks in stores, etc, but even Walmart stopped checking for them and reopened all their entrances, they were the strictest on that stuff.</p>
<p>We've even had some holiday events here, on Thursday I went out and parking lots were packed with cars. It all felt pretty normal. Restaurants are all packed too, I honestly forget the pandemic at times and how these other people are like "it's too dangerous to go to stores right now." I'm like, um, what?? You must not have been around here. LOL</p>

        <p>Figured I'd preface all this with not fully, personally knowing how Florida is doing at the moment, since I haven't been there in a few years.</p>
<p>I highly agree that going to school at the moment wouldn't be best. Wait until things calm down and people get their shit together. My younger brother just graduated this year and he's saying screw school. Many of his friends attended college, and are leaving after this spring cause it's just not worth it and isn't at all fun or indicitave of the actual "college experience". Plus, online learning suckssss. The money they're charging for a totally neutered college experience is insane too.</p>
<p>&rt;learn stuff online.... Which I can do anyway for free.</p>
<p>So I'll key you in on something that I was highly considering a couple years ago when I was 22 and looking to get a degree on the cheap without having to go overseas: I <strong>highly</strong> encourage you to read up on "CLEP exams". Basically, you study on your own outside of college for whatever class(es) you'd like, pass an official exam, and get college credits for that course. Without having to go to classes, without all the homework, without paying stupid amounts of money for the class. It's an amazing thing. A thing that few even know exists. So you can work and save money, while also actively earning college credits.</p>
<p>&rt;So, now I feel like I have no direction in life.</p>
<p>You aren't even 18, you don't need a direction. Countless people that are considerably older than you don't even have a direction. Follow what feels right to you and what would make you happy.</p>
<p>&rt;I hear that Florida Is respecting people's rights?</p>
<p>South Dakota is a great option as well. Even better than Florida, actually. I'm currently in the process of planning a move to Sioux Falls in January. I recommend SD more than Florida because SD is the most open and most middle-finger-giving to lockdowns and mask mandates. Plus, a very conservative population, even in Sioux Falls. In addition, it's much cheaper and safer than most Florida cities. Way less elderly too lol.</p>
<p>&rt;Where I live it would be impossible to get even a shit fast food job without some sort of connection.</p>
<p>Speaking of Florida, I've heard Miami is very much this way.</p>
<p>&rt;are there any cities in Florida that don't require a car?</p>
<p>Again back to Miami. Miami is definitely your best option if you don't have a car, but I'd stay away from it. Lotta sketchy areas, much less open that the rest of the state, and very liberal. Not to mention expensive.</p>
<p>Many, many cities in the US almost require a car to do anything, which sucks. This goes double for Florida, where everything is typically soo spaced out. Your best bet, outside of Miami, is Tampa/St. Pete.</p>
<p>&rt;My car is a big expense</p>
<p>Another good call. I had a car until I was 21, then gave it up. Wasn't worth it. In addition to the expense of acquiring the car itself, you have gas, maintenence, repairs, insurance (especially as a 17 year old guy), registration, inspection, etc. Just not worth it, esprcially if you're going to live in a city.</p>
<p>So to end this novel, I'd recommend this: Put off college for a couple years until this all blows over. Move to somewhere like SD and sell your car. Work like hell and save a bunch of money while taking CLEP exams to save you time and money when you go to college. Real-life experience is incredibly valuable, especially when you're your age. Learn as much of it as you can while you're out of school. When you're ready for school, take the plunge, since it's your goal and seem like you really want to go. I'd recommend a community college for at least your first year, since your first year is gonna be all the BS common core classes anyway. Much better to get those knocked out at a substantially cheaper and more accessible CC/JUCO.</p>

        <p>&rt;Plus, if I don't go to college I won't have to deal with all the pointless leftist indoctrination classes that have nothing to do with my major.</p>
<p>What major are you interested in? Depending on what the field is, there may be ways to get into it other than 4-year college.</p>
<p>I second everything people have said about getting into a trade. There is a lot of good work out there that people aren't going into because they look down on manual labor. The training required is almost always much less than a college degree, sometimes you are fully or partially paid for training, and the job odds when you're done are much better. If you can get into something with a union, you also get a lot more security than most people have these days. </p>
<p>If you're just looking for a way to make more money right now while you reassess, have you considered warehouse work? The hours can be weird and the work is physically hard, but the pay is WAY better than fast food (and if you're a 17 year old male you can probably handle the exertion). Sometimes there are opportunities for advancement too.</p>
<p>My husband started in a warehouse at a factory to pay off his college debt (for a degree he has never used). He got promoted into an administrative position in the factory, stayed there for a few years, and then decided he needed a change. So he studied network engineering independently, using materials he found online/bought on Craigslist, passed his certification test, and got a new job in tech.</p>
<p>Sorry I went on so long, I just wish we had both known about all these other options at your age! I wish you luck!</p>

        <p>I am definitely going to look into warehouse work.</p>
<p>I actually was planning to get a computer science degree.
I am actually already trying to self teach myself cyber security stuff. It is really interesting, and if/when 1984 becomes real the opposition will definitely need some programmers. But I look online for software development jobs and almost all of them require a 4 year degree.</p>

        <p>As an ex software engineer of 15 years, I can tell you I’ve never needed a degree to get work, even when the listing said it was required. I was completely self taught and worked for multiple Fortune 500 companies, including a current top 5 tech company. Your formal education means absolutely nothing if you have the skills they’re looking for. If you want to prove this to yourself, create a fake resume with no schooling and submit for a few listings “requiring” a 4 year degree and see if they ask you for an interview :)</p>
<p>I basically made the same decision as you out of high school and by the time my friends were graduating with tons of debt I had already been working 2 years and saved close to 50k. You’re taking responsibility of your own life and not delegating your learning to a 3rd party. Very smart!</p>

        <p>&rt; So, now I feel like I have no direction in life</p>
<p>No, you just have change the direction you were originally driving towards! And this is one of the biggest lessons in life. Life won’t always go where you want or expect it to. That’s why you should always have Plan B, C and D as backup. Doesn’t mean you’ll never experience your Plan A, it may just be about timing. Maybe Plan A is not right for you at this point. </p>
<p>I agree with everyone here so far. It’s much better to take a program or course that is 2 years or less.</p>

        <p>Trade your car in for a truck + camper in which to live. Search craigslist and facebook marketplace for used CABOVER campers (with interior toilets and showers, with roof solar panels) and used trucks. Work various jobs until you can buy undeveloped land.</p>
<p>QUIT PAYING RENT while you are still young.</p>
<p>Also learn stock option trading using books from the z-library, financial subreddits, and subscriptions to hedge funds like bubbatrading.com. Do NOT wait until age 40 years to learn stock option trading.</p>
<p>Finally, get vaccinated against COVID-19 and do attend college </p>
<p>after you have taken <strong><em>a gap year</em></strong> </p>
<p>to travel/road trip with friends, WORK SEVERAL DIFF TYPES OF ENTRY-LEVEL JOBS, date fun people, skate/snowboard and hike and camp and surf, and get to know yourself as a young adult away from your Mormon-ass parents.</p>
<p>Good luck, Buddy Lee! 👨🏽‍🌾👩🏾‍🍳👨‍💼👩‍🔬👩🏿‍🏭</p>
