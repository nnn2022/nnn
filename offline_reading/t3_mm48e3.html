        <p>People in California are already calling vaccine passports racist because more whites are getting vaccinated than non whites. We need to glom onto this and start calling people that want them racists. It's the easiest way to get this shit shut down.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily just the vaccine that's dangerous, but kneeling to their authoritarian rules. By forging documents you're still playing by their rules.</p>

        <p>and a deeper agenda would be, to make the first ones deliberately easy to forge to create compliance with the cards or app or whatever else itself and THEN</p>
<p>after a few months they could go fully encrypted digital cancer only.</p>
<p>so naturally you have to so</p>
<p>HELL NO!, rightnow.</p>
<p>no poison injection taken verification system for me EVER.</p>
<p>i rather die by a gun shot, than get a genetically modifying poison injection every 6 months and live in a dystopian social credit system.</p>
<p>also death is not the worst outcome by far.</p>
<p>poison injections from traitor governments can create far worse outcomes than death.</p>
<p>don't believe me?</p>
<p>well meet  brandon:</p>
<p><a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/ex-vax-files-brandons-legacy/">https://thehighwire.com/videos/ex-vax-files-brandons-legacy/</a></p>
<p>his life was taken away and replaced by constant hell, that is literally unbelievable almost anyone here, who can read this comment, because brandon has severe autism, horrible digestive issues, seizures, etc.. etc... all thanks to poison injections pushed by traitor governments.</p>
<p>so stand your ground now, regardless of the consequences, because this is it.</p>

<p>Yup. I called it from the beginning. This is why (widespread domestic) use of Vaccine Passports is pretty much dead in the water. All it takes is a few news stories of "lack of vaccine passports impacts minorities the hardest" and it will cause governments and companies to back down. Nobody wants to be "institutionally racist" in this day and age.</p>

        <p>You were trying to equate abortions with the pandemic and vaccines with a scarlet letter.</p>
<p>&rt;    Maybe we should get abortion cards as well. So if you receive an abortion you get an x barring you from entry to public places since well the person getting an abortion killed a baby.</p>

        <p>Good Point. This is why the government cannot mandate Vaccine Passports themselves, they are relying on private business to.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong> be aware of the law. If a local business <em>(local as in public access and you don't need a membership to walk in)</em> tries to demand you show your vaccine passport, <strong>that is a violation of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the 14^th Amendment.</strong></p>

        <p>But my mask is a one-way valve, i'm only protected if every other person in society wears one. I could purchase an N95 respirator at Home Depot like this one:</p>

<p>And then I wouldn't have to worry about what anyone else is wearing, and I'd be WAY more protected than I would wearing a cloth mask, but I shouldn't have to do that. Everyone in society should have to conform to my personal health standards. Or they're "selfish".</p>

<p>I find that ironic, since the term for German citizens who turned a blind eye to human rights violations(or actively engaged in them) are now known as "good Germans". 
 If you had been a German citizen(during WWII), wouldn't you have rather been one of the few who went against pop culture narrative?</p>

No we don't have a dictatorship, but things have gotten very authoritarian. More so than it's ever been in US history. And I don't recall there being a vote for these lockdowns and mandates...</p>

        <p>which "science" you following ? would mind sourcing ? i don't know how old you are, but here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpfmQKZ-B_0&amp;ab_channel=NowThisNews">ELI5</a> on masking up. if that's "social trend" for you, here are some articles with scientific backing. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">Source</a> 1 <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">source 2</a> or would you prefer actual peer-reviewed journal articles that's penned by academia? <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">source 3</a>. either way you'd be wrong, the concept of "airborne" virus gets misinterpreted all the time, especially people like you. they're "airborne" but would need droplets as a conduit, droplets that your mask would catch.  </p>
<p>&rt;  Why would you wear an inadequate mask when there is a better alternative? </p>
<p>feasibility.</p>
<p>&rt; No we don't have a dictatorship, but things have gotten very authoritarian. </p>
<p>could have, but luckily trump was voted out.   </p>
<p>&rt; And I don't recall there being a vote for these lockdowns and mandates... </p>
<p>do you recall voting to drive when the light is green and stop when it's red ? or do you recall voting to get out of Paris Agreement, and voting to get back in again ? or voting to criminalize theft ? i can't believe this needs to be said but you vote for the people making the rules not the actual rule itself. and majority wins. that's how democracy works. don't like ? move out.   </p>
<p>also, just for the heck of it, why would you want an N95 mask when it's possible to get an N99 or N100 mask ? LOL</p>

        <p>I just had a discussion with a dude who is vehement that vaccines should be mandatory because ‘we are trying to stop a pandemic’.</p>
<p>When I asked why he cares if others go unvaccinated if he himself is vaccinated his response was: we can’t achieve herd immunity without vaccinating everyone (this is incorrect but fine, whatever).</p>
<p>So I ask this guy why it matters if everyone who wants a vaccine gets one or has access to one — why does it then matter that some people opt not to have one and take the risk?</p>
<p>His response: people might die. I remind him that some people are comfortable taking that chance and it is a personal risk/benefit assessment.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that we can’t do it this way because we need to stop the pandemic.</p>
<p>This goes in circles until I give up and conclude that they aren’t interested in a rational discussion — they are interested in you doing what you are told because they do what they are told. That’s it. There’s no secret to it, no rationale, no logic, no anything. It is totally senseless to talk to these people and anything you share with them will be twisted, denied, or strawmanned into oblivion.</p>
<p>The human race is doomed and it’s probably for the best.</p>

        <p>i honestly would be interested in a rational discussion and would like to pick up where he left..  </p>
<p>&rt;His response: people might die. I remind him that some people are comfortable taking that chance and it is a personal risk/benefit assessment. </p>
<p>the science on it now is that it'll be harder for virus to spread if you're vaccinated.   </p>
<p>&rt;Transmission happens when enough viral particles from an infected person get into the body of an uninfected person. In theory, anyone infected with the coronavirus could potentially transmit it. But a vaccine will reduce the chance of this happening.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In general, if vaccination doesn’t completely prevent infection, it will significantly reduce the amount of virus coming out of your nose and mouth – a process called shedding – and shorten the time that you shed the virus. This is a big deal. A person who sheds less virus is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccines-need-not-completely-stop-covid-transmission-to-curb-the-pandemic1/">less likely to transmit it to someone else</a>.</p>
<p>so yes, that means if whoever you're talking to is vaccinated, he'll be a lot less likely to transmit virus, hurray, and he's a lot less likely to be affected by covid. but YOU, on the other hand isn't. you'd still catch the virus, you'd still be able to pass it on to people who aren't vaccinated (either due allergy, pregnancy or underage). vaccination would lower the transmission, and we can all get over this sooner. in short, YOUR vaccination would lead to the good of community, and since you're living in a society/community, get your vaccine.</p>

        <p>Covid morbidity and mortality is marginally worse than a bad flu season and not as bad as very bad flu seasons. This data is readily available for you to look up should you be interested.</p>
<p>Having said that, why don’t we mandate annual flu vaccines? People are free to make their own decisions on whether or not to be vaccinated and for anyone under 65 the risk/benefit is extremely questionable.</p>
<p>Regardless, to your point, if vaccines are available to everyone and individuals choose not to get it then they are taking a calculated risk. If they get it and die then that was the risk they took. The proportion of people who cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons is extremely small. Are you contending that you force the entire population of the world to take a vaccine against a virus with a 99.95% survival rate for under 65’s to protect an extremely small percentage of people who couldn’t take that vaccine? Is that what are you saying — because we don’t do that for literally anything else and it would be interesting to me why you think covid is a special case when the data show that it decidedly isn’t.</p>

<p>here's a copy and paste from another post of mine " let me explain why: say there's a hurricane coming your way, and in your town of 1 million people, only 1% will die. so it's okay, don't do anything to prevent it, don't take precaution, don't leave town, just go about your normal life. would you do that ? will you take the chance that your parents or kids or spouse or family or friends to be that 1%? if so, you're a heartless creep. what'd you do ? you'd bolt down, you'd secure all loose things at home, you're tune in to weather station for update, you'd stock up and fire proof your house, you'd listen to the siren warning. isn't it ? the hurricane will come, 99% will survive. well great !! 99% survival comes at a price. there'll be damage done, people will need medical aid, buildings would need maintenance, the electrical poles and all would need fixing. who's footing the bill ? would you remunerate ALL LOSSES the town suffered? how you gonna compensate that ten thousand people that died from covid because of the callousness"  </p>
<p>&rt; because we don’t do that for literally anything else and it would be interesting to me why you think covid is a special case when the data show that it decidedly isn’t </p>
<p>you jumped the gun, data show that it decidedly IS a special case. because of the virality, the way it spreads and how it has NO CURE. unlike you know, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/flu-treatment">flu</a>. just look to italy as an example, the entire healthcare gets overrun, nurses and doctors are among the casualty. ask them now if they had a vaccine back then, how many WON'T take it. i'll be surprised if anyone raise their hand</p>

<p>There have been a number of flu seasons in the last 100 years that have been as bad or worse than this COVID season for most of the population. What is different about covid is that it affects the over 70’s worse than the flu (while affecting the under 70’s less than some bad flu seasons). The data are clear — you just don’t want to see it. </p>
<p>If you take out nursing home deaths (which was admittedly a catastrophe but a human cause one) then Covid looks remarkably similar to a bad flu year. Again — we don’t react hysterically to bad flu seasons so why react this way to covid?</p>
<p>Your anecdote about the hurricane is silly. What you are essentially saying is that “no one is safe until everyone is safe” and that is simply an absurd standard because we don’t apply it to literally any other risk (besides, surprisingly, covid). By the way, the survival rate for covid is 99.95% for most adults under the age of 65. Finally with respect to your hurricane analogy — you are appealing to emotion and ad hominem attacks which are fallacies and don’t support your argument (heartless creep?). </p>
<p>And by the way with respect to healthcare professionals — they have some of the highest rates of refusal for the new vaccines. These are people who have been on the front lines and are still refusing to take the vaccine. Then you have people like me and my colleagues who work in vaccine development and will also be waiting. I find that interesting. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/945055</p>

        <p>buddy, the chart you showed compared deaths in 1892, that's more than one century ago. with the advancement of tech and med, wouldn't you think we should hold ourselves to a higher standard ? and your article is outdated  </p>
<p>refer to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html">this</a> , related to nursing home, it's estimated at 33% sure, take that out, it'll be more than 300k still, which is still 10 times that of yearly flu death toll. you don't look at the WORST years, you look at the recent 10 year average, because that's where we're at. you don't go "oh, the literacy rate in 1800s is X%, we're better than that, we should be good this year, we don't need to prioritise education"  </p>
<p>&rt; If you take out nursing home deaths (which was admittedly a catastrophe but a human cause one) </p>
<p>why would you take them out? how would you house the elderlies if not in nursing homes?  it's something you CAN'T avoid at that point in time. like Trump closing border will have an effect. if you want change things, use targeted approach swab people going in homes, ensure that healthcare workers follow SMM, restrict large gathering, change their routine, disinfect shared places etc  </p>
<p>&rt; you are appealing to emotion and ad hominem attacks which are fallacies and don’t support your argument (heartless creep?). </p>
<p>my bad, it was a copy and paste, i was merely mirroring the emotion displayed by the person i was talking to.  </p>
<p>&rt; Your anecdote about the hurricane is silly. </p>
<p>really, you think you're safe if you're unvaccinated ?  </p>
<p>&rt; By the way, the survival rate for covid is 99.95% for most adults under the age of 65 </p>
<p>again, you're looking at one part of the stats, are you suggesting we ignore everyone above age 65 ? or that the lives of people age 65 and above are worth less than that of their younger counterparts ? why's it important ? lives are lives, and the mortality rate of US as of today stands at \~2.3%, that's stats for people who die, not affected. like the hurricane affecting the town, covid just doesn't affect the 2.3%, there're a lot more in place, especially if a domino effect happens, like northern italy. a lot more like the people who recovered, will they face long term effect ? the strained healthcare, the stretched medical staff etc  </p>
<p>&rt; And by the way with respect to healthcare professionals — they have some of the highest rates of refusal for the new vaccines. </p>
<p>that's interesting to me too. but don't ignore the ones that do support <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/01/940158684/some-health-care-workers-are-wary-of-getting-covid-19-vaccines">vaccine</a> or have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/19/health-workers-covid-vaccine/">taken it</a> . do you think because it's politicise ? because it'll be interesting to show stats from other countries rather than just USA/UK, how about NZ ?</p>

        <p>It doesn’t show data from 1892. It shows data from 1892 plus several other flu years. You have misinterpreted the chart.</p>
<p>On elderlies I’m not suggesting forgetting about them at all. I’m suggesting vaccinating all of them who want to be vaccinated. Those who don’t want to be vaccinated are free to take that risk. </p>
<p>You are making stuff up at this point and I won’t be engaging with you any longer. The survival rate per the CDC is 99.95 for under 70 and greater than 95% above 70. The mortality rate is nowhere near 2.3% and you appear to just by lying at this point. </p>
<p>The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289900/</p>
<p>Risk groups are clear and those people should be prioritized for vaccination. Those who don’t want to be vaccinated can take the risk and determine whether or not that risk is acceptable.</p>

<p>yes, i saw the rest as well, i used 1892 as an example  because that looks higher than covid-19  </p>
<p>&rt; I’m suggesting vaccinating all of them who want to be vaccinated. Those who don’t want to be vaccinated are free to take that risk. </p>
<p>yes, that's your point from day 1, what i'm trying to say is you not vaccinating might endanger those that have yet been vaccinated or can't be.   </p>
<p>&rt; The mortality rate is nowhere near 2.3% and you appear to just by lying at this point. </p>
<p>man, just <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">look</a> , it's not hard to tell if i'm lying or not. recovered cases about 24 mil, death cases, about 570k, the math is 2.3% mortality. i'm not talking about those over or under 70, i'm talking about EVERYONE, no one here is questioning your 99.95% for people below 65 or 70 (it's actually lower) why you don't think anyone above 65 or 70 is unknown to me, they're human lives too. excluding them at this point is just selfish.  </p>
<p>&rt; Those who don’t want to be vaccinated can take the risk and determine whether or not that risk is acceptable. </p>
<p>that's if vaccination affects them and them only, just like masks. but no, vaccination is a community thing. community because you dying will implicate doctors and nurses, they have to house you, they have to care for you, doctors and nurses have to take time away from other patients in the hospital to tend to someone who refuses to take the vaccination. now that that times the 30% who won't be taking the vaccine. it's not like the world stops for covid. accidents still happen, people will still be hospitalized, it's added burden on something that can be prevented easily, vaccination.    </p>
<p>&rt; and I won’t be engaging with you any longer. </p>
<p>"This goes in circles until I give up and conclude that they aren’t interested in a rational discussion — they are interested in you doing what you are told because they do what they are told.

It is totally senseless to talk to these people and anything you share with them will be twisted, denied, or strawmanned into oblivion. " - (colcrnch 12 hours ago)  </p>
<p>just like how you're straw-manning the mortality rate above 65yos ? LOL. i would think excluding people above 65 is irrational since they're humans too.  you'd sound exactly like the person you talk about in your original comment.</p>

        <p>That guy was an idiot, but there are valid reasons for widespread vaccine adoption.</p>
<p>Viruses replicate within a host. Every time a virus replicates there is a chance it mutates. The mutation is random, meaning it could actually hinder the viruses ability to spread (that strain would die out quickly), but the mutation could make the virus more infectious (as seen with some newer strains). From here it is a simple numbers game. There is an extremely small chance the virus mutates juuuust right, but the number of times the virus replicates (opportunity to mutate) grows exponentially as a virus spreads through a population.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that the mutation affects the binding sites on the virus that the current vaccines are targeting. It doesn’t take a large alteration at the binding site to drastically reduce the ability for your antibodies to counter the virus. If this occurs, it basically resets the pandemic.</p>
<p>Widespread vaccine adoption reduces the number of viable hosts for the virus which is beneficial in two ways. 1) less hosts = less chance to replicate and mutate unfavorably. 2) less hosts = virus has a harder time spreading within a population since it can’t survive outside of a host for long. In some cases, if the vaccine adoption is high enough, you can nearly eradicate a virus (e.g. polio).</p>
<p>This is why widespread vaccine adoption is important. I don’t think it should be mandatory but I hope eligible, healthy adults choose to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>The risk of mutation is theoretically higher during a pandemic. In fact, what we are doing has never been tried before and it flouts previous CDC and WHO work not to vaccinate during pandemics. </p>
<p>The risks you describe would only be mitigated if we knew for certain we did not have what is known as a ‘leaky’ vaccine — a vaccine which protects the host but which does not impede transmission. This is another reason why we shouldn’t be vaccinating until after the pandemic has resolved as we don’t know if these vaccines are leaky because we don’t have the data (data which would be available to more traditionally developed products).</p>

        <p>Recent data indicated that some of the more popular vaccines reduce transmission rates. Keeping an eye on this to see if more data backs this in the coming months.</p>
<p>Can you expand on the rationale behind not vaccinating during a pandemic? Thats seems contrary to what studies have called out for at least 20 years. Even if onward transmission isn’t blocked, by vaccinating an individual you reduce the chance of the virus mutating since you effectively removed a potential host from the population.</p>
<p>I work in product development as well but primarily with medical devices. My pharma experience hasn’t been in vaccine development.</p>

        <p>The concern is something called ‘antigenic escape’ which is when a pathogen isn’t fully recognized by the immune system (this is a very basic explanation). The worry with the covid vaccines is that they are potentially overly specific which could prompt viral mutations at an accelerated rate thus contributing to new pathogenic variants. With a more typical vaccine — for example subunit — the immune system is exposed to the entirety of the virus and not just proteins from the spikes and this theoretically creates a more well-rounded immune response. Michael Mina from Harvard discusses this in some detail. You can look that up. </p>
<p>I want to be clear — I am absolutely not against vaccines — on the contrary I believe them to be the single most effective medical intervention ever developed. All I am saying is that the general population is FAR too comfortable with these vaccines given they have not gone through the same standard of safety monitoring (duration is key) that every other vaccine has AND these are a completely novel technology which has never achieved approval from a regulatory body despite numerous attempts. </p>
<p>The problem is one is completely unable to have a rational discussion.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the background. I will read up on those topics more. I feel the cobwebs of old microbio classes being dusted off here.</p>
<p>To confirm the general understanding of your first paragraph, a vaccine encoding resistance for the entire subunit that houses the binding sites responsible for human cell entry is better than the vaccine targeting the specific binding sites themselves. Is this because by targeting the entire subunit, the vaccine can still remain effective even if point mutations at the binding site or other locations on the subunit occur? Whereas the vaccine targeting the binding site specifically is rendered useless if small mutations occur affecting that binding site, so you are effectively selecting for viruses that have some benign mutation around the binding site that prevents the vaccine from being effective?</p>
<p>And agree on the vaccine front. I think people on both sides of the argument don’t grasp the effort required to bring a new drug or medical product to market, especially in the US. On the overly pro-vaccine front, you have people equating approval and authorization from the FDA and they fall back on “it’s basically the same thing”. On the flip side you have anti-vaxxers who think the FDA just rubber stamped whatever big pharma told them.</p>
<p>The truth is it’s a delicate middle ground. The FDA wouldn’t emergency authorize a vaccine that showed severe adverse events in a significant portion of trial patients. But we are likely to see new side effects discovered as vaccines are rolled out to populations that weren’t represented in the limited trial.</p>

        <p>A subunit vaccine is essentially a fragmentation process which breaks down the virus into constituent parts which can still be recognized by the immune system. These can be of varying sizes down to individual molecules that make up the virus. The idea is that you present ‘all’ of the virus to the immune system for understanding. The mRNA vaccines cause the manufacture of a protein which is limited to the spike of the virus. The concern is that any mutation away from this spike protein could allow the virus to evade the immune system. This can also happen when a subunit vaccine is used but imagine that there are still other components of the virus that have trained the immune system to recognize it because the ‘whole’ virus was utilized and not just a narrow portion.</p>
<p>This is all theoretical by the way.</p>
<p>What is interesting is your point on the FDA. The issue is that with vaccines, AE’s tend to pop up after years and that’s why we don’t license vaccines without 18-26 months of follow up data. Take a look at sanofi’s dengvaxia for an example. It launched with 36 months of follow up and was subsequently pulled from markets due to ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) worries. So  while I agree that they probably wouldn’t release a vaccine which showed severe AE’s my point is simply that they don’t have the data to make that very determination because they haven’t studied these vaccines with sufficient time and rigor.</p>
<p>Prior incidents with vaccines show clearly that AE’s can pop up after years and after millions of patients have taken them. Put simply, if you are taking the mRNA vaccines now, you are on the leading edge of one of the largest medical experiments ever conducted.  This is irrefutable.</p>

        <p>That would be fine if someone wanted to get a certificate or something stating they're STD free. Imagine the outrage from the gay community if a large percentage of them were no longer allowed to travel.</p>

        <p>An STD passport means that if you have std's, you would not be allowed to travel to certain places. The gay community is disproportionately affected by HIV, so it would hit them the hardest. 
Advocates of vaccination passports want to take it a step further, restricting people without the covid vaccine from going to restaurants, shopping, movies, travel, school, etc.</p>

        <p>‘Just stay home’ or ‘just socially distance’ would be a better analogy, as masks are not supposed to protect the wearer, but are instead supposed to protect others FROM the wearer.  (I am not a pro-lockdowner, just pedantic)</p>

        <p>that's false equivalency. you're clutching at straws here. think of the reason behind the passport. now think again about equivalating STDs with COVID, hint, transmission.</p>
<p>&rt;You can only <strong>get an STD</strong> from contact with semen, vaginal fluids, blood, or skin-to-skin genital touching. <strong>STDs</strong> can't appear out of thin air - you can only <strong>get an STD</strong> from someone who already has one. But many people who have an <strong>STD</strong> don't know it, because a lot of times there aren't any symptoms.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;or  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) — or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — are generally acquired by sexual contact. The organisms (bacteria, viruses or parasites) that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Sometimes these infections can be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mother to infant during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.</p>
<p>i think it's fair if you restrict the acts mentioned above for the way it's transmitted. BUT, if i fly with an STD positive passenger, i wouldn't get STD. i wouldn't get it if i go to a restaurant, or shopping or movies with one as well. but i will LIKELY get it if it's a covid positive person.   </p>
<p>which movie theater do you go to or which mall do you shop at which will expose you to vaginal fluids or semen from strangers?</p>

        <p>Seriously? Yeah there are other means of STD transfer like IV drug use and mother-child transmission during child birth.</p>
<p>No one prevents people with STDs from booking hotels, flights, etc. because STD carriers pose virtually no risk of transmission to other customers unless the other customer explicitly engages in sexual acts with the carrier. </p>
<p>COVID is not a great comparison here because a carrier can spread the virus to other customers without either party being aware or even directly engaging with each other.</p>
<p>To use an airline example, let’s say you were running an airline business today. When using your services, are customers at risk from contracting genital herpes from other customers? Technically yes, but they  would need to engage in some sexual act (which is likely outlined as a no-no in your travel policy).</p>
<p>When using your airline service, is there a risk of a customer with genital herpes spreading it to another customer without their knowledge or consent? Again, technically yes, but the probability of that occurring is extremely small and would require some pre-meditated actions from the carrier (and likely would end up with the carrier serving some jail time).</p>
<p>When using your airline service, is there a risk where neither party is aware that one has passed genital herpes to the other? Virtually none.</p>
<p>Replace Genital Herpes with COVID in the three scenarios above and you should arrive at a different conclusion.</p>

        <p>Wonder if the means of transmission makes this a false equivalency. If you walk into a store and pass on a std to everyone inside from the grandmother buying milk and the baby in the cart ... well you’re a psychopathic serial rapist.... so there’s that.</p>

        <p>While standing next to someone is probably not enough touching the same items could already be enough.</p>
<p>Considering that people are (at least to my observation) more likely to touch their faces to manipulate their mask it's not impossible that germs are even more likely to find an opening to enter the body.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To give a proper example:</p>
<p>Herpes is a smear infection.<br>
Let's say person a gets some saliva onto their fingers while fixing their mask. They then go on to chose some vegetables.<br>
They pick one up, find mold on it and therefore put it back.<br>
Introduce person B who does the same thing.<br>
Now they touch their mask and in the process touch their eye.<br>
Now the herpes virus is celebrating since it found a new host.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:<br>
In everyday life we meet billions of germs. Even more than that.<br>
When participating in said life there is a risk to catch (some really nasty) diseases.</p>
<p>Thats the risk of life.</p>
<p>Fear shouldn't control our lives. If someone is willing to let their fear control them they may do so but I politely forbid any involvement in my personal life by them.</p>

        <p>You’re right, and knowingly transmitting COVID to isn’t illegal yet. I don’t support it by any means, but looking from that point, of which one is illegal and which one isn’t, an STD free passport would be more "justifiable" than a COVID one</p>

        <p>Not in California. The law that made it illegal to knowingly transmit HIV was repealed in January 2020. Well, apart from sex workers. It's still a felony to accept money for sex without disclosing your HIV status.</p>
