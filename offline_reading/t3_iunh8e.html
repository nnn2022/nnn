    <strong>Daily Mail and The Sun - Propaganda alert - “Second coronavirus wave ‘won’t be as bad as the first thanks to new treatments and local lockdowns“</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12682381/second-coronavirus-wave-wont-as-bad-first-new-treatments-local-lockdowns/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12682381/second-coronavirus-wave-wont-as-bad-first-new-treatments-local-lockdowns/</a></p>
<p>“<strong>A SECOND wave of the coronavirus "won't be as bad as the first" due to new treatments and local lockdowns, experts have claimed.</strong></p>
<p>Officials claim that while <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12677683/uk-coronavirus-cases-rise-deaths-test-shambles/">cases are on the rise in the UK</a>, the curve will be flatter compared to the start and the peak of the pandemic in March and April.</p>
<p>It comes after the Office for National Statistics yesterday revealed that influenza and pneumonia is still killing ten times more people in England than Covid-19.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12672972/flu-pneumonia-still-killing-ten-times-as-covid/"> latest data from the ONS</a> revealed that deaths from coronavirus fell below 100 for the first time since March.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8737035/Experts-say-new-treatments-local-lockdowns-coronavirus-better-control.html">Daily Mail</a> reported that government officials believe that social distancing, combined with local lockdowns, will see a reduction in both deaths and case numbers.”</p>
<p>Or you can read the identical propaganda in the Daily Mail:</p>
<p>“Second wave 'won't be as bad as the first': Experts say increase in Covid cases is 'normal', new treatments and local lockdowns will keep it controlled and tough restrictions will do more harm to people than the disease”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government experts believe a second wave of coronavirus wouldn't be as bad</strong></li>
<li><strong>They suggest local lockdowns and social distancing would reduce the impact</strong></li>
<li><strong>There are also hopes that a vaccine could be ready by as early as next spring</strong><br>

<p>Believe, perhaps, suggest, hopes, maybe...not very scientific. The next wave of technology and computer modelling masquerading as Science begins...</p>
<p>Subliminal propagandising here, falsely emphasising that lockdowns, measures and treatments have caused and will continue to cause this lessening of a potential second wave, rather than natural herd immunity for a virus that - even accordingly to their own stats - pretty much died out over 10 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Who is still buying this? Next stop: Fluvid - a truly deadly conflation of flu and covid coming in the autumn...only the vaccine will save us!</p>
