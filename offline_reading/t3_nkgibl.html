    <strong>More Cyber Attacks coming as per Elitist Agenda</strong>
    <p><p>They plan on re-building the current economic infrastructure because of these 'Covid like cyberattack threats' . Part of the roll out will be the new era for Bretton Woods II with the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) launch, essentially rebuilding our financial system from ground zero.</p>
<p>The recent events that occurred with the Colonial Pipeline from the so called 'Darkside' Group that breached its network is BS. </p>
<p>Why do I think so you may ask?</p>
<p>Well.. What hacker would ask for a sum of money using a trackable currency like Bitcoin? (Which of course they have already succesfully tracked down the wallet address) </p>
<p>Any hacker asking for crypto would know better and would have used a privacy centered crypto like Monero, Zcash, Piratechain, etc.</p>
<p>This was an organized attempt to fearmonger just like Covid-19. These were strategically placed events that were likely thought out for years. The change in narrative succesfully makes the population comply with all their demands out of submissiveness and fear</p>
