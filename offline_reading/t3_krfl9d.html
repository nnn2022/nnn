    <strong>Q: "When can I get back to normal?" Washington State Department of Health A: Never</strong>
    <p><p>There was a recent vaccine forum. The host asked the below question and I transcribed the answer below.</p>
<p>49:48 Making Sense of Vaccines During COVID-19 - WA DOH (look it up on youtube)</p>
<p>Q: “I, like many people have been cooped up in my house for the majority, the vast majority of this year. So I must say that I’m ready to get out of the house. I’m ready to go to the next Marvel movie in a packed theater, kick my feet up without any masks in sight. When is that gonna happen? Now that we have these vaccines, they’re safe, they’re highly efficacious. When do we get to go back to quote unquote normal?”</p>
<p>Dr Corey: “Well, normal is individualized and it will take a little bit, a while. Its like playing, we know it prevents disease. We actually don’t know if it prevents you from actually, the virus landing on your nose, you not knowing it and still replicating in your nose and transmitting it unwillingly to someone else. Now we know most of the transmission does that. We know that college kids go visit the grandparents and the grandparents get sick. Asymptomatic acquisition and transmission is how this virus mainly spreads. So does the vaccine prevent that from happening? We actually don’t know that yet. So even if you get vaccinated there is security in being protected from getting disease and that may allow you to alter a lot of behavior. Go to the Marvel movie, go to a restaurant and get on an airplane. But that doesn’t mean that you can give up your mask. But at the moment you can’t give up your mask because that mask is needed for you not to infect somebody else. We do not know the knowledge at this point in time to say that you’re protected from hurting someone else. You’re pretty protected of your own benefit so we still have what we call a population effect and I hope people understand the community responsibility that you have when you get vaccinated.”</p>
<p>Dr LaSalle: “Yeah and its gonna take, you know there’s not enough vaccine to go around right now. So its gonna take a while for us to get the number of people that we need to get vaccinated vaccinated and people have to take the vaccine. You know, it won’t help if we have a vaccine that nobody takes. So we have to get people immunized. And yeah, if you know, if you’re not coughing and sneezing maybe you’re less likely to spread those things but we don’t, like Dr. Corey said, know about transmission and asymptomatic infection so until we get a larger percentage of the population vaccinated, we still have to take all the precautions we’re taking currently. And I don’t know when that’s gonna happen, my patients are asking me that, “when can I get back to normal?” And I will, you know take out my crystal ball and tell them, you know I’ll guess but don’t hold me to it. But maybe by the fall is kind of what I’m saying. Maybe fall, winter it will feel a little bit more normal but I don’t know if we’ll ever get back to totally pre-pandemic life entirely. Those are my thoughts.”</p>
<p>Dr Danielson: “I have always resisted this sort of “back to normal” kind of phrase and the thinking that goes with it. For lots of people, pre-pandemic was a difficult time for all of us, its been a difficult time and I hope that we are actually learning and gaining from this so that whatever we get to is based on deeper wisdom and some hard earned experience and knowledge. I’ll also say that, you know, just wherever you are sitting and listening and watching just I won’t be able to see you, but like snap your fingers if an important lesson that you’ve learned through this time is that we have a lot to do with our own fates. That we as individuals and a parts of communities have a lot to say about how things will be moving forward. We influence the course of this pandemic. Its on us, its up to us, sorry to borrow an Obama phrase, but “we are the ones that we’ve been waiting for in terms of really turning the corner in the most meaningful ways in this pandemic. We’re getting tools, we’re getting more tools and more knowledge. We’re getting more ways in which we can be better stewards of the people around us that we care about. Better stewards of heading towards a place where we’re able to hug again and see each other smiling when we’re face-to-face those kinds of things. But we are the stewards of that. We are the pilots in that process and there’s no way for us to avoid that lesson from these last nine or ten months. And I think that’s gonna have to continue to be very front of mind for us to move forward. Its hard to say because sometimes you’re tired and you just want someone else to rescue you. You want this to get better fast and you wanna just stop having to work so hard, make so many sacrifices and what I love about conversation on this panel and what I heard from Dr LaSalle and Dr Corey are just that there is not a sugarcoating rainbow kind of thread in this conversation. This is very real about what we don’t know what we’ll continue to learn. But I also feel so strongly that I’ll say it one more time that we have the greatest influence we have individuals, over what happens next."</p></p>

<p>Can you go to any business you want to? Can you go to "the latest Marvel movie"? Can you go out without a mask? Can you go out without a mask, and not get harassed by a group of mask nazis? Is your governor or whatever politician you follow implementing more restrictions? </p>
<p>Because, for many of us, this shit is not over. </p>
<p>Before you tell me, "Just stfu and stop wearing the mask and go outside!" Sure, I've done just that. My life isn't very pleasant or normal anyhow.</p>

        <p>Well, I think saying this is over is counterintuitive, maybe also naive. It's really not over yet, not until the countries all over the world stop enacting lockdowns and restrictions, and our way of life is restored.</p>
<p>As for what to do, we need more support; namely mass protesting and mass civil disobedience to counteract the mandates being put into place.</p>

        <p>But in that case, what more can that commenter do? This is moot because we don't know for sure their situation and are both just speculating. But outside of individuals refusing to adhere to the "new normal" starting in their own cities, what are they supposed to do for people in other cities? I'm genuinely curious what more you want someone to do, no hostility intended</p>

<p>This is very important. Also, F the WA unemployment. Was laid off in April and claimed unemployment for 3 months. Returned to work, and received an overpayment notice in November for all the money back. Tried to appeal but they're still pending. The government really doesn't care about working class folk.</p>
<p>If I get laid off again, I'm probably just going to skip unemployment all together. No debt and no money is better than no money and oweing debt to the government.</p>
