    <strong>Questioning CV-1984 is alright - unless you also touch on these topics, then many on here will violently attack you</strong>
    <p><p>From the least to the most severe "wrongthink" for this sub of "free thinkers":</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Questioning the existence of the beerus: </li>
</ul>
<p>You can rant on about what despicable liars and hypocrites the media and the piece of shit politians are, but don't question their whole fascism pretense, only how bad it is. (Though I have to admit that one got better in the last few weeks).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Not choosing to be literally enslaved: </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bit unexpected, but pointing out that voting means literally to choose between two pieces of shit to rule over you - which consequently makes you (and everyone else) their slave by definition - is something that you should not take part in, makes people on here blow up for some reason. </p>
<p>(And the obvious fact that the "election" is a scam anyway is even completely besides the point, because even if it were not, you would still deliberately choose to be bossed around, robbed and abused by some politician scum - which is literally the source of all problems right now, and obviously so.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Not being "positive" (=mostly deluded) about the future: </li>
</ul>
<p>Will get you quite nasty attacks, many will even blame you as the problem for why things are so bad in the first place (which is like blaming a rape victim who finds no way to resist the rape and realizes there is no way for them to stop it). Expect to get vile hate spewed on you for taking away their hopeium.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Veganism: </li>
</ul>
<p>Of course someone brings it up how there is some agenda to reduce "red meat"-corpse consumption (and that's partially correct, but there is obviously a far, far bigger agenda to normalize gulping down tortured corpses in the first place). </p>
<p>You will get bullied for pointing out that it's wrong to enslave, torture and murder others (even if they happen to not have human dna). Of course bullying vegans is completely normalized in the mainstream, so no surprise here, as you are only allowed to question the mainstream so much.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And the worst of all reactions you will get, expect severe bullying every single time:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Antinatalism: </li>
</ul>
<p>Pointing out that you have no right to unnecessarily force others into a lifetime of enslavement to a psychopathic ruling class in a fascist dystopian shithole.</p>
<p>- will get you the most vile reactions on here, because apparently <em>-Yeah this fascist system really, really sucks, we complain about it 24/7 on here, but why shouldn't I still unnecessarily force others into it so they get harmed and abused by it as well?-</em></p></p>

<p>I agree, but there is no further discussion possible here, that's the reason I'm posting this. Though the vent part is certainly true, as the op is a vent too basically.</p>

        <p>Don't know who you refer to with -that guy-, but the reason I'm venting about this is that you apparently only can go so far against the mainstream and will be shunned, shamed and attacked if you go further, doesn't matter if both agree on the topic of the scamdemic.</p>

        <p>when i see people say things like "not to go full conspiracy theorist" or any variant of this here when things have gotten to the stage they are at now makes me cringe harder than the normies talking about how they cannot wait for the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you still throwing around terms like that at this stage you deserve whats coming, some of us have been fighting this agenda for decades now not just since the latest rona narrative made life in their system uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Yes so true, this scamdemic is simply the same fascism as before on steroids, but no difference in principle -  some politician scum is bossing you around and abusing you, same as ever only increased in severity.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that they may have had it hard in terms of digesting it, as we had years to come to terms with reality, they only weeks and months and likely a far bigger illusion to fall from. Though still not a reason to lash out on the messenger.</p>

        <p>There's plenty of others you didn't mention. For example, don't bring up the health effects of 5G, or you're a complete lunatic.</p>
<p>However, you can't expect everyone to be "enlightened" and readily accept every new take you bring to the sub. Many of the people here are not truthers... they just see the BS in this one instance and are at various degrees of understanding and coming to terms with it.</p>

<p>I don't, but not getting bullied for having arguments that are not exactly pleasant in their implications would be a start.</p>

<p>Yes that's reasonable to assume, and yet the extreme hypocrisy in pointing out the shunning, harassment and attacks on mainstream subs and then deliberately doing the exact same thing when other parts of the mainstream are questioned is just too much for me.</p>
