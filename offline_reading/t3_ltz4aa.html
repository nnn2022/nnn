    <strong>I just feel so lost right now...</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone tell me what the point of life even is at this point? To be totally honest, if life stays as it is right now, it does not seem worth living - I totally understand why people are choosing to kill themselves. Call me selfish all you want. I am selfish, and I am sick of this shit. I don’t want to live in a world where masks and vaccines are going to be the norm. I do not see an end to the masking either - there is going to be a significant enough amount of people turning down the vaccine, and we will become the ones to blame for everything. The masks will have to stay because of those of us who are “selfish” and who don’t want the vaccine. We will remain in lockdown and we will continue to believe that our neighbour is the enemy. Critical thinking is no more, and people are totally brainwashed  I must be cut from a different cloth, because this shit ain’t for me - I don’t want to live in a society where most of the people are totally spineless and bend over the minute that daddy government tells them to. </p>
<p>I have worked hard over the past decade, I have overcome addiction and an unfortunate amount of trauma and hardship, I was finally beginning to feel like my life was actually headed somewhere in 2019. I am in my last year of university, I went from being on the dean’s list to just barely getting by now. I spend long, countless hours at my computer doing zoom meetings, homework, extra readings, group meetings, playing catch up, etc. - I am not even exaggerating when I say there are days where I have to squeeze in time just to eat a meal. On top of it all, I don’t even want to work in my career choice anymore (teaching). I feel like getting a vaccine is inevitable if you want to be a teacher and there is just no way in hell that is happening - I do not want the vaccine in any way, shape, or form. Also, there is no way in hell I can perpetuate this bullshit narrative in my classroom - I fully believe in keeping my biases out of the classroom, but this is one issue that I cannot <em>not</em> be biased about. It just seems pointless. I was once excited about being a teacher. I am beginning to loathe the idea now. </p>
<p>I legitimately just want to become a nomad but I have zero of the resources to do so... ugh, life is just so blah these days. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not suicidal, I am just venting. I have been through many hardships in my short 30 years of life, I will get through this (I think) but I just feel so lost right now.</p></p>
