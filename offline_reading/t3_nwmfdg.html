    <strong>When did you first become skeptical of this whole thing?</strong>
    <p><p>Years before the pandemic even began? At the onset? In the middle? Or perhaps you’re just now beginning. I’d be interested to hear as many of your responses as possible!</p></p>

        <p>The very start.</p>
<p>While people were pissing and shitting their pants over the "leaked" videos from China of people dying in the streets, I thought to myself, "Huh. Fake. Their government would never allow this to leak so easily." Then I saw the fear stirring up, and thought how it seemed like they were trying to drum up <em>something</em>. Once the notion of lockdowns began to happen in China and then Italy, the dread of them trying to do that in the US emerged.</p>
<p>Of course, I feared the lockdowns and the ramifications of such much more than the virus. I read the data coming from China and Italy in March, yes, <strong>March</strong>, and knew the virus was a nothingburger. I, mostly by myself, tried to share this data on Reddit and other places, to try to quell the fears. Nobody listened to me, and I often got mocked, insulted, yelled at, etc. Even by people I now see as regulars on here and at /r/lockdownskepticism (heh, "it's just for two weeks, bruh, just chill out lol!" Yeah, you were <strong>so</strong> right! Dumbasses.).</p>

        <p>A few months after this began when some of the really troubling information came out and mistakes started happening I began reading posts from people that had turned sooner and comparing it to what I was seeing. Up until mid 2020 I was still following the agenda and fully supported the UK government. </p>
<p>I still have trouble believing we are where we are right now it’s beyond comprehension that as many people as there are still believe that “normal” is returning here next week. Quite sad actually.</p>

        <p>When professionally produced floor stickers bearing among other imagery and graphics the phrase "social distancing" appeared at work less than two weeks after the whole mess started</p>
<p>&rt;But that doesn't <em>prove</em> anything</p>
<p>True, but consider the fact that "nonessential" businesses were being shut down as well as the means of distribution apart from food, medicine, military.</p>
<p>These were not decals sitting on a warehouse shelf gathering dust.  These were specifically designed. machinery configured, printed, cut, packaged, and shipped.  Understanding the manufacturing planning process with creating and setting printing plates presses. die cutting, etc. suggests to me very strongly that these had already been made before any of this went down.</p>
<p>Everythig else has borne the aroma of BS established by this small detail.</p>

        <p>In the very beginning when they were claiming that hospitals everywhere were inundated and overwhelmed, I had reason to be visiting 2 different hospitals in my area almost daily, and made a point of wandering the wards to see for myself (I was already no noobie to the idea that the media and government are audacious liars with ulterior motives). 
Well, surprise surprise... 
Then when they started the lockdown bullshit I called it as being the cover for financial collapse and governmental consolidation in nato countries... the former is now painfully evident and I am still seeing nothing to refute the latter</p>

        <p>When the first lockdown happened in March 2020, I was skeptical. By April, my state was still locked down, and I realized that there was something fishy going on, and that it wasn’t right. By June 2020 when a certain mass/ global protest happened, I was completely red pilled. </p>
<p>The same people who made an absolute mockery of the anti lockdown protestors and who accused them of spreading covid during their protests were gathering in massive crowds and protesting. Their hypocrisy stunned me. </p>
<p>A few people carrying signs saying “I need to work” and “freedom” were accused of k!ll!ng thousands, but then massive amounts of people who stood (and, in some situations, mostly peacefully rioted) in crowds for an extensive period of time were labeled as spreading absolutely no infection. There wasn’t even a “maybe we spread Covid, but it was a worthy sacrifice for our noble  cause”. Nope. Any mention of it spreading at all was shot down.</p>

        <p><em>Absolutely</em>. As soon as I saw the clear contradiction with those protests/riots I was definitely convinced. 
And I wholeheartedly agree with your last paragraph in particular. Censorship has been real since the beginning.</p>

        <p>When they said it came from bats and china released the genetic sequence of the virus before the bat story came out. </p>
<p>And also when said genetic sequence had evidence of gain of function research (the HIV protein sequences are kind of a giveaway) while the media was all "oh no bats".</p>
<p>Admittedly I thought it was a gain-of-function-lab-escapee-civilization-ender, but as soon as some actual data started coming out... I stopped caring about it. I just wish the rest of the world would too.</p>

        <p>I became skeptical about two months in which was around end of March or mid April. Honestly don't remember what exactly got me skeptical but I think it had to do with people starting to wear masks. Just thought that was a bit over the top when I saw people doing that. This was also the time where businesses in the area I was living had started to implement capacity limits, social distancing signs, and one way isles. All of this contributed to my skepticism since I thought it was being taken a little too far at that point.</p>

        <p>I think I figured that out. I was asking myself "why toilet paper" along with everyone.</p>
<p>I reckon they needed to easily create a low criticality shortage for something everyone uses very quickly. All for show, to induce panic. There's no high consumption item with more bulk than TP. It has its own aisle ffs. Reporting the shortage created that shortage very quickly which created the panic which created more a sustainable shortage and so on.</p>
<p>Anyone panic buying runs out space to store their stupid fucking toilet paper hoard quickly, levels are replenished and stocks return to normal after everyone has had a good flap and is scared .... shitless... It's genius.</p>

        <p>I realized it was really fucked up when our governor shut down the majority of businesses unless you just ordered something and left. Crowd control could have been done from the very beginning while keeping as many people employed as possible. </p>
<p>When the BLM protests were happening all over last year, some hospitals were told not to ask people if they attended any protest or were in a very large group (don't remember the exact wording) due to making it "isolating" for people who would get tested. </p>
<p>The vaccine is what really sealed the deal for me. If you are elderly and/or have a lot of health problems it is probably worth it to get it, however for everyone else? Probably not and don't force it on people.</p>

        <p>Not trying to brag, but almost immediately. I’ve been so skeptical of the media and the establishment after seeing so much blatant propaganda for so many years that anything they tell me I automatically assume it’s untrue. Not only that, but I immediately start thinking about motive and looking where the money goes. That usually solves it. </p>
<p>Took me about two weeks after the first mention of Covid to understand where it was headed. I was already on edge about Gates because he’s been pushing eugenics, experimental vaccines, and comprehensive electronic IDs for years, so as soon as I saw him weigh in, it was clear to me what the endgame was.</p>

        <p>No, I don’t think it’s bragging, you have a valid point. I haven’t watched the news (except for small clips) in years. I think that a lot of people have become more skeptical of not only the government, but the media as well. As long as it makes money, they’ll continue saying what (some) people want to hear.</p>

        <p>For me it was the morality rate. I took the whole thing somewhat seriously at the very beginning. But then I saw the mortality rate never became really alarming. Young people weren’t dropping dead in the streets, whole townships weren’t vanishing, families weren’t being wiped out, etc. </p>
<p>I was still cautious for a little while, but only moderately. Plus I’m a Floridian so by last Summer I was already over it.</p>

        <p>Well, like I said, I was a shit disturber. I was no stranger to the principal's office, haha. They never got me on the hook for anything that could have allowed them to fully expel me though. Plus, my grades were good in spite of my frequent antics. They generally just didn't know what to do with me, so I usually just ended up in the in-school suspension room.  </p>

        <p>The literal second I heard there was a new virus. They’re always nothingburgers. When the lockdowns began I knew this was “the big one” they were going to use to take away all our rights and force vaccinations. My coworkers thought I was crazy, but I could clearly see that the fatality rate being reported was the CFR and it was being compared to IFR for flu. Two totally different measures of fatality. The lies were obvious from the start.  Then when my boss pulled up the COVID patient count of 62 across our 24-hospital system and condescendingly asked if there were “any questions” I knew that even in the healthcare industry people were outsourcing all their opinions to the media. They don’t think at all. 2.5 patients/hospital is NOT a pandemic, but the TV said it, so it is true. I couldn’t believe it was happening, but it was clear.</p>

        <p>I was one of the first people offered the vaccine because of my job. I didn’t want the vaccine then. My boyfriend was talking about how vaccine passports could be a thing at some point. I was like that’s ridiculous of course no ones going to force an EUA vaccine onto people. I thought the vaccine was there for people who were scared and wanted to protect themselves. A few months later all I can see and hear are people trying to coerce people into doing something against there personal choice for their body. I am still not vaccinated. I didn’t want the vaccine way before I read into any ‘conspiracy’ information. I have my other vaccinations. For some reason everyone is assuming I made this choice because of conspiracies I’ve read or that I’m anti all vaccines. The truth is that I chose to not take the vaccine out of my own choice for my body and that choice is being threatened by media and loved ones. This is what sparked my skepticism.</p>

        <p>When I saw demonstrations of people in Berlin, Germany. Before that, I thought: It's a fringe thing. Then I saw their posters and banners, which weren't denying anything.

I thought this would be somewhat of an intellectual endeavor, a thought exercise, it can't hurt me if I start to do my own research about all of this.</p>
<p>Some months later, I was on a train, and was singing to myself "deine propaganda" ("your propaganda"), a line from SchwarzVyce, a lockdown-critical musician from Germany. I didn't notice that others heard me sing. But I noticed that they have must felt the same way: That there is propaganda in the air. I could tell because they didn't bring me down, they were puzzled maybe, but they wouldn't deny the propaganda, I think they felt it too.</p>

        <p>Not immediately. The first narrative of flatten the curve because hospitals were getting full sounded okay to me. Our prime minister said we would need to create herd immunity (through natural spreading of the disease) and protect vulnerable people sounded logical too. 
But almost right after that speech by being criticized about this the PM actually denied having said that (while the whole nation listened), when the curve was flat, the narrative changed (test results instead of deaths were counted, whereas there was hardly any testing in the beginning), mouth masks were first said to be ineffective, then became mandatory, we heard stories of a GP working with HCQ helping patients getting threats from inspection. There were so many strange things happening...
I cannot believe so many people arent critical still.</p>
