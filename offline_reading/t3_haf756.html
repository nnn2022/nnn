        <p>I get so angry that the media foolishly looks at increased case numbers, but ignores the facts that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Far more tests are being done</li>
<li>Many of the positives arenâ€™t serious infections and include people who are younger and are far less likely to have complications</li>
<li>Hospitalizations and deaths have decreased in most areas.</li>
</ol>

        <p>That's why getting the confirmed cases up won't help, even though it would show how many people get infected without dropping dead. They simply don't care about that. The virus has "gone viral" and people are more afraid of just catching the virus than actually dying from it, so more testing will only make people more afraid of those big scary numbers on the TV screen.</p>

        <p>Exactly, they seriously want us to believe that there are currently 8.3 million confirmed cases right now all sitting in ICUs on ventilators and fighting for their lives, and that if we leave our houses, we will be one of them.</p>
<p>To get to that conclusion, you have to:</p>
<p>Ignore the 4.4 million of them who have recovered.
Ignore the 450 thousand of them who have already died.
Ignore the 3.4 million of those cases who are mild. 
Ignore the fact that testing has ramped up.
Pretend the 54 thousand worldwide who are in critical condition represent all of them.</p>
<p>Basically, to believe the narrative, you have to ignore reality. So they'll refuse to report any of this simply because they're afraid that the reality of the situation "might send the wrong message." But if "sending the wrong message" is what the media is so worried about, then maybe the virus isn't worrisome enough on its own afterall.</p>
