    <strong>Are Masks making people more confrontational?</strong>
    <p><p>I had an unpleasant interaction with another shopper at the grocery store today: I was kind of rushing around to get my things and get home before it got any hotter outside and I cut my cart a little close to some middle aged woman‚Äôs cart in my haste. Whoops. Instead of a number of things she could have said, she passive aggressively says ‚Äúexcuse you!‚Äù but acts like she didn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôm not unconfrontational myself, and I turned to her and said, ‚ÄúSorry?  You don‚Äôt need to be rude.‚Äù  She continues to pretend she‚Äôs minding her own business and just quips ‚Äúyou‚Äôre rude!‚Äù and waddles off on her way. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was trying to figure out why this interaction bothered me so much, and it occurred to me that it seems to me that people are more willing to be rude and have confrontations with a faceless person, but also know that they too aren‚Äôt being seen either. I doubt this person would have gotten so asshurt about my faux pas, and even could have expressed her dismay with a facial expression, but instead had the freedom to be a troll like an internet commenter. </p>
<p>You guys have any experiences like this one, or noticed this effect from widespread masking?</p>
<p>Edit: I feel I should make it clear that I was masked too during this incident. I live in California and just want to do my groceries in peace. </p>
<p>Also: which one of you trolls gave me that award? lmao üòÇ</p></p>

        <p>Last week, I was having lunch with my family at a restaurant (indoors). I was chatting with them about all the BS this situation is, telling them about data, studies, common lies and misconceptions, etc. </p>
<p>A couple at the table next to us were having coffe with masks on (lol). The guy was holding his phone funny. Like he was recording me.   <br>
I called him out.    </p>
<p>"Hey, like what you're hearing? Hi to everyone on your social media".     </p>
<p>Him "what? Sorry? (In a nervous way).      </p>
<p>Me: "you're recording me, aren't you?".      </p>
<p>Him: "no I wasnt, I promise. Here, check my phone if you want".      </p>
<p>Me: " nah, mate, I don't care. Share it, I've nothing to be ashamed of".     </p>
<p>He left immediatly.     </p>
<p>I was surprised at myself, I'm never the kind of person looking for conflict. But this virus has forced me to be more vocal. I've learned we won't get back our freedom by being quiet.</p>

        <p>Yup. It‚Äôs kinda how people get irrationally mad at how people drive sometimes when they make small mistakes and start honking and yelling. It‚Äôs because they see the car and not the person driving who probably just made an honest mistake, same with the mask. The mask makes people view you as an object with no emotion because there‚Äôs no emotion to see or express. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve found people in stores these days incredibly rude and unforgiving over small things.</p>

        <p>Pisses me off when people use the horn for expressing anger rather than its true purpose of warning others of a hazard. Like, how do you think the cars around you are going to react when you honk? It just makes them angry too. And if someone is deliberately breaking the rules, your honking isn't going to suddenly realign their moral compass.</p>

        <p>Oh for sure, honk in that situation! In that case, you are reminding them to move. Your honk has a clear purpose. I'm talking about situations where people honk but there's no point to it - like for example, I'm driving say 10 under the limit because it's rainy and dark. Person behind me wants to go faster. Too bad, I've picked this speed for a reason and honking isn't going to make me change that.</p>

        <p>Got ya. That's really the only time I use my horn outside of the rare occasion someone is backing out of a parking spot and doesn't see me coming.</p>
<p>I deal with that same shit when its snowing/raining hard enough to where I dont feel comfortable going the speed limit but some douche wants to tailgate me. I will admit, and I know its petty of me, but those people get the middle finger when they finally pass me.</p>

        <p>Hopefully you don‚Äôt live in NY/NJ bc that happens all the time here. </p>
<p>I hate it too. Had to break up with someone partly (there were definitely other problems but this was one) bc of his honking and the anger he‚Äôd get over fairly small errors people made while driving, and never made attempts to stop when I made clear how uncomfortable it made me (my dad has serious road rage problems that have ended horribly with me in the car as a kid so it‚Äôs a sensitive issue for me).

        <p>Funny enough when you're driving a convertible with the top down, or a bike, I've noticed people are a little more considerate around you. Because they can see you driving it, not just the rolling hunk of steel in front of them.</p>
<p>The real psychos will still cut you off at 80 mph even if you're driving a Miata with the top down. They're probably the same people who will actually fight you over a mask.</p>

        <p>This is it, 1000 times. If I can get all conspiracy theorist for a second... what‚Äôs changed in our world thanks to the internet? Yeah a lot of people have lost anonymity through social media... but on platforms like this and 4chan they can spout whatever hate they want! Recourse free! </p>
<p>That‚Äôs what these masks are about. Furthering dissent between the masses with the protection of not being found out. You saw it coming with the ‚ÄúOk boomer‚Äù memes. I thought that was so fuckin weird that with all the ways people are divided, suddenly it was generational on top of it all. It‚Äôs simple. Divide and conquer. That‚Äôs what ‚Äúthey‚Äù want.</p>

        <p>Masks dehumanize you. I ran an experiment back when we were allowed outside to exercise and with a mask on as I walked around the block in circles one morning, nobody said a word to me. The next day, I removed my mask and the very same people now all said a cheery, "hello!" as they would have done before the pandemic.</p>
<p>They say familiarity breeds contempt but this is not, usually, the case it's differences that trigger the basic revulsion complex in human beings and it is why, contrary to popular belief, the smallest children often act like massive racists - they're biologically programmed to recoil from those different from themselves (a sensible drive back when we lived in small groups and non-group members would have been a huge threat but today, it's a bit of a pain).</p>
<p>Masks make everyone different from us. In this situation, for many people, this makes you the enemy.</p>

        <p>There have been studies on this I think. Deindividuation. It‚Äôs why groups like the KKK wear masks - when your face is covered you feel you can get away with more. Reducing people to automatons and robbing them of the full range of facial expression has consequences.</p>

        <p>My trick with the masks is that once you get past workers that want to play mask police, you‚Äôre on your own against the Karen‚Äôs. Just ignore everybody. Don‚Äôt pay attention to anyone. Act like you‚Äôre deaf and super laser focused on finding your <em>product</em>. Then if someone confronts you they are over stepping a boundary where they‚Äôve bothered you so much you have to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù back into focus. Then it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat? What do you want from me? I‚Äôm shopping. Huh? Mask? What are you talking about? No I‚Äôm not doing that? Why would I do that?‚Äù Just walk away.</p>

<p>I do this as a matter of course.  I have significant hearing imparement and when someone talks at me with a mask on I cannot understand them.  In part due to the muffling effect of the face diaper, but also since I rely on seeing the lips to aid in understanding the sounds that form words.</p>

        <p>I think mask wearers are jealous of people who have their faces uncovered in their casual activities. They may feel inferior. I will try to explain with a better analogy I thought of.</p>
<p>Imagine you go to a beach in a shiny swimming trunk and before getting into the water, you notice some people walking on the waterfront wearing coats with hoods, gloves, boots watching you. Lets say it's a sunny winter day for the setup. What do you think these people think of you in that instance? Do you see the dressing contrast? And because of it, you are now an attraction point, yet you don't insult or bother anyone. But their feelings are not neutral they will include admiration and jealousy. It becomes like a challenge between you and them.</p>

        <p>The insanity is wearing on us all. Everyone is at a snapping point. I've noticed that I've begun muttering to myself about stupid shit.  I see it... I say something about it.  I'm just talking to myself... but I'm starting to talk to myself to the point where others can hear it.  I like to start my day with breakfast, a cup of coffee, and my laptop while sitting on the veranda.  Last week I stepped out the door, my hands full with my laptop acting as a serving tray, when I looked down and saw a woman with a huge dog.  The dog was trampling around in my landscaping while she stood on the sidewalk holding a leash that was getting tangled in an exotic hibiscus I had planted less than twelve hours earlier.  It's a unique Indian Hybrid that I ordered as a seedling, and had nursed and pampered for more than four years. I had chosen the spot I wanted to plant it, had removed existing plants, and carefully prepared the area for that Hibiscus, along with another Tahitian Hibiscus that I had grown from an imported seed. Two one-of-a-kind plants that can never be replaced. I haven't even had my first sip of coffee, and I'm seeing some idiot and her dog trampling my plants.  So I muttered to myself...  <em>Oh... Get The Fuck OUT!</em> and continue carrying my breakfast to my sitting area.  The woman turns and looks around and says "Are you talking to me?"  I ignore her and put my things down. So she shouts... "Are you talking to me?  I asked you a question... Are you talking to me?" So I shouted back <em>Yes!  I'm talking to you. Get your fucking dog out of my landscaping.  What the fuck is wrong with you?</em>  "Well you don't have to be rude about it.  You need to say please!" to which I shouted back <em>If you're going to be rude enough to let your fucking dog trample my landscape, I'll respond in any way I damned well please. Now Please... Get your fucking dog the hell out of my landscape</em>  To which I got a "Fine... I'll never walk my dog on this side of the street again, I don't need this abuse"   All the while, her sister (a woman in her 60's who walks by and exchanges pleasantries with me while I work in my garden) was smiling and waving like she's happy to see me, completely oblivious to what's going on.</p>
<p>The next morning I'm sitting there drinking coffee, and here they come again...  The woman tugs on the leash, and says to the dog "Come on... let's not stop here.. we don't want to make that crazy man angry again."  As they pass, her sister looks up, smiles, and gives me another friendly wave.</p>

        <p>This social medium, reddit facebok etc, seems to make people more confrontational.</p>
<p>I think it's because there's a greater space between us. No faces or voices or any of that human stuff. All of us isolated within our own mind.</p>
<p>I think that can make you feel safe to bark and curse. It can also make you feel a kind of hunger. The satisfaction of any kind of simple society is gone. All that registers is, well, the barks and curses. And such loud crass stuff. </p>
<p>Yes, I think that masks can do a similar trick.</p>
<p>There's only clearly shouted words and silence. Society becomes crude barking or nothing.</p>
<p>What do you expect? They're taking our face. Faces are a huge part of communication.</p>

        <p>Wearing the masque gives people a false sense of security. The similar mentality that drives a keyboard warrior. They can't see your face, you can't see theirs. </p>

        <p>The psychology of masks? LTC David Grossman explains in his book, On Killing:</p>
<p>If an enemy combatant has a face covering, it is 60% more difficult to connect with that person and feel empathy or compassion. This has nothing to do with training or killing, it is just the way human brains work. </p>
<p>So over a period of time, masks will alter our way of viewing each other as humans, and cause people to be on average 50% more prone to violence, and 50% less empathetic.</p>
