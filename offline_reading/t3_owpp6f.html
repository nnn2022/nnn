<title>The Republicans keep making this pandemic political so I have to keep wearing a mask so no one thinks I'm a Republican!! The anti-vaxxers keep making shameful, unwarranted comparisons to The Holocaust so we should segregate them into camps and force them to take the heckin' jab!! That'll learn 'em!</title>

    <p><p>Um, you're spreading dangerous misinformation, sweety, so let's take away your right to free speech, mm'kay? Mm'kay. While we're at it lets censor anything and anyone we don't like. Gosh, we're SO progressive!! We are truly building a better world for our heckin' kids!!! Never mind the fact that they're inheriting a FUCK-TON of debt and are probably gonna have to wear masks for the rest of their miserable fucking lives because we've invested far too much energy and resources into myopically fighting Covid now and we don't want to admit we might have been wrong about any aspect of the heckin' pandemic!!</p>
<p>At least I felt good and virtuous as people killed themselves in droves, small businesses closed their doors forever, women and children were locked up with their abusers, the economy collapsed, celebrities and politicians flouted the same rules they preached, an insurmountable backlog of hospital cases and treatments built up higher and higher, a technocratic breed of fascism and authoritarianism was ushered in by governments around the World, mostly peaceful yet fiery BLM protests raged, media outlets ignored or demonized anti-lockdown protests as super spreader events, everyone's mental health shat the bed, childhoods were destroyed and kids education and development was stunted, masks polluted the planet and adverse side effects and deaths from the jibby-jabberinos went completely ignored by governments, Big Pharma and the media!!!</p>
<p>I'M A HECKIN' HERO!!!</p></p>

        <p>I can't wait until we all finally make it to the camps together.  The wife and I have so many fun yard games planned, and she's a great camp cook who can make do with very little (and you know there will be very little).  Can't wait to meet all of you guys!</p>
