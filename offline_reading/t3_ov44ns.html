        <p>They are not. There's a small vocal minority that knows what's going on and protests... and there's a huge majority that listens to the government propaganda, and thinks that small minority is just pulling everyone down with their "anti science" bullshit.</p>
<p>The most effective tool of the propaganda around all this is the sense of moral superiority that the propaganda was able to instill in the unthinking majority.</p>
<p>You have people that haven't done the slightest amount of research and wouldn't be able to if they tried telling people that spent maybe months of their lives looking into this that they're "anti science" and "don't believe in science", while feeling <em>so fucking good</em> about it because they're 100% sure they're on the right side of things.</p>
<p>It's the moral sense of superiority that makes everyhing work. Most of those people won't even <em>listen</em> to what you have to say. They just nod and smile until you're done talking, like if they were talking to a crazy person. <em>Yeah sure buddy, I'm sure you believe that</em>. <em>Geez, these antivaxers. Good there's not many of those, right? Some people are completely deranged</em>. It doesn't matter what you tell them.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, the whole “might is right” thing that’s been pushed onto human society in this age is indeed an issue that needs addressing. Love the perspective. Very true words spoken here</p>
