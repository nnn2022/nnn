    <strong>Evidence that COVID-19 does not spread through asymptomatic carriers?</strong>
    <p><p>I saw a comment on this sub recently that I thought made a lot of sense. This user pointed out that whether or not a mask is effective is completely irrelevant if COVID-19 does not spread through asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>Are there any recent studies showing that asymptomatic carriers do not spread COVID-19?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>It's very hard to prove such a thing. </p>
<p>The problem is that presymptomatic spread is real, and there is really not much of a difference between no symptoms and very mild to not noticeable symptoms. So it's most likely possible for someone that is infected to experience very mild symptoms, and not realize they are sick, and then spread the disease. </p>
<p>But the reality is that this kind of spread is very rare. If I am infected, but showing very minimal symptoms, it's unlikely that I would be able to give someone a large enough viral load to infect them if we are just passing each other in the store. Infection generally happens due to prolonged exposure in close quarters.</p>

        <p>I'd love to see something like that, too, I feel like it's true but I can't find any studies to show a Doomer.</p>

        <p>This isn’t a rabbit hole I’m interested in going down. We may as well battle out the concepts now while the wound is open:</p>
<p>If this pandemic doesn’t have asymptomatic spread but the next one does, is it okay to be <em>forced</em> to cover our faces and not see each other for years on end? Because that’s the argument you will be awakening if you pursue this.</p>
<p>I personally want to battle the concept of “healthy until proven sick,” the concept of being able to legislate the personal lives of people to such an atrocious extent, and the concept that unelected public health authorities should wield this kind of god-like power without legislative controls.</p>
<p>So if the evidence against asymptomatic spread isn’t available or draws the wrong conclusion (that it does exist), are you ready to submit to a national mask mandate, even though high risk people have the option of isolating?</p>
<p>I’m not.</p>

        <p>I am not either. The issue is, pro-maskers use the argument “you are required to wear pants in public! Why not a mask? What’s the difference?” To which I don’t really know how to respond. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>I don’t actually know if most places require you to wear pants. Oregon does not. Non-sexual public nudity is legal, but not wearing a mask is <em>illegal</em>.</p>
<p>People wear clothes more out of social pressure and I for one, wear pants because the benefit to me outweighs the costs (social and otherwise). They also protect me from the weather and from chafing. Further, I don’t believe people should be stoned and arrested for not wearing pants. They are making their own decisions about such things. And many private businesses, as is their right, exercise the option to not serve unclothed people. All of this happens outside of government mandates. The state and the justice system aren’t involved in these choices and transactions. It happens at a private level.</p>
<p>So there’s your explanation why the government shouldn’t be mandating widespread, indefinite mask usage. It’s none of their damned business. And it’s an infringement on the individual AND private business.</p>
<p>As to why you personally would choose not to wear one - definitely, studies on transmission would relevant, here. The effect on transmission would be the “benefit,” and the negative effect on society and YOU personally would be the cost. It still remains an <em>individual</em> calculus.</p>
