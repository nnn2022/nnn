        <p>This is what happens when you have open borders - their entire subreddit has been taken over by liberals.</p>
<p>I've talked to some real libertarians (they're far and few in-between) and they're absolutely in favor little-to-no immigration exactly because of shit like this.</p>

        <p>The primary problem that most don’t understand is the controlled groups used to straw man the true opposition to this authoritarianism. </p>
<p>The so called alt right, trumpers, proud boys, even desantis and the Republicans ie Marg Green the list is long and all of the characters and groups are controlled opposition. Many of which appear extremely ignorant which is by design. There is even an element within the Protestant churches and evangelical conservative groups playing into a specific narrative. </p>
<p>It runs deep, and without understanding how tptb control and shape the narrative it’s easy to get sucked into these groups that are playing into their hand. They want people to protest bc they want people asking for CHANGE and the protests are not any real threat. A proportional response would be much more appropriate but thanks to Jan 6 and the Whitmer situation we would just be considered terrorists for standing up for ourselves. </p>
<p>It’s way beyond what most people understand but it’s these sort of groups misrepresenting our position that people are arguing against. </p>
<p>Generally speaking it is simply being against government control and forced medical treatments and against tyranny. Not that we are a cohesive group with all of our positions but I think we can agree on these basic principles.</p>
<p>But ya what a joke of a sub.</p>

        <p>Most "libertarians" just hate taxes.  They couldn't care less about other people's autonomy.</p>
