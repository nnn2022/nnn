    <strong>robbed of life experience??</strong>
    <p><p>for those who continue to advocate for shutdowns, do they not care about life experience? </p>
<p>I'm in my late 20s and I feel like my 20s are getting robbed. However, everytime I say that, I'm accused of not caring about the 70-year-old next door. I'm allowed to care about my own livelihood while also caring about someone else. I don't understand why people jump to this presumption. </p>
<p>I'm just so confused. are people not worried that they are wasting precious years of their lives? Are they not realizing that they'll never get these years back? If anyone could explain to me, please let me know. I'd love to understand.</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same. I’m 20 and this year i was so excited because i became more social and was started to go out more. I feel robbed because i can’t live my life since everything is closed and my friends are all scared as fuck.</p>
<p>But nowadays i don’t care anymore. I’ve been going out on my own and i don’t mind, i will just make new friends.</p>

        <p>Cancun is good. Touristy but the night clubs are open, most of the beaches are open and you can go on a ferry/booze cruise to Isla Mujeres or drive to Tulum. If you're into hostels and meeting/partying with like-minded people (Covidiots don't travel right now), visit the Mayan Monkey in Tulum or the one in Cancun. I was there last month with a few friends and it was amazing.</p>

        <p>I am  in my late twenties too and I feel the same way as you. I hate it when people say that stuff about different ages too. We can be upset for ourselves and others too. </p>
<p>This wasted time is a huge concern for me because it is holding me back. Tomorrow isn't guaranteed. I've already discussed it with my fiance and our plan is to ride out the winter and see what happens. If it is still looking bad in the spring we are going to look into moving. Life is too short for this.</p>

        <p>I feel like boomers are an entitled generation and haven’t come to terms with the fact that they are in the later stages of the lifecycle. Elderly have always been more susceptible to illnesses but for some reason this year it is a big deal. </p>
<p>I turned 30 this year so I’ve gotten to at least have some milestone memories that Zoomers haven’t gotten to experience. I also have a two year old son who I worry about what experiences he will miss out on. 70 year olds have experienced life I’m much more saddened by this diet life experience our youth are getting.</p>

        <p>I've noticed this sub has a lot of 25-35 year olds. I have a hypothesis for that - most people around 30 have lived enough that they know how fun life can be when you get established and aren't just starting a career, but aren't completely burdened by mortgages, kids, etc.</p>
<p>Whereas much younger people have grown up on an unhealthy diet of socially isolating social media, mobile phones, and aren't yet out in the wider world and so don't care or know what they're missing out on.</p>

        <p>I was thinking this yesterday how “back in my day” social media was just starting to become a thing with Facebook. I blame the mainstream media and social media for this reaction we see from citizens today about everything from pandemics, protests, and elections. It’s really sad to me. This is not healthy for a society to be gaslit by the media and social media everyday. I’m so fortunate that I was raised during a time when Zoom wasn’t seen as an adequate substitution for life events.</p>

        <p>The funny thing for me is that I was an early adopter of this lifestyle. As a teenager at about 14 I migrated most of my social life online during the winter (due to cold) and played video games online with my friends over Teamspeak/Vent/Mumble. Until I was 18 and went to university it became my primary mechanism of socialising.</p>
<p>I won't say I hated it but there's a reason that <em>as soon as</em> I got out of my neglectful home and out of my hometown I suddenly went radio-silent on the internet. I stopped being available altogether. I went back once I got a job and had more free time in the evenings, but we're talking a dozen hours a week while the majority of my free time was still face to face, real, interactions.</p>
<p>But now it's forced... I can't stand it.</p>

        <p>Yes this is my #1 concern in general, not just with Covid. So the restrictions exacerbate it a lot. You (and I) are selfish for wanting to live your life and that's okay. People are more selfish for insisting on robbing you of substantial quality of life just so they can feel slightly safer.</p>

Yes people are selfish, that's normal, but what fucking pisses me off the most is that the lockdown lovers pretend they're altruistic and not selfish. They're absolutely some of the most selfish people around. They aren't harmed by or benefit from the lockdown <em>and lie about it</em>. It's about the "old people". Fuck off it's not. These same cunts were calling for the death of boomers before they became a convenient excuse for lockdown.</p>
<p>They just want to sit home, play "Among Us" or water their plants or whatever other shit they like to do without the awkwardness of having to reject people for socialising and the "hardship" of going to work.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am in my 40s and trust me on this, when you hit your 40s, your impending mortality becomes way more real than it was in your 20s. I want this year back and I am not willing to surrender another to their fear.</p>

        <p>Last 3 years before COVID I got the travel bug and enjoyed going places a lot. Now I feel I'll never be able to do it again. For now, Mexico and the states (if you are in the US) are still open but it's just not the same and if we don't do something about it, we will be stuck in our "smart cities with our smart scooter going to the smart food banks"</p>

        <p>I’m in my mid 20’s and advocate using your brain. I advocate for needed lockdowns <em>because</em> I value life experiences and my community. </p>
<p>Gonna jump on masks first as they’re a huge factor in curbing cases and preventing lockdowns. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask isn’t hurting you or anyone. Seriously. I can’t grasp that. At worst it’s protecting you and others while being a little annoying and fogging glasses up, at best it’s protecting you and others. </p>
<p>I will not listen to the medical exemption excuse as that has been debunked repeatedly. Wearing a mask isn’t killing you or depriving you of oxygen, it’s just annoying you. There is a difference. People with breathing complications and compromised immune systems are absolutely the most critical that should wear masks and as someone with asthma and PTSD (two frequently used excuses to unmask) I feel more inclined to wear one to protect myself. </p>
<p>Onto actual lockdowns; </p>
<p>The longer people whine and spread it around like hot cakes, the longer and more frequent lockdowns will be. I don’t want to be in a lockdown, but if I have to I’m gonna just do it right, and be done with it. </p>
<p>Where I live (dual citizen not living in USA), everyone took this seriously and committed to the lockdown, masks, and social distancing. We live very normal lives as a result. </p>
<p>Restaurants, bars, clubs, schools, parks, etc. It’s all open. Our weekly street parties continue to happen and only stopped for our one lockdown. We close down a huge strip, we have street vendors, little games, and it’s literally a party that we have every week sometimes multiple times a week that our village has done for years. They’re so much fun. And we get to do those and live normal lives because we sucked it up for a few weeks and now we get to live life like normal mostly (markets and small businesses require masks and you get your hands sprayed with sanitiser when entering buildings are the only difference from pre-Covid). </p>
<p>I go out to parties, my favourite restaurant, hang out with family and friends, go to concerts, be in my community and literally dance in the streets with them because we took it seriously, sucked it up, and moved on. We take weekend trips to the big cities, go to museums, parks, festivals... </p>
<p>Meanwhile, my three relatives living in the USA I fear for them constantly and they are upset and frustrated because they feel like it will never end as cases keep rising there... </p>
<p>Life experiences are only being taken away because you’re letting them be taken away. I know that sounds harsh, but... as people continue to deny, deny, deny and more people die, and cases rise while being given all the resources to stop/slow the spread and return to normalcy that they refuse to use... it’s hard to see it as anything but that. </p>
<p>Life can, and will, return to normal. But it will take a little work.</p>

        <p>Hey, do any of you guys work full time? Any of you pro life? Send your kids to school? You believe in unfettered capitalism? Do you refrain from certain activities because of your religion? If you answered yes to any of these, I've got some bad news for you regarding this idea of "muh life experience!" You don't actually want to understand anything, just have a whole bunch of internet strangers tell you being selfish is ok cause you only live once and its all about you, baby. I want to understand why more of you just can't come out and say, loud and proud, "I do not give a fuck about anyone else but me." Stop trying to convince others and yourself that there is some noble love of freedom and life behind your actions.</p>
