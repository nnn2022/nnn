    <strong>Apparently, gays seem to think that Fauci cured AIDS instead of inventing it.</strong>
    <p><p>They seem to think that Fauci somehow helped make those AIDS cocktails and prophylactics, and not one of them seems to suspect that he and Dr. Gallo and others were the ones who invented it.</p>
<p>I was talking to my mom about the Fauci emails and she said that Fauci saved her brother's (my uncle's) life, since he's gay and he caught AIDS decades back. She thought that I would be sympathetic since I'm gay, too (but no AIDS for me) but ... I made the mistake of being honest with her about how Lord Fauci may have caused AIDS and now she's mad at me. But I know many gays who also think the same thing. If I disagree, they banish me or something.</p></p>

        <p>Fauci didn't invent aids. All he invented was the scare tactic that you could catch it off a toilet seat. So he definitely contributed to the panic and stigma.</p>

        <p>What Fauci did, was push drugs that killed AIDS patients much sooner than the virus would have. He told the world that you could catch AIDS from household contacts. He has always been an ignorant death dealer. This man has never been good at his job.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I'm old enough to remember the fear over it that lingered for YEARS all because this toad spouted the same lies and bs. </p>
<p>I mean into the early 90s some people still thought you could get it from sharing pools, toilets and things like combs. Once the fear spread, it took over a decade for everyone to finally calm the hell down about it and realize it was all lies. And at the center of all those lies was Fauci. The little toad fuck. I remember my grandmother freaking out because my mom was going to go to the funeral of some friend of hers that died of AIDS. I distinctly remember that because even as a kid I didn't understand how a dead body in a casket could spread something. I was a kid and I knew that sounded like bs. But my grandmother was all bent out of shape because the people on tv a decade ago told her to be afraid of this. And that was it. It's very difficult to un-scare morons once you've scared them.</p>

        <p>He didn't cause it, but he did basically practice for his covid-crap (it was pre-email though). Pushed masks, gloves, treating AIDs patients like lepers...his usual trope. Also practiced some SUPER shady publishing. He was despised by the gay community for most of the crisis until eventually the NIH allowed experimental treatments....for a disease that was 100 percent fatal. "And the Band Played On" is a very good book if you are interested in the full story</p>
