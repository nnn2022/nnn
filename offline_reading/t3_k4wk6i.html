    <strong>Does anybody have articles from the WHO advising for extreme lockdowns in the beginning of the pandemic? They are taken down</strong>
    <p><p>In the beggining of the pandemic all the world was flooded by media announcing the need for lockdowns, #stayhome ads everywhere... I remember reading a lot of articles from many important media outlets, and organizations like the WHO or the World Economic Forum suggesting the extreme need for lockdowns to "flatten the curve"</p>
<p>and out of the sudden, I can't find those articles.</p>
<p>I can just find these: <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/why-lockdowns-work-epidemics-coronavirus-covid19/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/why-lockdowns-work-epidemics-coronavirus-covid19/</a></p>

<p>do you know any more?</p></p>

        <p>I think some were in the form of memos of how "amazing" and essential China's lockdown supposedly was. I can't put my finger on them right now.</p>

        <p>I listened to the WHO press briefings every day for the first several months of the pandemic and I never recalled them calling for more lockdowns. </p>
<p>They just never explicitly came out against them. </p>
<p>And all their literature before the covid pandemic is explicitly against strict lockdowns even during “extraordinarily severe” pandemics (like spanish flu). The only thing they said might be considered is banning large gatherings and temporary school closures for up to 4-6 weeks.</p>
