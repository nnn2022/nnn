    <strong>I'm tired of people "thanking" the youth for their "sacrifice"</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen a number of posts and articles about how much young people have lost this year. Incredibly crucial years of their lives, potentially life long relationships or connections, worse education, worse career prospects, a ruined world to recover. And it usually ends with going "so resilient, we thank you for your sacrifice" or some bullshit.</p>
<p>NO. This is NOT a sacrifice. A sacrifice implies choice. The youth was thrown under the bus. You don't mug someone and shoot them in the foot before running away whilst screaming "thank you so much for your donation, too kind of you".</p></p>

        <p>Yes! I missed my high school graduation, not because of "sacrifice." It wasn't a choice. If it was, I wouldn't have spent the last few months of high school crying my eyes out.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear that. They stole so much from us. The only thing we can do is to not forget because I am certain that the future will vindicate us. In 10 years everyone who supported lockdowns will be ashamed of themselves, and rightly so</p>

        <p>Admittedly, I don't know you at all, so in a real sense - yeah, it doesn't matter to me directly whether you're homeless or a billionaire, whether you jump off a bridge or get married and have 10 kids. I don't know you so I would never know.</p>
<p>But you do have a mother who knows you. She loves you, and you are her entire world. I am speaking for myself, but sometimes I want to strangle my toddlers, sometimes I wonder why I became a mom at all - but even at the worst times (and certainly most of the time) they are just shining lights. They changed my life. They are beautiful and perfect to me, and I see them as they are but I see them as their best selves. They give me joy just sitting on the couch drinking chocolate milk and laughing at Winnie the Pooh. Please don't discount how much you matter and how much you are loved by the real people in your life (the opinions of Internet strangers like me really don't matter).</p>

<p>She's only happy that I provide free IT tech support, and being a financially and emotional rock.</p>
<p>I've been a caregiver for 5 years and its crippled me permanmently. You don't know what its like.</p>

<p>Not a single person in real life reached out to me to see if I was OK for almost an entire year during these lockdowns. Theyre would only be loving when I'm dead.</p>

        <p>It’s not a snitch line, I used to work for them I can assure you they don’t have access to your location. The pro lockdown point you might be right about. But they are respectful of your feelings you could always try calling.</p>

<p>Same. I just try to keep on living. Going outside, taking my dog for a walk, buy some flowers just to smell them, make fucking snowangels like I'm a toddler. But hey at least it helps somewhat. I don't have a tv, I try not to hear any type of news, ignore all the muzzles I see, don't get involved in any conversation that's about covid, masks, lockdown etc. If I can I literally just walk away, pretend to answer my phone or whatever. I'm sick of it. I pretend to have a somewhat normal life still, even though I know damn well I'm just pretending. But hey, fake it till you make it, something like that? And the future? I don't think we will ever go back to normal, but I could be wrong, I don't know and I try not to care. I live now, not tomorrow or next year. New day, new worries. Todays worries are for today, fuck the future.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry to hear that. It’s ridiculous. I was six months into hs when the lockdowns started and now I graduate next year and people are already saying we probably won’t have a grad. Graduations are so important but the government doesn’t care. I hope you get a redo or something but either way that’s unfair.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry. I'm still pretty young, but I can't imagine being a child during this. They deserve better. My dad is kind of against this, although not all the way. He kind of agrees with most of the measures but still doesn't think they should be forced. He wouldn't wear a muzzle all the time if he wasn't afraid of trouble. I told him to stand up against it, but he just says he's "too old" to fight. But that's another reason why I fight. I wouldn't care about my age, I would want all people to be free from this, and I would fight for the freedom of my children's future.</p>

        <p>It's why I don't wear one. I hope things go back to normal for my kids -- but, at the very least, I want them to know that there are worse things in life than being different and saying "no." They need to do what is right, not comply because it's easy. I want them to have that sense of freedom.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. I know plenty of peers to me (20-25) that grew up in lockdown conditions before this and the prognosis is HORRIBLE. They are absolutely mentally crippled from it. They would have been fine if they had been allowed normal childhoods but as it is they will never be able to live alone. I am the best case I've ever seen come from years of isolation and I am fucked up. I'm just capable of living alone and dealing with an office job.</p>
<p>We're about to see an entire generation of those people. What is going to happen to all of these half-adults? Certainly not widespread societal support, more like the individualized blame that America has always loved. If I was a parent I would be doing anything possible to reject all restrictions as much as possible and hide this from them.</p>

        <p>Last spring I was told I can just sacrifice 2 months of my life. Ignoring that it's been way longer than two months, sacrifices are voluntary. This has all been forced on us. Even if given a choice, I wouldn't give up two months for this shit.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone would. I think there would be less people supporting the lockdowns if they knew from the start that it would be like this, and for this duration no less. If you told people from the beginning that face diapers would be enforced all over the world, people would be like "Excuse me? You expect me to WHAT?"</p>

I went out to the beach last weekend with wife and she forgot her mask.  The whole time she was complaining that she felt people were giving her the stink eye.  Told her to just stay 6 feet away and to fuck them.  I lead by example everyday by walking outside without a mask is a super liberal brainwashed city.  I love it and have only had 1 Karen ever say anything in the last year. I give secret nods and smiles  to the few who do the same...</p>

        <p>I'd sacrifice the first 2 months if it meant the hospitals didn't get overwhelmed AND the government (in my case the Netherlands but it's the same everywhere else) actually tried to increase hospital capacity so we don't have to destroy peoples lives. Instead the government kept shifting the goalposts every lockdown and didn't do shit to help the hospitals out.</p>

        <p>Two years ago, I had an emergency surgery that went badly and left me with a huge open abdominal wound. I was told I had to wait a year until it was safe to have reconstructive surgery and literally put my guts back inside me. That year was absolute hell for me and the only thing getting me through was knowing I'd have my life back after surgery. Cuz I couldn't go anywhere or do anything with a disgusting, leaking, painful wound. Nightly nutrition infusions two, through an IV.</p>
<p>I finally had the surgery and was done with all that shit. Then lockdowns began almost immediately after. I can't even put into words how fucking angry and hopeless I feel. Why am I not allowed to have a life? Am I just done? I'm never going back to the person I was two years ago.</p>

        <p>Yeah they can go fuck themselves. I'm missing out on 1+ years of my 20s, where most people make significant relationships that last their lifetime (spouse and friends), have lost friends, become more depressed and unsure of my future career, and developed more cynical views. All of this is to possibly help keep old people alive for more of their twilight years. Once we saw that the risk wasn't young and healthy people, but old people or those with pre-existing conditions it should have been announced and then people quarantine or don't based on their personal needs/preferences. </p>
<p>I even had Covid and my only symptom was loss of taste/smell, so I went on a diet (might as well eat extra healthy since I can't taste the raw broccoli and tuna), and lost weight. Lasted 4 days because I'm young and healthy. If you're scared stay home. If you're sick stay home (just like a cold or the flu). If you are neither, then your life shouldn't be taken from you.</p>

        <p>The number of suicides the lockdowns have caused probably rival the Covid numbers. The difference is Covid deaths are among the old and I would venture to say the suicides are among the young.</p>

        <p>Speaking of suicides, a guy last June living at home committed suicide because he thought he owed 700k to robinhood for bad options plays. Since the parents just recently sued, the media reported like it had to do with the GME stock. And the parents are, unfortunately, suing because of the opportunity due to GME and robinhood. (quite obvious their lawyers said it was a good time to)</p>
<p>But the reality is that this 20 year old kid was stuck at home spending money he didn't have on robinhood and obviously needed both financial and mental help because of the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>My children have been cut off for a year from all the things they love. Soccer, D&amp;D gatherings, Magic the Gathering meetups, theater, kendo, etc.</p>
<p>Anyone who supports this nonsense is dead to me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this madness is so widespread it leaves me with few friends and detached from most of my extended family so... I guess I'm playing into their goal of division.</p>
<p>But this theft of life is such an affront to me -- I just can't see past it. I know we're not allowed to make references to pre-war Germany, but literal "Government Quarantine Facilities" are starting to happen around the planet and everyone thinks it's a good thing.</p>
<p>These people have supported a lockdown that has plugined millions of people into poverty. I've driven cross-country 5 times since the lockdown started and every time the tent-cities grow in size.</p>
<p>I just can't see eye to eye with these people. They have crossed a line in the sand that is too far. Taking our lives away while calling us selfish if we don't go along with their plan.</p>

        <p>Sociologists are warning of this but listening to only epidemiologists seems to be the current trend.</p>
<p>Throughout history, everytime a generations childhood is destroyed said generation is developmentally behind and social norms cease to exist.</p>
<p>With the lockdowns on children we have taken away their education and social interactions in the name of a condition that mostly affects the 80+ crowd. Health professionals have known from the beginning of clown world that Covid doesn't affect kids like adults yet they have been the most punished. We shut down schools and everything that is great about being a kid because people were getting Covid in nursing homes, hence my referral to clown world.</p>

        <p>They only say that because verbalizing it allows them to justify ruining kids' lives without guilt. "Oh kids are so resilient, it's okay", "We all make sacrifices, thanks kids for doing your part", it all just makes them feel better about themselves and allowing fear to run their lives if they phrase it in a way that young people are voluntarily giving things up.</p>

I cannot possibly fathom what it's like for a kid missing once-in-a-lifetime milestones: graduations, proms, even a single year of college is 25% of "the best years of your life". I would have been absolutely inconsolable if I had to even miss one year of going to grade school, let alone one of those big events. Aside from small business owners, young people (and not the obnoxious 18-year-olds yelping about how important it is to bE sAfE, but the ones who are upset about missing out) are one of the few groups I actually still have empathy for these days.</p>

        <p>Agreed! Never in my life have I been so angry as tre moment some idiot claimed my daughter and her teammates were putting others at risk by practice their inherently socially-distanced outdoor sport last summer. These kids aren’t supposed to give up everything! They only have one chance at their childhood/teen/young adult years.</p>

        <p>Given that those men and women and uniform are the ones enforcing this bullshit (atleast in my country) then I would not call them heroes. I would call them tyrants.</p>

        <p>It's the same logic used on mothers under patriarchy: you're put on a pedestal, worshipped and praised in the most flowery language possible, until you start standing up for yourself and demanding rights and fair treatment, then you're an evil bitch.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, lockdowns are destroying many working mothers' careers because of the difficulty of raising a kid under these traumatizing conditions along with the unwillingness of many men to step up and be dads to the same degree that their wives are being moms...it's almost like these "progressive" politicians keeping schools etc closed are not so fucking feminist after all...</p>

        <p>I really feel like in some countries, like the UK, it will take mass protests and violence to get the restrictions lifted. The youth are part of the problem because they just laid down and took it up the arse. No resistance whatsoever. Here in the U.S., more and more Covid restrictions are getting lifted. Why? Because the BLM riots and the attack on the U.S. Capital showed that Americans are becoming increasingly violent and will NOT tolerate continued lock downs.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%, I didn't sacrifice my future, they murdered it. 
It's the same as when they blame the virus for anything instead of the lockdowns and nonsensical restrictive measures. Covid didn't close businesses, lockdowns did.</p>

        <p>The only rational response is egocentrism. The society clearly could care less about the youth so they must turn their back in response. Do not serve. Do not vote for increasing collectivist politics. Do not stop for one second to serve anybody but your self and kin.....</p>

        <p>Hey at least you get a thank you. In America, our leaders and media just browbeat us constantly about how “we” aren’t doing enough. I’m 26, I’ve put my entire life on hold, lost so much, done everything that was asked of me and all I get is lectures and condescension about how “we” aren’t doing this or that. I can only control myself.</p>

        <p>To be fair, many are voluntarily doing it and even driving it.  Others are just doing it because they are forced.  It's a mixed bag.  Either way, the 'carrot' is part of how they train people.  And I really do have a great deal of sympathy for what many youth are going through right now.  Them especially since these are special formative years for many of them that can't be got back.  Also since they are younger with less life experience, it's going to be harder for them to process this and have perspective on it.</p>

<p>Every generation faces challenges. Most recently it was millennials and getting thrown into a 2008 economy just out of college with useless degrees subsidized by the government. </p>
<p>Now I just lost my whole junior year. The only time I actually see people is work and church. </p>
<p>It’s not a sacrifice. It’s a theft.</p>

        <p>Yesterday i saw a heartbreaking story of a 43 year old woman who couldn't get her cancer diagnosed on time,unfortunately she's doomed and will die. Doctors are giving her 6 months. She's only 43 year old ! </p>
<p>All that because hospitals (governement) decided that cancer screening/biopsy and treatments were not essential. Instead they only treat covid (they don't test for influenza which explain why there's 0 case since last year).</p>
<p>Will the elderly and children and grand children of all the 90+ year old will thank this young woman and her children for their sacrifice ?</p>
<p>FFS in an ideal world we would love to save everybody,people around you love you even tho you're 108 year old but i think that if a situation is that catastrophic it is clear that the priority is to save those who will keep the whole society running. I know it sounds harsh but that's life.</p>
<p>The worst part ? Hospitals aren't any more full than any other year....In 2015 we had 6900 deaths from the flu in a single month and we didn't go through lockdowns,curfews,shutting down the economy,made mask mandatory,closed schools,stop giving life saving treatments,nope,nothing ! So what's really going on ?</p>

        <p>&rt; NO. This is NOT a sacrifice. A sacrifice implies choice. The youth was thrown under the bus. You don't mug someone and shoot them in the foot before running away whilst screaming "thank you so much for your donation, too kind of you".</p>
<p>The other problem with thanking the youth for their "sacrifice" is that those doing the thanking think this is <em>all</em> that they will have to "sacrifice".  Just 1-2 years.  Just having to wear masks.  Just no team sports or in-person class or at-school socializing, for 1-2 years.  They're myopically ignoring the economic fallout this will have on these kids, for up to a decade to come.  (I say decade because that is the average time it takes for someone graduating into a recession to economically catch up to everyone else who didn't graduate at the wrong time.)</p>

        <p>The sickening part is how much they've been led like sheep into blindly following.  The young impressionable crowd are the most staunch, hateful doomers that want to lock up anybody acting normal into cages.  </p>
<p>The reality is that they should be the ones refusing to follow the shutdowns, and living their lives like normal by sneaking out, having MASSIVE parties, etc.  Yet they seem to be the most deluded and snubbing their noses at those who acknowledge the net harm caused by the suspension of freedom.</p>

<p>"People online (if they are even single, as a LOT are using it for attention/to have affairs) are not going to actually meet anyone because of the pandemic, and you know people aren't the same on zoom as they are in real life."</p>
