    <strong>STOP PRESSURING ME TO TAKE THE VACCINE</strong>
    <p><p>Fuck off. Fuck the fuck off. My medical information is none of your damn business. </p>
<p>Most of my family is pressuring me to take the vax. Saying I won’t be allowed to come over and visit if I don’t have it. I’ve asked them “will the vax protect me from covid” and they respond yes.... so why does it matter if I’m protected from covid, that’s MY risk to take, NOT YOURS. If they are so convinced it works then why do they care if I have it or not?! I’m not taking it.</p>
<p>Stop calling me an anti vaxer too. I’m not anti vax, I’m anti-vaccines developed in a few months that haven’t been tested long term, that are less effective than my immune system for a virus with over a 99% survival rate. I HAVE other vaccines that have been tested long term and prove to be safe. NOT ANTI-VACCINE. ANTI-EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS. </p>
<p>I’m so sick of this. I don’t give a fuck if you get the vaccine. Do whatever the fuck you want to your body. But don't tell me what to do with mine. I smoke a ton of weed and think it’s great but you don't see me running around trying to stick joints in other peoples mouths. I don't give a fuck if you smoke weed or what crazy shit YOU inject in your body. DONT FUCKING TELL ME WHAT TO PUT IN MINE. </p>
<p>MY FUCKING BODY MY FUCKING CHOICE. NOT YOURS. NOT THE GOVERNMENTS. MY FUCKING CHOICE. MINE!!!!!! </p>
<p>Did see a post on this sub that I liked. Now when I'm asked if I have the vax my answer is "do you do anal sex?"  And they are always puzzled by this response. I say "oh I thought we were talking about things that are none of each other's damn business". Thanks to whoever posted that. </p>
<p>Just really fed up with all the brainwashed sheep out there that can't fucking think for themselves. Clearly they just sit in front of the tv the whole day believing all fear mongering lies and don't have the capability to think for themselves. Sorry for the profanity too, I was pushed to my breaking point today and needed to rant and thought this was a good place.</p></p>

        <p>It is sad, but remember, this group of like-minded folks alone numbers over 70,000. And this is just one group out of thousands of other groups. And websites, and organizations. More and more people are waking up every day, all around the world. I attended an anti-lockdown protest a few weeks ago and I’m pretty sure there were near 50,000 people that came out! Get out to one of them if you can, you’ll feel better, guaranteed. You are not alone!</p>

        <p>I’m in Ontario, Canada and we’re basically a dictatorship at this point so have been regularly attending the anti-lockdown protests. Missed the last two weeks due to work though. But it does feel nice to be around people who think like me- not even think like me, just people who THINK.</p>

        <p>At this point, any shred of faith I had remaining in the political system here has been destroyed. I'm not even going to bother voting anymore. There's no fucking point when every party is basically the same at their cores.  </p>

        <p>Yeah that’s true. Toronto basically decides all federal elections and they go red every fucking time. I’m getting out of here, there’s no hope. Going to finish up school and then head to Texas once I have some money saved up. Sad to see this country I was born and raised in go to absolute shit, but I won’t be sticking around to pay the prices of our degenerate politicians. Wasn’t the biggest Harper fan, but seems like everything hit the fan when he lost. Spending and debt is out of control... especially in Ontario, we have the highest sun-national debt IN THE WORLD. It’s like twice as high as California (per capita obviously), how embarrassing. </p>
<p>Liberals racked up our spending here so I voted for Doug Ford (you know, because he’s a Conservative and their job is to clean up the liberal mess) but he’s somehow managed to make our situation way fucking worse. Ridiculous. </p>
<p>By the way, if you didn’t know, Doug Ford net worth December 2019; 3 million. Doug Ford net worth as of last month; over 50 million. Our politicians are all fucking crooks that should be in jail.</p>
<p>I used to genuinely think this was the best country in the world, now I hate everything about it. Sad to say.</p>

        <p>I hear you - Ontarian here.
Ford seemed ok at first, but then it's like a puppeteer came and took his body over. He looks scared shitless on tv. Who has him by the balls - did he visit Epstein island? Was his family threatened? 
I'm voting PPC when the time comes if I'm not dead or in jail by then. Lol  the big 3 parties are basically homogenous now. A bunch of freedom hating traitorous bastards, only sparring with each other enough to keep up the charade.
Ontario's disproportionate influence on the rest of Canada is a load of bollocks. No reason to fix that as long as the big turd benefits from it.</p>

        <p>The Conservatives that were kicked out of caucus started a new party called the New Blue Party of Ontario. Barbara Karahalios was solely fending off the new legislation that Ford was trying to pass last week to extend his emergency powers until December. These are the only people fighting lockdowns, etc,. and are will to pay the price for it - they are protesting at rallies and getting fines, etc.</p>

<p>Federally, Maxime Bernier is fighting all of this, as well. There is a freedom caucus of about 5 politicians, I think. Anyway, Bernier is Libertarian.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’ve heard of the new blues... I’m hoping they’ll have candidates in my area. Seem like the party for me; classic liberalism, economic freedom, and obviously anti lockdown. </p>
<p>Love Max. He seems to be the only federal politician with a brain. I voted PPC last election since they’re the only party not so far gone into corruption and they will actually get this country back on its feet. Too bad most people are too stupid to understand reality and continue to vote Liberal and Conservative...</p>

        <p>I'm surprised at how many people still don't know Max exists. It really shows the national media has too much power.</p>
<p>I refuse to concede to people that tell me not to split the vote by voting PPC. There is literally no point to voting for any major party, they're all basically the same.</p>

        <p>Yup. Need to get rid of <strong>most</strong> of our government and get them out of the economy. Only keep them for services like policing, military and the courts. Get rid of public funding, get rid of our single payer healthcare system, get rid of everything they’re involved in lol.

        <p>There is a complacency among Canadians. They seem to prefer to be taken care of. I waver every day between fighting it or just leaving Canada permanently. In the meantime, I am trying to be bold and do things that can help - Calling my MPP, donating to constitutional organizations like The Justice Centre, raising awareness of Maxime Bernier and the New Blue Ontario party in social media and in real life, etc.</p>

        <p>Good for you, I try to do as much as I can too. Don’t really have much money since I’m a student in debt, but I go to the protests, raise awareness about why tyrannical government is bad (ridiculous that we even have to do that...), and calling MPPs/MPs. But I see this country collapsing soon. Like you said, people want to be taken care of, and as you already know, that isn’t realistic. The rich people either hide their money or are moving away because our debt is insane, and they don’t want to stick around and pay 50% income tax, or whatever it is. When a country loses all its productive members of society and are left with the ones that want to sit there and complain and not work... bad things happen.</p>

        <p>I had my own business in Ontario for 10 years, until 2015. Before that, I grew up in a family business that was started in the 1960s. It has gotten more and more difficult every year. I love being my own boss and taking the risk, but the burden put on small businesses by all levels of government was too much, and add the rising wages, taxes, etc. and it was such a headache that I ended up selling it. </p>
<p>My real goal is to buy an existing business in Florida or another southern state, possibly even Texas, and run it down there. I have family in Florida so it would already feel like home. The tax advantages are great there, and the cost of living is a lot lower compared to where I live now. </p>
<p>I don't think we're alone in thinking this way, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s sad that you ended up having to sell. But I think that’s the reality for a lot of people. Minimum wage increases have been killing off small business in my town... low cost of living and they simply can’t afford to pay their workers $15 an hour. Too many restrictions and taxes on top of that. Shouldn’t be this hard to start/run a business in a country like Canada...</p>
<p>That’s similar to my goal. I’m not sure if I would want to start my own or buy an existing one... would be a lot easier to start one down there though. No bullshit from the government. </p>

        <p>Yep, I just mock them. “Yes, I took all three just to be safe” “ I only feel safe taking the Sputnik v vaccine” </p>
<p>What usually makes them leave me alone for good is saying “ I’m just ready to get my third dose” when they ask about #3 I start redpilling them about the ‘booster’ shots. Most of the sheeple haven’t been exposed to that particular part of the propaganda yet and are mortified because shot #2 really sucked for most, they don’t even want to contemplate what shot 3,4,5 or 6 will be like!</p>

        <p>It’s quite effective, guys at work don’t discuss the jab with me ( or even around me ) because I bring up the boosters. If they get bold I start talking about the ‘variants’ and how they’re prolly gonna need a whole new set of jabs for those!</p>

        <p>I feel you. This new gene therapy jab is not a “vaccine” and sets a whole new precedent for our society as a whole. This is a world-changing event equal to the likes of 9/11 in that our society will never be the same. Gene therapy, up until now, has been extremely controversial. Scientists have been arrested for using it on unwilling participants. It’s implications are endless and they are forcing it down our throats, with millions of people begging for it! If you told me 2 years ago that I would be pressured to engage in GENETIC alterations, I would not believe you.</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with my sister who is pressuring me AGAIN to get it, even though I told her I don’t want it. I don’t care that millions have taken it and are “fine”, because there are so many people who are not! You just don’t see it on CNN and mainstream media. </p>
<p>I am not an unintelligent hick who only listens to Alex Jones. Lol, I want science and data! There is no science or data for a jab that did a study for a few months and then made all the control studies come get the jab because it would be “cruel” to not let them get it. That is NOT science.</p>

        <p>When they say you can't come over, you should reply with "Is that a promise?"</p>
<p>And then see how long it takes them to invite you over anyways.  But I would recommend that you stick to your guns and tell them no... because you're not vaccinated.  Fuck the risk with any potential shedding.  They may be more dangerous to you then you are to them.</p>

        <p>They may be more dangerous to me then I am to them... agreed. They are trying to force me to take an experimental drug we know nothing about! At worst I would give them covid-19(84), and they would have to toughen out a fever for a day! But if the vaccine works then why are they scared of me???</p>

        <p>Now that studies have proven that the spike protein alone is capable of causing cellular disruption and can also cross the blood brain barrier, ask them what makes them so sure it's such a good idea to inject our bodies with something that teaches our cells to produce those same spike proteins?</p>

        <p>Just because something FEELS a certain way, doesn't mean it is that way. Which ironically is also an argument against most religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Also not everyone cares about Fauci. I'm not an American and I've never heard anyone even speak about him, outside an American bubble. I was also unaware that anti-science and anti-fact was so prominent. Makes me concerned about what they're teaching you at your schools over there.</p>

        <p>They're teaching things like CRT, anti-racism against Blacks and Asian American and Pacific Islanders, and backpedaling on all the surveillance measures in a bid to "encourage" the community to take unapproved vaccines because "they will be mandated ONCE approved" -- all this because our state is rushing to open for a governor who wants to open in order to win back favor from the public before the people recall him for his draconian measures. I heard two locals I know discussing their vaccination dates in the same reverence that I've heard for salvation dates from religious folk. The science around vaccines is a religion where I live, but I am in one of THE most liberal areas of the US, so I'm not surprised. </p>
<p>And don't pretend like education around the world hasn't been fucked this entire last year. I'm hoping kids learned ANYTHING at all in this remote education circus.</p>

        <p>Thankfully people like you existed back when vaccines were rolled for rubella, smallpox, measles, mumps etc etc....you're gonna be on the wrong side of history dude. Not sure why you're looking down on people excited to get vaccinated immunity from a pandemic inducing virus. </p>
<p>Look I'm not gonna change you're mind, you're clearly programmed to be anti-science which is honestly bizarre considering how incredible modern medicine truly is. If you wanna get religious on it then how's this: God gave us the vaccine. He gave us this incredible feat of science, so be grateful.</p>

        <p>Just turn the anger into laughter, honestly their positions make no sense and with humour it can easily be pointed out given exactly what you said: if the vaccines do indeed protect from covid then if they are vaccinated then they should have nothing to worry about </p>
<p>Try to take the approach of Bill Burr on this one rather than Alex Jones</p>
<p>You can’t redpill anyone and the harder you try you will just push people away. Instead you have to ask them the right questions and let them arrive at the conclusion for themselves. </p>
<p>I don’t think the vast majority of the population are so stupid but they can be put under a trance by relentless propaganda intended to do just that. It’s the same as an abused partner finally realising their relationship was abusive and they snap out of it but the abusive relationship all these people are in is with the government</p>

        <p>For women, you can also ask "have you ever had an abortion?" If she's not too offeded to answer, and says yes, you can say: "that's great! I'm pro choice, too."</p>
<p>Also, its time to start taking back the narrative. You're not an "antivaxxer" or "hesitant," you're "pro freedom" and "pro choice." </p>
<p>If called "antivaxxer," you have this defense: "Being a supporter of inalienable human rights and proponent for personal freedoms means I support vaccine technology, but that I also acknowledge everyone's right to make decisions about their own bodies and health needs. These are not mutually exclusive ideas."</p>

        <p>Regardless, there are at least thousands of dead people who could be alive right now if it weren't for selfishness and misinformation surrounding vaccines.</p>
<p>How could you possibly argue that it's "only your risk" when it's a communicable disease that spreads by jumping from one person to another person?</p>
<p>When you let yourself be the stepping stone, of course you are putting other people at risk. That's just common sense.</p>

        <p>Survival rate is more like 98%, but even at 99%, that’s still hundreds of thousands of (potentially preventable) deaths. 81 is just an average, plenty of younger ppl have died from COVID. Vaccine still received plenty of safety tests. </p>
<p>You’re free to make your own, uninformed decisions yes. But you’re decisions affect more than just yourself. You’d think a sub called “No New Normal” would do what it took to go back to the old normal, but I guess putting a piece of cloth over your face and getting the jab is asking too much</p>

        <p>81 is a pretty high average...  also doesn’t matter how many “safety” tests the vaccines have undergone, they aren’t done by independents. Big corps hiring other big corps to “test” their products. There is absolutely zero way of telling any long term impacts. Zero. It’s like when the Tesla first came out, people were hesitant to buy it because we had no clue how long the battery would last. That’s only something time will tell, same with the vaccine.</p>

        <p>mRNA is inherently short lived. It does not last long once inside the body, which means any side effects are short term. It basically tells the body to do x and is done. X in this case being to create antibodies. Which is a natural function of our body anyways. So I don’t buy it lol. It’s fine to be careful about it, not fine to put other people at risk because of it</p>

You are just petulant, selfish children who can’t be bothered to put the smallest effort in to helping others. You pretend it’s some issue about “muh freedom” or try and use some pseudoscientific bs to act like there’s another reason why you won’t wear masks/ get the vaccine, but in reality it’s just you can’t see past your own tiny little world and refuse act like responsible members of society so you can be slightly more comfortable.

<p>I put lots of effort into helping those people that I know and care about.  I have zero obligations for people I don’t know and, though you’ll never admit it, you operate largely the same way.  There are tons of people out there suffering in one way or another.  Do you help every single homeless person you ever meet?  Provide temporary shelter for battered women?  Help the starving kids in Africa?   No?</p>
<p>You could be helping them more, but you don’t.  Why?  Because you don’t care about them.  You don’t wish evil upon them, certainly - but they’re just not on your radar to give a shit about.  They’re out of sight and out of mind.  </p>
<p>And that’s ok.  But be rational enough to admit it, bruh.  Right now you’re just being a hypocrite.</p>

        <p>Sure. I’m not about to house a stranger or fly off to Africa to save the children. I get your point. But that’s not what’s being asked of you. You’re not being asked to put your life on hold for other people. Putting a mask on and getting the shot is a tiny, tiny inconvenience. If you need a purely selfish reason to give af, then get the shot cuz it will get us back to “normal” faster. If you don’t want the “new normal” then do what it takes to get your life back to how it was before rona. Bruh.</p>

        <p>You’ve decided that masks and vaccines are “tiny, tiny inconveniences”. </p>
<p>I’ve decided that donating $50/month to the Red Cross is incredibly easy and convenient.  So why are you being so selfish by not doing it?!?!??</p>

        <p>&rt; that’s costs $50 a month I don’t have</p>
<p>I've decided you do have it and could make different life choices to free up the money to be able to care for others.  Again, why are you so selfish?</p>
<p>&rt; What does putting a piece of cloth <em>that doesn't actually do anything to prevent the spread of covid</em> on your face and getting an <em>experimental</em> shot <em>for which there are no studies of the possible long term side effects</em> cost you?</p>

        <p>That doesn’t even make sense. Why in tf would I put an experimental drug in MY body??? Do you realize how brainwashed you have to be to overlook the facts of this pandemic. There is absolutely zero way of telling the long term effects of this drug, ZERO. We have no idea. Why would I even consider putting that in my body?????? The government is NOT your friend... why do you trust them so much? You ever heard of world war 2? Government has killed close to a billion people over the last 100 years. THEY ARE THE ENEMY but too many people are so far brainwashed into trusting them that they won’t see past it. Think for yourself.</p>
