    <strong>Poovid19 Why Cuz</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccines don't prevent you from getting infected. Its nothing like force field shields up and nothing can get through. (It's not like polio or Chicken pox)</p>
<p>Vaccine doesnt prevent you from spreading the virus . (Too many cases of reinfection and being positive after vaccination)</p>
<p>Vaccines doesn't prevent you from getting sick. It only prevents you from not being severely sick and end up in ICU. (So you still get sick and require medicines, The Cure)</p>
<p>Some claim it will prevent this floo from running  through the population and prevent it from mutating. Well if that was the case Pfizer and Astra wouldn't be drooling over the prospect of yearly vaccination and boosters, for new strains and mutants.</p>
<p>What happens when you take the vaccine and end up being positive for this poovid19 flu? Go to the doc? And what medications are you prescribed? Paracetamol LOL, Vitamin C, Vitamin D and Ivermectin</p>
<p>If vaccines create bodies that bind with the spike protein of this Floo, and this is not the first Poorona Virus(as there are others that cause common cold, there was Sars Cov from 2002 for which Pfizer has a tablet), there is influenza that has spikes and same symtpoms. Don't we just need anti viral medicine, which surely the doctors have after dealing with so many kinds of viral types.(Like broad spectrum anti viral remdesivir, Glaidesivir, NHC Prodrug IEDD 2801)
. So cure exists, they just don't want people to be free of the fear. </p>
<p>Most importantly, if you are afraid of dying in a gun fight, you should be the one wearing the bullet proof jacket. Not the person holding the gun. Likewise, if you are afraid of dying from Poovid19, you should be one getting vaccinated and living in a hazmat suit.  Not me. If you think double masking prevent Poovid from getting in you, I dare you to sit in front of an exhaust and ask your buddy to rev the engine. Let's see how many particles it filters out.</p>
<p>How is it possible, that a new mutation of a virus that has existed and been tested on since 2000, doesn't have an anti viral drug/medicine/cure. It's 80% the same as previous ones. It has same structure as Influenza A and some additional upgrades, thanx to Faucci, NIH and WVI, but even those parts are from the viruses that have a cure.</p>
<p>If it was something we would have never been through before, every single person that was exposed to it would have died by now. No one would even have natural immunity to it ( just because you are weak one, doesn't mean people don't have natural immunity to it, many do, means human body does have capacity to deal with it (immune memory))</p>
<p>Out of 7 billion people, there were 137 million cases and 2.9M have died while they were corona positive. Not dead due to corona, but were positive at the time of the death, so we still don't know how many have truly died from Poovid.</p>
<p>And at last, 
If you don't feel safe amongst us, you can move to epestines island.</p></p>
