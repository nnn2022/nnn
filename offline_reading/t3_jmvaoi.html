<p>They had chips in passports for more than 15 years, yet I still have to enter my first and last name into some stupid computer for about 5 times every time I fly, instead of just tapping my passport.</p>
<p>When technology meets bureaucracy, it becomes a lot more like a bureacracy, and less like technology.</p>

        <p>A chip inside your body is different than a chip in a passport.</p>
<p>It is not stupid. It is stupid to believe that after the last 8 months of madness, you can trust the idiots in charge to do anything in our best interest.</p>

        <p>More complex for sure. Chip in a passport is easier to troubleshoot and replace.</p>
<p>Also, is presented that Bill Gates giving us the inconvenience before convenience. Facebook was a convenient way to communicate BEFORE it became an inconvenient breach of privacy. If the chip comes, it should come with convenience. Never carry id, pay contactless, no identity theft worries ever again, no tickets needed to fly, etc etc etc. All of the above is very much possible with today's technology and will be welcomed by people. Yet, it is not yet done, because money, bureaucracy, regulations and overall sluggish pace of digital revolution.</p>
<p>From what the conspiracists are telling us, the chip will come with all the cons with none of the pros. You will need a surgery to install it, and it will control you, and ti will not do anything good for you. Who would sign up for that? No one. It's a stereotypical picture of a villan who does mean things just because he's evil. This is not reality.</p>
<p>The chip, if it comes, will be very useful, and will help us to do many things. The ability to control us will be presented as an unintended side effect. However, the infrastructure is not ready for a chip like that. POS terminals, airports, governments, no one is ready. That's how we know it is not really coming in the near future. Maybe in a 100 years. Look how long it took for countries to adapt color pictures in passports. About ... 50 years since color pictures were invented? And still passport includes no video or voice samples, just the facepic. These things are insanely slow to change.</p>

<p>It’s really good timing for both, one is his plan to blanket the earth with satellites for real time video and a chip that monitors everything about you.</p>

        <p>If I try to imagine myself being a programmer behind these chips, I would tell my manager that even though timing seems perfect, we'd need decades to really make it work. </p>
<p>Here's a list of 2 very modest prerequisites: </p>
<p>1) Fully digital IDs that allow you to cross borders. Totally possible today, and doesn't really exist. With today's cryptography and smartphones we don't really need paper documents anymore, yet we rely on them SO MUCH. Digital IDs can later be incorporated into a chip, but first they need to be legislated and built without worrying about chips. </p>
<p>2) Working and tested universal contactless payment system. I still cannot buy many things with Google Pay(that has 2 incompatible competitors), and even those payment systems actually rely on a almost a century-old credit card / traditional banking backend. Also, Bill Gates personally doesn't own any payment system at all, and the chip will have very little appeal if it doesn't allow you to pay for things.  </p>
<p>I'd like to see a smartphone do everything they tell me this chip will do. Before starting implanting these things, maybe let's build a working prototype? If a .25 pound smartphone can't do it, how will a .5 gram chip do all that? If the chip will not do much, who will ever need it and for what?</p>

        <p>They microchip animals. They want to do the same to all humans as well. 666! But I think at this stage it is more about DNA collection. Possibly so they can tailor their chips to individual people. I for one will be staying well away from any evil "medical" person with a needle. (there are good doctors out there, but VERY hard to find)</p>
