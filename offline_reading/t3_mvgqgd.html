    <strong>I Don't Need The Vaccine So I'm Not Getting It, Simple As</strong>
    <p><p>Is that so fucking hard to understand? "B-b-but you'll spread the virus to other people!" Yeah, people like me who don't give a fuck and trust their immune systems, people who have been vaccinated and should therefore have ample protection against the fucking thing, or the very, very small minority of people who are unable to take the vaccine because they were dealt a shit deck of cards in life and are so immunocompromised that they have to roll around in a giant hamster ball outside lest they touch grass and die of an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Herd immunity is achieved through vaccination AND infection. All the people who should have been vaccinated have been at this point or will be very soon (and if not they've made their choice, respect their decision and let them just get on with what's left of their fucking lives). So let me just catch the fucking virus and do my part in defeating this deadliest of scourges.</p>
<p>Sorry to cum in your cornflakes but I will not be getting a Fauci ouchie. You've taken a year of my life already, I'm not giving you the rest of it just so you can feel smug and secure and to be honest I'm refusing out of spite at this point. I will not move another fucking inch on this. This bullshit stopped me from being there when my dog was put down and I have dealt with a torrent of abuse and death threats online for simply speaking out against this fucking shit and casting a spotlight on your woke stupidity. Furthermore, I will not cast aside my personal anxiety and fear about needles just to temporarily satiate yours about a meme virus with a 99+% survival rate.</p>
<p>The fact that I need to defend my own private medical health and personal reasons for not getting prodded in the arm by a nurse whilst she's performing the Macarena for a new Tik-Tok video is reason enough to believe this entire thing is a fucking farce. Feel free to take the vaccines, that's your decision, but how dare you demand anyone else to do the same.   How fucking shameful of you.</p>
<p>Edit: I implore, no, BEG everyone (NNN members, randoms stumbling upon this post who may be sceptical of the vaccine and lurking doomers alike) to read <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this article</a> that was kindly posted by u/DeplorableRorschach in the comments below (thanks very much for that). It is an amazing, detailed and thought-provoking read that completely lays out exactly why you SHOULDN'T get the vaccine. Archive the fuck out of it as there's a chance it could get buried (as we've seen happen before countless times). I really feel like this is an important issue and a lot is at stake here; share this article around to anyone who might be on the fence about getting the vaccine or is browbeating you into it as it might change that person's point of view or at least make them see why you'd be so hesitant to get this fucking thing.</p></p>

        <p>It is literally INSANE how I have to explain why I’m not taking an experimental vaccine as a healthy 25 year old? The gaslighting is abnormal I can’t believe this is what we’ve come to.  Their fear of things never returning to normal is so bad they need the reassurance that everyone’s taking the vaccine. Mind your fucking business I don’t own an explanation to ANYONE. Just because you are a sheep that does everything the governments you to with blind unwavering faith doesn’t mean I have to, too. Just because YOU have zero backbone and get manipulated into taking an experimental vaccine you literally don’t need after a little propaganda and scaremongering about how it’s necessary to return to normal doesn’t mean I buy the crap too.</p>

        <p>Hey man, don't wanna dismiss how you feel, and you definitely have the right to not take the vaccine if you don't want to. But vaccines are supposed to be given to healthy people, so it actually checks out that it would make sense to get a vaccine as a healthy 25 year old. </p>
<p>Again, not trying to say if you should or shouldn't get the vaccine. That choice is yours, but ye vaccines are for healthy people. Sick people have too much to risk to take them.</p>

        <p>The purpose of a vaccine is to help strengthen immune response. With the rates of death for people under 50 with covid being so very very low, why would it make sense for a healthy 25 year old to get an experimental vaccine? Doesn't make sense, the risk to reward is not there. An unhealthy 70 year old? Sure. Their survival rate with covid is less. However there is no logical reason a healthy 25 year old needs to get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I see what you are saying now. Not that vaccines in particular wouldn't make sense for healthy young people to get. But this specific covid vaccine is one you feel is unneeded for younger people</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying, I think they mean relative to the COVID risk at that age which is extremely low. Compared to other diseases which could present a real risk to a 25 y/o and a vaccine would be preferred.</p>

        <p>Preach, dude.</p>
<p>Is it so hard for people to understand that this vaccine is experimental and therefore shouldn’t be pushed onto anyone? Also, these pharmaceutical companies are making bank off of these vaccines, so it’s obviously in their best interest that the public thinks it works without consequences. </p>
<p>Also, since when does anyone else care about someone’s health? The immunocompromised were always here, it’s just that nobody cared about them. They’ve always been at risk, and had to protect themselves. It’s such virtue-signaling bullshit that these people just suddenly care about everyone else.</p>

        <p>This is it, exactly. Three out of every hundred thousand, (or even ten thousand) people dying from COVID (assuming that's even the case) is statistically insignificant, and shows that most people will have the capability to fight it off. The problem comes when people use their loved ones' medical frailty as an excuse to impose all the fuckery we've been subject to on everyone else.</p>

        <p>Heck there was a National Geographic article from 2008 that found people who survived the spanish flu still had antibodies 90 years later and had lasting immunity. Based on this Covid will probably be no different. I trust my immune system over the experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>It is important to note though, that a lot of the folks who died during the Spanish flu didn't die of the influenza virus itself - they died of a secondary bacterial infection that wouldn't have occurred without the influenza virus weakening the body's immune previously <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/">(source for paper is here)</a>. So just because someone is able to develop immunity to a virus like the Spanish Flu influenza or Covid-19, it doesn't mean they're out of the woods. Other illnesses that wouldn't otherwise have the chance to make someone seriously ill are able to when the body's immune system is weakened. </p>
<p>Additionally, we have no long-term studies that look at the effects of Covid-19 on the body's organs, even if those who caught Covid had only a few, if any, mild symptoms. <br>
There's still very much a possibility of long term damage being done to lungs at the time of Covid infection, which could cause a lot of health problems in the future - even for healthy folks. </p>
<p>Thus, it's better to be safe than sorry with new viruses like this - it's difficult to be free and have liberty when your stuck to a ventilator.</p>

        <p>There is also no guarantee that the vaccine won't have long term negative health effects either since it is still in the experimental phase and there are no long term studies on it since it still pretty new in terms of human use. Either getting Covid or the Vaccine we as humans are in for a interesting few decades.</p>

        <p>Yes, but T-Cells rely on past infections or, in the case of newborns, antibodies passed through mother's milk to them soon after birth, as a source of "memory" so they know how to kill viruses in the future.   </p>
<p>Every virus has unique antibodies that are able to kill it, but T-Cells will have a difficult time fighting off the virus, in this case Covid, if it has no clue what antibodies to produce. That's why its important to get immunized, if you medically can, so that your T-Cells can do their job correctly and keep you healthy if they see any Covid-19 virus again.</p>

<p>Xanax would be exceptionally more helpful to our situation.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it annoys me that people think that they even have a right to ask if I got mine. One coworker bragged, "I got the vaccine and didn't turn into a zombie." She didn't try to hard-sell me too much but it was annoying...</p>
<p>If someone asks and I refuse to answer, they can assume my answer is "no". If I say "no" they'll give me some propaganda talking points and I'll have to tactfully dismiss them if I'm at work.</p>

        <p>The article is clearly biased against the vaccine. The entire case it's making is why you might not want to take it. Agreeing with those points doesn't mean it's unbiased, and bias doesn't always mean untrue. It's still important to recognize bias when when we agree</p>

        <p>I agree. It's biased against taking the vaccine. My concern is everything else I've read hides any negative facts about the vaccine. That's also bias. I want to see all the information and make my own decision. Not rely on experts who tell me it's good. The opaqueness and censorship of information about the vaccine, especially the information this article highlights, is why I ultimately decided against taking any vaccine.</p>

        <p>YouTube and Facebook are taking down posts by epidemiologist who are critical of the vaccine. Individual people who have gotten the vaccine have had their personal experiences about getting vaccinated taken down from social media. Google curates searches looking for information critical of the vaccine and only shows positive results. A roundtable discussion with Gov Desantis and several epidemiologists critical of COVID-19 policy was taken down from YouTube and Facebook. </p>
<p>I'm sure there's more, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. It's really depressing to me, because the internet and social media used to be a place where you can find different perspectives and competing ideas and decide for yourself which is true. Now they're trying to turn it in to the six o'clock news.</p>

        <p>Bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing. If I want you to try the pizza I made, I might say "pizza is delicious, lots of people enjoy it, and it'll probably make you happy!" Facts, but presented with bias since I like pizza tbh and think you might too. Doesn't make the pizza less delicious though :)</p>

        <ol>
<li>Vaccine makers are immune from liability - Fair point, I can see how this seems weird, but I haven't looked into this</li>
<li>Checkered past of vaccine companies - I would bet that all these companies have done vastly more good than bad, but even so, I won't debate this too much</li>
<li>The ugly history of coronavirus vaccines - This seems to focus on "Vaccine Enhanced Disease" and claims pharma companies have no data they've solved this. But this seems to not be the case, and at the very least it is a topic being monitored by Moderna. <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/covid-19-vaccine-researchers-mindful-of-immune-enhancement-67576">https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/covid-19-vaccine-researchers-mindful-of-immune-enhancement-67576</a></li>
<li>Data gaps during vaccination studies - My understanding is this is primarily due to the fact that pharma companies wanted a study that did not try to "do to much" so they could rollout vaccinations to low risk people first. Higher-risk / edge cases could be studied afterwards. This is why there's no data (currently) for old/young, pregnany, or auto-immune people. Additionally, I think the transmission and duration were left off to enable the study to move quickly, and now those aspects are being studied. Lastly, my understanding is that only the early phase trials excluded mortality, but the stage 3 trials did study mortality.</li>
<li>No access to raw data - The author implies that skepticism has been brought up by the British Medical Journal, but neglects to point out it was their opinion/letters section</li>
<li>No long term safety testing - my understanding is that almost no long term side effects don't "pop up" after hiding for years and years. Long term side affects would be noticed immediately and then not go away. Additionally, I would argue that there are plenty of examples of long term covid side effects, so it seems like covid has concrete long term effects, and the vaccine has speculative long term effects.</li>
<li>No informed consent - The author implies that the vaccine adverse event system is not working, but the link they provided works, and the website/system seems to be up and running</li>
<li>Under-reporting of adverse reaction and death - The harvard study showing only 1% of reaction were reported was back in '06 to '09. I'm sure its not 100% now, but people are definitely on the lookout for vaccine side affects. Additionally, my understanding is the system is for "bad things that happened AFTER i got a vaccine" not "bad things that happened BECAUSE i got a vaccine"</li>
<li>Vaccines do not stop transmission or infection - Just because the study did not investigate transmission or infection, does not mean the vaccine doesn't do these things. Again, my understanding is the studies were intentionally limited in scope to be fast and easily measured. It is much easier to look for covid symptoms instead of covid infection, especially if you are skeptical of PCR testing or that type of thing. Additionally, we are now getting more data indicating that the vaccine helps prevent infection and transmission. Lastly, it does make sense have the vaccine target symptoms instead of infection, since the symptoms are what kill you (so to speak)</li>
<li>People are catching covid after being fully vaccinated - this is not surprising, it has been well documented that the vaccines are 60%-95% effective (depending on the vaccine). Additionally, the last link about 28/35 nuns getting covid and 2 dying after getting the vaccine neglects to say that this all happened 2 days after their 1st dose, not 2 weeks after the second dose. (Which is when people are considered fully vaccinated)</li>
<li>Overall death rate from covid - Media probably overplays the risk of death, but the real risk of covid (IMO) is it spreading too quickly, and overwhelming healthcare systems. If everyone gets vaccinated, and somehow transmission stays high, the hospitalization rate wouldn't be \~10% of the US population, would be 5% of  10% of US population</li>
<li>Bloated covid death numbers - There's a lot of info refuting this point, I'll sumarize it and say that if someone would have lived 5 more years had they not caught covid, covid is what killed them.</li>
<li>Fauci and others hold moderna patents - I don't have a bunch of knowledge in this one way or the other, but even if we take this as malicious as possible, just get JnJ, or Pfizer. </li>
<li>Fauci's involvement in gain of function - Again, not well versed in this topic, but even if fauci himself cooked up covid, how is this an indictment of the vaccines?</li>
<li>The virus continues to mutate - My understanding is the main reason covid is so infectious is the "hook" part that binds it to cells. I'm pretty sure that the vaccine creates protection against the "hook" attachement. So if the virus stays dangerous with the hook, the vaccine help protect against it. If the virus mutates away from the hook, it would probably get less dangerous.</li>
<li>Absence of scientific debate - There wasn't a ton of debate around a lot of measures because they were common sense and well understood. Additionally, medical professionals are probably hesitant to publicly disagree and decrease public trust.</li>
<li>The world's leading vaccinologist is sounding the alarm - Geert Vanden Bossche is a veterenarian, and I don't even think he has any peer reviewed publications.</li>
<li>Already had covid - It's great that the author didn't get a severe case, hopefully she didn't transmit it to anyone who got severely ill/died</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sure I glazed over/rounded stuff off, so sorry in advance /s</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>That's an exhaustive analysis. You make intelligent points and I'm glad we can discuss this. A couple reactions to your reaction. </p>
<p>&rt;6.  ⁠No long term safety testing - my understanding is that almost no long term side effects don't "pop up" after hiding for years and years. Long term side affects would be noticed immediately and then not go away. Additionally, I would argue that there are plenty of examples of long term covid side effects, so it seems like covid has concrete long term effects, and the vaccine has speculative long term effects.</p>
<p>My personal concern about this is that the vaccine modifying our RNA could potentially weaken our immune system against other viruses and diseases in the future. I think of it like: if the Army focused all its resources on fighting insurgents, it would weaken itself against fighting conventional forces. A 9-10 month sample size would not be able to adequately assess this potential risk. </p>
<p>&rt;8.  ⁠Under-reporting of adverse reaction and death - The harvard study showing only 1% of reaction were reported was back in '06 to '09. I'm sure its not 100% now, but people are definitely on the lookout for vaccine side affects. Additionally, my understanding is the system is for "bad things that happened AFTER i got a vaccine" not "bad things that happened BECAUSE i got a vaccine"</p>
<p>I read about 43 year old dad with four kids and was in great shape with no pre-existing conditions who got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and had a massive stroke and died 6 days later. The vaccine wasn't listed as causing or contributing to his death and that concerns me and makes me think things are underreported. I get this is one case, but everything I seem to hear is that the vaccines are great and there's essentially a free lunch with no risk or downside. I don't want someone else's assessment, I want to hear the arguments and the data from both sides and assess the risk for myself. </p>
<p>&rt;11. ⁠Overall death rate from covid - Media probably overplays the risk of death, but the real risk of covid (IMO) is it spreading too quickly, and overwhelming healthcare systems. If everyone gets vaccinated, and somehow transmission stays high, the hospitalization rate wouldn't be ~10% of the US population, would be 5% of  10% of US population</p>
<p>This is what the experts said during the first two weeks of the original lockdown, but America's medical system was never overwhelmed from COVID-19.  Italy's was, America's wasn't.</p>
<p>&rt;12. ⁠Bloated covid death numbers - There's a lot of info refuting this point, I'll sumarize it and say that if someone would have lived 5 more years had they not caught covid, covid is what killed them.</p>
<p>Dr. Birx <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/08/dr_birx_unlike_some_countries_if_someone_dies_with_covid-19_we_are_counting_that_as_a_covid-19_death.html#!">said </a> that anyone who died while having COVID is counted as a COVID death, even if it's not the proximate cause of death. The Federal funding hospitals get for COVID patients incentivizes this behavior as well. </p>
<p>&rt;15. The virus continues to mutate - My understanding is the main reason covid is so infectious is the "hook" part that binds it to cells. I'm pretty sure that the vaccine creates protection against the "hook" attachement. So if the virus stays dangerous with the hook, the vaccine help protect against it. If the virus mutates away from the hook, it would probably get less dangerous.</p>
<p>They're still doing booster shots next year. Maybe it only protects up to a certain point?</p>
<p>&rt;16. ⁠Absence of scientific debate - There wasn't a ton of debate around a lot of measures because they were common sense and well understood. Additionally, medical professionals are probably hesitant to publicly disagree and decrease public trust.</p>
<p>There were a lot of medical officials and epidemiologists who came forward and their videos were taken down from Facebook, YouTube, and Google searches. </p>
<p>&rt;17. ⁠The world's leading vaccinologist is sounding the alarm - Geert Vanden Bossche is a veterenarian, and I don't even think he has any peer reviewed publications.</p>
<p>I didn't know anything about the guy, but I just <a href="https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/">googled</a> him. He has a PhD in virology and seems to have a very impressive resume, including being published by the WHO and having an entire career based on vaccine studies, development and manufacturing.</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Already had covid - It's great that the author.</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;I'm sure I glazed over/rounded stuff off, so sorry in advance /s</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your analysis and agree with a lot of your points. I just responded to the ones that I had a different point of view on.  Taking and not taking COVID-19 vaccines each present their own set of risks. I'm choosing the known risk over the unknown risk. I may be making the wrong choice, but it will be at least a year or two before I conclude that one way or another (barring my death from COVID, in which case I would conclude that I made the wrong choice. 😂).</p>

<p>I don't know enough to refute this, but i believe <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">an abnormally large ammount of people have died this year</a>, and I think it is reasonable to attribute this to covid. </p>

<p>Touche, he certainly has more experience than you or me. I don't know if its accurate for the article to call him the world's leading vaccinologist, and I am going to side with the majority of medical experts. I can't live my life researching every topic and the motives of every single author, I would never be able to decide anything. I think the risk is very small that the huge majority of experts are conspiring or idiotic.</p>

<p>That's fine if that's what the vaccine amounts to. My concern is that it's neglecting readiness for everything else in order to fight COVID-19. The only way we will for sure know this is observation of the experimental population over the long term. </p>

<p>&rt;I don't know enough to refute this, but i believe an abnormally large ammount of people have died this year, and I think it is reasonable to attribute this to covid.</p>
<p>There's also been a huge spike in drug overdoses, violent crime, and suicides, so if there is an increase in deaths, we have to sort all that out. </p>
<p>&rt;I don't think that booster shots / vaccine diminishing over time is an indication that the vaccine is dangerous, or not effective in the near term. My dog gets revaccinated for kennel cough, and I got my TDAP vaccination again after 10 years.</p>
<p>I didn't mean it was dangerous, I was just addressing the mutations and how the vaccine has to get boosters to stay effective.</p>
<p>&rt;I wasn't a huge fan of tech companies doing this, BUT i would argue that this thread is a great example of the difficulty/confusion that can be generated by innaccurate information, and people debating stuff back and forth. </p>
<p>I feel like talking to you has helped me understand. Most people I try to discuss this kind of thing with don't want to convince, they want to shame.</p>
<p>&rt;I am comfortable relying on the medical establishment to analyze all the data and make a recommendation to me.</p>
<p>I don't trust government and big pharma to place my interests over their own.  At all. That's why I want to see the info for myself.</p>
<p>&rt;I can't live my life researching every topic and the motives of every single author, I would never be able to decide anything. </p>
<p>Not every topic. Sure. But am experimental drug that big pharma is not legally liable for the outcomes it produces? Yeah, I'm gonna look into that one. </p>
<p>&rt;I think the risk is very small that the huge majority of experts are conspiring or idiotic.</p>
<p>A friend of mine is a professor of epidemiology at UPitt and he had a competing theory on how COVID spreads and wrote a peer reviewed paper in a major scientific journal. Rather than debate the merits of the theory, the graduate students were blackballed for participating in the study and the University stopped supporting their own professor's paper when they got a couple phone calls from other "experts." Science is not designed to work that way.</p>
<p>If you're curious, the theory is that people in certain areas are more vulnerable to COVID depending on the magnetic fields being affected by the ground water. They were able to successfully predict ahead of time where COVID would hit hard based on this variable.</p>

        <p>I caught COVID already, but trying to explain to people I have natural immunity is a lost cause. I don't even know who put the idea in their head that it doesn't. There's plenty of good quality research coming out nearly every week continuing to prove natural immunity exists. Even without the research, almost every virus provides lasting natural immunity provided you are not immunocompromised. Do they just not trust this science in particular, because it goes against their views?</p>

        <p>I was once one of those people with a compromised immune system. I never would have forced/wanted people to get vaccinated on my behalf. D I get mad at people who are clearly sick with colds and flus who are walking around spreading it when they dont have to? Yeah duh. But here's the thing- if my immune compromised system can't handle a live virus vaccine then I would not expect anyone else to get it. Because I recognized that for those with healthy immune systems, they got over those illnesses quickly, and didn't need it.</p>

        <p>It’s so interesting to me that people can simultaneously understand that immunocompromised people shouldn’t get vaccinated, while assuring me vaccines are safe. If we can agree they’re not safe for someone with cancer, we can’t continue to call them inherently safe and pretend that people who <em>think</em> their immune system is fine can’t potentially get injured. Anyway, tangent aside, I’m with you. No shot in this arm.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I'm at the same point. I've built a reputation on being goddamn near Vulcan. Nearly operating on fact and logic alone. But this noise, I've called from the beginning, the masks won't stay "recommended," it won't be just "15 days to slow the spread," the definition of "essential" is arbitrary.</p>
<p>At this point, whenever I discuss this, ppl expect me to bring arguments and facts; I just say I'm operating out of spite now. I have to wear the stupid fucking mask at work and my feelings are well known. If you want me to do something that doesn't bring me any closer to not having to strap on a filthy muzzle every time I get up from my desk, you can kiss my ass.</p>
<p>I'm not getting the "vaccine" for the sake of the Science™ because there needs to be a control group and, that group is vanishing quickly.</p>

        <p>Hey, I noticed a couple of things in your post that I think would probably be good with a reference so I'm just gonna add a couple. Broken down into two parts b</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients to the Pfiezer vaccine:</strong> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download</a> on page 2<strong>Ingredients to the Moderna vaccine:</strong> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download</a>on page 20<strong>Ingredients to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine:</strong> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download</a> on page 2</p>
<p>All the listed packages are both provided on the FDA website, and are also provided to healthcare professionals and those who have received/are receiving the vaccine.I'm not sure what vaccine you are listing the ingredients for above, as it doesn't match any of those available in the United States, which I'm assuming you're in.</p>
<p><strong>If not, here are the ingredients for the AstraZenica vaccine:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/astrazeneca.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/astrazeneca.html</a></p>
<p>This is the website for the Canadian government, as the USA is not currently distributing the AstraZenica vaccine. Once again, the ingredients do not match, so I just wanted to make sure that we're on the same page.</p>
<p>Also just some quick facts, with sources, about some of  the ingredients you've listed above.</p>
<p><strong>Thimerosal:</strong> First and foremost, yes, Thimerosal does contain a mercury compound, specifically methylmercury, which while still a heavy metal compound, only remains in the body of a human adult for 3-7 days and is extremely unlikely to accumulate in the human body after 30 days post exposure (i.e. after getting a vaccine). <a href="https://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8730.pdf?ua=1">[on page 5]</a> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines#nolink">[From the FDA]</a>. While Thimerosal can still be found in many vaccines, due to its wide use as a preservative to prevent vaccines from spoiling between production in lab to deliverance to patient, all common vaccines in the United States and Canada are now available in versions not containing Thimerosal, so you can get any of those vaccines (listed in the FDA information I've linked above) without experiencing any exposure to mercury.Additionally, there are no peer-reviewed and repeatable studies conclusively linking <strong>Autism and ADHD,</strong> another developmental disorder, to mercury or vaccines themselves. While it is true that mercury can cause neurodegenerative disorders, there is currently no study that can concretely, and with approval from the greater scientific community, say that there is a direct link between autism and vaccination <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25349/">[one study]</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25349/">[another study]</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2632594/">[a third study]</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169657/">[fourth study]</a></p>
<p><strong>Aluminum salts:</strong> Because Aluminum salts can encompass any compound of aluminum with a non-metal in an ionic bond (like aluminum chloride, aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate, etc) there's no way I can tell you if which one you're thinking of is safe because it's not specified in said ingredients that's you've listed as to what it is. That said, it's true that there are harmful aluminum salts that we as humans would want to avoid, but there's also aluminum salts that we are exposed to on a daily basis and do not suffer ill effects from because they are at such a low dose. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/chemical-substances/fact-sheets/chemicals-glance/aluminum-salts.html">[Information from the government of Canada]</a></p>
<p>And, if it helps, please note that none of the Covid-19 vaccines currently available contain an aluminum compound of any kind.</p>
<p><strong>Pig gelatin, egg protein, and formaldehyde:</strong> I'm not sure if these are all supposed to be one ingredient or separate, but they're all linked so I'm going to tackle them all at once. Pig gelatin and egg protein, when used in vaccines containing live or dead viruses, were used to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium">growth medium</a>, the gooey material needed to grow viruses, bacteria, and the link in a petri dish inside the lab. Because the virus, when a live / dead vaccine is used, needs to be able to eat to grow and reproduce, it needs something protein heavy that is easy to obtain and contains the enzymes/cell structure of animal cells. Pigs, in terms of structure and cell function, are actually incredibly similar to humans - thus it is used as part of growth medium when a virus requires a cell similar to human cells to effectively reproduce. Egg protein is used when a human-similar cell isn't needed, but viruses require protein to be healthy, so eggs (which are incredibly high in protein already) are used as part of the growth medium. Today, most vaccines don't use either as a growth medium unless absolutely necessary, and in the grand majority of cases there are now alternative ways to grow viruses, so you can find a vaccine that doesn't have these in it.</p>

<p><strong>Formaldehyde</strong> is toxic, yes, but as a person receiving a vaccine you will receive at most, a trace amount of it, if any at all. Formaldehyde is used in the vaccine production process as an antiviral medium, for deactivating viruses so they can safely be used in vaccines. Special care is taken to remove as much of it as possible from the final product, and although there is very very little of it remaining, if any, it is listed so that those who may have an above-average sensitivity to it are aware and can take the appropriate precautions. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/common-ingredients-us-licensed-vaccines#:~:text=Formaldehyde%20has%20a%20long%20history,used%20to%20make%20diphtheria%20vaccine">[A good explanation on its use and history in vaccines, from the FDA]</a></p>
<p><strong>MRC-5:</strong> Yes, MRC-5 is fetal lung cells used to assist in the development of vaccines. <strong>No</strong>, it is not the harvest of aborted/stillborn/stolen/other illegally obtained infants and fetuses. MRC-5 is a cell line (laboratory maintained culture) of human fetal cells collected in  1966 <a href="https://www.atcc.org/Products/All/CCL-171.aspx#history">[Source from current distributer]</a>, which has continued to be maintained and used in modern medicine and the development of vaccines. While you may not agree that it was right to collect them from an aborted fetus, I would like to note that they were collected in 1966, when science ethics were far more lax than current standards, and that <strong>no more cells have been collected for use in vaccines since.</strong> Cell line MRC-5 is a single source, once-collected line that hasn't just been used in vaccines <a href="https://catalog.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=AG05965-D">[list of publications that have used MRC-5]</a>, it's been used to do life saving research for other diseases like tuberculosis, radiation poisoning, and even for researching and bettering treatment for fetal and infant connective tissue disorders.</p>
<p><strong>"HUMAN alubmin RNA recombinant":</strong>  I'm just going to assume that you are referring to the use of RNA, specifically mRNA, that is being used in many of Covid-19 vaccines. So, just to make things clear, DNA and RNA are not the same thing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MfSYnItYvg&amp;ab_channel=DNALearningCenter">This video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNKWgcFPHqw&amp;ab_channel=yourgenome">this video</a> do a great job at explaining the differences between them, even if you're not super into biology. If you have a strong background in biology and want some more details on the differences, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gUY5NoX1Lk&amp;ab_channel=KhanAcademy">this video</a> might be your cup of tea.In other words, your DNA, the stuff your cells come with, is like the recipe that makes you <em>you</em>. It's the complete thing - ingredients, tools, steps - the whole bit, that tells your body what to make. RNA is like reading off a section of that recipe and actually using that to make whatever you're making. If your DNA is the entire recipe for a muffin, the RNA would like the step telling you how to mix all the dry ingredients. An RNA vaccine is just like if a friend told you a little tweak that would change how the recipe comes out, like adding a quarter cup more sugar for example. The original recipe is still the same, you've got all the stuff to make it again exactly as it came, but your friend's extra step makes the recipe come out a bit different. In the case of the mRNA vaccine, that extra step is making antibodies for the Covid-19 virus, so that if your body gets it, your cells already have the tools to effectively kill it and prevent it from incubating in your body to spread to others or make you seriously ill.</p>
<p>RNA isn't permanent. Both the RNA produced by your body, and the RNA delivered in mRNA vaccines, eventually breaks down. That's why your cells have to continuously read DNA - because it doesn't keep those RNA instructions around forever and eventually it has to produce another RNA strand to replace the one that just degraded. It's the same with the mRNA vaccine. Eventually, that RNA is going to break down and your DNA won't know the difference. It'll keep working just like it did before you got the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I agree that freedom and liberty is important, but I also worry about the effects I have on others. While I am definitely free to take a brick into a crowded public space and spin around with it clutched in my hand, I could seriously hurt someone else so I don't do it.   </p>
<p>Fighting for liberty and freedom doesn't just mean fighting for liberty and freedom for yourself, that's just shifting the scales of oppression to a different side, it's about making sure as many people as possible are able to have the same freedoms and liberties you do - even if they are immunocompromised, elderly, or just unlucky enough to get seriously ill from a highly infectious disease.   </p>
<p>Just like militias and rebellions that helped form our current democracies, fighters took one for the team by engaging themselves in warfare, slogging through trenches, and getting shot at in the dark of night because they wanted to ensure freedom for those they loved, sometimes we have to do the same.  </p>
<p>And frankly, if all it takes for me to fight for my fellow brothers and sisters is to wear and mask and be respectful of distances, hell I think I can suck it up until as many people as possible can feel safe, be free, and have liberty.</p>

        <p>It might be too late. In India cases dropped to nothing as half the population in some areas got infected, creating a natural herd immunity. But at the same time as they started vaccination, cases shot up and are completely out of control.</p>
<p>Which could very well be because it's a leaky vaccine, meaning those vaccinated cause the virus to mutate and become more infectious to non vaccinated, it is a well established phenomenon : https://www.healthline.com/health-news/leaky-vaccines-can-produce-stronger-versions-of-viruses-072715</p>
<p>In the end, those who got vaccinated might have damned all of us. In trying to get rid of it they just made it worse, and we might be forced to take the vaccine forever. Just as they planned.</p>

        <p>Love this post and the sarcasm!! But all jokes aside, I whole heartedly agree with everything you have said. </p>
<p>Here in the UK its particularly bad, I cant believe how compliant the public have been over here. And the amount of times Ive heard people say "I cant wait to have the vaccine just so we can just all get back to normal again" Noooooooo, what the fuck are you people doing???!! A few work colleagues have asked me if Im getting the jab when its offered to my age bracket, my reply being no. They then ask "why not?"..........my reply to that on a level the morons can just about deal with is "well, I dont see the need to have a yearly flu jab as Ive never considered myself at risk, and this is no different"</p>

        <p>Problem is we don't want to get it but our jobs are going to mandate it or make our at-work lives miserable with restrictions. We will have to get it to travel and pretty much go anywhere. You're not going to escape it unless something is done on a MASSIVE scale do dismantle the whole Big Pharma industrial complex. There will be some small skirmishes and protests but they will win in the end because they will skirt around legal issues by holding service providers, employers and the like personally responsible if you're let in maskless or unvaccinated and ONE person "comes down with covid" and it's traced to their business. Employers especially are complying because they don't want lawsuits from employees, health code violations that threaten to shut them down, bad PR, fines, and all sorts of mess. They're scared. Lawyers are licking their chops just waiting for the frivolous covid lawsuits to fly. "I went to Cuck Supermarket and they let someone in with no mask on and 2 days later I had a sore throat, headaches and a test confirmed I got COVID. It HAD to be from that store and that maskless person! SUE THEM!"....</p>
<p>People who say "just don't get the shot" or "just don't wear the mask"...hope you're good at living off the grid and being self-sufficient, cause that's what it'll take eventually.</p>

        <p>Oh dang, I did all that? It must have been St. Patrick's Day, my bad. Also, if getting vaccinated both for my own health and that of a family member who can't be is virtue signaling, what is not getting vaccinated out of pure, Fox news inspired, spite called? Murdock signaling? Nugent signaling maybe? Also, no one knows I was vaccinated side from the person who stuck me and my family, who am I meant to be signaling to?</p>

        <p>I'm not referring to you personally. I'm referring to people on your side of the argument; not any one specific person. </p>
<p>Idc what FOX says. I watch both FOX and CNN, but that doesn't mean they think for me. I arrive at my own conclusions</p>
<p>If you wanted to get the vaccine and got it, than great, I'm happy for you. What bothers me is social media influencers and celebrities urging people to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the civil reply. I don't watch a whole lot of TV or news, when I do watch it tends to be BBC or Deutsche because I like to hear what's going on in the world at large sometimes. I've not had the chance to see many celebs using their fame to encourage folks to get vaccinated but I think that's a good thing. I respect people choosing not to get vaccinated out of fear of side effects but the covid ward horror stories I've read, from actual front line workers, tell me it's far less dangerous. Psudo-science and anti-inellectualism are causing so much needless harm, not just in the U.S. either. I'm no big brain, I dropped out of H.S., but I know enough to trust experts with more experience than I have birthdays. If the talking head who is pulling in big bucks tells me to disregard a world renowned and respected expert, well, I'll not trust them ever again. God bless you and yours.</p>

        <p>No one cares. You realize most people only come in here to laugh at you and feel better about themselves. Half the people posting in here already got the shot but are playing tough keyboard warriors since they can stay anonymous.</p>
<p>You realize if you’re wrong then you become the minority that can’t fly, can’t cruise, can’t vacation, cant leave the country, can’t get a job, can’t visit grandma in the home or see your new baby at the hospital. If you’re right and it kills everyone vaccinated then you’ll live just long enough to say I told you so before the state sized firestorms and poison gas clouds wipe out all of modern society when the other 90% die.  You say they took a year of your life but then voluntarily lower your quality of life of all the years you have left. It doesn’t even have to be govt mandated...societal pressure and economics will do that anyway</p>
<p>As it is I am pro-choice. I think you have the right, as an adult, to make the choice to not get the vaccine. The problem is you don’t also agree that everyone else has the right to avoid you because of it.</p>

        <p>How would my not being vaccinated have any sort of effect on anyone to the point where I'm restricted from living a normal life? You do realize the vaccine is experimental, doesn't stop you from transmitting or catching the virus, and only lasts for six months? There's literally no fucking point to getting it if you're healthy.</p>

        <p>You can’t do any of those things while vaccinated either. There’s no end to this. No incentive to get it. No light on the horizon for going back to normal. They still tell us to mask and distance as to not spread the virus even while vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Current guidelines don’t say that anymore. No need to mask at home, no need to mask or distance if everyone around you is vaccinated. The only reason we’re still doing it now is buying time until a majority get their vaccination and most states have already removed their mask mandate anyway. </p>
<p>The light is on the horizon for “normal”. If you are vaccinated.  Right or wrong the only ones who don’t see an end are the anti-vaxxers because things will become more and more restricted.</p>

        <p>How so? We just want our lives back and do not want to be forced to take an experimental vaccine to get our lives back. We're tired of the government overreach and the constitutional violations of the many things done in the past year and a half. </p>
<p>And before you paint us all as Americans, we're not. We're from around the world, and we're all done with he propaganda, the virtue signaling from people who are doing the exact opposite of what they preach.</p>
<p>As for selfish, who is selfish, the one who spends their life living how they like and letting others do what they want, or the one who screams at others, attempting to control them, threatening others to conform to what they want them to do? </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the one living freely is not the selfish one, but you paint us as the selfish ones. A lot of you are hypocrites, and you scream at us for not confirming to the masses, all while thinking you're not part of the masses.</p>
<p>Trust me, as the 16 y/o who doesn't know half of the extent of the true corruption, you have no real clue what you're trying to defend. Stop while you're ahead, you're only going to delve deeper into the insanity if you continue down this road. Keep your nose out of this shit kid, you have no clue what you're talking about.</p>
