        <p>Well they come to my work place and give the flu shot to anyone who wants it. It is free, convenient, and I get paid for it. ( I get the shot on company time is what I mean by that.) Most importantly though it is a choice whether or not you get it and no one cares either way.</p>
<p>Idk about where you live but where I do, I would say only about half the people even bother getting a flu shot if that many.</p>

        <p>We'll see that pattern with Covid shots I'm certain.</p>
<p>We've had people out to give shots at my company multiple times now, including paying people $100 to take it, so literally paying people to take it.</p>
<p>The choice is the important part of course. I've started seeing more pressure for flu vaccination the last few years, and I'm curious to see how it continues in the next coming years.</p>

        <p>I don’t see the point in pressuring people to get the flu shot. I mean putting more information about it, and advertising it is fine. But doing the crap like they are doing with The Covid shot by trying to convince people that by not getting the shot they are hurting people, is really messed up.</p>

        <p>In my own experience, this does seem to be true for some people. For me however it was the opposite. The only time I got the flu was the year I didn’t get the flu shot and it was rough.</p>

        <p>You have a good immune system. Congrats. Covid is real. I have had it. It wasn’t the flu. I have had the flu and it was a way worse experience. However the After I got over Covid I haven’t been able to smell properly since. I can’t smell things unless they are strong and if they are strong they smell faint. I have never heard of someone having such strange side effects from the flu.</p>

        <p>How to spot a troll:   They endorse flu shots and tell us Covid is real,  and  that it has these weird side effects that are just soooo scary.   But they never say anything about how the PCR test was never designed to diagnose any disease, especially when it is cranked to double the number of cycles it can be considered even vaguely accurate for.</p>

        <p>Bud you need to chill a little bit.</p>
<p>I think the flu shot works, simply from experience. </p>
<p>I think Covid is real for the same reason. But let’s get one thing straight. I am not scared of Covid. As I have already said, the flu was worse, and if anything am loving my new lack of smell super power. The guys at work will pass gas and it will now have almost no effect on me.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to promote the flu shot. If it doesn’t work for you then don’t get it. I wouldn’t if it hadn’t worked for me, but it does so I do.</p>
<p>The Covid vax though. I got no interest in that. </p>
<p>Tbh bud you people that are denying that Covid exists are the real trolls. Either that or you are amazingly out of touch with reality, or just plain ignorant.</p>

        <p>Covid is a fraud and time will prove this.   The entire Big Pharma driven so-called <em>health care</em> industry is a fraud.</p>
<p>It basically works like this: you can't make money if you don't have clients, for big pharma that means you need people who want a cure for an ailment.   So if you want clients then give them a reason to need a cure, like say a pandemic, for instance.   When they start taking your pills/shots  make sure there will be side effects so that they need more pills/shots.    Soon you'll have piles of money coming in so you can pay for the propaganda campaign to launch the next big disease.</p>
<p>Don't be a victim of these snake oil selling tyrants.</p>

        <p>Yeah, also, flu shots tend not to cause a stroke, myocarditis, or blood clots. Even if those things are rare with COVID vaccines, they're still much more common than with flu vaccines.</p>

        <p>Ya the thing about the flu vaccine is that it is actually a vaccine.</p>
<p>This “Covid Vaccine” is really just a mRNA science experiment that was designed to lessen the severity of Covid symptoms. It does not fight Covid and was never designed too. It is kinda like taking Tylenol for a headache. Sure it has a chance to make your head not hurt as bad, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem. </p>
<p>In 4 years they will probably come out with an actual vaccine and hopefully it will not come with all the crazy side effects.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It sounds like a treatment to me, one that isn't very well-tested. The Novavax vaccine that's coming out soon sounds like an actual vaccine, though.</p>

        <p>That’s because there isn’t one. There is discussion about making it mandatory for care home workers, but no bill has been passed, and no mandatory digital vaccination records are required either. Catchy meme, but it’s just plain wrong.</p>

        <p>Most people take no notice, a passing notice at best. And with such limited attention paid, some of these suggestions seem rational/reasonable but what they don’t pause to realise is that combined, these gradual erosions of Liberty amount to a full on assault and complete power grab.</p>

        <p>I see. So you're referring to the mandatory vaccination for Healthcare workers. (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348224993">https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348224993</a> )</p>
