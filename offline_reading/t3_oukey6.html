    <strong>The continuation of Lockdowns and other draconian measures.</strong>
    <p><p>I have recently finished Thomas Sowell's Book, The vision of the anointed: Self Congratulation as a basis for social policy. In the book he addressed the prevalence of the anointed (intellectuals who pay no price for the decisions they make for society) making terrible policy decisions, such as that of implementing the sex education in schools. This policy was implemented to decrease teen pregnancy and the spread of STDs, however the result of their policy was a significant increase in both teen pregnancy and STD transmission. When confronted about this fact they merely said that "it would've been far worse had we done nothing at all", a form of heads I win tails you lose. </p>
<p>When it comes to the practice of lockdowns, which we all know are far less effective than they are portrayed by the media, it is likely that in spite of its inefficacy and the costs that we have incurred because of it, our 'benevolent' overlords will merely claim it would've been far worse had they done nothing at all. Then with that previous 'success' they can continue to engage in draconian lockdown measures and if there is any disagreement they can just reference the brilliant success of their previous lockdown policy and mask mandates, which under their benevolent guidance saved the world.</p>
<p>What I feel is the most worrying is that people will just give up on the past, on what life used to be, on what it should remain to be today. People crave stability and predictability in their lives if lockdown policy and other measures persist, they will become normal and people will give up the past. </p>
<p>At least there is hope in the sense that as human beings we can only bear to live in captivity to a certain degree. It will reach a point where man kind can no longer psychologically bear their condition and it is at that point where they can push no more. Without the ability to fulfil the power process, pursue real goals, and have some autonomy in their lives we become mentally ill. This is evident through the expansion of the industrial society and the strong rise in mental illness (Industrial society and its future). </p>
<p>**This is my first post, I'm still trying to figure out my position. I'd be interested to hear what you lot think of it.**</p></p>
