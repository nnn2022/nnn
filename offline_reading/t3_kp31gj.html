    <strong>Did any of you read Todd Strasser's "The Wave?"</strong>
    <p><p>My dad is a huge WWII buff and bought me this in middle school. Read through it in class thanks to those "free reading" segments.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(novel)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_(novel)</a></p>
<p>It's not one of my favorite books and it's actually kind of boring, but I think it's why I was immediately anti-lockdowns and all of the weird social engineering that came along with it. You learn how to spot it very quick.</p>
<p>The TLDR is that a schoolteacher in the late 60's wants to simulate how quickly the Nazi's came to power, because his students just don't get how people were so dumb to just go along with whatever the government told them to.</p>
<p>As an experiment, he creates this generic social club, "The Wave", that anyone is free to join, using three simple ambiguous phrases: STRENGTH THROUGH DISCIPLINE. STRENGTH THROUGH COMMUNITY. STRENGTH THROUGH ACTION. </p>
<p><em>(Wear a mask! Social distancing! We're all in this together!)</em></p>
<p>His students immediately embrace these ambiguous phrases and the teacher adds roles and structure throughout the week - just as the normies were slowly given more and more Covid protocol rules to follow. The kids bandwagon it <em>hard, to the point where it became part of their identity,</em> and begin actively bullying/insulting any of their classmates who don't go along with it, akin to the mask zealots losing their shit at people in stores.</p>
<p>The teacher ends up revealing to everyone that the leader of "The Wave", is actually Hitler and everyone who went along with his draconian social club got to LARP as a Nazi for a week. Even after this is revealed, there are students <em>upset</em> it ended because it gave them a sense of purpose and belonging to shill for this totally-not-Nazi's-group.</p>
<p>Bro I read this in middle school and it helped me avoid so much horseshit just like it. Kony2012, the wage gap, Covid-19, all of it I just outright refused to partake in rallying for because I understood what the blueprint for social engineering looks like.</p></p>
