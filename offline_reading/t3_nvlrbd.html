        <p>There are good-faith arguments to be had about anti-lockdown, but Sweden has been fairly liberal on that front and it seemed to really have fucked over the country. So I'm not sure. </p>
<p>As for vaccinations. Here, I'd like to consistency. Aren't you as concerns about Ibuprofen? It's being used everywhere to treat everything. The side affects include heart failure, kidney impairment not to mention the allergic conditions. How does the near universal use of this life-threatening drug that is being given to children all the time doesn't concern you?</p>

        <p>I'll be honest with you. I did not expect that consistency. My point would have been that people generally don't worry about painkillers or contraceptives or just about any other tablet they take on a daily basis but they worry about vaccines with the same or less severe side effects.</p>
<p>I don't think vaccines should be forced upon people - but I also don't think people who aren't vaccinated or won't wear masks have the right to enter private business.</p>

        <p>What makes getting a vaccine superior to an immune system doing the normal thing and just clearing the virus?</p>
<p>IOW:  why wouldn't people that naturally cleared the virus have that same "right" (you actually meant privilege)?</p>

        <p>Not sure what your distinction between right and privilege is there, but alright. </p>
<p>Whether or not you wanna risk it by exposing yourself to the virus without antigens is up to you. I wouldn't. I have a friend who lost his sense of taste. And who knows what kind of side effects they'll discover for the virus in about ten years. Look at the rates. Decide for yourself. </p>
<p>If you've had the virus and have antibodies then I see no reason you should be treated differently than anyone who is vaccinated, provided of course that you still have antibodies and that they are effective. I think business ought to mandate masks for their customers for some time since you can never know for sure who is vaccinated and who isn't. </p>
<p>I think there's a conversation to be had about public spaces, hospitals and other public service intuitions like schools. As far as I'm concerned, you're "right" to any of these public services only exist in so far as you've implicitly enter into a contract with the State whose mandate it is to protect not only your individual rights but also the safety of the population at large. That's always a balancing act. In general, I think people who refuse vaccinations, and refuse them for their kids, cannot expect to have all public services available to them at the expanse of other citizens.</p>

        <p>The human immune system is extremely complex and sophisticated and very well adapted from 500,000,000+ years of evolution to deal with this virus.</p>
<p>I already had it.  It was trivial.  Probably around 3 billion people or so worldwide already had an infection with this virus, and just cleared it, as is normal.</p>
<p>Even the statistics in the mis-begotten "official" (lol) numbers clearly show that an infection from this virus has <em>never been</em> a "safety" issue.  It's always been a personal, individual HEALTH issue.  Specifically; a matter of what people choose to put, and not put, into their mouths.</p>
<p>Health is not a game of chance.  There is no game server RNG rolling dice to determine if people take adequate care of their immune system or not.  That's a matter of choices that individuals make.</p>
<p>It's a shame some people, like your friend, take care of their immune system so badly that it can't function as well as it could if they'd take care of it.  It's just like how some people maintain their vehicles badly.</p>
<p>Rights are not granted, they are inherent.  They could be stolen, but all cases of that are violence against whomever rights are being stolen from and must be repelled with violence.</p>
<p>Privileges can be permitted or taken away.  For example: you never have a right to walk across my lawn.  I can grant you the privilege to do so if I wish, or I can deny you such a privilege at my whim.</p>
<p>You don't know the difference between safety and health, you don't know the difference between right and privilege, it's pretty obvious you don't know the difference between what this virus does in a body vs what the body does to itself, I'm have a hunch you don't know the difference between a pathogen and a disease, you apparently don't know the difference between antibodies and t cells,  you don't know the difference between personal responsibility and the actual social need we have for government, you obviously know almost nothing about the immune system ...</p>
<p>Not knowing <em>SO MUCH</em>, so many very important things, many of which are basic, where the fuck do you get off mentally masturbating some theory crafting on how and when YOU should control other people?</p>
<p>You're a control freak -- a fundamentalist Nazi.</p>

        <p>I was wondering how long it'd take before you called me a Nazi. </p>
<p>First and foremost, <strong><em>relax</em></strong>. I have no doubt that you're way more knowledgeable about the adverse effects of vaccinates, the immune system and indeed your libertarian distinction between negative rights and privileges than I am. </p>
<p>In fact, the vibes I'm getting is that you probably spend a lot of time arguing about all this online and I got way more important things to do. Wanna win the internet debate? You got it. </p>
<p>That said, I can't help but feel that the avalanche of unmitigated anger and accusations I was just exposed to was based less on things I actually said and more on things you think I said. </p>
<p>Because I really only remember making two points. </p>
<ul>
<li>People ought to decide for themselves whether they want the vaccine or not as long as they are ready to accept the consequences</li>
<li>Private business ought to have the right to enforce whichever policies they want </li>
</ul>
<p>I also added that it is my personal opinion that your don't have some intrinsic right to use certain services provided by your government (like schools, hospitals etc) where deceases might spread if you refuse to get vaccinated or do other things so you might reasonably present a hazard to other people. For someone who who would stress the difference between rights and privileges, this shouldn't come as a surprise. </p>
<p>You'll note that is not an opinion that I am in any way shape or form alone in having or expressing. It's widely considered a reality of living in a modern civilization with other people who are going to be affected by what you do or don't do. </p>
<p>Now I'd love to hear how any of those opinions should make sympathetic or adjacent to the National Socialist Workers' Party. </p>
<p>While you're at it, please tell me where I've demonstrated an inability to tell the difference between: </p>
<ul>
<li>Safety and health </li>
<li>Rights and privileges</li>
<li>What the "virus does to your body" vs. "what the virus does to itself" (some incredibly vague language there) </li>
<li>Antibodies and T-cells </li>
<li>Personal responsibility and the social need for a government </li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly and probably most importantly, you asked me <strong>how I can justify telling people what they can't or can't do</strong>.</p>
<p>The answer is beautifully simple. <em>I don't have to.</em> </p>
<p>I don't have to personally justify having to control other people because I am not nor do I wish to be in a position to do so. In fact, the difference between you and me is that I'm largely confident in how public health experts are handling this epidemic in my country whereas you quite clearly aren't.</p>
<p>So it seems to be that you got more important things to do than trying to convince some random guy on the internet. </p>
<p>You should probably get the vaccine though.</p>

        <p>I must have skimmed over that part. And if you can't tell that was meant as a joke, I was probably right not to pay too much attention to what you had to say.</p>

<p>Your argument about your immune system being this perfect machine crafted through thousands of years of evolution that is going to work flawlessly if you just stay healthy and eat your vegetables is so laughably, childishly naïve that I couldn't help but smile while reading it.</p>
<p>I just think it's beautiful that someone who I assume is an adult could have gone through life and retain this worldview. I also think it's funny how you can accuse this guy of mixing up his medical terms without knowing that genetic epidemiology is a thing. </p>
<p>I just hope that you don't get colon cancer in case you try to cure it with an all fruit-based diet or something.</p>
<p>Simply put, a healthy lifestyle can make a world of difference, but it's not gonna make all the difference. Hereditary diseases are a thing. Underlying medical conditions that people might not know about is a thing. Age is a thing. And vaccines don't exist to protect just the healthiest among us but also the weakest.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't even know why people like you write comments like that. People who aren't paying attention might find it convincing, but just the slightest bit of critical thought will tell anyone how insane your position is.</p>

        <p>Quote my text where is said the immune system is "perfect".</p>
<p>You think "thousands of years of evolution" (your words) is the same as 500,000,000 (my words) of evolution...</p>
<p>Quote my text where I used the word "flawless".</p>
<p>&rt;eat your vegetables</p>
<p>Your logical fallacies just keep coming.</p>
<p>You obviously practice building strawmen quite a lot with the voices in your head.</p>
<p>&rt;but it's not gonna make all the difference</p>
<p>That's something the voices in your head told you to pull out of your ass.There is <strong><em>no</em></strong> scientific evidence to that effect.</p>
<p>If I thought you might have any chance of doing so, I'd recommend you try to start learning something about science, and try to start learning about what science knows about the human immune system.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately there does not seem to be any likelihood of you succeeding at any of that.</p>
<p>I also wish I could recommend that you try to learn the difference between marketing and science, but you've demonstrated numerous times in one single comment that you are grossly incapable of distinguishing extremely different things as being different at all.</p>
<p>&rt; just the slightest bit of critical thought will tell anyone how insane your position is.</p>
<p>I get it: a lot of people have told you that you're insane and that you should try starting to use even a little bit of critical thought, but you couldn't comprehend what that meant so you wanted to parrot what they said and project it onto me to see how I'd handle it, thinking you could simplemindedly parrot how I respond back when people say this to you in the future.  Unfortunately things don't work like that.  People have to actually learn for themselves, so you're simply shit out of luck.</p>

        <p>Good lord, you’re unreal! You’ve got all the keyboard warrior memes. Pseudo-intellectual nonsense, the debate bro informal fallacy terms you seem so eager to spit out you don’t bother to make sure they actually apply (here’s a tip mate, there’s a difference between strawmanning and being hyperbolic) and you’re still doing the “voices in your head” bit. </p>

        <p>See that's where we diverge.</p>
<p>Sweden had what I would call an absolutely acceptable death toll from covid 19. Sweden's yearly death toll from covid was at about 1100-1200 per million by years end 2020. For context, cancer kills 1920 per million every single year. Part of the absurdity with covid death tracking is that they did not reset the stats after a calendar year, so all of the death tolls you read about today actually represent 18 months of pandemic deaths and two winter seasons. We don't do that with any other illness, and it's dishonest to do it now with covid. </p>
<p>They are sitting somewhere like 27th in the world for deaths per million, below the USA, UK, and a bunch of other countries.</p>
<p>I think there is a huge misrepresentation in the media of the benefits of Lockdowns without an honest discussion about their negative results.</p>
<p>We saw this here in Canada and we've seen it elsewhere. I'm talking about seniors dying of loneliness, starvation and thirst... Which 100% happened and was explained in the Canadian military report on care homes in Quebec and Ontario. Those deaths were related to staff reductions caused both by the Lockdowns and other covid restrictions, and due to poor nursing home policies prior to covid.</p>
<p>We also don't take into account the massive increase in drug overdoses. For example 1700 people died in BC here of drug ODs in 2020. That was an increase from about 1100 the year before.... And only 900 people died of Covid. So we had 2x more people dying of drug overdoses than from covid. This is all just factual data.</p>
<p>This carries into other subjects as well, although we didn't see a sudden increase in Suicides, that doesn't mean we won't see an average increase over time. We know that unemployment leads to statistically relevant and measurable increases in suicide over a period of 1-5 years after job loss.... So this is something we will almost certainly see borne out in the numbers in any western nation that locked down and had significant unemployment increases.</p>
<p>You also have to have an honest conversation about the effect of mental health and happiness on overall physical health. Happy people live longer. It seems stupid but it's really true. A really simple and really possible reality is that one of the reasons that Swedes fared relatively better than their neighbours in the UK despite not having a full national lockdown, is that Sweden's population was less stressed, less depressed and less prone to symptomatic expression of covid 19 infection. Mix this with the fact that people in Sweden chose to voluntarily take many basic precautions, and you can make a pretty reasonable argument that by allowing people to continue to live their lives on their own terms, the immune health of the Swedish people was likely much improved compared to people in the UK suffering under the uncertainty of a full lock down. Depressed people have worse immune system markers, this is scientifically confirmed. We might not understand the mechanics, but we know it's a real thing.</p>
<p>As to vaccines, I'm less concerned about them... But there's a valid question in asking why we are making people under 30 take vaccines for covid when we have plenty of evidence showing that people in this demographic rarely get sick enough to be symptomatic, and when we know they are 55x less likely to die of covid than of the flu at that age range. In a normal year only 30% of people get a flu vaccine, so it's odd to me that there is 0 questioning about the benefit and need to vaccinate all people above the age of 12. There is some inherent risk in the new vaccines, J&amp;J and Astra blood clots specifically, but also heart swelling in youth from the MrNA vaccines as well. My stance isn't "no vaccines", but it's certainly "is there really a scientific basis that confirms vaccinating these young kids is actually necessary, or are we doing it because of social and political considerations?".</p>
<p>For context, I'm 31 and I took my shot - but really only because I need to travel to see my partner, and I know my government is shitty and will be forcing vaccine passports on us, so I had to do it for that consideration. Otherwise, I already had covid and I wasn't too concerned with my risk one way or the other.</p>

        <p>I feel kind of bad about ignoring respectful and well-thought replies like this while answering lunatics that are calling me a Nazi for thinking that private business should have the right to enforce their masks-on policy. </p>
<p>But the problem is that I'm not reading anything here that I fundamentally disagree with. The psychological health risks are real and should be taken into account. There are valid questions to be asked whether all age groups should be vaccinated and what the potential long term health effects of covid could be.</p>
<p>As for as I'm concerned, any disagreement we could have here would come down to numbers. Numbers and statics. </p>
<p>Sweden has had a much higher death toll than most of its neighboring Scandinavian countries. But more importantly, we've also seen the decease spread in retirement homes and our attempts to mitigate it and protect senior citizens have not been enough. </p>
<p>I also know that public health experts in Sweden has seen it fit to "lie" to the population when suitable. Early on, we were told that masks aren't particularly effective in combating the spread. Now we know that our public officials were worried about masks running out and creating an atmosphere of panic. </p>
<p>Give people the stats and the truth and allow them to make their own decisions.</p>

<p>What do you think the governments' intent then? A lot of people seem to believe they're not out to harm the population, that this is all the government "misinterpreting the data". Nevermind that they have access to way more information and context than we could ever have access to. So they knew the true "deadliness" of the virus, which was a nothingburger in the scheme of things yet they continue on with the charade that it is deadly and also mandating a rushed vaccine under very suspicious circumstances (mass propaganda campaigns, million dollar giveaways, etc).</p>
