    <strong>New normal and transhumanism</strong>
    <p><p>Transhumanism is movement that advocates for the developing  technologies to ehance human intellect and physiology. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism</a></p>
<p>In USA there's actually a Transhumanist Party. This is a section from their 2020 platform </p>
<p><em>The United States Transhumanist Party advocates for an immediate  allowance for remote learning to satisfy the completion or graduation  requirements of all K-12 schools and all publicly funded colleges and  universities indefinitely going forward.</em> <strong><em>Not only is physical proximity  not necessary for effective learning in light of rapidly advancing  technologies allowing immersive interaction at a distance, but the  encouragement of remote learning also allows individuals more  flexibility in advancing at their own pace and focusing on subjects and  skill sets which result in the greatest fulfillment and most improved  life prospects.</em></strong> <em>The United States Transhumanist Party advocates for the  maximal adoption of diverse homeschooling approaches throughout the  United States, suited to the individual aptitudes, preferences, and  learning styles of students.</em></p>
<p><em>The United States Transhumanist Party also supports refocusing the  education system on producing the goods and services necessary to  maintain United States independence, including vocational studies in  electricity, metalwork, ceramics, auto mechanics, graphic arts, and  coding in the classroom.</em></p>

<p>As we see they don't treat remote learning as a temporary lesser evil, but as a future we should all pursue.</p>
<p>This party is not influential at all, but mere ideology of Transhumanism is. It seems that all the big tech guys flirt with the idea of unrestrained technological development on the pursuit of the "new brave world". Open transhumanist Raymond Kurzweil is employed by Google as their director of engineering and is a popular speaker at conferences such as DEMO, SXSW and TED. </p>

<p>It's also worth of mentioning that Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York cooperated with Gates Foundation on "Reimagine Education" project, when he infamously said that with current technogolical advancements traditional education is obsolete.</p>

<p>In this article Naomi Klein notices worrying consequences of the cooperation between elites of government and big tech tycoons.</p>

<p>It's clear to me that these rich assholes work with governments now to push their view of the world with screen addicted population without real life interaction.</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m all for vocation schools and trades like electricians, plumbers, etc. I have family in these trades and they are honest good people. However how the hell do they teach someone these things only online? Most people who do these things for a living have to actually leave their houses. Also a lot of this means watching and learning through doing.</p>
