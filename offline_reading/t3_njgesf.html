    <strong>Don't Wear Your Mask, Until You Are Told To. This Has Worked For Me A lot of Times and It Will Attract Genuine People Towards You.</strong>
    <p><p>So, living in the province of Onterrible, this province is screwed, in fact this whole country is. That's No question. We all know this. But since the beginning of this plandemic, I have tried My best to not wear these masks in stores etc. And it has worked in some places. If you walk in without a mask whether it's at these gas stations etc and you do what you gotta do, most employees dgaf. Fuck these masks. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that they don't do shi anyway, so I personally dgaf. I have gotten permanently banned LOL from a few stores in the beginning for not complying even after I was told to. So, I decided only to wear a mask if I'm told to repeatedly. I have gotten very crazy looks by the doomers, but also lots of respect from people like Us. </p>
<p>The other day I was at 7/11 doing My thing without a mask of course. Some Indian guys work there so they are very chill. And, a guy comes up to Me and is like, "I like how you have the guts to not wear a mask" etc and starts praising Me. So, all I tell him is, "Do what you have to do. This life is too fucking short to follow others. Live for yourself and live free." That's all I tell him and then he ask for My phone number and is like we need to chill sometime. </p>
<p>Anyways the lesson that I learned is, follow what you believe in. Never sacrifice your values, principles and self respect for anyone and then you will attract genuine people like you, and they will follow your lead. There are more people are like us, but they don't have the balls and guts to act upon what they truly believe in. Do what you have to do and you will attract people like you.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I walked into a supermarket today and I was the only one without a mask on. Not one person told me to put it on, not even the security guard at the front door.</p>
<p>I could see everyone looking at me and I simply smiled and acted pleasant, got my things, paid the cashier and walked out without an issue.</p>

        <p>Just did the exact same not even 30 minutes ago at a harbor freight store. Did the same during my past several visits to home depot the past few days. I doubt they want to harass paying customers and tbh I get more looks from other customers than employees. Hoping they look at me as a courageous person and how silly it makes them feel haha but who knows since masks block body language.</p>

        <p>There’s a small family owned store that is near where I live, they don’t get much business. I stopped in the other day because I needed some bottled water, and the store was on my route. </p>
<p>The owner was the one who was checking, and he told me that he couldn’t serve me if I wasn’t masked. I told him that I’d spend my money elsewhere, and started walking out. I made it to the door and he told me to come back... we ended up having a very long winded conversation about how much he hates mask mandates, and how the pandemic has pretty much fucked his life over financially. I plan on stopping by his shop more often now that I know his opinions on the matter.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this for a couple of weeks now and it feels pretty good. I'm mad at myself that I didn't ditch the mask sooner lol. I've only had one business ask me to put one on. We were out with some ladies from my church going to antique stores. Normally I would have just walked out, but I didn't want to cause a stink in front of the women I was with so I opted not to buy anything from their store instead. But I've been to the grocery store, bowling, out to restaurants, etc without one and it's been so great!</p>

        <p>I've done this often throughout the entire year. Several times people look at me then pull their own masks down/off. </p>
<p>One day a man at the grocery store approached and nearly started crying as he told me I was his hero 😂 </p>
<p>He asked for a hand shake and then a hug. It was so genuine and wholesome.</p>

        <p>I think that's a good rule of thumb for those who aren't sure what to do doing this gray area period. Most are "playing it safe" and that's why we are seeing too many. Yes, sometimes you don't feel like dealing with shit, but you will feel better about yourself that you didn't comply afterwards.</p>
