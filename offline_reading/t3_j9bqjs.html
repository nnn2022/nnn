    <strong>Being a leftist anti-lockdown-er!</strong>
    <p><p>Wondering if there are more of us out here? </p>
<p>I‚Äôm 24F, live in Canada, and have voted NDP the past 2 elections, I‚Äôm pretty much the stereotype for ‚Äúspecial snowflake‚Äù- though I don‚Äôt dye my hair purple or green or whatever just because I like my natural color. I‚Äôm bisexual, pro-choice, pro separation of church and state, BLM all the way, higher taxes, free healthcare and free college, you all know the drill- and I‚Äôm a bit disheartened that many of my friends who share similar beliefs are... really into the whole masking and lockdown thing? Trying to get into discussions about the politics of COVID policies with other people kind of... outside my circle I guess, maybe 80% of the time leads to a lot of unnecessary arguments- like if I say to someone, dude, I‚Äôm on you side, this lockdown is ridiculous, they‚Äôll start with some bull about how Trump is going to save us all from the demonic vaccines which will turn us into ‚Äútransgendereds‚Äù or something else I really don‚Äôt want to engage with. I‚Äôm not interested in hearing about people‚Äôs faith and have no idea why people seem to think being anti lockdown MUST only be for conservatives?</p>
<p>I know most ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and liberal people are very pro lockdown- under the guise of ‚Äúcaring for others‚Äù and protecting the vulnerable- but actually- lockdowns destroy the infrastructure that we DO have to protect our most vulnerable, it has increased the wealth and knowledge gaps, been extremely detrimental to public schools and public health initiatives, and made it difficult if not impossible for low and middle income people to participate in public life. The negative impacts of these policies MOST affects people of color, women, single parents, and LGBTQ people- because these are the people for whom community care (non governmental help in addition to public aid) made the most difference. As well, the cost of mental health impacts will be especially insurmountable in single-payer health care countries- since the treatments for mental illness dont just include ‚Äúcounselling‚Äù or cheap drugs- but given the age of onset of severe mental disorders, the crisis that popular culture and media seem to want to force us into- can also create decades of extreme expense which will be placed on the tax burden of citizens, when we already are struggling to make ends meet. Heavy warehouse and factory production as well as heavy home resource use have been shown to be among the biggest contributors to climate change- in addition to the fossil fuels used by vehicles which we‚Äôre all now mandated to sit an idle in pretty much everywhere. If this isn‚Äôt enough- the elastics from disposable masks have actually killed and maimed enough animals that it‚Äôs comparable to plastic waste and straws. Yes, really...</p>
<p>As a totally stereotypical ‚Äúlibtard‚Äù- I just don‚Äôt know why anyone who claims to share my beliefs can support extending lockdown. </p>
<p>If you care about the environment, sustaining lockdown will only make that situation worse and possibly accelerate it if lockdowns are kept in place in countries like China, India, USA, which are already the biggest contributors. If you care about women, then please understand that cutting people off from their communities has led to a historic rise in domestic abuse AND in situations where domestic abuse isn‚Äôt a factor- women are disproportionately caretakers in their families, whether in single parent or two parent, multigenerational, heterosexual or otherwise relationships- there has been a tremendous burden placed on women- which affects their mental and physical health, and could affect pregnancies, as well as these home environments. As well, women make up a large number of workers who have been disproportionately affected- such as teachers, small business owners (YES, many women own small businesses such as boutiques, salons, self-employment, hell even Etsy), and minimum wage workers are mostly women, as well as most University students are women. There‚Äôs almost no aspect of life that hasn‚Äôt been disrupted severely which affects women the most- whether this is access to healthcare, family, children, school or work. If you care about the LGBTQ community- then you should know that lockdowns have resulted in a rise in suicides, overdoses, and lack of comprehensive health care being provided especially for Trans and NB people. Community care and community initiatives are among the most crucial things within the LGBTQ community- as well, because so many of us work in industries not expected to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù, such as service, arts, personal care, many people have lost their savings and future in this ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù and have no recourse to get that back. At home healthcare and telehealth can be extremely unsafe for LGBTQ people, too but like- people are all so quiet. </p>
<p>So in conclusion if you truly care about other people AND our planet, you‚Äôll know that lockdowns are killing all of us and especially the people you claim to want to help the most üôÑüôÑüôÑ</p></p>

        <p>I have been really fascinated by the whole political divide myself.</p>
<p>I am a conservative, pro-trump (but I am not an extremist or anything. I am not racist, I am pro-choice, probably more of a moderate really) but I am ANTI LOCKDOWN! </p>
<p>I have a pole and aerial studio in a downtown, college area. Most of my students go to the University. Mostly liberals, we have a TON of LGBTQ+ students, lots of gays/bi/gender fluid, over half are POC, etc. </p>
<p>They are 75% still in lockdown, wearing masks in their profile pics, etc. in fact, since we have been allowed to re-open, most of them still have yet to return. </p>
<p>I just got a text last night from one of my students (still in lockdown) asking me to do some promotions in support of Biden, so that we could ‚Äúend the lockdowns‚Äù once he is president. 
I almost feel like people are so gung-ho for all of these dystopian lockdown measures as a big ‚ÄúF You!‚Äù To trump. </p>
<p>It can‚Äôt be though, right? Its like cutting off your nose to spite your face.  </p>
<p>But, then I also see in all of my local coronavirus subs, constant political references. Its just so widely assumed that if you ‚Äútake the virus seriously‚Äù then you are a liberal. It‚Äôs flabbergasting how people show their political ‚Äúfaith‚Äù by choosing to lockdown and mask up.
It‚Äôs like their party is more important to them then the common good of their communities and even their families. </p>
<p>Sorry, didnt mean to go off on a rant, but I just can‚Äôt believe the craziness of it all.</p>

        <p>So lockdowns now are necessary.  But if Biden is elected, the virus will magically disappear and lockdowns can end?</p>

        <p>I'm also a leftist lockdown-skeptical.</p>
<p>I'm a leftist because of I'm pro universal healthcare and education, services for disabled and elderly, pro-LGBT+ rights, separation between church and state, and so on. But I'm pro-contraceptives and more right-leaning on the pro-life vs pro-choice issues.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm lockdown skeptical because of I think it's affecting people's economy and mental health negatively. Humans are dependent on socializing, going outside and new environments to functional and for their well being.  I don't think it's healthy to force healthy people to stay inside, everyone wearing masks and seeing everyone as a potential threat. The virus isn't as deadly and dangerous as first thought.</p>
<p>I think it's possible to be mostly left or right supporter without being agree with your party in everything. I'm a leftie, but I'm lockdown skeptical, hope Trump survives COVID19 and successfully recover - although I don't want him as president. I don't like Biden either who's a leftie by US standards. Normally I'm mostly Bernie Sanders supporter. Since I'm not American, I vote an equivalent in my country.</p>

        <p>Honestly, the list of political convictions you listed leads to this inevitably, that is the argument I've been making for years as a libertarian. I feel pretty vindicated, but it's no fun to watch. I used to be a serious socialist, I would just recommend analyzing the role of state authority in your system, and you might recognize that there is no option but subjugation under expanding government. This is the first time you've been this averse to it, but it's always happening.</p>

        <p>Yep theres a reason they say many become conservative as they grow older.  Op probably never had what she considers important impacted by the goverment but covid is showing her it can.</p>
<p>Not saying op will be conservative soon but generally speaking  once someone starts noticing the downsides of big goverment on freedoms, its generally a road to becoming a coservative afterwards</p>

        <p>Well written :) I am glad there are people like you on the planet :) Our political opinions differ, yet we share the same love for this beautiful planet. Being the anarchist I am, I find "right wingers" to be the best current solution for the planet because of their opposition to globalism, regardless of their motivation. While "leftists" are motivated by doing good, they fail to see the bigger picture and that the civilization they are trying to repair is actually  toxic. I have to make a distinction between "conservatives" and "right wingers" here as the former are the real evil, driving a murderous economy at all costs. "Right wingers" to me, while potentially sharing similar values with the conservatives, stay in their own backyard and while being overprotective, are not expansionist.
Anyway, politics aside, I completely understand how you feel. I was once baffled to find out that many outstanding environmentalists were meat eaters. Go figure. :D I hope that we activists learn how to unite over what holds us together rather than to get divided over our differences :)</p>

        <p>I'm apolitical, but more of my beliefs steer towards conservative.</p>
<p>That said, I'm for separation of church and state. Most religions are heavily involved with politics for THEIR benefit, rather than the real goal, which should be to serve God.</p>
<p>The number of people that believe the way you do may be small, but no doubt they exist. With 7.5 billion or so people in the world, you can bet there are 7.5 billion different opinions, personalities, and ways of thinking.</p>

        <p>The worst thing about this pandemic is seeing people politicise it</p>
<p>In an ideal world (that could never exist in reality sadly) those in power would listen to the science and follow its instructions to the letter. <br>
Maybe even say "look, this is awful, we're going to let the Doctors lead us for the time being until this is dealt with"</p>
<p>But that hasn't happened and you get all kinds of takes that run across or against party lines</p>
<p>Yes, lockdowns are hard on those with mental health problems. I feel sorry for the animals who are dealing with the elastic from masks and whatever other secondary problems lockdowns cause. <br>
The point is to get those people with MHP to a point when they can be dealt with post-lockdown. Because getting COVID is not going to do their mental health any good either.   </p>
<p>People will have to adapt, because the alternative is carrying on like normal and letting the virus take down way more people that it has already. <br>
And that will be a lot worse for all our mental healths as we'll all lose people we love and be devestating for various communities as there'll be a lot less people in them when it's all over.   </p>
<p>Whatever it takes, get through this. But do it properly, with masks and social distancing, and lock down if your countries government deems it necessary. It's the only way we can win</p>

        <p>i know 2 people personally that have committed suicide from the lockdowns, and 0 people that have gotten any serious symptoms, let alone died from this infamous coronavirus. my dad is over 60 years old and he couldn‚Äôt give less of a shit. we never wore masks and went out 5 days a week during the summer, neither of us suffered from it. </p>
<p>it‚Äôs supposedly the deadliest virus that has ever existed but i have to get tested to differentiate it from a common cold. you don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that? you‚Äôre more afraid of a fucking cold than you are of suicides, overdoses, the collapsing economy, starvation and the rapid increase of mental issues around the world? not everyone can just ‚Äòstay home‚Äô in a cozy apartment ordering Uber Eats everyday.</p>
<p>i don‚Äôt like how you think this is only bad for people with mental issues when isolating from others is what causes mental problems. it‚Äôs actually a torture method.</p>
<p>i wasn‚Äôt a suicidal antisocial hermit until the people in power made their genius decision to lock down the entire fucking country and turn people into schizophrenics afraid of their own bodies. if refusing to live my life sitting in a room in isolation for months without a deadline makes ME the crazy one, then i guess i‚Äôll get used to the title.</p>

        <p>Having covid was the least of my troubles when I was trying to figure out how to avoid being homless and living off instant noodles. Literally a mild cold. Most people wouldn't have noticed they even had it, let alone know someone who died. This is according to statistics, not my personal feelings. Why would we hand over all power to a doctor to make healthcare and financial decisions for every person as if all viewpoints don't matter? That is politicizing it. There are experts in other fields who have shown that far more people will die or suffer long-term health consequences of poverty side effects caused by lockdowns. </p>
<p>But anyways, OP, I am in the same boat. I expected the right to be more authoritarian. The riot and protest responses were worrying, but I also thought it would make people see how silly they were being. However, they just come up with some mental gymnastics and a news headline that justifies their hypocrisy to continue the clickbaiting and dig in deeper. I think it's all refusal to come to the middle on the part of liberals. </p>
<p>I always knew that environmental policy is mostly politicized though. Politicians always benefit from what they're pushing, at least in the US. They don't really care about the environment or the public. Capitalists don't care either, but might if their customers do. I think individuals can make an impact by changing their lifestyle and being less consumerist, but there's so many factors involved that it can be difficult to actually know what helps the most. Of course, the environment won't improve until governments change too, and I don't mean by implementing restrictions on regular citizens. Mostly military and mining pollution and waste of tax dollars in bureaucracies.</p>
