    <strong>What exactly do you guys want?</strong>
    <p><p>You guys really want to the world to go back to normal with the pandemic going on? Y’all would be cool with that even if cases spiked, hospitals overflowed and the death toll skyrocketed?</p>
<p>What sort of COVID precautions would y’all want to put in?</p></p>

        <p>We get several posts here every single day, similar to yours. Posts that are solely just "fuck u all ur all dumb lol" by people who bring zero talking points to the table and have zero intention of having an actual discussion about anything. It gets old.</p>
<p>Have you also seen all the completely uncivil and intolerant comments and posts on other subs directed towards anyone who even slightly disagrees with all the restrictions being put in place?</p>

        <p>&rt;Bro I’m only responsible for what I say and I do.</p>
<p>Of course, I was just stating how the reverse is very true as well, and how we get quite incendiary posts all the time here, so people are naturally going to be more dismissive and hostile when yet another similar post comes in.</p>
<p>&rt;When I just ask a simple question</p>
<p>It's a "simple question" that's asked 24/7 and a question that's often quite loaded.</p>
<p>&rt;you’re reaction is a knee jerk, Go FuCk YoUrSeLf.</p>
<p>I should hope you aren't directing that my way.</p>
<p>&rt;Pretty much tells me all I need to know.</p>
<p>Again, go to essentially any other sub and make a post about how you're even a little skeptical of all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns thst have been placed upon everyone. Watch how fast you get the same response, but way more hostile. Come in with an open mind and not asking loaded questions, and legitimately wanting to have a rational discussion, and you'll find plenty of people who would gladly and openly engage with you.</p>

        <p>Yeah I ask a simple question 24/7. I’m like a Mormon missionary, but instead of going door to door telling people about how Jesus was in New York I ask them about how anti-maskers would like to combat the pandemic. Brilliant observation. </p>

        <p>&rt;Yeah I ask a simple question 24/7.</p>
<p>I never said that it's you specifically that asks the question 24/7. You did ask it, but so do many, many others at different times, making it so the question is asked all the time.</p>
<p>&rt;I ask them about how anti-maskers would like to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>You asked that after insisting on talking down to us and trying to make it seem as though we don't at all care about others.</p>
<p>&rt;By the way I’ve already tried to gage you in civil conversation. How would you want me to phrase my questions?</p>
<p>I'm not saying you aren't civil when talking with specifically me, and I don't particularly have an issue with your replies to me. My issue is with the post. I'm just saying that you clearly came in here with your mind made up and with an agenda, then proceeded to make a post that tried to subtly insult everyone here. Then ask a largely rhetorical question - a question that's asked daily, mostly by people who insist on being assholes - so don't be surprised if you're met with some hostility. That's all.</p>

        <p>I want the clinically vulnerable to be shielded and the rest of us who have minimal medical risk to continue our lives. This will save tens of millions of lives from starvation, missed medical procedures (including vaccination), and the generational effects of poverty and malnutrition. However, because <em>they</em> aren't affected by any of these things - at least they don't think they are... - people who want general lockdowns don't care. Tens of millions dead so they <em>feel</em> safe is a price they're willing to pay. Then they have the nerve to call us selfish. It's sad, really.</p>
<p>&rt;hospitals overflowed</p>
<p>If hospitals aren't well-funded enough that they can't handle a pandemic - a bit like a building that can't handle a fire - the people you want to speak to are tax-dodgers in large companies like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. Not Mr. and Mrs. Smith just trying to open their corner store so they can eat.</p>

<p>Yes, because clearly all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns aren't working. The "cure" is much worse than the virus itself, at this point.</p>
<p>&rt;even if cases spiked, hospitals overflowed and the death toll skyrocketed?</p>
<p>As opposed to tanking the economy, and seeing massive spikes in unemployment, home loss, poverty, starvation, terrible education, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide (just for starters)? All because someone may possibly catch this virus and maybe kinda sorta perhaps has the mere risk of being harmed? Yes.</p>
<p>&rt;What sort of COVID precautions would y’all want to put in?</p>
<p>Personal ones. Ya know, basic personal responsibility. Crazy, right? If you're so terrified and paranoid of this weak as fuck virus, simply stay home. It's easier than ever to do so. Meanwhile, whoever wants to "take the risk" of going outside and even living a halfway normal life, can feel free to do so. Protect the vulnerable, take whatever personal precautions you need to in order to feel safe, and let people live their lives.</p>

        <p>Sweden is doing great, so is florida.  California, not so much.</p>
<p>Since the masks and lockdowns aren't having any impact on pcr positives or what we count as deaths, why are they still in place?</p>
<p>I assure you, no one here wants anyone to die unnecessarily, but even ift he precautions worked, they need to be balanced against their impacts.  With increased suicides, drug overdoses, abuse cases, missed cancer screenings and vaccinations, spoiled education, increased poverty, hunger, homelessness, etc., it's not worth the cost.</p>
<p>We want to save lives, that's really the focus.</p>
