        <p>1) No, however it will greatly decrease the amount of time the virus is in your body, decreasing your chances of getting ill or dying, and decreasing the chances of you spreading it to other people.
2) Already answered this above.
3) The vaccine only remains in your body for 6 weeks, by which time your immune system will be able to recognise the virus if it enters your body. The vaccine has been available for months, so most long term effects will have already been discovered, provided that there even are any.
4) Unfortunately so. I am sorry for the friends and relatives of people who have died due to the vaccine, but know that it is extremely uncommon.
5) No, but, as I said before, the side effects aren't going to affect most people, and death due to the vaccine is very uncommon.</p>
<p>I'm probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but if it makes one person listen and actually learn basic biology again, it's worth it.</p>

        <p>It's also extremely uncommon for young healthy people to suffer any severe consequences from covid. So why would you expect these people to put themselves at definite risk, no matter how small, by taking this experimental vaccine over close to zero risk from the virus it is meant to protect against, and that is assuming you haven't already had it and aren't already immune.</p>

        <p>I covered this in point 1. The vaccine isn't just to protect yourself from the virus, but also people around you. If you've had the vaccine, you are drastically lowering the amount of time the virus stays within your body, if you ever catch it again. No, young people do not suffer as much as older people, but vaccinating as many people as possible will ensure that the virus is less likely to spread to people who are at a greater risk of dying.</p>

        <p>Turns out whoever made this chart didn‚Äôt pay attention in 3rd grade</p>
<p>Vaccines prevent diseases</p>
<p>Though it won‚Äôt stop the spread, if everyone is immune that point is moot</p>
<p>True, it hasn‚Äôt been tested long term, but you can simply wait for one that has been tested if you‚Äôre that much of a whiny child about it</p>

        <p>If it stops you from getting and spreading covid, why should I as a young adult be coerced into getting it? Why are people so concerned about every other individual? Also, there is no proof that there is no long term effects from the vaccine. In fact there‚Äôs this study  https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/</p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs only one study but let‚Äôs not act like the question of long term effects is crazy</p>

<p>Because it sucks getting sick, even if you wont die why do you want to be stuck at home feeling like shit? Also it adds to something called herd immunity, if enough people are vaccinated or have natural immunity the virus can't effectively spread in the community. This is how we got rid of illnesses like Measles, Polio, and Small Pox in the US. Of course you can get the virus and get immunity that way but again getting sick sucks so why do you want to when you can take the vaccine instead.... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That study is talking about the ACTUAL VIRUS, the spike protein is completely USELESS on its own. All the spike protein does is allow the virus to trick our cells into letting it in, without the other parts of the virus a chain of infection can't start so the bad things that study talks about can't happen! This isn't the first vaccine where we used a part of a virus to create a vaccine, in fact the Hep B and HPV vaccine works this way, they take part of the DNA that codes for the Help C/HPV spike protein and have yeast produce that spike protein so it can be injected. The COVID vaccines just skip that step, they directly give your cells MRNA so your cells can read that RNA and make the spike protein itself. This doesn't cause any issues, it can't change your DNA, at worst the immune system will detect something wonky with the cell and order it to commit suicide so it can be replaced by a new cell which happens all the time, in fact this is why we have something called an incubation period, our immune system is so good at keeping the virus under control that we don't get ill until the viruses speed of replication out paces our immune system. I recommend you watch this video, it's for measles but alot of it applies to coronavirus (specifically how the immune system attacks viruses): https://youtu.be/y0opgc1WoS4</p>

<p>Of course it sucks getting sick but I‚Äôm not going to take something I‚Äôm not comfortable with so I don‚Äôt maybe get sick for a few days. We‚Äôre already at herd immunity and have been. It‚Äôs been obvious if you look at both the numbers of vaccinated and natural infections and the charts of the virus peaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs talking about the ACTUAL VIRUS AND THE SPIKE PROTEIN IN THE VACCINE. That‚Äôs the problem with the spike protein. It jumps the first line of defense your immune system. There are no long term studies on it</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>‚ÄúPrevious studies have shown a similar effect when cells were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but this is the first study to show that the damage occurs when cells are exposed to the spike protein on its own.‚Äù</p>

<p>No we aren't, infections come in waves and until we skip a wave we can't say we are at herd immunity for sure, see India as an example. Though right now because of vaccinations and previous infections we are in a MUCH better place than last year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again the spike protein can't do ANYTHING without the rest of the virus! How viruses work is they emulate something our cells need to function so it can trick them into letting it inside (this is what the spike protein does). The second part is once inside the cell the virus releases it's genetic material so our cells can read it and turn into virus factories (this is how viruses reproduce, they can't do anything on their own, this is why they aren't considered living). With just the spike protein that second part CANT happen so a chain reaction of infection won't start!</p>

<p>We are at herd immunity. India is another panic porner from the media</p>

<p>There are no long term studies done on the vaccine and it‚Äôs not fda approved thus I have no interest as a young adult in getting it. Also your argument about not wanting to be sick is flawed because the vaccine can make you very sick even if it‚Äôs only for 1 to 2 days. And that‚Äôs via an injection</p>

<p>We very well could be but again we don't know for sure. It depends on how many people have had the infection in the past and we don't have an exact number for that. Better than safe than sorry especially when the vaccine doesn't destroy the economy like masks and distancing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does there need to be? The MRNA vaccines are just a piece of RNA and fat both things that we know the effects of. Also during the development of MRNA tech they had a very hard time getting the vaccine to even stay around long enough so it could actually work, I doubt anything from it could be sticking around for decades in the body when they had a hard time getting it to last minutes... Also the beauty of MRNA vaccines is they don't need adjuvants like aluminum which makes them even LESS likely to cause "long term effects" The J&amp;J, Astrazenika, and Sputnik V vaccines are a bit more unknown since they use a viral vector but the solution to that is simple: don't take those vaccines if you arent comfortable with them. Also it's not guaranteed you get side effects from the vaccine, I had both shots of Moderna and the only side effect I had was a sore arm for a day or two, I didn't have any of the other side effects. Unlike the vaccine it's pretty much guaranteed the virus will make you feel like shit...</p>

        <p>This is again not true. A lot of people who get the virus don‚Äôt have any symptoms and feel like they have a cold. </p>
<p>Because it‚Äôs a non FDA approved product that hasn‚Äôt been mass tested on humans ever. There is no long term data proof.</p>

<p>Having a cold IS a symptom!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again we know the function of MRNA and lipids (what's in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). I swear you "we don't know the long term effects" people are just as bad as the "we don't know" COVID people, you ignore decades of research and say "well we don't REALLY know". Yes decades, THATS HOW LONG MRNA TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT!</p>
