    <strong>My government actually put in a good (albeit imperfect) COVID prevention policy.</strong>
    <p><p>Tonight, when it was expected that we’d go back into a second lockdown, the U.K. government announced a policy to fine people who break self-isolation instead. I know some people will bawk at the way I’ve phrased that, but if you read through it, I genuinely think it’s a positive step, especially as I was fearing a second lockdown and if these are the kinds of policies we’re now implementing then it definitely alleviates that fear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54221953">People who test positive and break self-isolation will receive fines of £1,000-£10,000 (but no more, there’s no being dragged off to camps or having your children taken away like we see in some other countries). To balance this out, they will be paid £1,000 over the two weeks they need to self-isolate.</a></p>
<p>Why is it a good COVID policy? Because it only affects people who have COVID and reinforces something 99% of people would gladly do anyway. Not only do you get paid an amount higher than the monthly minimum wage for doing it, you won’t be fined if your employer forces you back into work, <em>they will be</em>, although it still give them the freedom to carry on operating or hire emergency staff.</p>
<p>This is what lockdowns should have been from the very beginning: isolate the sick and, using the taxpayer money that would end up being spent on billion pound furlough schemes, pay them to stay isolated. It’s painful that this comes after the Rule of Six and curfews in many parts of the country, and I’d rather not have someone who has been tracked and traced get forced to self-isolate without testing positive (it’s still unclear how that works, whether you have to do the two weeks or simply until you can get a mobile test if you’re negative), but if those parts were scrapped, we’d have come upon a perfect compromise.</p></p>

        <p>Don't agree with any new measures and just because they have introduced this doesn't mean more lockdowns and idiotic rules aren't coming down the line. It does justify my decision to always give false details when required to fill in track and trace forms though and I hope the vast majority of people do the same.  Do that and don't ever get tested and this legislation is meaningless to you.</p>

        <p>Cautious hope is always good as long as you're OK with being disappointed.  To be honest I'm not really sure how they would enforce this anyway, do they station a policeman outside your house when they ask you to isolate, if not, why would you be stopped when out on the street and how would they know you are meant to be self isolating, it's not like they put a tracker on you.</p>

        <p>It’s explained in the article that they call you every few days to check if you’ve been self-isolating. That’s it.</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s not at all foolproof, they’re just relying on at least one person in your circle being a snitch or them hearing the sound of you walking in a busy area when they call.</p>

        <p>Aren't a lot of people in self isolation because they are contacts or are returning from abroad? So they are not necessarily positive like you claimed. The UK gov is extremely idiotic and I have no idea how they plan to reverse this.</p>

        <p>Dude. Any fines related to covid are bad. Fines for employers are even worse because as hard as it is for people to realize, they trickle down hard and have huge effects on decisions and hiring etc. No no no. Fuck this.</p>

        <p>People who have COVID. So sick people? Or just people who have tested positive and have no symptoms?</p>
<p>Though I do agree there are alternative measures we could have taken instead of spending trillions of dollars that would have been both more effective and a hell of a lot cheaper.</p>
