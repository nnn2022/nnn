    <strong>German microbiologist Professor Sucharit Bhakdi has continually sounded the alarm, most recently about covid vaccination blood clots</strong>
    <p><p>This is yet another world renowned highly qualified and credentialed expert that has been ignored, censored and smeared for expressing "wrong" opinions since the start of this deranged clown show. I've seen him appear in a number of interviews, so I'm just going to link a few of them here, the most recent ones are where he goes deep into the blood clot issue and are highly informative and interesting.</p>

        <p>Tell it to the Brits. They keep crying that EU is just being a petty bully for suspending AstraZeneca because of the blood cloths. They say EU is just doing it as revenge for Brexit and that their vaccine is perfectly fine.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Dr. Bhakdi was one of the dissident experts I used in my unsuccessful attempts to wake up my family.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm sure he doesn't count and he's just a "quack" and a "conspiracy theorist," unlike that saintly, selfless public servant (even in jest, I gagged typing this) "Dr." Fraudci and his Mockingbird-driven personality cult.</p>
