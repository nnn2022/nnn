    <strong>My email to Goodwill. Their email address is Goodwill.org. Tell them what you think about their "no exception" mask policy.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear Sir/ Madam:</p>
<p>I am very disappointed that your company policy is to not honor medical exemptions for mask usage. Every other place of business understands &amp; honors the Americans With Disabilities Act. Your company, which claims to help people with disabilities, are completely hypocritical. For example, people with Autism (which falls under the catagory of developmental disabilities) sometimes have sensory issues, which a mask could trigger in some individuals. You are telling those people they cant shop there while claiming to be inclusive. I understand your bottom line will be affected if you don't show your submission, but your hurting your reputation. </p>
<p>I, myself have asthma. I struggle to breath much of the time without a mask. My medical issue is worsened by air temperature within a mask, as well as air flow. One of your employees asked me for a doctor's excuse when I didn't have a mask on, which I wish I would have got on recording. I do not need to provide proof of my medical condition, especially when I'm openly using an inhaler in the store.</p>
<p>I am so upset with your establishment. I really hope you will do better, before someone has a medical emergency in your store and you are on the hook for it. </p></p>
