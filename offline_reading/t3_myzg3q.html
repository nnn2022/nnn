        <p>So I take it you’ve never had a mental health issue and had episodes. It is irreversible but when going through the episode, it’s hard to calm down and not do anything silly. Where as not getting the vaccine in the first place, wouldn’t have menstrual irregularities.</p>

        <p>“The only way to avoid menstrual irregularities caused from the vaccine is to not have the vaccine in the first place. Simple?” People can still contract and transmit the virus, and still have to social distance, wear masks. So if it’s so SAFE and EFFECTIVE, why do the producers have no liability, why are we seeing reports of menstrual changes, why are we seeing women have miscarriages, or severe reactions?</p>

        <p>That sucks and I’m not trying to downplay it, but maybe your fixation on that one aspect is why you are having trouble understanding the original analogy at hand. </p>
<p>I suppose you’re saying we should blame those that got vaccinated because they had a choice not to get it whereas generally speaking those that are suicidal presumably had no choice in the events leading up to it. However, I would still argue that there were potential events leading up to your episode that could have potentially played out differently just like there are countless people being brainwashed into taking the vaccine without a 2nd thought. Sometimes it’s not reasonable to expect people can think through every event leading up to a bad situation.</p>
<p>The point is the people pushing the vaccine can reasonably think ahead and are choosing not to just like how now we have things like suicide hotlines in place to help people that have not yet already killed themselves instead of only making them accessible to the people who “really need it” and have already killed themselves, because then it’s too late, just like someone that has already been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>People have been so conditioned to be scared of this virus that they are getting cardiac arrest on the first dose of the vaccination and STILL want the 2nd dose. There are many ways to break people, locking them up for a year and telling them they can have freedom if they just get this shot sounds pretty good to those people.</p>
<p>I never used to understand Nazi Germany and always thought never again was a stupid statement because obviously it will never happen again, but somehow here we are again, half the population brainwashed into thinking anyone that doesn’t get the vaccine is preventing their freedom, just like when the Jews were being blamed for everything. Obviously how this story ends remains to be seen, and there’s a chance for things to shape up differently, especially with such a similar event happening recently, but I think it’s good to not think too harshly of others when they have different weaknesses.</p>

        <p>So personal story time. My parents got vaccinated last week, I’m around them everyday. My period started like normal last week, and ended like normal 6 days later (so I thought). 2 days after “ending”, I’m slightly bleeding again. This has never happened for almost the 20 years I’ve had a period. When it stops, it stops. Coincidence or what, I don’t know but this is definitely not normal. I haven’t changed any diet habits or anything during this.</p>

        <p>Anyone know how they plan to “study” this? </p>
<p>From what I understand, during clinical trials the safety rate of a vaccine is determined by how many reports of adverse events there in the vaccinated group vs. the control group. In addition, the point of VAERS is to further track adverse events once released to the public. VAERS reports relating to the COVID vaccines are over 80k (likely 90k-100k now, been awhile since the numbers were updated...at least 1% of the vaccinated population, and that doesn’t account for unreported adverse events) yet that doesn’t seem to be cause to pull the vaccines for further “safety research”? How high does the number need to get for them to acknowledge the initial safety claim may not be accurate?</p>
