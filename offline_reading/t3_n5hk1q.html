        <p>You can hear the pain. God I feel for the kids the most. Adults will just drink, smoke, eat, fuck, gamble the pain away but what can kids do?? They're trapped.</p>

        <p>I had a friend talk to her therapist about going to an eating disorder clinic and her therapist had told her all the ED clinics are completely filled up right now with a bunch of 9-13 year olds.. they got nothing else to numb the pain except for ways that they have control over... such as food and purposeful starvation. How fucking sad.</p>

        <p>Jesus christ that's horrific. First off do adults not see what they're doing to the kids??? The masks alone are horrible for development. The lockdowns are horrible we need to socialize as humans.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm in my first year of high school. I had my first ‚Äúfull week‚Äù 4 weeks ago. I don‚Äôt have any friends, I‚Äôm failing almost every class due to online school despite assignments being easy, I have to have so many mental health tests for severe depression, social and generalized anxiety, stress, and ADHD. I even had to take an IQ test. I have always gotten an A or B in classes. I was so excited for high school, and then this happened. I‚Äôm sick of nobody brining it up. I‚Äôm sick of nobody thinking about us. I‚Äôm sick of being told to just get used to it, to just try, to just work harder. I‚Äôve been working my hardest this whole goddamn ‚Äúschool year‚Äù on a platform I can‚Äôt even focus on sometimes. My internet is too slow sometimes, I get assignments jumbled up, I can‚Äôt pay attention, my medicine doesn‚Äôt work. And yet I‚Äôm still blamed for not doing well in school. I‚Äôm having to take summer school to regain my credits. I‚Äôm going to have to work even more on this platform, sacrificing my time to de stress and not have anything to worry about. I‚Äôm having to get blamed for something I never even knew I had to do. I wake up and I can‚Äôt even get out of bed sometimes because it‚Äôs the same stupid things every day and I‚Äôm TIRED of it. I hate the health officials, I hate the president, I hate my teachers, I hate my doctors, I hate myself for not doing anything. I‚Äôm sick of it. How many students have killed themselves because they can‚Äôt handle the stress of it. And how many of them are known? None. And we‚Äôre only bringing attention to it now. I‚Äôve had my fucking education robbed from my hands, from my mind for a cause I‚Äôm not even fucking relevant in!! I‚Äôm only 15 fucking years old and I already feel like my life is over, how many times have you heard our overlords of science bend the knee and tell the truth? And all of these people that are falling for this shit, I know I‚Äôm a teen but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have a voice. My life has been consumed by this, every waking moment spent thinking of it. I can‚Äôt do anything I like anymore no matter how hard I try and focus on it. And they‚Äôre only just now fucking bringing attention to it. It‚Äôs too fucking late. It‚Äôs done. I‚Äôm done. People that are more worried about a fucking cunt ass virus that majority of these fuckers on earth aren‚Äôt even going to die from to just give up their rights. I would love to speak to my governor or even fauci or Biden himself. Hear from somebody that you‚Äôre affecting because god knows my educational directors don‚Äôt care. And yet the clock keeps ticking. How much longer until we stop complaining and actually exercise our rights?</p>
