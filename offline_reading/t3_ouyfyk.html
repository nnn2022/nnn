<p>I've always been someone who's always asked questions and saw through bull shit. I've always been good at spotting patterns and very good at noticing things that don't make sense or go against common sense.</p>
<p>I'm a common sense kind of guy. That's why.</p>

        <p>My family finally agreed to stop fighting and accept each others decisions... It was a short lived truce though. Now that they want to go back for booster shots, we are back to fighting again.</p>
<p>I keep trying to point out to them that our family has NEVER fought like this and if there was no TV, no news, no propaganda, we would not be fighting today.</p>
<p>I swear they are driving people apart on purpose and it started w outrage machine and trump and the election drama and hunter and the racial bullshit and cancel culture. Why cant they see that we are being divided on purpose?</p>

        <p>Why am I a healthy 32 year old male with no significant family historic health problems? I guess I gotta thank God, followed up with healthy eating and exercise after that.  Maybe in a few years I'll scope out this vaccine and it's LT effects as there are plenty of trials going on. Til then, ill be on the running trail and at the tavern with the boys. Cheers!</p>

        <p>I have a background in toxicology and post-graduate studies in epidemiology.  I have a Public Health credential.  I do human health risk assessment in my job. I have been trained on PPE annually for more than 30 years.  </p>
<p>Masks don't work and it's not new science.  PPE wasn't invented fucking yesterday and this bullshit that we are learning as we go is simply untrue.  We know how PPE works.  Masks are used to reinforce fear.</p>
<p>I might have believed covid was a threat until they govt. told us that it was ok to put lockdowns aside and go to BLM protests and then did everything they could to tell us that those protests didn't result in increased covid cases.  To make it worse, they called any lockdown protest or Republican rally a superspreader event.  How in the sane world could anyone believe those contradictory messages? This was the point where I stopped believing all this bullshit.</p>
<p>My own kid had covid.  It was no worse than a cold.   I have another friend who suffered minor flu symptoms after being diagnosed.  My friend's brother who was on hospice for end of life care was "diagosed" with covid' put on morophine, and died 18 hours later.   I have another friend who died "with covid" but he had stage 4 cancer.  Though I'm sorry for the loss of life in both cases, I don't think it was covid.  I do believe people have died from the virus, but I think the numbers are false and massively inflated</p>
<p>The flu disappeard because we wore masks?  Haha .  Sure it did.   </p>
<p>Those vaccinated can/can't spread the virus.  Kids can/can't get sick from covid. Masks are/aren't needed if you are vaccinated.  Ivermectin does/doesnt help.  Delta variant is less/more likely to make you sick.  Just take the vaccine and we can all go back to normal.....just kidding...got you, hahah!  Mask up motherfuckers!  We are/aren't going to allow kids back in classrooms in a few weeks and we are/aren't going to lockdown again.  If only those unvaxxed would stop spreading/not spreading covid to the vaxxed.</p>

        <p>I’m the kind of guy who just wants the pandemic to stop and return to normal life. I’ve had enough of the paranoia pushed by the media, and I’m sick of government overreach. I’ve been vaccinated (cue the autistic screeching from idiots), I’ve complied with stupid mandates for long enough, had to graduate high school in 2020 on a livestream, and I just want to start college like a normal person after taking a rather difficult gap year</p>

<p>You lot on the other hand are exactly what the Rockefellers and friends intended when they set about installing compulsory government schooling in America.</p>

        <p>I always wanted to know the truth about a lot of things in life so I’m naturally skeptical and read a lot.</p>
<p>9/11 and hundreds of hours of research into that event made me permanently extra skeptical of the government.</p>
<p>Any government willing to at least go along with and look the other way while thousands of its own citizens are killed in order to justify expanding government power and spending trillions on war does not give one SHIT if you, your grandma or anyone else does from a cold virus.</p>
<p>Once you see some big lies it’s easy to see the others.</p>

        <p>Well it all started when I was born back on April 13th 1979. My mother Donna was struggling to push me out, took her 5 hours to finally push me out and when I came out I was screaming bloody hell. <br>
At age 3 I thought Mr. Rogers was a flamer and would say “fag fag fag” until my mother would slap me for it. <br>
At age 5 I often would watch Kids Incorporated and rub my little member to that hot older 80’s chick. In school I would dance like Michael Jackson to impress girls and then take them into a little play house on the playground and show them my wee wee.</p>
<p>Oh you meant why am I against this Covid BS.. My bad</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because I have common sense and use critical thinking. Plus I read and study🤓 I don’t trust mainstream media nor the governments and question everything.</p>
<p>Why do you trust them when it’s been over a year and you’ve never once seen anyone sick, collapsing or dying in public?</p>
