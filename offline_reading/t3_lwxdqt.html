        <p>I used to be big into rage against the machine and other punk bands.</p>
<p>As I got older I learned that they are the furthest thing from anti establishment you could be. I used to be big into anti flag as well, and listening to them basically campaign for the democrats made me throw up in my mouth a little.</p>

        <p>Zack de la Rocha slandered the owners of a small business on social media because they refused to give him special treatment.  He is a fraud.  He is part of the machine.</p>

        <p>Ah, you bring up an interesting opinion. I can’t see how, “they are the furthest thing from anti establishment.” I can see how you might consider them to be pro-democrat. However, I disagree! I disagree because of all my eyes have been opened to. The division has never been democrat v republic. It has always been the rich establishment, Illuminati, Freemasonry, and the ilk, against the rest of us, whom are considered peasants. This country hasn’t been free since the assassination of Lincoln. The flag doesn’t represent us. It hasn’t since we lost our freedom. It represents lies, collusion, delusion, divisiveness, brainwashing., and justified murder</p>

        <p>And to be honest, I’m not taking part in political parties any longer- they are nothing more than smoke mirrors. I have a set of values that I live by, that I hold my children to, and that is all. I only identify myself as human now. In reality, that is all we all are. Just humans trying to survive and find a little joy where we can. This life holds very little value to me now. I look to eternity!</p>

        <p>The issue that a lot of us now recognize is that the causes that RATM stand for are the same causes that the billionaire class stand for, allow, and fund.</p>
<p>In other words, this band, like many others, are just grifters saying whatever would get them the most exposure with the coorporate media.</p>
<p>Let me give you a specific concern. Viacom is the parent company that owns MTV, VH1, BET, and CMT. They literally have a monopoly over the entire American music industry, and the worst part is that it is owned by a single family - the Redstones. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard RATM call them out? Of course not. You don't bite the hand that feeds you.</p>

        <p>Imma clue you in to something, SunflowerKitty4, and this comes from almost fifty years of life experience.</p>
<p>No matter what band, musician, genre or album you like, some choad will come along and say, "They're not <em>real</em> X".  Seen it with metal, punk, rap, country...shit, someone, somewhere right now is making the argument that John Lee Hooker wasn't a <em>real</em> bluesman.  These people are what we call 'douchebags'.</p>
<p>What matters is if you like it.  Full stop.  If you're buying records based on some sort of perceived ideological connection to the musician, then I'm really not sure that you should be buying anything at all, because you're clearly confused.  The people that make music professionally are, for the most part, shitty people.  Their motives are suspect and they're doing it for money, no matter what else they may tell you.  But, if a song makes you tap your foot, or sing along or punch some doomer in his neckbeard, then that's working for you and no amount of naysaying should change that.  The cash you laid out for that record was worth it to you, even if the guy it's going to eventually uses it to buy his fourteenth solid gold toilet.</p>

        <p>Are we to nay say everyone who comments that they have been moved by a certain song or music genre, or artist, just because the human(s) behind it are, well, human!? Should we nay say everyone who is touched by John Lennon’s lyrics of “Imagine,” perhaps? Was John Lennon a douchebag? Yes. Did he do some stupid shit? You bet! Probably a Democrat, maybe even a Socialist. But I still get tears every time I hear that song and sing it as loud as my lungs will allow.</p>
