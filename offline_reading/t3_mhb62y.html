        <p>I find it strange that not once during this entire event have I heard any "health expert" talk about the importance of healthy diet and regular exercise. I realize people can't lose 100 lbs in a week if they are severely overweight but not once has any of these people addressed this besides saying obese people are more seriously affected. Not once have they talked about anything other than mask wearing, distancing, staying home, vaccine etc. No effort to educate people about how to improve their overall health so their immune systems and bodies are better able to fight off a virus. Shouldn't this be mentioned? And again, I know it's not curing anything and it can't be done overnight but it's been A YEAR and we've known this for many months. They have promoted a sedentary grossly unhealthy lifestyle. Why would I listen to these "experts" they obviously don't truly care about public health.</p>

        <p>Fat shaming is out man. PC culture. GFs friend is getting severely overweight. Started talking about it on his own a year ago. The other day invited him out to eat, wouldn’t do it too high risk cus he is obese. Had an entire year to correct this and did nothing. People don’t want to fix their own problems anymore. </p>
<p>This guy talks to us like we are supposed to deny it when he says he is obese. We just agree with him. Do not support these people in their problems.</p>

        <p>That's a tough situation, I know someone like this and I was once like this decades ago when I was young. I was Heavy when I was younger and I decided to do something about it but the thing with weight loss is you can't do it until you're ready. You can think you're ready, and you can know you need to do it, and you can want it but actually doing it is a whole different thing. There's a lot of psychology at play here. I've never known of a really overweight person who wasn't using the food to self medicate, of course unless you're really overweight due to some sort of medication or metabolic issue but that's not common.</p>
<p>Food is a really heavy person's drug of choice.  It takes a lot of work and dedication to learn how to keep it in check and most people just don't have that motivation especially in today's world where food is all they've got. Just because you're fat and you need to lose weight and you know it doesn't mean you're going to do it. It's such a mind fuck. Having been through it myself I'm well aware of it. And I struggle with it to this day but I'm committed to not going back there, I've kept it off for a long long time. But I had to accept that I have issues with weight and just learn how to manage it as if it's any other chronic health condition. I'm grateful that I figured this out fairly early in my life. I'm middle-aged now and I did it when I was younger. I think about it now and I wonder if I would even still be alive or how many health problems I would have if I hadn't done it.</p>
<p>The point is, people need encouragement they need the seed planted in their heads. It's not enough to say you are really fat and you're more at risk. They need some sort of support and guidance, a lot of them do. You can't make somebody do this but you can plant the seed and it seems like they're not even doing that.</p>

        <p>I’ve been there too, or at least to where I was getting overweight. I now realize as soon as I am even thinking of starting a bad habit with food. I have trained myself to feel like a piece of shit if I skip exercise. My issue with becoming overweight was plain and simple laziness. </p>
<p>I extended the olive branch of working out together etc but inconveniences were brought up and that is the end of my felt responsibilities to help in my view. </p>
<p>Regardless I see what you are saying, we should attempt to help, we shouldn’t put them down needlessly, but nor should we reward them for it.</p>

        <p>I totally hear you I did the same thing! I have a friend who was at least a hundred pounds overweight probably more and she did Express that she wanted to do something about it. I offered to be her exercise and healthy eating buddy. But she never said anything about it again. I left it alone because it's not my business, I'm here for you if you express you need help and you reach out to me but nobody can force it on you. You have to want it for yourself, when you truly want it and you're willing to do what you need to do it will happen for you. But by the same token, don't expect other people to protect you and change the way they're living their lives because you are at a higher risk. Of course it's nice if they do but the world doesn't operate that way!</p>

        <p>I try so hard to avoid conspiracies, but it is very puzzling that they seem to avoid giving knowledge that would put accountability and control on the individual.</p>

        <p>Personal responsibility is something they have all but extinguished. We are expected to live our lives around other people and their conditions and issues. If you don't do this you're horrible and selfish. Well it's not my responsibility to ruin my life because you have comorbidities. You need to manage your own health. Be cautious do what you need to do don't ask other people to do this for you and expect them to change their lives for you. Never in a million years would I expect someone else to do something for the benefit of my health. That's my job!</p>

        <p>In my area, when the lockdowns first started, more people were going outside, walking, riding bikes, playing with their kids, gardening and doing yard work. 2 weeks later, big sister announced that wasn't what she meant and executive ordered a stop to it. People complied and have been living the approved shut in, anxiety train lifestyle that will keep us all safe.</p>

        <p>Which makes no sense! People should be outside -- not only is it easier to "distance" it's also obviously not contained and there's the added benefit of Vitamin D production.</p>
<p>But that would only make sense if this was about "following the science and protecting people" and not control.</p>
