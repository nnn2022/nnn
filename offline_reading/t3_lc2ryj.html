    <strong>Let's try and find some positives (if we can).</strong>
    <p><p>The (over)reaction to this bug has ruined a lot of stuff.  Social lives, employment, travel plans, etc.  We had a trip to Venice all booked, now just a dream.  The voucher that we got from the hotel and the airline will probably expire before the world gets its head out of its ass.</p>
<p>We bought some property about five years ago.  Ten acres of woods next to a trout stream.  We put a primitive cabin on it and used to go there about once a month.  Now that we can't travel without maskfagging everywhere, we just go to the cabin.  We even went on New Year's Eve.  Spent New Year's Day cutting firewood and drinking hot chocolate.  We've come to appreciate it more than we ever did before.  We're basically planning on giving up on travel altogether and sink our vacation money into cabin improvements.  Who knows?  When the vaccine turns everybody into undead vampire zombies, we might need to live there!</p>
<p>So, that's good, right?  Anyone else have a rose they've picked from all these thorns?  This friggin' mess can't be <em>all</em> bad, can it?</p></p>
