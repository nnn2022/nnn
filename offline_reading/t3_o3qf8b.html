    <strong>Extended family scared because I’m not vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>So, if you’re “protected” and fully vaxxed, why do you care? Honestly I’m starting to love lose for these family members to treat me like I’m a second class citizen, and selfish for not doing my part. My mother agreed not to ridicule me but when my aunt is around they are against me and think I’m stupid.</p></p>

        <p>Repeat after me.<br>
"Don't talk to police"</p>
<p>and   </p>
<p>"Don't talk to anyone regarding your medical information", as doing so will, by your compliance, recognize their medical authority over you.</p>
<p>It's a trick, much like the cops will try to pull on you, to get you to incriminate yourself, or give them access or authority that they don't have over you.</p>

        <p>Seeing how they’re protected by the vaccine, any exclusion is on a moral level, not a safety one. Similar to how individual Jews might not have been doing anything specifically wrong, but they were still “unclean”</p>

        <p>I’m visiting my extended family this summer and I really hope none of them care. </p>
<p>If they do, I’ll respect their wishes not to see me but be very sad because I don’t know how much longer I have to see them because of their age. I know at least 2 of my grandparents got vaccinated. My grandparents aren’t doomers, as far as I know, so they will probably just say “well I got it so I’m good.” So far, haven’t been asked.</p>
<p>If my younger, millennial and Gen z cousins have a problem with it though I’ll just tell them to fuck off. It’s not like we talk that much anyway.</p>

        <p>Did they act this way during flu season and demand you got a flu shot? Very few people did. In my experience the only time anyone ever wanted you to get vaccinated pre-covid is if they had just had a baby!!! Lots of new mothers out there who demanded their families get a flu shot if they wanted to be able to see the baby! </p>
<p>I’m seeing extended family this coming week when I go up to visit my parents. My parents are vaccinated, my dad is fresh off chemo and my mom is in the middle of chemo. My aunt who is visiting, no idea if she’s vaccinated or her daughter who is visiting. Another cousin, my late uncles daughter, is come from back East too and she’s the one I worry about it. She is the only one in the family who leans a certain way politically and she is very opinionated (and loud lol). If anyone is going to bring up vaccines and make an issue out of me not being vaccinated, it’s gonna be her. Had a great conversation with my mail lady yesterday and she said some of her family treats her like a 2nd class citizen and when she was visiting them, a vaccinated nephew in medical school didn’t want to see her because she’s not vaccinated and when she asked why it is a problem if his vaccine works, he didn’t answer her just gave her a lecture on why she needs to get vaccinated!</p>

        <p>Hold your ground. Very soon when the auto immune crap starts happening with them, they will be extremely jealous that you were the only one with brains. Just make sure to tell them that you won't give up any of your life looking after invalids caused by their own stupid decisions.</p>

        <p>Ask them why ( now that the demand for the jab has dried up) are they just now coming out with peer reviewed studies that say ivermectin reduces chance of hospitalization from Covid by 90%?? Almost the same guarantee the jab give you. Weird huh???</p>
