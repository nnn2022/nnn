    <strong>Allow me to bounce an idea off of you: Public schooling shut down, especially pre-K though 12, is the only BRIGHT SIDE of the virus.</strong>
    <p><p>So I am under the assumption that most of you in this thread who are wise to this planned subversion, are also wise to the failings of our school systems to effectively raise up bright, motivated and responsible young workers and creatives as of the past decade or so.</p>
<p>Instead our current system of "education" has taken to extreme indoctrination and subversion of our youth. One good look at some of the pictures from schools in this sub should tell you that.</p>
<p>Now, I fully believe that parents should be ENTIRELY responsible for their kids. Moms should be teaching their children and raising them up. The state NO PLACE to be discussing things like sex ed, or even pushing political angles on our children. It's deviant and spoils the innocence of childhood. Then you have "zero tolerance" policies that inevitably harm those victimised by bullies.</p>
<p>So in that light, I would suggest to COMPLETELY withdraw children from the school system and let it collapse. Let's go back to RAISING OUR KIDS. Train a child up in the way he should go, and when he is old it will not depart from him.</p>
<p>Let your kids be kids, but discipline them and teach them right from wrong. Raise them so you can be proud of them. Let's create a generation of innocence.</p></p>

        <p>Did you know there was a time where mothers stayed home and raised children, and men were the breadwinners?</p>
<p>That's how it was always supposed to be. No, instead came a post war boom that put mothers in the workplace and put kids in the hands of the state. Then the bigger concern became income over proper child rearing.</p>

        <p>Eh, this is assuming every child comes from a stable two parent household where one parent can afford to stay home full time. It also does not account for parents who are abusive or neglectful. My parents were stable financially but my mom was terribly abusive and if I would have been forced to homeschool, my childhood would have been even more traumatic.</p>

        <p>i mean... no, absolutely not, lol.</p>
<p>do i think parents should have the right to educate their children as they see fit? absolutely. i believe that every parent has the right to chose a public, private, charter, or home school education for their child. the lockdown has shown everyone that we need more options and more choices and more flexibility now more than ever in academia. </p>
<p>but every child is entitled to a public education.</p>
<p>i believe that education is the most important good that a country can provide for the next generation, and we should prioritize it above nearly everything else. if we have a well-educated, informed group of citizens, that is a net good for a country. therefore, yes, we should apply public monies and resources to educate our children. every child is entitled to an education - it is the one thing we can guarantee them as a nation. educated citizens and residents make a country thrive, it makes us successful, it empowers people - public education should be a great equalizer and a national treasure.</p>
<p>Americans don't value public education, and it shows. we keep taking money away from our school systems, we chronically under fund our children in urban and rural areas who desperately need funding. we give kids laptops and tablets instead of textbooks and art supplies. we crowd them into classrooms and trailers. and since 2003, we have been teaching our children how to ace a test and how to memorize answers. the Common Core has destroyed public education by gutting the liberal arts and sand boxing STEM - there is no critical thinking or analysis, there is no appreciation of the art of teaching or the art of learning. kids are not robots - humans are not robots - we cannot and should not be expected to become rote cogs in a machine.</p>
<p>Americans love their children - they want the best for their children. in our hyper capitalist system, that means parents hoard time and resources for their kids above other kids. that means many children go without and are being robbed of their right to an education. we see it with property taxes, we see it with state funding. look at how we've robbed our state universities of public funding since 2008, and look what that's done to cost of higher education and tuition. i am not critiquing capitalism right now - i suppose i could and i am in fact a capitalist - but the system is not designed to protect or help kids. it is designed to protect and maintain privilege. we have a two and maybe even three or four tier education system in the U.S.. we're a very selfish people, but we will do anything and everything to protect our offspring. i get that, too. i would do anything for my (future) children.</p>
<p>i believe in the meritocracy. i don't think we should nix the SAT/ACT, i don't think we need a "woke," progressive curricula, i don't believe in zero tolerance, i don't believe in teaching to a test, i don't believe in online education, i don't believe in busing children out of their neighborhood schools. i do believe in the arts, i believe in play, i believe in music, i believe in sports. i believe that children should hold books in their hands and read them and fall in love with them, or hold a glass beaker in a lab and make a compound, and discover their inner mad scientist. i believe in the potential of children, and that they make us better people and a better country. i believe that we should teach civics and not politics. i think we should teach people to look at history and literature critically, especially when it is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>do i think we need some sex ed in school? yeah, it's called public health, and we have a responsibility to kids to teach them about their bodies in addition to preventing teen pregnancy and STD/STIs. i don't think we should have the Judeo-Christian god in school, but i do think all religions should be taught respectfully, and the expression of religion is a constitutional right. i want to feed every child two hot meals a day, in case they aren't fed at home. i want kids to have heat and A/C and electricity and a safe place to be for 8+ hours a day. i want them to be around other kids. i want them to know that there are adults at school who care about them, and kid can go to adults with their problems. </p>
<p>with the public schools closed right now, we the adults have failed the children. we have set them back a decade. i don't know how they catch up. there is no longer a socio-economic inequality gap - it's now a chasm. the rich will pull far ahead, the middle class will chase after them, and the poor are utterly screwed. yes, the school system has failed. it's our fault. we did this. we must be the ones to fix it or suffer the consequences with a future generation of dunces.</p>

        <p>As much as the school system is an indoctrination center, it's also a babysitter and socializer. Our society isn't really designed to not send kids there. For those who can, more power to you, but it's not for everybody.</p>
