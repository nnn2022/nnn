    <strong>Is it actually possible to change a sheep’s mind?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you guys think it’s actually doable to change a sheep’s mind? Does anyone have any tips or tricks about how to go about this? I’ve been having a never ending argument with my gf about all this stuff, showed her evidence to support my claims. She just simply says she doesn’t believe my evidence then I ask her to provide evidence to support her side and she gets offended and says she doesn’t have to show evidence to support her side. I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried to be mature about it and handle it the best way I can, but it doesn’t work. She won’t change her mind?</p></p>

        <p>Appeal to her emotional side, and her own own sense making.</p>
<p>Logic doesn't win these kind of arguments. Appeal to her heart, her intuition.</p>
<p>Deep down she knows something is off, every human does - fight for what she's knows deep down but has buried under a mountain of conditioning.</p>

        <p>Actually yes. The media can reprogram them from one outrage to the next, even if they're completely contradictory. That's technically changing their mind.</p>

        <p>You have to do it real subtle. Like any teaching at all, if you try to dump information or a viewpoint on them, it won't work. At best, it'll go in one ear and out the other. At worst it'll be like with your GF, or national politics, where everybody just shouts stuff at each other.</p>
<p>People have to be motivated to learn. That's why most people never wake up - sitting on tv/internet, eating shit food, body wasting away, is just about the easiest thing to do in this society. People have to have a reason to not do that. </p>
<p>The best you can do is wait for the cracks to form, and then slip in with an innocuous question so they don't get all defensive. Friend says "God damn I'm so tired of wearing this mask." that's your cue to slip in with a "I know, can you even catch corona outdoors?". GF says "why don't people get this vaccine?" and you slip in, nice as pie, very innocuous "I think I read some stuff about periods being really heavy."</p>
<p>They gotta be inspired to look it up on their own. This is what the government misses all the time and why our online 'debates' never work. Forced compliance does not enlist the faculties and energies of those whose compliance is being forced. It does not convince.</p>
<p>You should check out Dewey's "Democracy and Education". About 15 pages in you'll have to stop because the truths about teaching others come hot and heavy.</p>

        <p>I was going to get the vax. I changed my mind. I'm very far left (communist) and knew only of the memes about what "anti-vaxxers thought".    </p>
<p>I  was reading about the b.1.617 variant because I was getting sick and tired of the lockdown and wanted to get out of this funk.  I was hearing about needing new boosters if this thing mutates.  I got really upset because I was looking at getting the first vax shot in a week and now I'm already looking at a follow-up after the first 2?    </p>
<p>As I looked into it I couldn't find any hard science on it or at least very little. So I just kept digging (looking past the algorithm) and finally got something that scratched my worry. Unfortunately it just made me more scared tbh.</p>
<p>I think using my leftist perspective has allowed me to realize what is going on and makes me unable to buy specific narratives on the right that people may have hoped would've pulled me over sooner.  I feel like arguing about how BLM, woke culture is involved or Fauci is a demon or easily meme-able ideas that people on the right are familiar with are not going to be effective to lefties. I think if you want to reach me then speak on terms I care about or how I perceive the world:</p>
<p><em>Do we really want to commodify our immune systems?  Are we ok with institutions like CDC, WHO having 0 democratic control and able to suppress non-pharma approved strategies?  Do we want a society where eventually after conservatives are purged from all media and possibly society through vaccine discrimination they then go after leftists?</em></p>
<p>All people want similar things but they just want them in different ways.  Speak to the base axiom of my belief system. For me: Capitalism is bad.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I think speaking to people on the left requires speaking in their language. Talk about capitalism and control of our bodies through commodification of the immune system.  Talk about 0 Democratic control of these institutions.</p>
