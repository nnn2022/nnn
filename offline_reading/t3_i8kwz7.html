    <strong>Funny how adults, prior to covid, ranted about how bad social media was for kids and how they need to actually get out and play with other kids.</strong>
    <p><p>Boy, has the narrative shifted! Now these idiots are trying to spin it every possible way to make it sound like Zoom calls and social media are a perfectly valid (and in some cases, superior) replacement for actual human interaction. On a more positive note, though, I think what this pandemic has shown us is that despite how much Boomers and the like bitched about technology for YEARS, at the end of the day, people still have an innate need and desire for physical connection. I don't think anyone ever really needed to worry about technology, because as we've seen over these past several months, people DO still want to go out and party, and will even break the law in order to do so. Technology is NOT a replacement for "real life," and even I, someone who spends pretty much all day online for work and other things, can acknowledge that.</p></p>

        <p>Many, <em>many</em> adults are hypocrites.</p>
<p>I learned that truth as a child, and I think it still holds true even as an adult myself. This entire scenario highlights the hypocrisy, ignorance, and malice most adults possess.</p>

        <p>Well sure, but that was before airborne super-ebola-AIDS was killing everyone including your grandma (especially your grandma) with a 99.9% death rate.  That was before the arena-size mass graves, before we had bodies stacked like cordwood on the side of the roads of our abandoned cities.  </p>

        <p>I had both too. Covid was like the worst bronchitis I’ve ever had. Swine flu almost killed me and my other 4 21 year old roommates at the time. 104 degree fever for 8 days, blue lips from poor oxygen flow. 2 of my roommates went to the ER for dehydration. I managed to choke down enough water and Gatorade to avoid that. It was 10 years ago and I still remember the abject agony of being sick with that. I recently met up with the roommate that gave it to me. She is also not afraid of covid. We talked about that flu and how we all thought we would definitely die, not because the media told us we would but because we could feel that’s how sick we were. Covid was just an annoying nuisance of a chest cold for 2 weeks.</p>

        <p>Yeah with covid I had the energy to sit in the bathroom with a steam shower going to alleviate the chest issues. Swine flu, I couldn’t even stand to walk to the damn bathroom to pee. I crawled to the bathroom a few times. Swine flu actually scared me. Covid just annoyed me.</p>

        <p>Mysteriously is one word for it, but I have been getting serious “amnesiac” vibes from my Liberal friends lately. For instance, an old friend from high school who used to expound for hours in the most self-righteous manner possible about the Snowden whistleblowing is now completely ignoring his perspective on COVID-19 preventative measures. </p>

        <p>I agree. I would add that a large part of why we're in this mess is because too many of us think that everyone's voice counts, and that we need to 'respect the democratic process'  or whatever. Me? I'm tired of the outsized influence the moronic masses hold over my life and how I am to live it. I get that 'we live in a society' and all that, but when said society is primarily comprised of pathetic virtue-signalling bootlicking sheep, I really can't be bothered to hold in even the slightest level of esteem the thoughts, feelings, and 'opinions' of these NPC clones.</p>

I realize there are plenty of folks out there who want to live their lives as hermits, which I respect 100%, but they have NO right to be telling everyone else that THEY should have to live that way as well, and not only that, but be HAPPY about it.</p>

        <p>Similarly: for years we were told to use more public transport because it saves gas and lowers traffic jams and more of that stuff. The government tried so hard to make PT attractive. Marketed it like “you’ll never need a car cause PT goes everywhere”. </p>
<p>But now sudden public transport is evil and we must avoid it like the plague just as people were becoming dependent on it. Traffic jans shot up. Its madness. </p>
<p>Tell me how great public transport is now eh?</p>

        <p>I bitched about technology as a bad replacement for real life before the sort-of-pandemic and I'm bitching about it now. It doesn't work well enough as a substitute. The best you can say is that it's better than absolutely nothing, and in limited circumstances like if a friend lives a thousand miles away, it might be your best option with that particular person. Phone calls and online chats are just not the same as real face to face interaction and don't meet human needs. </p>
<p>None of this is about what's best for children, or for adults for that matter. It's about what's best for the State. Depressed, isolated people who feel helpless are much easier to control. I don't think that's the <em>intention</em>, but it's certainly not a <em>problem</em> from the perspective of the people who profit from lockdowns and limiting face-to-face communication.</p>

        <p>I was also thinking about classes that can’t be taught online...musical instruments, wood shop, choir, graphic art type classes, PE, etc. it’s going to be hard later to convince kids that those things are important too, because the message they’re getting right now is that those can all go by wayside.</p>

        <p>What no one realizes is we are now an ‘online first’ society, that’s where it’s all moving to. Real life is a secondary life now that simply exists to fulfil online life. </p>
<p>It’s terrible but we seem to be treating the online world as something more meaningful than it is.</p>

        <p>People do not have entirely consistent ideologies, like ever.</p>
<p>Also yeah, when things change their behaviors change, that's not hypocritical or weird thats just how you should respond to a changed context and changing information...</p>

        <p>But we know that shoving kids in front of screens all day is actually bad for them. We’ve had 2 decades+ of screens and not a single study says that kids in front of screens all day helps them. Do we expect these kids to never grow up? Do we as adults expect to never die and therefore we can just infantilise this generation of kids and never let them become members of society? This is fucking kids up and I’m going to be someone expected to hold their inept hands when they inevitably have to take part in the work force and I shouldn’t have to do that. Kids should be naturally socialized amongst other humans not via screens. Just because we can do it doesn’t mean we fucking should.</p>
