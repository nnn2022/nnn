        <p>This sort of crap makes zero sense to me; if the vaccine works, those who are vaccinated should feel safe. The people who aren’t vaccinated are the ones “at risk” and should be able to make that decision on their own as to whether or not they want to cruise. The slippery slope is allowing this cruise line to require proof of vaccine, not the other way around. The left makes me want to throw up, I hope the judge laughs in their faces</p>

        <p>They are a private company only doing this for the sake of money. Period. </p>
<p>They likely feel an outbreak on a ship would keep people from cruising with them and would be tough to control if lots of folks needed medical care. It would be a bad public image. Personally, I think it’s perfectly fine for them to do and the government saying otherwise is just more overreach into private business. It’s the free market of America, if people don’t like the rule they will cruise elsewhere and their businesses will suffer. Cruise lines who opted to not have a vaccine requirement stand to make tons of money and this company will could out which would likely prompt them to change.</p>

        <p>I actually disagree with this. All the rule does is create a divide between vaccinated and unvaccinated, when a distinction between the two isn’t necessary. All sorts of things can happen on a cruise, remember people pooping in buckets and being stuck? This is not some mom and pop shop worried about infecting an immunocompromised person, this is virtue signaling to those who are not vaccinated-but again, the point of pain is that the vaccine either works or doesn’t; if it doesn’t work, then it doesn’t matter if everyone is vaccinated anyway and if it does work, then those who are vaccinated should feel safe.</p>

        <p>It creates a divide (as if there isn’t one already) amongst a group of people taking an OPTIONAL vacation. The cruise lines are only interested in money and that’s what the free market is based on.</p>

        <p>The cruise line also has the option to move the port in which they board their guests</p>

        <p>Right, but they shouldn’t have to do that in a free market economy. The put ports in the USA with the understanding that they wouldn’t endure any government overreach but obviously that’s not the case in Florida. </p>
<p>How is this not gov overreach?</p>

        <p>And you think requiring proof of vaccination isn’t overreach from a publicly traded company? Part of being an American is the freedom to choose, seems that’s been forgotten</p>
<p>Edit: that sanction was put in place because American freedom is under attack all over the US. Lots of government overreach on both sides, but at least DeSantis has American freedom as a whole in mind</p>
