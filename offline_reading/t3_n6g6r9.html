    <strong>My doomer BIL wants me to wear masks around his nephews</strong>
    <p><p>I have an older sister who is capable of rational thought. We frequently discuss this scamdemic and can’t believe that the situation has gotten so bad. Unfortunately her husband is a big doomer (never really liked that guy anyway, I guess my instincts were right). The sad thing is that he’s a very smart guy and very accomplished on paper but clearly lacks common sense.</p>
<p>I’m close with my sister so regularly spend time with her two young sons (3, 5). She doesn’t make them wear masks because that’s obviously child abuse. </p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to take them out to the park and before we left my doomer BIL said that I should be wearing a mask to set a good example. And something about children transmitting the virus at a higher rate. I told him that I will not. We had an argument and I ended up not taking the kids out. </p>
<p>Anyone know how to deal with family members like this?</p></p>
