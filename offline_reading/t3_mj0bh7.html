        <p>Used the army to seize printing presses. Jailed judges and journalists, even tried to use the death penalty. Raised tariffs on the South kicking off the war. Denied a prisoner exchange of some 12,000 soldiers in Andersonville so the South was burdened with feeding them, most starved. Endorsed Sherman's total war tactics, which led to mass starvation and raping of any unprotected woman in the South. Started the military industrial complex. Started the draft, and income tax. </p>
<p>Also set up the practice of lobbying which started under Grant right after his assassination. Grant would spend so much time in hotel lobbys with people bribing policy, thats where the name comes from. There is more, there's a book called The Real Lincoln or something along those lines that covers most of it. There is a reason men with no shoes and only scraggly clothes fought so hard against the northern war machine and it wasn't for the slaves they couldn't afford.</p>

        <p>The war was only in part about slavery, it was mainly used as a pr reason to keep foreign powers from aligning with the South. Chattel slavery was phasing out in the South already. It nearly got abolished in Virginia by 1 vote before the war. It was expensive and businessmen were realizing wage slavery is more effective. Nothing was done about slavery in the North, the federal gov simply refused to lose the ability to exploit the taxbase of the South, and they used German and Irish immigrants as an endless supply of meatshields against Lee's Virginia army. After the war 3 northern states voted against the 13th amendment and only 1 southern state. Of course my opinion is that slavery should've been abolished, but that is easy to say being raised in a different moral landscape. </p>
<p>There are more slaves alive today than in the history of the world. The question should be what are we doing about slavery now?</p>

<p>The fact that Virginia, the major state of the confederacy, almost diplomatically banned slavery by 1 vote before the war. You don't recognize how it could have ended without the utter destruction and pillaging of innocent people who never owned slaves in the South? </p>
<p>Ending slavery is like ending wars. It is a complex problem but a good start is ending the fast fashion industry which creates millions of textile and fibre crop slavery jobs. Also revising foreign policy and ending predatory loans to poor countries that enslave their governments to debt from the World Bank and others.</p>

<p>Virginia was the heartland of the confederacy, you would think they are staunchly pro slavery, but they came 1 vote away from banning slavery. Proving that diplomacy could've worked, or was at least worth pursuing/influencing. But the war was never about this alone. The North imposed predatory taxes on the South, that is why the Confederate constitution added a clause about uniform tariffs. </p>

        <p>Ok let me clarify my position because somehow this is lost on people. </p>
<p>If the civil war was fought for the sole reason of freeing slaves as quickly as possible then I agree with it as a solution. However this obviously just wasn't the case. Slavery was abhorrent and disgusting and it needed to be abolished asap. But Instead you had northern banks wanting to exploit the south who could care less about a slave, but it did make for a great excuse to exploit the south well into the 1900s after reconstruction. There was an abolitionist party in the north but they were a tiny minority of political power. </p>
<p>Virginia came 1 vote from banning it, all I am saying is that is significant, it would be easy to swing a vote. I am not saying anyone deserved to remain in slavery. </p>
<p>Look up the Gullah Geechee for the best answer to slavery.</p>

        <p>I think it would be great if things in life worked out as cleanly as what you're proposing.  But I think it's fantasy.  And while yes, I think the Virginia vote can seem significant on the surface, I think you grossly overestimate the reasonableness of people who for hundreds of years walked by human beings in chains up on auction blocks right in the center of town - and after hundreds of years of that, the BEST they can do, is to get within one vote.</p>
<p>I always will be for a peaceful solution first.  I think MLK was absolutely right.  But he was operating under a different system.  Slaves were not even considered human.</p>

        <p>It is also important to point out that the war did not end slavery, nor did the emancipation proclamation. The 13th amendment did which was opposed more heavily by the north than the south.</p>

        <p>Lincoln was a racist pig. He believed in relocating all black peoples to South America. He only opposed slavery in expansion states because slavery competed with white labor. The guy was a war criminal. Society has spent over 100 years turning this pig into a saint </p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the Douglas Lincoln debates of 1858</p>
<p>“I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]-that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”</p>
<p>Lincoln was against slavery but he did not like black people and he’s directly responsible for what happened to native Americans after the war. We need to stop praising this war criminal.</p>

        <p>I think you have to put people in the context of the times they lived in.  There's absolutely no way Lincoln would have won the presidency if he had said anything more favorable to black people - white people at that time simply would not have voted for him or anyone else who said that blacks were equal to whites.</p>

        <p>First off putting things into “context” is a way of justifying wrongdoing. That’s like saying “well slavery is wrong but you have to understand how things were back in those times”. False, slavery was wrong. No excuses. Lincoln approved and authorized war crimes throughout the south. (Rape, murder, theft, property destruction). But to address your assertion, Lincoln on his first inauguration speech reiterated his racist views as well as stating that his purpose for the war is not to end or preserve slavery but to preserve the Union. You can’t justify the governmental tyrant that Lincoln was. He is without doubt the most corrupt president we’ve ever had. In fact his legacy continued after his death with the slaughter of 45,000 native Americans...perpetrated by the same crooks that pillaged the south under Lincoln’s own orders!</p>
<p>From his first speech as President where he says he “will not recant” what he said before</p>
<p>“I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.”</p>
<p>Here in the next quote he is referring to the fugitive slave act where he states he has no intentions to get rid of it</p>
<p>“There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:</p>
<p>No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.</p>
<p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause "shall be delivered up" their oaths are unanimous”</p>

        <p>I agree that it's disappointing that we have to put things in the context that no president could get elected by the white people of that time if they treated black people as equal human beings.  But that's the reality of the way it was.</p>

        <p>Did you not read what I posted? He was already elected. He wasn’t trying to hide his “like” for black people. He was open as a book about it. In fact he even wanted to relocate black people to South America in order to preserve the white race. You are literally defending him in face of the facts. Why is it so hard to accept that sometimes we are wrong? All of America has been lied to about this man. They call him honest and the great emancipator when he was literally known for being deceitful and never freed a single slave nor had any inclination to! But I guess the further away people get from the truth the more they hate you for speaking the truth. You are a prime example. Instead of accept that Lincoln was racist and a terrible human you say “that’s just how it was back then”. That is essentially victim blaming. You should feel ashamed</p>

        <p>Actually, you're the one who's too lazy to properly make your point.  </p>
<p>If you're trying to convince someone of something, the burden is on you to be clear.  The borden is not on someone else to wade through every link you post to try to figure out what you mean. If someone wants to do that, fine.  But if they ask you to clarify, it's your responsibility to do so.</p>
<p>But that's fine, if you don't care enough to properly make your point, then I just don't believe what you're claiming.  Now I'm sure you'll have all kinds of time and energy to throw a tantrum over this, even though you claim it's too much effort to properly make your point.  So let me just say in advance of your tantrum: nobody cares.</p>

        <p>Yup true. He only freed slaves in the south, which legally he was unauthorized to do. Because the emancipation proclamation only applied to the south, which was a different country, and not the north, not a single slave was freed. Slavery was completely abolished until 1866...1 year after the tyrants death</p>
