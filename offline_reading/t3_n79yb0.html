    <strong>The concept of good faith and the union of pharma and politics: the risk of medicine for profit and control.</strong>
    <p><p>This is where we are.  There can be no denying that global health has been politicized.  The biggest influencers on the planet have skin in the game.  I would love to hear this group's take on the following concepts and questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a distinct possibility that the virus that causes COVID-19 was leaked, either by neglect or intention, from a laboratory.  Many of the competing hypotheses are losing likelihood which, increases the likelihood of the Wuhan lab as the source.   It can be verified that some of the most influential players in managing this pandemic have a history at that same lab, and material interest in, researching 'gain of function' on coronaviruses.  <strong><em>What or who should be, the purest, good-faith solution to preserving and managing the health of the world population?  Pure and in good faith, as in not politically or profit-driven.  Have we found ourselves irretrievably bound to relying on a solution that must answer to profit and/or power?</em></strong></li>
<li>The mainstream media is relentless in its promotion of the vaccines, each of which was not the product of a single herculean effort and collaboration, but multiple publicly-traded companies with their own intellectual property.  <strong><em>Should the solution to a global pandemic resort to changing the nature of how vaccine research is funded?  Should this instantly sever any existing financial relationships with media companies?</em></strong>  This is an obviously huge conflict of interest.</li>
<li>The vaccine companies have zero accountability in that fact that consumers cannot sue for injuries.  There is the risk that improper, rushed implementation of these vaccines could result in mid-term to long-term injuries, particularly when the next flu season hits and the state of our 'vaccinated' populations encounter surges in exposure to possibly a different mutant strain, resulting in even more massive fatalities.  <strong><em>Who or what organization should be accountable for this, if not the vaccine companies?  The governments?  The WHO?  The media or the media moguls who have material interest in the media narrative?  Are there absolutely no consumer rights?</em></strong></li>
<li>The  National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has compensated 4.5 billion in 30 years for vaccine injuries via 'vaccine court' with no jury.  <strong><em>Are there similar operating legal bodies in other countries?</em></strong></li>
</ol>
