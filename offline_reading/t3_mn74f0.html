    <strong>Anybody else hearing all the "reach.gov" radio and podcast ads lately, pushing the site and the app?</strong>
    <p><p>It's a suicide prevention site that looks like it was tailored originally for veterans.  I'm a veteran and had never heard of it, but now it's on multiple morning radio talk shows and podcasts.</p>
<p>While on the surface it seems like a good thing, why now, and why is it pushed so hard?  Do the CDC and HHS know something that hasn't yet been widely publicized--like suicides have increased?  Is this getting ahead of the narrative?  I wish I weren't so suspicious, but these are the same fucks that had Lavar Burton on every 5 seconds telling people to go to CEE-DEE-CEE.gov, and wear a mask for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>FFS, to reduce suicides, you don't need reach.gov or the associated app, you just need to stop the bullshit lockdowns, anti-social distancing, and the goddamn masks.</p></p>
