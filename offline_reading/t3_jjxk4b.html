        <p>Surely if the rate of deaths is based on covid infections, the death rate would be high between June- Sept. whilst we had no lockdowns, the eat out schemes, people going on summer holidays, children out and about during summer holidays, university age people out and about, and yet the graph clearly shows low death rate. Also elderly people more out and about cos of the warm weather!!!</p>
<p>Now we are getting into the winter months and the death rate is starting to rise "due to Covid"</p>

        <p>I'm wondering this too, the "second spike" in the US and EU seems a lot more pronounced than you all's too. </p>
<p>I live in Oklahoma and our second spike picture looks pretty well like the national us or eu one and we were one of the most lax states, with mask orders inside 2 big cities proper, not the suburbs/metro area, not small towns and this metro area I'm at, indoor dining and bars were the only things closed for a few weeks in april.</p>

        <p>No, not necessarily, often pandemics have different patterns and can relate to seasons ( although I want to add I dont think all of these deaths are due to Covid or at least not pure Covid)</p>
