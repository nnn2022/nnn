        <p>I've seen mask studies with 100 people.</p>
<p>Science is done with hundreds of independent researches from dozens of different places and all researches reaching the same conclusion (including the ones from people who didn't believe in the results).</p>
<p>What we had there was just a team of hired scientists who were told to provide the minimum needed to be able to ship the product without getting legally liable.</p>
<p>It was never "proved" to be safe. Whoever says it's safe is not being scientifically factual. It was just considered safe enough to be authorized for an EMERGENCY situation for the people who really want to take it (reason why you have to sign a form saying you are taking at your own risk).</p>
<p>Basically, if you want to risk it, then by all means: your body, your choice. They are free to sell the vaccines to whoever wants it.</p>

        <p>42k healthy people and only a small number got covid. Ok. But then you're going to distribute it to millions of people, many older with compromised immune systems. You run a trial of a tiny sample size 0f healthy people, then give it to a wide range of people, pregnant, over 65, autoimmune disorders and so on, you're going to have severe adverse reactions that seem like a small number compared to millions. But had they included those types of people in the 44k, and 20k had adverse reactions or got covix, you'd see the data differently. That is not a real world study. That is picking the best factors to go in your favor.</p>

        <p>I know, I am agreeing with you just adding some more numbers to it.  I struggle to see how they even concluded it worked when only 8 in the vaccine group had covid. Because they didn't give them the vaccine and then give them covid to prove it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've been there. Its all people being like, I experienced these crazy side effects. No regrets! Get the damn shot people! They don't even realize that when you're sick, the lymphnodes at the base of your chin get swollen. These swellings have happened everywhere else and that is not normal. </p>
<p>Then, there is the whole, these people with comorbidites wouldn't have died if they never caught covid. But you get the same exact symptoms from the vaccine (Yay! Your body is working!) and then people die. They say they died from comorbidities and not vaccines. But if the vaccine gives you the same symptoms, and those symptoms would kill you if it was actual covid, would it then be fair to say that those people would not have died had they not gotten the vaccine? Because then they wouldn't have experienced the symptoms of covid.</p>

        <p>A good question! This is why statistics was invented. With it, you can compute the probability that the results are actually due to an effective vaccine or just due to random chance. There are a lot of subtleties to account for, but that is basically how we know the results are correct!</p>

        <p>R8ght, but to only test 44k healthy people, and then distribute it to hundreds of millions of older people who are not as healthy as trial volunteers seems sketchy. I get statistics, but they literally only tested this on 44k healthy people, the size of a small town in Illinois. To distribute to the entire world, where billions live.</p>
