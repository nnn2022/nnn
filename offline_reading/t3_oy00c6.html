    <p><p>I think it’s a good exercise for them to test their morals as a rhetorical question. These people are being radicalized; I can’t believe I live in a time like this.</p></p>

        <p>It really is scary to me. First of all, wishing death on someone who hasn't been vaccinated no matter what is awful and wrong. But there are parents out there who haven't gotten the vaccine because they know it will make them sick and they don't have anyone to look after their children. There are people who have lost their loved ones due to healthcare negligence and are scared to put their trust in people who have failed them before. But none of that matters to radical Covid justice warriors. They think their fear justifies anything and everything no matter what, no matter that they are wishing for children to be orphans and wishing for good people to die. They think so highly of themselves and their moral superiority that they believe they are already the Covid judge and jury, I don't think adding executioner to the list would matter much to them.</p>

        <p>I think that many that pose an ultimatum on loved ones, are conveniently using a time such as this to get them to PROVE what they are willing to do to sustain a relationship with them. It's extraordinarily mentally and emotionally unhealthy to participate in such ultimatum. On the other hand, it makes me suspect that many of these people that pose ultimatum are mentally unwell and that if enough loved ones refuse to participate in their mind game, they may well attempt suicide to attention seek.</p>

        <p>My fellow Christian brothers and sisters, at least some, still refuse to believe there is a massive conspiracy involving covid. They still believe everything the media tells them, even though we've caught them countless times lying to everybody. It's really sad though. Some people refuse to believe it, because they've never seen true evil before and they're constantly having a battle of wills inside their head over a mere possibility that the "conspiracy theorists" may have been right all along.</p>
