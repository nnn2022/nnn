        <p>It has its pros. A few days ago I was in a coffee shop and my mum told me to put on a mask because I was putting employees at risk and I pointed to the plexiglass and said "If a mask stops a the virus then so does this"</p>

        <p>well, it is important to keep in mind, that surgical-/ face masks have 0 effect on virus based infections and do make u sick:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. <strong>In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</strong> (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>however, i do agree, that stupid useless plexiglass walls are a less insane "measure", as they don't remove the basic freedoms from the customer and employee and they don't physically harm u or traumatize u in general.</p>
<p>but of course those plexiglass walls have no scientific basis, that i know of, same as social isolation, that is called by a fancier term now "social distancing".</p>
<p>hell u probs find far better studies on how physical contact is healthy for humans or animals, than u will find for the "benefits" of forced social isolation, which all those 6 feet apart madness is.</p>
<p>but hey now i am mostly speculating i guess, but yeah remember, that masks have 0 effect and feel free to read the data yourself :)</p>

<p>literally every respiratory infection/virus spreads the same way why woud this one be any different? everyone wants to use the "it's not just the flu bro" argument but it spreads like the flu, has the same symptoms as the flu, serious complications/pneumonia get treated like the flu but yeah totally not just the flu. totally</p>

        <p>in regards to that, i suggest, that u read on from this comment, which was a response to the "influenza is difference" idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ijfb0h/its_funny_because_its_true/g3e3sv3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ijfb0h/its_funny_because_its_true/g3e3sv3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>read the first comment  and the 2nd longer comment.</p>
<p>the comments go into detail, why u can't have proper studies on how effective face- /surgical masks might be for covid-19, because there is no proper covid-19 test.</p>
<p>if u don't know, whether or not someone is infected or not, then u obviously can't test, if someone protects u from getting infected.</p>
<p>with the PCR and antibody tests being completely worthless (other comments go into why and how it exactly matters), we are left with other virus based infection spread studies anyways, in this case influenza viruses.</p>
<p>another reason is, that some studies may take a long time and doing a bunch of them and adding them all together in a meta analysis (which is what i linked) takes even more time, so this is another reason, why using influenza virus based infection spread studies  are great to use and should be used and looked at here.</p>
<p>so at best, u will find a few week studies using worthless PCR tests to test infection rates and control groups. again this fails already at the PCR test level.</p>
<p>u will also find worse, that will create models based on an assumed effectiveness of face-/surgical masks, that will claim, that masks reduced infection and death rate by x. when u look at the garbage and u should look at that garbage, i suggest, that u sit back and remember, that u first need to find out whether or not the PCR tests used have any value at all and if u come to another conclusion than i did, then u have to compare whether or not the studies shown can be compared in strength to the meta analysis, that i linked, that used 10 RCTs for influenza of different strength.</p>
<p>so i mostly try to get u to think critical and think about the basic requirements for said covid-19 studies.</p>
<p>good luck for your search. also sci-hub is your friend to find pdfs from paywalled studies :) (use torbrowser, if your country blocks sci-hub)</p>

<p>well, feel free to link me a study, that doesn't rely on useless garbage rt-PCR "tests", that shows this :D, that shows, what u are claiming here.</p>
<p>if u don't understand, u can't do a proper study, if u don't even have a proper test for the virus, which we don't at the moment, unless u count a "test", that specifically is stated, that it can not be used for virus based infection testing.</p>
<p>reminder to u, that this "test" has no known false positive or negative rates and tests goats and fruit positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a> </p>
<p>as a result of this, u CAN NOT test how this supposed virus transmits itself, because u can't even test, if someone is positive properly to begin with.</p>
<p>u probably can for the different influenza viruses and we have a much longer history of studying it, so yes it does apply perfectly.</p>
<p>u claim, that it doesn't? first show me reliable covid-19 tests and then studies showing difference in transmission, that use those tests.</p>
<p>i doubt, that u will be able to do either, but hey i can be wrong, same as u. that is why we share references, so we can look  at them, rather than follow the blind believe from someone else.</p>

        <p>This person doesn't even understand how respiratory viruses, including influenza, spread.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is acting like any other respiratory virus and there is no reason to imply it's mode of transmission is special in any way. Touch was over emphasised at the start  - no idea why being this is a respiratory virus and touch isn't the major mode of transmission for such viruses. Touch/formite transmission is plausible for such viruses but in reality isn't a major issue to the point of all this sterilisation being needed and hand sanitizer every time people enter shops. It's found in aerosal samples too, unsurprising. </p>
<p>So all indications are that it's major modes of transmission are air transmission (non contact modes vs contact) just like other respiratory viruses including influenza and other coronaviruses - both course respiratory particles (larger "droplets" mostly released during sneezing and coughing) and fine respiratory particles (aerosols released during coughing, sneezing, talking, breathing). Followed lesser so by fomite/contact transmission.</p>
<p>Now of course what you are saying is true - hard to study transmission using PCR tests which are unreliable for detecting infection both ways. RT-PCR is also used for influenza along with other tests being available though.</p>

        <p>We have to work with the data we have, and our best data says that these "garbage" tests are at least indicative at large scales.</p>
<p>One cannot disregard evidence because its precision cannot be verified. Statistics show us that the tests are accurate, and that's what we have, even if it is not precise, statistical scales make it at least better than random noise.</p>

<p>uh...., i'm not sure u know what u just wrote there :D</p>
<p>false-positive and false-negative rates HAVE TO BE KNOWN for a test, to see if it would be better than random guesses to begin with.</p>
<p>it also HAS TO BE KNOWN, to create proper statistic, as death rate and infection rate statistics have to be adjusted for the false-positive and false-negative rates with unadjusted and adjusted values being openly accessible to the public.</p>
<p>of course covid-19 death counting doesn't even care what the cause of death is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state">https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state</a> </p>
<p>as they literally count motorcycle deaths as "covid-19 deaths", but that's another story.</p>
<p>again, it seems, that u don't understand what u wrote there.</p>
<p>this is fine btw, we all are learning.</p>
<p>i assume u don't have the references or reference, that i asked for, which is fine, but mostly i would like for u to understand that knowing false-positive and false-negative rates is required for a proper test.</p>
<p>i can give u a random example btw. a lot of other people can give u much better examples, but let's keep it simple.</p>
<p>so u have a worthless test, that will give u a basically random positive result at 1% of tests.</p>
<p>u test 1000000 people.</p>
<p>that means, that 10000 people will get a positive result with a test, while being negative.</p>
<p>this means, that without knowing specificity and sensitivity of tests (the actual scientific terms to show false-positive and false negative rates), the tests are worthless garbage, which they are....</p>
<p>&rt;without knowing specificity and sensitivity of tests, u are living in la la land.</p>
<p>one could say.</p>
<p>with tons of false-positive test results u can create nice high numbers to bring fear to people and remove freedoms.</p>
<p>if u combine tons of false-positive tests with insane death counting, that counts everyone "with" a positive covid-19 death as a "covid-19 death", then u push those numbers through the roof based on nothing.</p>
<p>and rest assured, that the motorcycle example isn't a rarity.</p>
<p>this is how it is done, as stated by the usa government, that is how they are counting:  <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09">https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09</a> </p>
<p>other countries do the same like austria for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html">https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html</a> </p>
<p>&rt; (1) Jede verstorbene Person, die zuvor COVID-positiv getestet wurde, wird in der Statistik als „COVID-Tote/r“ geführt, unabhängig davon, ob sie direkt an den Folgen der Viruserkrankung selbst oder „mit dem Virus“ (an einer potentiell anderen Todesursache) verstorben ist. </p>
<p>it's german, but it basically says, that everyone who dies with a positive test will be counted as a covid-19 death, regardless of what they actually died from.</p>
<p>there is also another great example of why precision and transparency is important and that is the original model, that predicted millions of deaths and came from the  little monster called neil ferguson.</p>
<p>he used 13+ year old flu garbage model written with thousands of lines of undocumented C code.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/neil_ferguson/status/1241835454707699713">https://twitter.com/neil_ferguson/status/1241835454707699713</a> </p>
<p>it is important to know, that this model was used to get most of the world into lockdown as this was used by the criminal politicians as excuse to remove freedoms.</p>
<p>then his locked source model suddenly got majorly downgraded</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/epidemiologist-behind-highly-cited-coronavirus-model-admits-he-was-wrong-drastically-revises-model">https://www.dailywire.com/news/epidemiologist-behind-highly-cited-coronavirus-model-admits-he-was-wrong-drastically-revises-model</a> </p>
<p>and then what do we have here, when the code was finally opened up:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/coding-led-lockdown-totally-unreliable-buggy-mess-say-experts/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/coding-led-lockdown-totally-unreliable-buggy-mess-say-experts/</a> </p>
<p>oh the neil ferguson imperial college model was worthless garbage and had nothing to do with reality, who could have guessed....</p>
<p>only everyone, who already threw their arms in the air, when those criminals were holding back the source code for this deliberate dumpster fire model, that got used to imprison the public.</p>
<p>do u see now, why your statement doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>tests without known false-positive and false-negative rates ARE NO TESTS and can't be used as tests, PERIOD!</p>
<p>please don't blindly accept numbers thrown up by the mainstream media, that have NOTHING to do with reality and i showed u, that they have nothing to do with reality. it is not my believe, but it is reference based facts.</p>
<p>again, please look at the references i put up, look at the research and articles and then realize, why what u wrote doesn't make any sense. once u realize that yourself, then u can't be fooled anymore by fake numbers and tons of fear thrown at u.</p>

        <p>No it doesn't rely heavily on fomite transmission at all. Transmission by touch is not influenza's primary transmission method or anywhere near it's most effective. The most effective is air transmission - both course respiratory particles (larger droplets mostly released when sneezing and coughing) and fine respiratory particles (smaller aerosols)</p>
<p>We don't know which of these two forms of transmission are most effective, some studies suggest about 50/50 and very minimal transmission by touch in reality. Evidence suggests that fine aerosols increase the risk of particular complications if you get the virus this way.</p>
<p>Pretty much exactly like other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Covid isn't special. </p>
<p><em>I don't know where you got the idea that influenza, a respiratory virus, relies on fomites to spread... and then think you can speak to others as if you have a clue when you don't even understand the basics of respiratory viral spread 🤷‍♀️</em></p>

        <p>I went by a shopping center yesterday (because, you know, I go out and do stuff, as opposed to living in fear), and I noticed a pretzel shop (because, you know, they are essential businesses even in the midst of a "global public health crisis") ... and they have a folding table set up at the door for their transactions (because I guess it helps to "stop the spread" by having all the customers pile into this tiny little doorway rather than go in and maximize the indoor space) ... and they only accept cash payments (because I guess debit and credit cards somehow cause viruses to spread more than exchanging cash).</p>

        <p>Shared this on my facebook and a lot of my friends (who are normally all about social distancing, masking, etc...) liked/reacted to it. Clearly they are capable of seeing the ridiculousness of some of these measures. So how can I then bridge the gap to being skeptical of masks? They're willing to laugh at this, but are dead serious about face coverings.</p>

        <p>While the pores in a mask are infact larger than the actual virus particle, the virus does not travel alone in the air.
When you sneeze, cough, talk, or even breath, you are releasing particles of water every time, many of which are light enough to stick in the air for a bit. When you are sick these particles contain thousands if not millions of viruses.
These droplets are what is absorbed by a mask, making the virus inert by drying it, and the plexiglass at many stores is another measure of stopping these droplets. Instead of the droplets hitting the face or eyes of the person, they are stopped by the glass. This only works for larger droplets which is why you should also wear a mask. Edit: also commonly touched surfaces are less likely forms of transmission than breathing in particles, it is still possibly but unlikely. and the plastic covering the touch pads are likely there to make them easier to disinfect as it is a flatter surface and the electronics are less likely to be damaged.</p>

        <p>N95 masks only protect the wearer from getting the virus. They are not designed to stop the wearer from transmitting anything. Isn't the whole point of mass mask wearing that nonsick people with no symptoms might transmit it anyway, so wear a mask to protect others?</p>
