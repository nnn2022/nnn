        <p>As a "Doomer", I'll respond real quick.</p>
<p>We are nothing like the strawman this guy thinks we are. We aren't anti-freedom or anti-social, otherwise, we wouldn't be on Zoom. I don't know why you say we hate freedom. We love freedom. That's why we are pro-mask and pro-science. So you can continue to live and cherish freedom in this amazing country. Can you please explain to me how masks remove your freedom? That's like saying wearing clothes removes your freedom. What makes masks any different? </p>
<p>We actually don't enjoy this new life at all and we want to get out of it just like you do. So the best way to get out of it? Wear masks, stay 6 feet (2 meters) away from people, and get outside only if you have to. If we do this long enough and when the vaccine comes out, we can return to normalcy again and we can learn from COVID and what to do during the next pandemic.</p>

<p>COVID skeptics truly lack empathy and do not care about their fellow man. I'm not straw-manning you, I'm quoting exactly what you said word for word.</p>
<p>&rt; My constitutional rights and freedoms override your safety. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court disagrees with you. In Jacobson v. Massachsetts (1905) which ruled that public safety overrides personal freedom.</p>
<p>&rt; This subreddit is for folks like me. Why are you here? You think lecturing and trying to shame really works? </p>
<p>I'm here because I care. I care about my fellow man and want to end this virus so we can get back to normal life without having to worry about getting COVID-19. I want you to live, I want you to be able to enjoy the beauty of life and all it has to offer. We just have to endure some minor inconveniences so that we can have a chance to get to normal life faster. Think of it as tough love. If this were a harmless ideology, I would've ignored it. But it's this ideology that's making us a laughing stock in front of the world.</p>
<p>The good news is, you don't have to be like this forever, you can go back to square one and be a caring human again by wearing a mask again, staying 6 feet (2 meters) from the nearest person, and going outside only if you absolutely have to.</p>

"Minor inconveniences"&lt;&lt;&lt;Here in Chicago, March thru July we were completely shut down. I was unable to attend my mental health clinic, AA meetings, church, ect......I'm now drunk, mentally unstable and violent. I suggest you don't confront people about not wearing masks in public. Store employees are getting physically assaulted for confronting shoppers about wearing masks. It's time for YOU and "Grandma" to suck it up and stay home.

What makes Covid so special? Are people still dying from cancer, drug overdoses and suicides? Why are you Covid folks so selfish?! We are destroying our younger generations to save 80yr old Grandmas who are dying anyways. I value a child's life much more than a grandparent. I know it's harsh but it's the truth.</p>

<p>COVID is highly contagious. Cancer, drug overdoses, and suicide are not contagious. </p>

Almost 700,000 people/yr die of cardiovascular disease IN THE U.S. ALONE...and obesity is known to be psychologically contagious...but you're not demanding a ban on fast foods...why? Maybe it has something to do with respecting people's choices to live their lives how they see fit, even if you disagree with them?</p>

Most people don't. It's why people are moving on from the Corona virus. You like to minimize people's mental health issues in your Covid crusade. You enjoy being the Mask Police and lecturing others. At least, I'm upfront and honest about not caring about other people.</p>

        <p>What evidence do you have that "following the rules" will get us "back to normal"? These muhfuckas been lying since March...this started with "2 weeks to flatten the curve!" Lol...they'll keep moving the goalposts and you're so passive that you just take these "authorities" at their word that people you don't know at all, have your best interest at heart.</p>

<p>In countries that listened to scientists from the get-go, COVID cases have gone down significantly. The best example of this is New Zealand where they've only had 25 deaths from COVID. Trump didn't listen to scientists and that's one of the reasons why our COVID deaths are so high.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But my point still stands as New Zealand still listened to their scientists and we didn't.</p>
<p>&rt;  If you are comparing New Zealand to America and their Covid responses you have no idea whats going on, and just believed all the fear mongering because it would make Trump look bad. </p>
<p>We aren't doing this to make Trump look bad. He's doing that to himself and we're just pointing it out. We're also pointing out what New Zealand's PM did right which was listening to scientists and adjusting COVID policy accordingly.</p>

<p>*You're. I am from Austin, TX. Although, last July, I went to Portland to visit my dying grandmother (not from COVID). My uncle and cousin also live there. It's actually one of my favorite cities in the US and I would move there if I could.</p>
<p>&rt; Are you obese? </p>
<p>No. But even if I was, how would that disprove my points?</p>
<p>&rt; I figure there has to be a reason why you are so frightened of Covid. </p>
<p>I'm actually not afraid. I'm just following the correct safety precautions and just making the most of a bad situation. Also, making fun of those who are fearful of COVID is hugely offensive to them. Many of these people have anxiety about this and rightfully so about their lives and those that they know.</p>

<p>Why do you hate elderly people so much? They're people like you and me. And we should wish them the best and hope that they live the longest that they can.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you "get off" on lecturing others? I'm trying to understand why you take upon yourself to be a Covid crusader? </p>
<p>I'm doing this because this Anti-mask ideology is killing so many people and is damaging our reputation as a country. Sure, these people may exist in other countries, but they are a ridiculously small minority. </p>
<p>&rt; I don't have empathy for people like you. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have empathy for you. We are members of the same species and I don't want you to suffer and die from this virus. I'm wearing a mask so that in the highly unlikely event we run into each other, I won't give you COVID if I'm asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Then why have our top scientists endorsed Joe Biden?  It's because he has the correct idea of how to combat COVID-19 while at the same time saving our economy from any damage this pandemic has caused.</p>
<p>It sucks that our economy has been damaged. I agree with you on that. I would argue a UBI would fix this issue while we're waiting for COVID cases to go down.</p>

        <p>&rt; Can you please explain to me how masks remove your freedom? That's like saying wearing clothes removes your freedom. What makes masks any different?</p>
<p>There's a WILDLY huge difference between the two. Clothes are essential because they protect from the elements. But masks are not effective against a viral infection. There's nothing healthy about breathing in your own germs back into your mouth. Masks are filthy and don't help anything.</p>
<p>There's also the big matter of being <strong>FORCED</strong> to wear masks. THAT is infringing on freedom.</p>

        <p>&rt; But masks are not effective against a viral infection.</p>
<p>Do me a favor and sneeze into a tissue with no mask on. Then, sneeze into a tissue with a mask on and you will see fewer germs on the tissue with a mask on than the tissue with no mask on. </p>

<p>I wouldn't say you're forced to wear a mask. But it is strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Many places can refuse service to those who don't wear masks. So you're free to not wear a mask, but at the cost of places refusing service to you. Actions have consequences and this is one such example.</p>

<p>Violence is usually the first resort of a weak mind. Smart and empathetic people would never hurt those who make polite requests such as wearing a mask.</p>

<p>That's exactly what being forced to means, and how restrictive it is on freedom. Mandates are not okay.</p>

<p>The thing is, you sneeze into a mask, those germs are still there, on your face. You breath those germs back in. It's not gonna keep you or anyone else safe. It's a disgusting incubator of germs.</p>
