        <p>This is after a year of them not investigating, and not having a team on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone believes you.  Totally nothing suspicious about that.  Like, not at all.</p>

        <p>I did see a brief news report on TV where a WHO investigator literally said their team couldn't find no further evidence to anything just because they weren't allowed to get full clearance to go look where they wanted to look, and their last investigation (of a couple of weeks ago) in China was therefore inconclusive. She concluded this WHO dossier could only end up to be set as "ongoing" eternally. It was very clear because of her frustrated body language they were denied access and information and that China ostentatively held back on info and covered up. But of course, that's not what the WHO officially can publish.</p>

        <p>Who says they cannot officially publish that? I think various people in WHO should publish books of their own on this subject and throw the middle finger to that Chinese plant head of the WHO.</p>

        <p>That would only be seen as a conspiracy theory, as there is no proof to anything. Stating there's a coverup without proof is not exactly a strong position to hold against the CCP. It would end those people's careers while they have better chance to find proof from within the system. I'm sure that even this swift appearance of that WHO researcher in China, clearly showing her being frustrated by the way China is unwilling to cooperate, will have come at some cost to her.</p>
