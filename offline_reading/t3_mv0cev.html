        <p>The only reason I want people dead from “tha vairus” is to prove these lockdowns are justified. Show me the fucking bodies and I’ll stay home.</p>
<p>As an Ontarian living in a police state, it makes me want to fucking puke knowing how authoritarian our leaders can become essentially overnight. They smell blood and they jump at the wound like they’ve learned nothing from the ‘40s.</p>
<p>Show me the dead bodies, show me the overwhelmed hospitals. Like, come on, running out of beds isn’t overwhelmed. Choosing who lives and who dies isn’t overwhelmed. Show me scores of people dying in the hallways and outside the hospital. Show me “do not proceed to your local hospital, they cannot treat you” messages. That’s overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The current police state authoritarian dictatorship nonsense that is going on right now here in Ontario (and also in BC. for some reason)  is unjustified until we get bodies in the streets. Show them to me￼.</p>

        <p>This has played out across most of the world. There's the media pseudo-reality and official Govt narrative, then there's actual reality.</p>
<p>Most parts of the world have lived through a simulation of a pandemic and not an actual pandemic. Yes, a virus has circulated, but did it really meet the criteria for being a pandemic? Not in most cities, counties, states, provinces, regions, etc.</p>
<p>In March 2020 TV screens worldwide were flooded with images of hospitals being overwhelmed. Some images were purportedly from Wuhan, so should have been taken with a grain of salt, while others were legitimately from Italy. However, it was one specific area (Lombardy) and a maximum of about 2 hospitals during a very specific timeframe. A few images later popped up from NYC and Madrid but it was never quite clear that they were truly showing an overwhelmed health system, or simply a busy hospital (and many inner-city hospitals are busy ALL THE TIME).</p>
<p>The story was simple: this is about to happen everywhere. But where was the evidence aside from these same images being replayed over and over, and a rolling tally of cumulative worldwide "case" counts? There was none!</p>
<p>So they manufactured a response and used the response itself as evidence.</p>
<p>"The hospitals are at near capacity!" they said, after reducing available beds and closing entire wings.</p>
<p>"The virus is so dangerous and spreading so fast, it's unsafe to go outside!" they said, after issuing local stay-at-home orders or simply locking down an entire country using emergency powers issued overnight.</p>
<p>"Healthcare staff are working tirelessly day and night treating covid patients!" they said, showing a few select videos from a few select ICU nurses and doctors in a few select hospitals, who were indeed treating covid patients -- but there was hardly any difference between that and the work they do virtually every winter season treating pneumonia patients, flu patients, and many other very critically ill or elderly people.</p>
<p>"Covid is so horrible patients are dying agonising deaths!" they said, while optiing for invasive intubation procedures and ventilation, and suppressing any knowledge-sharing of treatment protocols from primary-care physicians, as well as banning the prescription of antivirals like hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>"Covid deaths are growing exponentially!" they said, as they launched a mass testing regime across hospitals and care homes (places where lots of people die every day and a wide array of pathogens circulate) and applied a completely unreliable and unscientific protocol to a test not intended for diagnostic purposes.</p>
<p>I mean I could go on, but it's fucking sinister the way we've all been played when you start to dig into it and realise what has actually been happening...</p>

        <p>I remember one particular image, or video footage that supposedly came from Italy. One of the nightly national news programs showed the same exact footage, and labeled it as NYC. </p>
<p>I know it's very easy to accidentally put the wrong text with a photo/video, but the MSM has a poor track record, and I don't doubt it was total bullshit.</p>

        <p>I heard about this.</p>
<p>What's crazy is that it doesn't matter that they mixed up the images -- people remember it as an overwhelmed hospital in NYC regardless.</p>
<p>This is how propaganda works. When an image or a narrative is repeated enough times, it gets implanted in people and <em>it stays there</em>. It becomes the accepted reality.</p>
<p>The "overwhelmed hospitals" trope is one of the most entrenched. </p>
<p>I bet there's people living in sparsely populated regions, in places as far from the hotspots as one could get, who steadfastly believe their local hospital was on the verge of being overwhelmed last March, and that the only thing which prevented it happening was adherence to dumb rules.</p>

        <p>I have a new job now, but I worked in a fairly busy ER during the first few months of "lockdown". It was dead. Dead as in, lots of employees got to go home early if it was their turn. I was able to leave a few times. Prior to March/April 2020, the last time it was slow enough for me to leave early was sometime in 2014. </p>
<p>As far as the Intensive Care Unit, plenty of hospitals actually have small units. My ER was 60 beds, the ICU was only 16 beds, with one always open in case a patient on a regular med/surg floor went downhill. Our ICU was almost always at capacity, it wasn't a new issue. But to hear the MSM say they're all at capacity, sounds concerning to someone who has no idea how a hospital works. Plenty of my friends and family were very surprised to hear my hospital was empty for about 4 months straight.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your insider's story and perspective.</p>
<p>It aligns with what many have said -- usually anonymously as there has been a campaign of top-down suppression. Doctors and healthcare workers in the UK have been told not to comment on covid publicly for fear of losing their jobs.</p>

        <p>The stats back what your friend is saying too. Overall ICU admissions are actually a bit lower than normal. I learned a long time ago not to ever take what the media says at face value. The media can pump out all the fear in the world but raw statistics don't lie and will always tell the true story.</p>

        <p>Ontario subreddit was flipping out over a tweet yesterday saying that people were being denied ventilators. I wanted to scream: if this is true, then the apocalypse we have worked so hard to prevent is here. And it's so benign that, if the media doesn't let us know, it would have no effect on our lives and we would otherwise live in complete ignorance of the ongoing apocalypse.</p>
<p>People were legit saying: OMG imagine IF there was a terrorist attack, or WWIII happened now? It would be a disaster! Like.... it would be a fucking disaster anyways but forget that. We're moving the goal post all the way to: We need to prevent covid BECAUSE it COULD overwhelm hospitals, which is bad BECAUSE that COULD limit the ability of hospitals to handle a hypothetical nuclear war.</p>

        <p>&rt; how authoritarian our leaders can become essentially overnight.</p>
<p>In all fairness, they've always been this authoritarian... They can just get away with it now because the covidiots would rather live under tyranny than face a 0.05% risk of dying from a virus.</p>

You want bodies in the streets, so that your freedom to go shopping or whatever fucking useless activity you fill your brain dead, narrow life with, isn't disrupted? This madness, you fucking dumbwit. Go work on your life, your self-deceit, your ignorance while you got plenty of time to do during lockdown.

        <p>Who do you think wants the stricter lock downs.  Weeks leading up to it people on r/Ontario were calling for Australian style lockdown and were shaming parents on playgrounds then flipped their stance when Ford caught shit because they're duplicitous cowards.  If it were an NDP or lib Gov, or if Trudeau comes in with the military, you'll clap like seals.  Socialists seem to have no problem with big government or watching businesses close because they're already government dependents and want everyone to be the same.  Want that ODSP to become UBI so they don't feel as bad about themselves.</p>

        <p>Who cares about cases? Look at hospitalization and deaths. A case doesn’t even mean you’re sick with covid19. All PCR tests do is check to see if the sars-cov-2 virus is present in your body. If you use PCR threshold higher than 30, it’s most likely a false positive anyways.</p>

        <p>So suddenly, the Indian government starting doing mass testings all over India, like in bus stops. As we all know, the PCR tests are around 2% accurate. So the number of cases are inflated.</p>
<p>As others has said, it's all about hospitalization, which doesn't have much patients for COVID.</p>

        <p>Care to share that proof? Cause if I remember correctly, a few months ago more people were dying per day from covid than there were people who died in 9/11, so I would think to call a 9/11-like event every single day kinda significant. Although I guess you guys can admit you don't care about humans as individuals, seeing that many people die from something so preventable probably doesn't phase you at all, huh?</p>

        <p>Such as Sweden? They never locked down businesses, elementary schools, cafes, restaurants, shops, etc. no one wore masks. Just common sense staying home when feeling ill and washing hands, as per 2019 WHO pandemic guidelines, and they had far lower excess mortality than <a href="http://tt.omni.se/sveriges-dodstal-bland-de-lagre-i-europa/a/LnjG91">two thirds</a> of European countries, despite an abnormally low 2019 mortality (build up of elderly and susceptible) AND messing up the quarantine of nursing homes (like almost every other country).</p>
<p>There's Florida, Texas, South vs North Dakota, etc.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://thefatemperor.com/published-papers-and-data-on-lockdown-weak-efficacy-and-lockdown-huge-harms/">several dozen analyses</a> now showing A) very little if any correlation (let alone causation) between COVID mortality and lockdown stringency, globally, and B) the enormous collateral damage and second order effects and deaths from said lockdowns.</p>

        <p>idk how many are still around, but they definitely had their own hate subreddits.  a bunch of them went off to join / make Parlor.  These people dont care about details, they just care about their own narrative even if there's nothing to back it up</p>

        <p>It is actually. Because if hospitals have too many patients than many people can go untreated thus raising the mortality rate.</p>

        <p>That’s fine! Go ahead and blindly scoop up and believe everything you hear from main stream media.  The truth is you do not know why there are or are not lots of cases. Latest science, however, says lockdowns and masks don’t work. You might try checking out some actual science as opposed to constant propaganda of fear mongering. And while you’re at it, check out how many many lives have been lost from suicide, domestic abuse and people unable to get critical care they desperately needed. The whole thing is criminal. But fortunes have been made (upper 1%), leaving middle workers losing jobs and business and reduced to poverty. Please don’t argue this part. These are published facts. Could you try using your own actual brain for a second? No? Well, I tried.</p>

        <p>They've been systematically brain washed into believing everything the establishment says as gospel. It's the very nature of being blue pilled. I've been thinking about how I could be one in an alternate universe. I don't think we should blame them, just slowly point things out and hopefully they go all in or at least recognize the narrative and choose to ignore it (my wife is like this).</p>

        <p>Really? Do you really think that people choosing to sacrifice their social lives, exercise, and family connections are doing that because they want to see you die? That's bullshit and you know it. 500k Americans are dead. 500k. From this virus. People are wearing masks, and trying to distance and being miserable all for the sake of trying to save your life and the life of your families, not wish them dead. Get out of your echo chamber and talk to some real reasonable humans with empathy. You saying that shit is disgusting, regardless if you think that Covid is a hoax (which it isn't), but it also invalidates millions of people's genuine hard working efforts to save other people's lives.</p>

        <p>No. I believe in delaying gratification for the future. I believe in that there is something more to this universe than simply existing. I believe that by taking the Eucharist, I am accepting Jesus Christ, his forgiveness of our sins, and ever lasting peace on this earth. I believe that going to confession is a deeply spiritual ritual that helps me absolve things I’ve done wrong.  </p>
<p>I believe that raising my kids in a two parent household who are actively engaged in giving 100% of their life to their family and expecting nothing in return. I believe that my engagement in the knights of Columbus that raises 60k a year for my small community regardless of the recipients religious leanings is a good thing. I believe that self reflection and prayer makes people analyze their life. </p>

        <p>I agree. I used to be catholic myself, and all you said is great, IMO. I’d worry about the delay grat though. If you can’t be (for whatever reason) gratified now, you won’t be ‘then’, whenever then is. It’ll still be ‘now’.</p>

        <p>Why can't you self reflect, analyze your life, and volunteer in the community without believing in Santa Claus? I think it's great how you make fun of a group of people for believing in something that you think has no evidence of being real, while also believing in a fairy tale based on an ancient book that 1.3 billion other people believe with 0 evidence at all. Do you need to wait until confession to do all your self reflection or can you analyze now why what you're saying is hilarious to me?</p>

<p>Lmao. You still don't get it. I don't have a problem with "us catholics," I have a problem with you. Because you're here, in your echo chamber, admitting you believe in fairy tales, while making fun of people in echo chambers who believe in fairy tales (covid has a lot more evidence than Catholicism but that's beside the point.) </p>
<p>It's a problem because I have seen covid hurt so many people in my small town. One of my friend's mothers was the sweetest ladies I've ever met, and she spent her last days hooked up to a machine in a hospital away from her family. As someone with a mother, I constantly put myself in her son's shoes and I couldn't imagine it. Knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of families that went through something like this breaks my heart. And yet, here you are, whining because you can't go to Chucky's and get a beer with the boys because everything's on lockdown. That is the problem. </p>
<p>&rt;Also: at every response you find a new way to dismiss a belief in God as nonsense. </p>
<p>Because it is. Spoiler: you are a grown man who believes in magic. It's time to grow up. </p>
<p>&rt;I’ve never insulted you or your beliefs. It comes off as petty.</p>
<p>Your existence as a pathetic whiner is petty. Take a break off of the anti covid subreddits and go interact with your children because they probably hate you.  Their dad spends time patting strangers on the back for not being a sheep and taking anti jerk off lessons. I feel bad for them. I really hope you actually do some self reflection one day in that booth instead of whatever you did to turn out like this.</p>

        <p>Honestly I was just bored and wanted to see what kind of sad person comments on a subreddit like this regularly. I picked the guy posturing like he's a big smart man who knows better than those stupid "blue pilled" people who turned out to be a part of the largest religious denominations in the world and also doesn't have enough self control to stop touching his own dick. I mean, that's literally all on one page, it was one click. I just found it hilarious. I mean, just all that right there tells you all you need to know about this person. It's so perfect you couldn't write it any better. If conservatives had a sense of humor you'd realize how objectively funny it is. </p>
<p>People can pray, whatever I do not give a fuck. Just don't brag about how you're not a sheep who believes in fairytales and in the same breath, with no hint of self awareness, state that you eat the blood of the lord every weekend. You're all sheep, just different sheep than the ones you make fun of. That's the part that's funny to me. As for the covid stuff, there's a pretty healthy middle ground between total shutdown of everything and covid is fake. That is where I am at,  like most normal people. Not circlejerking lame memes with my stupid buddies and whining all the time</p>

        <p>YOU are a big baby. Luckily you feel like your way is THE way. Nice for you! You have no idea what these persons think or why they think it.
You are a nasty person. You don’t know what’s magic and what is not. How would you possibly know? Oh right, you believe whatever the ‘majority’ seems to believe. Better watch out. All that is starting to change. You might be forced to change what you think, since obviously you don’t think for yourself. Saying ‘I’m the middle of the road’, that’s what they all say when they want to appear as a right person. Good luck.</p>

        <p>This sub is not dedicated to 'Covid denial' (Although there is some of that here), it's about questioning the response to Covid and the authoritarian shift of power from the people to the elite.</p>

<p>This specific thread was about Texas been wide open for weeks and there has not been any significant spike in cases or deaths. How is that Covid denailism?</p>

        <p>Yes, that's why I included the second link which covers the amount of total excess deaths.  </p>
<p>Even if you claim that a significant portion of reported covid deaths are actually from other causes, that wouldn't explain why there's been such an incredible increase in overall deaths from all causes.  </p>

        <p>So according to the second link, there were ~560,000 American deaths (covid and excess combined) between January and October 2020.</p>
<p>There have been 14.8 suicides per 100k people in the US in 2020 - which is around 50k total. This is an order of magnitude less than the total covid and excess deaths. </p>

        <p>you are a fucking dipshit aren't you, the excess deaths wasn't 560,000, it was "PRESUMED INVOLVEMENT WITH COVID"</p>
<p>the excess deaths is dramatically lower, the suicides were higher, and they account for MOST of the excess</p>
<p>you are clearly deliberately conflating either out of some sick desperate need to believe that all the lies we were fed are surely justified SOMEHOW.. or because you are a fucking troll, either way ive wasted enough time for you</p>

        <p>Read more, yell less. From my second link:</p>
<p>&rt;Besides visualizing excess mortality as a percentage difference, we can also look at the raw death count as shown here in this chart. The raw death count helps give us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 360,000 more deaths than the five-year average between 26 January and 3 October 2020, compared to 209,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths during that period.</p>

        <p>Just take your life back as much as possible, is my recommendation. I don't know where you live (if you're in Canada, you may be SOL), but I live in one of the most tyrannically led states, but that hasn't stopped me from going out to eat whenever I can, going to movies whenever I can afford to, and taking trips all around the country with my kids to other states, particularly ones less locked down, and tyrannically led. I highly recommend it, if you can!</p>

        <p>You know why I am happy to see that people aren't dying from this gathering yet? Because I'm not a psychopath! And most other "doomers" aren't either. Politicians be damned; I follow the science and the numbers. If the medical/scientific consensus is that 500k americans are dead because we couldnt follow guidelines, then that is a tradegy. If a group of people can go to a sports game, in spite of the risk, and most come out just fine? That's awesome; I'd like to see a case study done to identify what precisely made it so safe relative to all the body of evidence we have that indicates gatherings like this are dangerous. Maybe it was because it was outside, maybe because there is a more space between people, maybe it was because of the vaccine rolling out, maybe it was because of falling case number, etc etc. If these sorts of events are safe, excellent! It further informs what science/medicine know about the entire situation. This being a success (which we don't yet know to be true, since there isn't a detailed tracking of every person who attended that game and their later testing status) would be wonderful. However, that in no way invalidates other scientific consensus about risk around the disease. Most risk revolves around indoor transmission, maskless, for longer than a short period exposure. This is still the case. So, like outdoor dining, can outdoor sporting events be a perfectly reasonable thing to normalize again, given a solid study of the data and informed decision making? Absolutely. Does it own the doomers and invalidate all other safety precautions trying to actually save the lives of everyone in society from a highly contagious disease that could really alter your health for life, or even kill you? Not really.</p>

        <p>I'll give you a pass then. :) I just talk trash to you folks to fire ya up a bit. I've been to Toronto and thought it was a wonderful city. But when it comes to Covid, it seems like you folks love to "snitch" on one another. You should be blaming your government for not getting more vaccines.</p>

        <p>It’s good to see it, and Chris Sky is fing awesome. But it has to be an uprising. I guess it starts somewhere, but if it hasn’t happened after 13 months of this fucking bullshit...I wouldn’t hold your breath. People are “all in” and don’t want to admit they got fleeced. Sad that people would rather isolate themselves from
humanity than grow a pair and admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>This is how tyranny flourishes, fyi, we are watching in real time. Historians are shaking their heads.</p>

<p>Statistics say unless you’ve got major health issues (80% of people in the hospital were overweight/obese) you’re not going to die, hell you’re probably not going to have lasting side effects. 99.98% you’re going to be alright.</p>

        <p>That’s well and good for you, but if you could minimise potential risk to other people with underlying health conditions, wouldn’t you do anything you could in order to prevent them from possibly dying? I don’t see the argument here. Is discomfort from wearing a mask more of an issue to you then potentially killing someone?</p>

        <p>Every day I leave my house, I calculate the risk of “well I could die today or I could kill someone in my car.” Statistically, I’m not going to kill anyone via Covid, let alone know if I did. </p>
<p>I don’t leave my home when I have a cold or the flu or any other illness sans allergies. And I have been doing that LONG before this coronavirus variant. </p>
<p>Did you wear a mask when you went outside or to see people after the flu? What if you’re a carrier for strep throat and never get symptoms but shed and spread that virus? How many people have you unknowingly killed by not remaining muzzled and locked up forever?</p>

        <p>I think you’re trying to generalise something that you can’t really generalise. Flu strains have been around forever and working knowledge has been put in place to minimise harm for more at risk people. COVID is completely new, has a 10x mortality rate then most flu variants and we had no way to fight it apart from basic things like wearing masks to reduce transmissions. </p>
<p>Regardless of this though, I’m still failing to see the downsides of wearing a mask. Even after COVID, if it reduces mortality rate on at risk people for the common flu, I think it would be a good idea to keep on wearing them in situations that call for it.</p>

        <p>Then you take your free will, and keep wearing it. You have no fight from me on that. I care not who wears them. I refuse to let the State tell me what my “freedoms” are based on some lab coat technocrats. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the flu has been around forever. Coronaviruses have also been around forever, Covid is a coronavirus strain...the first human coronavirus was isolated by the University of Chicago 50 years ago. Covid is also a SARS coronavirus which until 2003 wasn’t really anything worried about since it has the same symptoms of the common cold. </p>
<p>So no, I don’t buy the claim Covid is “completely new.” The way the world governments reacted to it was the “new” part no one wants.</p>

        <p>the problem is, it was made mandatory illegally.  the way laws are passed is our elected officials write and vote on bills.  we are not a monarchy and we are not ruled by edicts from on high.  if its so important, make a law or stfu.  they won't, though, because they know their virtue signaling will cost them votes and possibly their jobs.  then there's the blatant doomer hypocrisy.  all these so called leaders out eating, getting their haircuts, etc, while telling us common folk we have to stay home, shutter our businesses, and wait for daddy government to take care of us, which, anyone with common sense knew, never works and always ends up with the politicians using the money to grease their donors, which is exactly what the democrats did with every covid relief bill.</p>

        <p>Your statements makes no fucking sense man lol but I’ll break it down for you. Saying that covid is "Deadly" is relative. It has a 0.2% infection fatality rate. The vast majority of those it "kills" are at, near, or past the age of life expectancy (and even in those over 80, there's still a 95% survival rate and a pretty high percentage of very mild cases). It's "deadly" the same way the common flu is, but in some ways it is actually less deadly than flu, as flu has a higher chance (5-10 times higher) of killing children and young people. So no, I wouldn't call this deadly. Ebola is deadly...a 0.2% IFR respiratory virus that kills the old and infirm is not. The whole bullshit "highly dangerous and deadly" narrative peddled by media, governments, and their anointed "experts" are why we're in this mess. The fact that the population has absolutely no understanding of how deadly this virus is (and apparently no understanding of basic math and science either) is why we're in this horrible dystopian, Orwell meets Idiocracy nightmare.</p>

<p>Science is not about belief you absolute moron. It's about evidence, critical thinking and doubting the dogma.
You believe in your own bullshit version of "science" where you blindly <strong>believe</strong> and <strong>trust</strong> whatever bullshit news article the media show in front of you.</p>

        <p>I never disputed that the burden of proof is on me.</p>
<p>Former White House medical staff member Dr. William Lang said that the lower rates of infection and increasing rates of vaccination in Texas give the decision more credibility. It's difficult to find a specific credible source (Twitter is not a credible source) about this because it's a pretty specific event, but he's a medical expert and he said that. Also, masks were required for all spectators except when they were eating or drinking, so that played a role as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/sports-and-covid-19-what-happened-earlier-this-summer/">This</a> is the best I've got. It's not the best source, but it's better than Twitter in any case.</p>

        <p>Thanks. According to the picture and what I have already figured, not everyone wore a mask. And even if it's just for eating and drinking (you know, because covid magically stops spreading when people eat? 😂), that still counts as being maskless. Also, obviously no social distancing.</p>
<p>But anyway, "Tarrant County, where Globe Life Field is located, and neighboring Dallas County both have about a 20 percent rate of fully vaccinated people, with about 30 percent partially vaccinated."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, based on other sources, I'm not convinced these experimental,  for emergency use "vaccines" stop the spread. It's been a year and I honestly just think it's herd immunity and the fact asymptomatic people are just rare.</p>

        <p>Neither I nor anyone else ever said that the virus stops spreading when you eat. But it's impractical to wear a mask while eating because, well, you can't eat due to your mouth being covered. You want to protect yourself with a mask when you can. When you are eating, you cannot.</p>
<p>The vaccines do greatly limit the spread. https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2021/03/04/vaccine-transmission
This article is fairly dated, so please let me know if you have a more recent source that contradicts it. I'm not sure about the credibility of the source itself, but it cites reliable studies, so I'm trusting it.</p>
<p>Also,
https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2M70MW
the vaccines are not experimental.</p>
<p>https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=29806&amp;publicId=395
A fair percentage of cases were asymptomatic. This article is dated about 3 weeks before the Pfizer vaccine got emergency use authorization from the FDA. So the number was pretty high.</p>

        <p>Also important here is that I'm willing to bet nobody asked.  I'm willing to bet those 40k people went there not knowing who was vaccinated and who wasn't.  The venue made no effort to check or make themselves liable.  This is what needs to happen.  People need to be allowed to assess their own risk and get on with life.  This is the only way out of this thing.</p>

        <p>The vaccines aren't perfect, hence why I said "largely." Plus, if the claim in the tweet that there were no deaths is true, then that probably means that among those who didn't have the vaccine, they did not have the virus and/or were at low risk. I specifically cited the vaccines because that is the main thing that has changed.</p>

<p>No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.</p>

<p>Do you have a degree in that field?</p>

<p>No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

        <p>I do not have a degree in the field, no. But others do. And by providing you a source, I am providing arguments made by people who have degrees in the field.</p>
<p>Anyway, the source you provided is from 3 months ago and is outdated at this point. The actual reason that Fauci provided for the drop was that holiday season was over and the new cases were dropping because of that. At the time, this was true. But now, holiday season has been over for over 3 months. That argument no longer holds water.</p>

<p>With vaccines have come lower cases. Consistently. I understand that correlation is not causation. But clearly, something is affecting the change in new COVID-19 cases. So what do you think it is?</p>

<p>It's politics, always has been, made evident when the WHO said:</p>
<p>&rt;WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that <strong>careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed</strong> (<em>1</em>). <strong>The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load</strong>. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology."</p>

<p>That was published moments after Biden's inauguration and guess what? With careful interpretation have come lower cases. If you want to talk about something that "is affecting the change in new COVID-19 cases", look no further.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fauci said this a month ago:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>We are unsure right now what the protection is against infection</strong>, because it’s conceivable that you could <strong>get vaccinated</strong>, get exposed, <strong>get infected</strong>, not know it because the vaccine is protecting you against symptoms, but that you could have virus in your nasal pharynx, which is the reason why we say <strong>until we prove that the vaccine prevents transmission</strong>, that people who were vaccinated should wear a mask when they’re near people who might be vulnerable to infection</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fauci also said this a few days on the 12th:</p>
<p>&rt;For the time being, until we show definitively, that a person who's vaccinated does not get this sub-clinical infection and can spread to others, you should also continue to wear a mask.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/mehdi-on-msnbc/watch/sen-bernie-sanders-on-historic-alabama-unionizing-vote-109656645892">https://www.msnbc.com/mehdi-on-msnbc/watch/sen-bernie-sanders-on-historic-alabama-unionizing-vote-109656645892</a></p>

<p>They intend for this to go on forever, which is why two weeks is now 13 months. They dangled freedom in front of us if we got the mRNA shot, then went back and said it's because of lockdowns and antisocial distancing that cases are down. The goalposts are moving so quick they must have wheels and an engine.</p>
<p>This all leads to the great reset, and I think they're going to use both the fear of new variants and the fear of climate change to get it done. A CNN technical director even admitted that climate change is the next fear-mongering campaign.</p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@ProjectVeritas:7/part-1-cnn-director-admits-network:7">https://odysee.com/@ProjectVeritas:7/part-1-cnn-director-admits-network:7</a></p>
<p>This is how I think they'll do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work from home = less cars on the road = less climate change.</li>
<li>Travel restrictions = less plane flights = less climate change.</li>
<li>Less meat = less methane = less climate change.</li>
<li>4IR + UBI = less businesses = less climate change.</li>

<p>If you're referring to the executive orders that Biden signed around the start of his presidency, then yes, and I am contending that the executive orders relating to the virus are contributing to keeping the case count lower.</p>
<p>&rt;With kids in cages have come lower cases.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about this. Do you have a source that shows this correlation? In any case, vaccines, warmer temperatures, and policy against coronavirus are all directly related to the virus, while kids in cages are not.</p>
<p>&rt;With careful interpretation have come lower cases. If you want to talk about something that "is affecting the change in new COVID-19 cases", look no further.</p>
<p>The source you gave is from January 20, 2021. However, the guidance that the paper refers to was introduced on September 11, 2020, before we even knew who would be elected president. To verify my claim, you can just click on the link that says "Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2" and you will see that it is from September 11, 2020.</p>

<p>It hasn't been proven, no. But there is a strong correlation, so it seems highly likely that it is true. Fauci has refrained from saying outright that it causes it in the event that we get new information to contradict that, but so far, that seems to be the case.</p>

<p>That makes it worse. All that says is they've known the PCR amplification was too high for over four months, but they didn't ask the labs to adjust the threshold until right after Biden got into office so his mandates and lockdowns could take credit. 100% political.</p>

<p>My bad, it auto-played to the next video after I watched it. This is the correct link:</p>

<p>&rt;I'm not sure about the credibility of this source. Do you have a more reliable source to back this up?</p>
<p>Here's some corporate media articles that say exactly what is shown in the video:</p>

        <p>&rt;Those were examples of meaningless correlations to illustrate the point that just because something has happened, doesn't mean it's responsible for the drop in cases.</p>
<p>There is a big difference, though. Vaccines are specifically designed to defeat viruses. Warm temperature has been recorded to negatively affect viruses and scientific explanations have been provided for that. The executive orders about the virus were policies specifically designed to defeat the virus. On the other hand, kids in cages do not have a significant relationship to the virus.</p>

<p>It never asked the labs to adjust the threshold until right after Biden got into office. It merely said, " follow the IFU [instructions for use] carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended by the manufacturer." It merely said that they should follow the manufacturer's recommendation.

<p>Thanks. But still, as I said, a strong correlation has been found (and unlike something such as kids in cages, it is related to the virus). It is not definitive yet, as Fauci said, but it strongly seems to be the case.</p>

<p>From your WEF-member Reuters fact-check:</p>
<p>&rt;False. WHO did not release guidance saying that PCR tests for COVID-19 resulted in inflated positive results, <strong>rather sought to address accuracy issues with PCR tests not being conducted correctly</strong>.</p>
<p>So there were accuracy issues and labs were using thresholds that were too high, got it. I can't find any default manufacturer thresholds, but if it's less than 40, which is already far too high, there will be less positives across all labs. Even the CDC found 33 cycles to be a good cutoff point.</p>

        <p>&rt;even Fauci and BoJo are saying that they haven't caused the drop in cases.</p>
<p>They said that in January. Later, Fauci <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/fauci-israel-way-up-there-in-vaccination-seeing-remarkable-drop-in-cases/">said</a> that Israel was doing very well in vaccinations and associated it with a drop in cases.</p>
<p>&rt;why is Canada barely affected compared with the UK</p>
<p>Weather and temperature is a factor, but not the only factor. By the way, Canada has still faced issues - it has over a million cases and over 20,000 deaths. It has about 0.8% of cases and deaths despite having only 0.5% of the world population. Granted, that's much better than the UK (3% of cases, 4% of deaths, 0.85% of world population), but it's still not that great. As for a specific answer to your question, I would point you to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-canada-united-states/2020/07/14/0686330a-c14c-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html">this</a> article.</p>
<p>&rt;I was thinking more like ones that have nothing to do with it like <em>trans women can compete in trans sports</em> executive orders.</p>
<p>Yes, the non-coronavirus executive orders contributed little to the transmission of the virus. However, the coronavirus-related executive orders were announced around the same time as these, which is a contributing factor to the drop in cases around that time.</p>
<p>Per the NYT article you provided, "The Food and Drug Administration said in an emailed statement that it does not specify the cycle threshold ranges used to determine who is positive, and that 'commercial manufacturers and laboratories set their own.'"</p>
<p>As for the Project Veritas video and the sources: I found another source <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-james-okeefe-releases-secret-recordings-of-cnn-staffer-calling-network-pro-biden/">here</a>. As it says, "Chester described his role in one scene as being 'one step down from director,' though the role of technical director has no input on the content of any programming, and he was almost certainly not included in any editorial calls."</p>
<p>Even if the video is legitimate, it is highly unlikely that what Chester said was true/incorporated into CNN's programming.</p>

<p>My first link showed BoJo saying it last week and another link I sent showed Fauci him saying it last week as well, and again just a month ago.</p>
<p>Your Israel source is from two months ago. And from what I can tell, Israel is only administering the Pfizer shot, so you can't compare effectiveness when the US has several shots and vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>20,000 deaths is fuck all for Canada. They have a population of 38,000,000, which is 0.05% of their population. Almost 300K die in an average year there. This chart shows it has barely deviated from the standard increase, and it hasn't even increased by the number of deaths with COVID.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They already said to use 40 cycles back in January 2020, so perhaps that's where labs got the threshold from. But if labs did switch to the manufacturer's recommendation, why would the WHO have to issue a notice?</p>
<p>&rt;A specimen is considered negative if all 2019-nCoV marker (N1, N2) cycle threshold growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within 40.00 cycles</p>

<p>Here's the next sentence from your source:</p>
<p>&rt;Nonetheless, he was gainfully employed by CNN, <strong>clearly was observant to on-air programming</strong>, and referred to his network’s work to defeat former President Donald Trump as “propaganda,” but said he believed in the mission.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Even if the video is legitimate, it is highly unlikely that what Chester said was true/incorporated into CNN's programming.</p>
<p>Sounds like your opinion. If it isn't true, why hasn't CNN issued a statement? If it isn't true, why hasn't it been fact-checked? The evidence is right there that corporate media uses propaganda. If you still don't believe it does, have a read up on Operation Mockingbird.</p>

<p>If the US has more vaccines, wouldn't we expect the US to be doing better? And yet it's not.

<p>That's quite a lot of lives, if you ask me.

The measures taken early on flattened the curve in Canada, which reduced the cases and deaths by a lot. The United States has been way worse - at present, it has 4.23% of the world population but 22.62% of the cases and 18.9% of the deaths.

<p>I found a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html">source</a> I personally trust for this, so we're on the same page here. This has not much to do with CNN - in fact, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the company responsible for this, often provides pro-Trump scripts/videos to its news outlets - the opposite of what you are saying.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the media isn't biased - it is. It's practically impossible to remain unbiased. But they're not propaganda networks or anything like that.</p>

<p>I meant more types of vaccines and shots, not uptake. They have different rates of effectiveness. Israel has fully inoculated 56% of its population, compared to 26% in the US. Even when the US catches up, a lot of the shots administered would be different to those used in Israel so its better to look at the US alone, and Fauci has said it hasn't been shown definitively that inoculations reduce transmission.</p>

<p>I wasn't bringing up Canada to downplay deaths, I only mentioned it to downplay temperature impact.

<p>My mistake, I'm British. If you look in the footer though, you'll see it says "Revision: 06". I found the first revision on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200205171727/https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">Wayback Machine</a>, which still suggests the use of a 40 cycle threshold and was published on February 4th, five weeks before the WHO declared the pandemic, and when there were only a handful of cases.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;But they're not propaganda networks or anything like that.</p>
<p>To each their own I guess. That Sinclair Group video was the one that put me off all corporate media. Project Veritas has much more dirt on CNN though - they recorded their morning calls for months and here's CNN CEO, Jeff Zucker, talking about how to go after Trump and other Republicans.</p>

<p>About 20% of deaths in the United States are under the age of 70. That's still over 100,000 people. Even if you say that all of these people had underlying conditions (which is not true), that still means that all of those people (in addition to the people over 70) are still at risk. So why are you going to neglect precautions, thereby endangering them?</p>

        <p>If you wear a mask, the primary effect of this is that people around you will have a lower chance of contracting the virus. They also protect you to a lesser extent, but the primary function is preventing others from getting the virus. Them wearing a mask will decrease their chances of contracting it slightly, but a much larger effect will be realized if the people around them also wear masks.</p>

        <p>Under Trump, the vaccine rollout was going fairly well - the vaccine rollout did get to almost a million a day, and the first stretch is usually the hardest. Under Biden, this continued and expanded, to the point where we are now hitting over 3 million a day. Both presidents deserve commendation for this.</p>
