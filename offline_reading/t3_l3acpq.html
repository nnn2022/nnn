        <p>One of the oldest tricks in the book is to play with the language. Lefties did it quickly with "liberal;" a word meaning "free man" which has now been bastardized to now typically refer to political "liberalism." Other examples of words being bastardized include the Soviet's using the words "liberate" when they took a country over or to refer to their national anthem as a "Hymn" as they did away with what would typically be referred to by the word. More recently we see it done with "marriage" being used to describe the relationships of two men or two women when such in the not-so-distant past would have been absurd and unthinkable. It's all really a tactic to tear down and replace with a degenerated form of what was; why do you think the left is so quick on a daily basis to censor or curtail one's use of the language? Hell, this post probably offended some snowflake. "Politically correct" is literally a term out of the Soviet Union!</p>

        <p>Don't forget "gender". And I don't think you mentioned their tendency to make up terms like social justice that sound like good things on the surface, but really mean "what we say to excuse a lot of really bad behavior that furthers our political goals"</p>
<p>Doesn't matter any more the whole thing will implode in the next decade or so.  Apparently the only thing that can inoculate you against socialist ideals is surviving a communist society.</p>

        <p>the democratic left uses the term liberal still to fool those either to ignorant, or unwilling to actually look at their policies. 
It's the only way they can fool large numbers of people into voting for them.
They are very much the fascists of the early 1930s. just compare the actions of today's left in America with the rise of nazi germany.  the playbook they are using is almost identical. its quite funny actually, bc the left is notorious for using projection against their political enemies, and I've lost count of how many times I've been called a nazi for disagreeing with them.</p>

        <p>Lefties often like to try and tie the Nazis to the "right" and the Soviets to the "left," but that is totally false. They were both on the left and in the same way Catholics and Protestants or different factions of Islam have gone to war in the past despite their fundamental similarities, so did the fascists and communists. Today the two have indeed fused together.</p>

        <p>That’s their out when someone calls their ideas fascist. They say they are not nationalistic so they can’t be fascist. Maybe so, but there isn’t much difference in the end result of fascism, socialism, or communism. They all result in authoritarian rich controlling the rest of the population who is poor</p>

        <p>Most people see the poitical spectrum as a line but its actually a circle. As the right went more extreme the left went more extreme to compensate. Then the right goes farther and the left goes farther, and both parties run face first into each other smack dab in the middle of super nazi territory.</p>

        <p>What liberal mean to me in a American sense: freedom, and liberty.</p>
<p>You need to understand something /u/PatFromSomewhere, the cunts and bastards that run the asylum have hijacked and taken over words and phrases. So when you say liberal, at least when I was in school, it meant you were for freedom, and small government (think Jeffersonian ideals). </p>
<p>Now, because the creeping socialism coming into our way of life courtesy of the Democratic Party, the cunts and bastards that run the asylum needed a way to get people to identify with them even though they are polar opposites. Take the NAZIS, and ChiComs, the vast majority of Germans and Chinese were peaceful, and just wanted to be surrounded by four walls and have dinner with their families each night. But how do you convince the populace to be on your side? You change the meaning of words. That's how Goebbels did it, and that is how Mao did it.</p>
<p>There is nothing "progressive" about taking away someone's right to bear arms, there is nothing liberal about silencing dissent. That's communism.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about this for a while. They’re actually very fascistic in many ways. Tried to tell a “liberal” this, and their response was that I’m an idiot bc I associated liberalism with fascism. I was trying to tell him that a turd can call itself gold, but it’s still a fucking turd</p>
