        <p>This is intended to be humorous, of course, but it's very close to the truth. The elite will continue to push their agenda by changing the rules. Our duty is to resist in any way we can. </p>
<p>Personally, I have an entire locker filled with 2nd amendment rights waiting for when BLM says I'm experiencing the Omega variant next year...</p>

        <p>How anyone with half a brain doesn't see this is crazy.  Up until a few years ago I was the type of person to just go along with things, never really questioning the motives behind whatever is going on but once you see one thing, one lie, one deceptive tactic you have no choice but to question everything.  </p>
<p>Once you start digging media manipulation and propaganda is nothing new, but what's really changed is they aren't even trying to hide it. Literally headlines about the delta variant saying the symptoms are runny nose and sore throat?  Posting death counts that are somewhere below chihuahua maulings but above tragic nerf gun accidents? Its nice to see some sane people here but there are far too many out there who are more than happy to jump on board with whatever they're told. </p>
<p>I had a customer call and complain that the tech at their house wasn't wearing a mask and told them he wasn't getting the vaccine.  He said that both he and his wife were vaccinated,  so what are they worried about?  Its work so I couldn't really say anything like I wanted to. He even said "there's a new variant spreading all over! Its terrible" .   Honestly,  its crazy,  at times it feels like I'm watching a movie about a pandemic because my life hasn't changed a bit. I was never in fear of it,  changed nothing about my daily life other than wearing masks at the store all while half the population is acting like ebola and meningitis had a baby named covid19.  My job requires going to several customer's homes each day, and my wife works in a medical building. Neither of us ever got sick.  Out of 12 techs at my office, only one ever got covid and it was a mild fever for half a day. The rest of the 14 days he said the worst thing qas boredom.  </p>
<p>The worst thing is that this is all right in plain sight,  I'm not getting anything from some weird conspiracy site or facebook group. All anyone has to do is look at things objectively and it should be obvious.  It's so sad how many are more than happy to go along with whatever the government / media says because "its for the greater good".  Always used to wonder how so many in Germany prior to ww2 didn't try and stop what was happening, but if all it takes is a minor flu to scare the public into submitting to lockdowns, mask mandates,  compelled vaccinations then I guess its not really all that surprising.</p>
