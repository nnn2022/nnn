    <strong>Useful Advice When Considering Protesting</strong>
    <p><p>Guys, the time to protest might come sooner than we expect. If you were already planning on taking some action, here is some summarized and redacted advice I found in this [article] (https://www.gq.com/story/hong-kong-protest-advice) . It may save your life.</p>
<h1>What to wear</h1>
<p>While there’s no uniform that suits every protest, different gatherings have different goals. Bear in mind that things can always change on the ground once resistance is under way. “You never know what cops are going to use. It’s not like you can choose, <em>‘Today I’m going to wear my tear gas outfit or something.’</em></p>
<p>There are a few essentials you should be sure to wear if you plan to hit the streets: <strong>masks, goggles, long sleeves, and helmets.</strong></p>
<p>Unarmed citizens have no business trying to force things against modern, heavily armed forces with full backing of the state. Masks and goggles don’t equip you to protect yourself from police officers. Instead, these really just buy you some time and opportunity to move away.</p>
<p>Wear a helmet to protect against batons and rubber bullets. Get the nicest helmet you can find. <strong>Avoid yellow construction helmets.</strong> They ain’t so good: they are flimsy (cracks on a determined baton strike) and if the police/military is shooting, you’d stand out like a firefly at night.</p>
<p>There’s a grim irony in the fact that the mask is an essential tool given the current crisis of COVID-19. If you end up on any direct confrontation with law enforcement, the mask is a must, along with goggles. If you’re not wearing them, once the cops fire tear gas, you’re done. Keep your mask on and a pair of airtight swimming goggles around your neck, just in case. Long sleeves are a good idea too, as tear gas and pepper spray can damage your skin as much as your eyes. The masks and goggles made for a wild combination when the HK protests reached their peak in 2019: “Everyone dressed like Heisenberg!”</p>
<p>HK protesters also employed a 50-year-old resistance strategy called “black blocking,” where participants wear generic, all-black clothing to conceal their identity. This has been especially important in China, where the surveillance state is omniscient and citizens must go to extraordinary lengths to preserve their anonymity. Beyond protecting a protester’s identity, black bloc attire typically identifies the wearer as more radical than other protesters, to their peers and police alike. In some cases, it can signal that they are prepared for militant action like sabotage (protesters in HK destroyed CCTVs and other surveillance tech) and direct confrontation with police. It’s an important and useful strategy that you should consider carefully before adopting.</p>
<p>Whether you plan on wearing black or not, <strong>bring a spare set of clothes to change into after the protest</strong>, so authorities can’t recognize you as easily. It’s also smart to change if you get pepper spray or tear gas on your clothing.</p>
<h1>What to bring</h1>
<p>When it comes to supplies, the most obvious might be the most important: <strong>Keep your people fed and hydrated</strong> . Bring food and water for yourself and others.</p>
<p>Water is also useful in the event of pepper spray or tear gas. There’s no magic cure when it comes to handling tear gas, but rinsing your eyes with water or saline solution (not milk, which helps with capsaicin in pepper spray but not tear gas) is an important part of recovery.</p>
<p>In HK, umbrellas were an essential part of the resistance. They can shield people’s faces from CCTVs and protect against pepper spray. In many instances, protesters have used umbrellas to form a Spartan phalanx and march forward toward law enforcement. They were a symbol and tool for solidarity between different factions of the HK resistance—moderate citizens will hold up an umbrella to shield a more radical protester as they change into black bloc attire.</p>
<p>Between an umbrella, bottled water, snacks, and a spare set of clothes, you may have quite a haul. Bring a backpack, and don’t worry about dropping it if you have to run. Your safety is more important than supplies. In HK, gear recovery and redistribution became a great activity for those who might were uncomfortable with more radical action—If you don't want to go to the front lines one day, stay back and collect gear to deliver next time.</p>
<p><strong>Please, please don’t bring guns.</strong>  I know y’all love your second amendment, but once lethal force is used, the escalation cannot be turned back.</p>
<h1>How to communicate</h1>
<p>When it comes to planning a protest, different platforms have different uses. For spreading the word about an upcoming event, Instagram, Facebook, and LIHKG, Hong Kong’s Reddit equivalent. Telegram, the encrypted messaging app, isn’t foolproof, but it remains the go-to platform for most activists who are working out the actual details of resistance.</p>
<p>During a protest, Hong Kongers employed different strategies. On site, voice communication is invaluable, Walkie-talkies and radios, or the Zello app with earpiece—the former is best, they are outlawed in HK so they used the latter.</p>
<p>If reception is poor, use Air Drop as an alternative to messaging—not only is it more likely to go through, but it’s an easy way to share maps with routes for marches. Visual aids like these are important—Most people ain’t so good with even their local streets!</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s the oldest and most reliable form of communication— <strong>word of mouth.</strong></p>
<h1>“Be water”</h1>
<p>Few have had as big an influence on Hong Kong protests as Bruce Lee. In a 1971 interview, the movie star and Hong Kong native gave a famous interview where he said, <em>“Be formless, shapeless like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”</em></p>
<p>Those words became a rallying cry and organizational principle for H K activists.</p>
<p>In practice, “be water” resistance is a type of pop-up, guerrilla protest. Protests change form and direction suddenly. By Air Dropping or Telegramming maps and updates, protesters disperse when police pressure gets too hot in one location, then reassemble in a different part of the city shortly after. Sometimes protesters share entrance codes for safe, friendly buildings so that groups can disappear from the streets on short notice. The point is to be agile.</p>
<p><strong>There’s no point in getting arrested!</strong> Move on when tension gets too high at any protest site—don’t get hurt, don’t get arrested.</p>
<h1>Build support from the community</h1>
<p><strong>Solidarity is essential</strong> among protesters and allies who support the cause from home. Build a sense of communal support beyond the streets, a mass movement that can cause lasting, positive change requires more than actions on the streets. It is not enough to scream <em>SHIT ISN’T WORKING</em>, but also to build actions and proposals for how to make things work. Changes take time and patience. Many—most?—significant actions are invisible.</p>
<p>In 2014, one of the whole reasons the HK protest movement fell apart was because they weren’t working together. They were pointing fingers at each other. <strong>It's all about teamwork.</strong> </p>
<p>The point is not asking <em>‘Are you radical or not?’</em> It’s finding something you can do for radicals. If you’re radical, find something you can do for a liberal. Use an umbrella to shield an ally as one common example. 
The most important thing is <strong>not to blame each other.</strong> You can blame the cops, but don’t blame other protesters. <strong>Be kind to each other.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: Some other advice/suggestions by commenters (feel free to add any other considerations if you wish so):</p>
<ol>
<li>A thing that will kill protests in U$A is this important fact- Police WILL infiltrate, goad more violent actions &amp; do illegal things to blame on 'protestors'. Look for the ones most vocal &amp; calling for violence. They are most likely Police. </li>
</ol>
<p>"One tip that has been told to me &amp; served me well- look at their shoes. I dunno if it's arrogance or stupidity, but they always wear some 'tacticool' boots or heavy shoes."</p>
<p>If a large enough event, there will be FBI instigators too. They are better, you will not 'make them' as they spend years training to do this. If someone is talking to you about either crimes you can commit or 'swapping stories' about crimes you've done, they are likely FBI. Do NOT trust! Remember Randy Weaver.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Facial recognition. Cover your brow bone especially and use a rigid mask if possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you carry your phone you should put it in a faraday bag, same with debit/credit cards and anything with an rfid tag.</p>
</li>

Remember Randy Weaver was being set up to be an 'inside man' &amp; it all started with 'just' cut down a shotgun barrel. Wife &amp; kids murdered before he surrendered at Ruby Ridge. Sure, he 'won' a huge pile of money, but his wife &amp; kids remain dead forever. (&amp; dog)</p>
