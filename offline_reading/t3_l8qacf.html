    <strong>They brought the world to its Chi.....knees</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously though. Where is the anti Chinese sentiment?
Every single person I know has either had their life severely disrupted, completely destroyed, or somewhere in between. Every. Single. Person.</p>
<p>We know now: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The reporting they were doing was such a joke they could have just said 2 people in China were infected. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They suppressed info.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fucking opened wet markets again. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone is at the mercy of the Chinese gov. Me. You. Your grandma. Everyone. </p>
<p>I understand that this is the Chinese government not the Chinese people. However, who do you think is paying 100k/year to study at North American schools? Who do you think that 19 year old Chinese  kid driving a lambo is? </p>
<p>We are beset on all sides by the progeny of the Chinese government.
Ever car they buy, every condo the jack the price up on, is paid for by the Chinese government or at the discretion at least. </p>
<p>Take a hard look. This is the future of the Chinese government. </p>
<p>Finally, where do we go from here. The Chinese gov will do as they wish and either lie to us or just do it anyways. 
There is no way for ensuring precautions are taken in the future.  </p>
<p>Take a good look, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WJH51oO">this is the guy</a>. This is the guy who from a world away reached into your little town or big city and fucked up your life.  </p>
<p>NOTE: I AM SPEAKING ONLY ABOUT CHINESE CITIZENS IN NORTH AMERICA NOT NORTH AMERICANS OF CHINESE DESCENT.</p></p>
