    <strong>Pfizer was previously sued by a scientist claiming infection by a genetically modified virus (lentivirus).</strong>
    <p><p>I was doing a bit of research into the pharma. companies that are developing the vaccines, when I came across this bit of Pfizer history. I donâ€™t recall ever hearing about this before. I will let each of you draw any conclusions you might have. Iâ€™m still not sure what I think of this. In particular, I found this interesting in light of the specific adverse effects some people are experiencing from the mRNA vaccines, namely Bellâ€™s Palsy and various mild forms of paralysis. Let me know what you think (or if youâ€™ve seen this before). </p>

<p>Medical experts will be watching closely Monday when a scientist who says she has been intermittently paralyzed by a virus designed at the Pfizer laboratory where she worked in Groton opens a much anticipated trial that could raise questions about safety practices in the dynamic field of genetic engineering.</p>
<p>Organizations involved in workplace safety and responsible genetic research already have seized on the federal lawsuit by molecular biologist Becky McClain as an example of what they claim is evidence that risks caused by cutting-edge genetic manipulation have outstripped more slowly evolving government regulation of laboratories.</p>
<p>McClain, of Deep River, suspects she was inadvertently exposed, through work by a former Pfizer colleague in 2002 or 2003, to an engineered form of the lentivirus, a virus similar to the one that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Medical experts working for McClain believe the virus has affected the way her body channels potassium, leading to a condition that causes complete paralysis as many as 12 times a month.</p>
<p>"If a worker in a plant as sophisticated as Pfizer is becoming infected with a genetically engineered virus, then I think the potential is everywhere," said Jeremy Gruber, president of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a public interest group created to explore the implications of genetic technologies.</p>
