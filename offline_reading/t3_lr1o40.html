    <strong>Got Karened by a grocery store employee</strong>
    <p><p>We were walking around the grocery store for quite a while without masks on our kids. We went to pay for a full cart of groceries just to have the employee say our son must wear a mask. We said he is exempt. She said he is too old. We said he is exempt for a disability. She said he would have to wear a mask anyway. I said "fuck you I will leave this full cart right here at your register". The next employee over took us without any further issue. Have fun virtue signalling karen. You were not even following the mask ordinance anyway. </p>
<p>We typically don't wear masks but some places try to enforce it. Each member of our home is legally exempt from wearing them anyway. We  don't believe in following with tyranny but we do like making the idiots follow the laws they profess to believe in. This one was so pro mask she wouldn't even follow the law.</p></p>

        <p>I work at a small grocery chain, none of us are allowed to say anything because of HIPAA laws. I don't understand why people do this anyways, it's none of anyone's business why you weren't wearing masks.</p>

        <p>I can't remember where I read this but it said to fill up a full cart of perishable items and go maskless, if something gets said and you have to leave the store (without buying anything) they can't legally shelve the items back and are at a loss</p>

        <p>I can explain why it works based on what i saw when my little grocery chain mandated that masks heavy-handed (initially for the first few days, not anymore).</p>
<p>It's not that the perishables are worth so much that we couldn't stomach the loss, it's the fact that it takes a LOT labor hours to put everything back. Perishables in Dairy and Produce are often in the complete opposite directions, and unless you have a streamlined system to sort them all and put them pack there's no way to do it without "wasting" labor. Which is something that the big wigs are not too fond of spending money on. </p>
<p>We had absolutely tons and tons of carts piled in the front and it was a complete mess, and there's certain items we have to throw out regardless, like bulk bin items. The amount of time it took to put everything back was too time consuming for how thin the daily store labor allowed is.</p>
<p>So yes, it's true that if one person does this a day, or even an hour, nothing happens, but if everyone does it, it becomes completely unsustainable to keep up with heavy handed mask requirements. The power lies with the people, but in places like California nothing like this would stand a chance.</p>
