        <p>Yeah for two reasons .</p>
<p>1) yes because my life hasn’t been dictated by the past year of limited restrictions and wearing a mask, I have lived a great life in my time on this planet. </p>
<p>2) and yes because my mom and dad didn’t die or have their health permanently damaged by me spreading the virus into their household. Nor did I risk the lives of my vulnerable friends or their parents.</p>
<p>Don’t worry kid, you will be able to hang out in larger groups one day soon.</p>

        <p>Above 70. And of course they matter but they aren’t dying at a high rate at all anymore. Most of those deaths are due to co morbidities, improper use of ventilators, and NY/NJ sending infected patients back to nursing homes. We have learned a lot. Treatment is much more effective, hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, and the death rate is significantly lower. Lockdowns don’t help literally anyone. Did you forget the whole initial point was to not overwhelm the system? You can’t contain this virus. Read a book you fucking moron. You know nothing. “jUsT wEaR a mAsK” clearly you have no clue what you’re talking about. Another mindless drone. Countless more people are being abused, dying of starvation, committing suicide because of the lockdown. Fuck you and your ilk, all selfish dirtbags who think you care about people because you wear a useless piece of cloth over your mouth. Makes me sick</p>

        <p>take off your tin foil hat my dear. Quick and effective restrictions have been hugely beneficial, especially to the countries in which acted immediately. They are in place to help limit spread while we actually put together effective treatments and develop a vaccine. You're stupid, selfish, and your "beliefs" are reckless and can hurt those whom are the most vulnerable in society. You're a disgusting human being. </p>
<p>It takes a real piece of uneducated ass to think they understand the situation better than the vast majority of scientific institutions on earth</p>

        <p>These aren’t just my beliefs guy. Your little echo chamber would have you believe that. I guarantee I’m far more educated in this than you are, based off your weak arguments. Have many friends and relatives in the medical field who are also aware of the true nature of this “pandemic.” The pseudoscience you espouse only works on mindless drones like you. You’re being played like a fool. Learn 1 fact about infectious diseases. Learn 1 fact about how this virus multiplies. You don’t know fuck all, and it shows. I’m glad voices like yours are dying around the world. </p>
<p>You didn’t provide a single argument. “Quick and effective measures have proven beneficial.” Whereas the control group to “prove” this? There’s no proof they’ve worked anywhere. There’s real solutions, and you’re polluting discussion with your useless virtue signaling “oh I care about grandma so I wear a mask, what are you doing!?” </p>

        <p>“Vast majority” yeah it’s obvious you don’t seek independent research. Ant</p>
<p>Here’s a hint. Just because a news source says “this is the scientific consensus” doesn’t make it the consensus. Talk to a real doctor. Read independent news sources. Read research papers for your self. Then you might realize how idiotic you sound</p>

<p>Vaccines do not cause autism, but they can have side effects, particulate when not properly tested for years. For instance, the vaccine for influenza causes narcolepsy.

        <p>Wow I guess you're not very good at sourcing information. </p>
<p>I guess I have to reiterate its not the government that needs to be listened to here (especially in the US), it's the guidance of the scientific consensus. </p>
<p>for masks here is a <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">very simple breakdown</a> from UC San Francisco. It includes a number of studies &amp; case reports that will you probably either claim to have zero validity or make an attempt to derive your own uneducated findings from. </p>
<p>The science behind lockdowns is in a pioneering state but in general the lockdowns (general population restrictions, including orders to stay at home and work from home) are put in place to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2932153-X">slow the rapid spread of the virus</a>. This was essential to reduce mortality, prevent health-care services from being overwhelmed, and buy time to set up pandemic response systems to suppress transmission following lockdown.</p>
<p>There is clear evidence of a reduction in mortality in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32414780/">this study</a> and [this study] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32512579/). keep in mind that lockdowns are essentially mandated distancing because people are too stupid to handle it on their own, as we can see even with the mandates in place. And yes, unlike us, some people don't even regularly wash their hands. I agree, it's sad that some people need to be reminded of basic hygiene. </p>
<p>Good to know you have at least the sense to understand that vaccines don't cause autism but you're incorrect re:narcolepsy. </p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found no indication of any association between U.S.-licensed H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccine and narcolepsy. Though you're probably going to believe this is a conspiracy, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320099/">here is the study</a></p>
<p>I know you get off on seeing yourself as a "Wolf" and not a "sheep" but you should at least be able to source opposing information to lend credibility to your claims. It makes you looked very one-sided</p>

        <p>Yish, man, you’re really thick. Hammering on with your wolf nonsense that you pulled out of thin air. If I repaid in you kind by assuming psychological reasons for your support of authoritarianism and your patent desire to label most people as ‘too stupid to social distance by themselves’, I’d say you’re incredibly insecure (mostly about your intellect), arrogant about what few talents you might have, and prone to pseudo-science as long as it makes you feel smart. </p>
<p>Also, like many insecure people, you confuse the state with your parents. It’s not the government’s job to keep you healthy. As functioning adults, we make our decisions. We also understand that governments are made of people, who are prone to error as much as we are but have more power and are inmune from the consequences of their decisions, and that scientists are people too, with biases, jealousy, reluctance to change, etc. The scientific establishment resisted and in fact attacked Galileo, Newton, Einstein, etc... much like they resist those now going against the consensus (there shouldn’t be consensus about a new virus, not enough time to make research, which makes sense since most of these ‘experts’ are government employed and not researchers). </p>
<p>Here’s the research for narcolepsy and influenza vaccine:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/history/narcolepsy-flu.html</p>
<p>Masks not reducing risk:</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>Evidence against lockdowns:</p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/experience-from-other-countries-show-lockdowns-dont-work/</p>
<p>Science is, by definition, not a consensus. Unlike your condescending self, I don’t get a kick of thinking you’re too dumb to understand studies. So have a read. There will always be conflicting views in an open society. I’m not a conspiracy theorist, an anti-vaxer, or any of the nonsense labels you’ve thrown my way to discredit me. I am a skeptic in a normal level, meaning I don’t blindly trust what government dictates from behind a desk. I take responsibility for myself rather than laying it at the feet of officials, and I know everything can be politicized, even science, and ask that the burden of proof be laid on those advocating lose of freedom rather than of those proposing personal accountability.</p>

        <p>haha OMG. this is too good. You need to read what you're sending me.</p>
<p>From your link RE: narcolepsy</p>
<p>"In response to the events in Europe, CDC reviewed data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and found no indication of any association between U.S.-licensed H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccine and narcolepsy." </p>
<p>Correlation isn't causation my man and your own link proves it.</p>
<p>RE: CDC and masks. All you have to do is read the part in my source titled "Why did the CDC change its guidance on wearing masks?"</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, my link cites way more studies that contradict the CDC's findings. </p>
<p>And lockdowns. WOW. You're citing the American Institue for Economic Research. Of course they are going to try and build an argument against a lockdown in the face of the (more recent) science <em>for</em> interventions. </p>
<p>In general with science we base consensus on the most recent information, you have sent me older data.</p>

        <p>Yes I am capable of reading outside of the media, it’s really not that big of a deal. By your logic the vast majority of medical and scientific institutions all over the world (universities, hospitals, research centers, etc) are bought and not to be trusted. thats where the tin foil hat comes out. Your university owes you a refund. Good luck to you.</p>
