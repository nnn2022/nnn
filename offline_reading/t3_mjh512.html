    <strong>Punishing the prevalence of a disease in a population is likely to have the opposite effect intended, by encouraging people to hide being sick.</strong>
    <p><p>Public health officials are aware that when you punish entire populations with catastrophic lockdowns for the prevalence of a disease, people will have a personal interest in hiding the prevalence of that disease by not getting tested and hiding being sick, right?</p>
<p>Ultimately it ends up putting vulnerable people more at risk because the people around them are more likely to hide being sick and carry on with life as normal. </p>
<p>We knew this prior to 2020... what happened?</p></p>

        <p>I haven't gotten tested because of worry about a) the tests not being super accurate, and b) having all my social contacts monitored by the government in the event of a positive result. If covid19 test results were private like pregnancy test results, I would've gotten tested multiple times. </p>
<p>As for how to not encourage people from hiding being sick, generous sick leave policies are how you do that.  Making everyone hate and fear each other is not necessary.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I haven't been sick yet, and in the beginning I would've called out of work and got a test. Now I would "whoopsie" forget to take my temp in the morning and fake being okay all day. I would do this because I've had to get my kid tested twice. The second time, he tested positive and I was out of work for ten days. I got FMLA, but they also cut off my payments into my medical insurance and failed to tell me. I almost got the notices too late and had to mail a check in. I don't know if I can get away with not testing my kid any time he's ill, but I can 100% fake it til I make it when it comes to my health and just go to work.</p>
<p>I miss the days of just calling the school about my kid being ill and promising not to bring him back until he was fever free for 24 hrs.</p>

        <p>you start off putting the lockdown in a negative light so you already have a bias towards it and then try to influence the reader with that bias. secondly you stated things such as people will hide their sickness causing vulnerable people to become sick without any facts to back this up. and not to mention again trying to influence the reader by playing on their sympathies. this virus is flu like and its kind of hard to hide those symptoms.  this is not like the aids pandemic that had huge social stigmas attached to it and no real visible symptoms for hiv carriers which caused people to hide it. with this pandemic if we locked down quicker, if we wore masks, etc and stopped being so obstinate and stupid we could've been back to somewhat normal by now. instrad you have grown adults throwing themselves on the floor kicking and screaming. humans have been around for 200000 years and we still refuse to grow up. well anyway  have a good one and good luck out there</p>

        <p>All you trolls always have the same flawed argument. If we are causing more infections like you always claim that would shorten the "pandemic". More infections leads to more immunity and less hosts for the virus. The only ones prolonging it are the govts and media fear mongering and their obedient sheep like you.</p>

        <p>is this subreddit really just full of angry morons? i mean seriously. you post a serious question or reply to someone and instead of trying to have an actual conversation to see where are our differences in thought are and how we can come to understand each other better, you get dumbasses down voting reporting calling you a troll or just coming up with sloped forehead insults like go and suck the goverments dick sheeple or whatever. segregation was bad before social media but now its 10x worse. buncha angry dudes surrounding themselves with other angry dudes online until that anger spills over into real life. pathetic. sad to say but there's not much hope for us as a species. be good to yourself and others with what time you have left. peace be upon you</p>

        <p>Lockdowns... are a negative thing. Who enjoys having their movement, freedom and ability to see their loved ones restricted?</p>
<p>I am stating that most people do not like extended lockdowns, and by implementing them when there is a high incidence of "cases", we have created an incentive for people to do all within their power downplay or hide "cases" by not getting tested or hide being sick. That's just logic. Even coughing in public is now very socially frowned upon. People suppress coughing or showing signs of being sick.</p>

        <p>lockdowns are not pleasant. no one likes them of course but if you want to start a discussion then dont start by putting your biases out there to influence the reader. and backing up your opinions with facts also helps. i haven't seen any reports or studies saying people hiding their symptoms especially hiding them so they can have their "freedom" to go see their loved ones. if they were your loved ones you probably hide your symptoms and possibly get them sick too just saying. again no one likes the situation we're in but whining about it, throwing yourself on the floor in walmart, or  stabbing a fastfood worker will change it. the false entitlement of humans, our hubris will be our undoing. again thanks have a good one smd good luck out there</p>

        <p>&rt;this virus is flu like and its kind of hard to hide those symptoms</p>
<p>&rt;if we locked down quicker, if we wore masks, etc</p>
<p>Well, which is it? If the symptoms are so hard to hide then why not just stay home when sick instead of of locking down and masking healthy people on the chance they might be sick and hiding it or not knowing it.</p>
<p>Also, "growing up" does not require people to give up everything that makes life worth living because those in power told you to. It requires critical thinking and independent action, which is the exact opposite of the "I'll stay home afraid until the government approved experts tell me not to" mindset.</p>
<p>When I had covid19, the symptoms (mild cough, fatigue, loss of smell) were obvious to me, but mild enough that I could successfully hide it if I wanted to. I self quarantined for 2 weeks because by that time, I'd found enough people cool with freedom and hanging out in person that I felt generally ok towards humanity, enough to not want others to be sick. If I'd gotten it while surrounded only by doomers who wanted me to quarantine indefinitely, I probably would have cared a lot less if someone got it from me. After all, they were doing their best to try to drive me to suicide. I also have many memories of getting seasonal allergy related coughs and attempting to hide the coughs and/or loudly saying "don't worry, it's just allergies" every time I had one. </p>
<p>AIDS is primarily different from covid because with the latter, you get it temporarily and then recover and become immune. It is way, way less likely to kill you...and yet, the government pushed <em>condoms</em> to stop AIDS from spreading, not abstinence. Expecting lockdowns to work is like expecting  abstinence only sex education to work : not gonna happen.</p>
