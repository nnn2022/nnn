    <strong>In case you're wondering how atrocities were able to be committed in the past...</strong>
    <p><p>Check out the phrases they've been saying about us. Without context, it sounds like they're straight out of a fucking dystopian book. Just YIKES.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Variant factories"</p>
<p>"Plague rats"</p>
<p>"Unvaxxed are the scum of the earth"</p>
<p>"They should lose their rights 100%"</p>
<p>"Conspiracy theorists scumbags"</p>
<p>"Literal murderers for not getting vaccinated"</p>
<p>"Anti-vaxxers being murdered is self-defense"</p>
<p><strong>MEANWHILE IN REALITY (MOST OF US)</strong></p>
<p>"We are simply waiting until we get long term data on the new vaccines that aren't even a year old."</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, I've seen a combination of so many of these on local coronavirus subreddits, some occasionally on worldnews or just other subs in general when talking about covid, and even getting plenty of Reddit awards or 1000s of upvotes.</p>
<p>Compare this to when you post on this sub, sure you get downvoted if you're trolling the sub, but its not an outright instant ban, as if we're more open to different viewpoints and being challenged, unlike their unshakable echo chamber. Almost like we have nothing to hide... hmm.</p>
<p>So.... does this sound like the people on the "right side" of history to you? Instant censorship, ban, insults, radicalizing, hating, dehumanizing? If you're ever wondering how "people could be so cruel to others" in the past, well...</p></p>

        <p>Everyone who understands even a little bit about psychology should be able to confirm that this strategy of talking to people is extremely unlikely to persuade them into doing what you want them to do.</p>
<p>For that you'd have to earn their trust, make yourself relatable, listen to theirs story and handle their objections.</p>
<p>So apparently that is not the purpose. The purpose seems to be to ostracize. Ostracizing, dehumanizing and objectifying people do indeed seem like steps on the ladder towards committing atrocities.</p>

        <p>This is a great point and one I have been trying to hit home with people from “the other angle”—you know, calling people sheep and doomers and making fun of them alienates them instead of inviting them to consider what we are saying. </p>
<p>To make fun of these people is not in our own best interests or helpful in furthering the message of this sub.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately basic information about communication-psychology seems to barely have reached anyone who hasn't actively searched for it.</p>
<p>I never learned about it from either my parents nor from school. I learned it later in life when actively looking for ways on how to improve my communication.</p>
<p>All of it is really comprehensible and it takes like an hour of lecture at most for the basics.</p>
<p>Once I had heard it and started to put it into practice, the experience while communicating with other people has dramatically improved. Even without telling people about how it works, just doing it is contagious.</p>

        <p>I’m not inviting them to consider anything at this point though.  They’re going to have to come to the realisation when they hit rock bottom.
They, however, still think they can convince people of their arguments through insults.</p>

        <p>This happened before, and is a trusted way of getting a genocide. One example: Rwanda 1994. For months before the machete genocide began the undesirables were called cockroaches, a pest, etc at state radios.</p>

        <p>Definitely an operation. The agenda is very nefarious and it has nothing to do with good health. More along the lines of merging man with machine in order to better psychologically manipulate, control and kill. There exist a class of people who see themselves as separate and “better” than the rest of humanity. They are currently waging war on us in a bid to perpetually sit on their imaginary thrown of slave masters of humanity. </p>
<p>Psychology is their primary weapon. Most media are distractions. They don’t allow you to understand yourself and the true nature of the events taking place around you.</p>

        <p>Right...it all starts with dehumanizing us, making it seem like hatred against us is justified. We’re dirty, we’re selfish, we’re ruining it for everyone else. To consider the comparison of this situation to 1930’s Germany as anti-Semitic is a red herring—-we’re not equating ourselves to what people then suffered...but the similarities in propaganda used to dehumanize us is STRIKING. Hitting on the same emotional cords, using the same tactics, manipulation of worldview. It’s nuts. But yeah...let’s foolishly believe that history doesn’t repeat itself! Let’s also remember that Mk Ultra was actually borne out of the aftermath of WWII. </p>
<p>To be honest though, I wonder how much of this name calling is just bots. Maybe I’m just lucky to know sane people, but I haven’t crossed this sentiment in real life. I know it happens, but I think bots falsely exaggerate the phenomenon. Now...how do we recognize a bot? Maybe there’s no way, but just something to keep in mind before we assume people have our worst interests at heart...it could just be a bot on the other end of the screen pushing your buttons and thus whatever they say is to be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>I sense that a turn around of all this is coming when the vaxxed start proving that they, in fact, are the variant factories and are making others sick. We, who are resisting, may soon be justified in villainizing the vaxxed as they shed spike protein in our air, create mutated viruses and clog up the health care system with ongoing problems. They'll try to gaslight it away but, clearly, the people on this sub will know what's going on.</p>
