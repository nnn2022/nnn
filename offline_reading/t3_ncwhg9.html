    <strong>I have officially become a second-class citizen</strong>
    <p><p>I posted an image with a small description yesterday, but I wanted to post a (somewhat) more detailed description of my scenario.</p>
<p>I am a sophomore in high school. I attend a small, independent, classical Catholic high school with less than 30 students and a decent size building (It's bigger way than we need, has enough room for like 50-60 students I think.)</p>
<p>My two younger sisters attend a small independent, classically Catholic grade school with just under a <br>
 hundred students in a decent size building, comparable to what my high school has if not smaller. Ever since the beginning of the year, they have been in school in person full time with optional masks or social distancing. (Expect for mass on Friday's because it's a parish mass.) A few students wear masks but the majority don't. Basically they have been going against the order put down by our governor.</p>
<p>My school has been in person full time as well since the beginning of the year, (Well actually, both of our schools did one week virtual when cases were on the rise in the area.) But the administration of my school decided to comply with all the restrictions and orders put down by the government. Masks, social distancing, temperature checks, capacity limits, you name it. I have always been extremely jealous of my sisters who have little to no COVID protocol and here I am sitting in school with all these restrictions. What's even worse is that many if not all of the schools extracurricular events have suffered or been shaken because they insist on following COVID protocol. We just put on a play, and the actors had to wear masks. (Granted, they were thin, clear plastic, upside-down mouth shields that probably don't even block COVID in the first place, but still.)</p>
<p>And yesterday, we were sitting <strong>outside</strong> at lunch when the headmaster told us If we were not six feet apart we had to wear masks. Someone mentioned that the new guidance was three feet, but he replied that that was only for in the classroom. Then someone asked how being outdoors is any worse than in a smaller classroom, because there is better ventilation. He responded that he didn't know, but he was following the guidelines. He said he thinks they (The CDC) only allow three feet in the classroom because they wanted to get more kids back in school.</p>
<p>There are a few students who are strongly conservative, including me, (anti mask, anti vax, etc.) and a few who are strongly liberal (pro mask, pro vax). A few faculty are strongly liberal on this topic, and there is only one who I know is strongly conservative. The rest from what I can tell are pretty neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, sorry for all of the rant, I just wanted to do my best to describe the situation. Here is the point of my post.</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, the school emailed all families with this update to their COVID protocol, because the CDC just announced vaxxed people can unmask indoors:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/wnntr3wvj9z61.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892d85049c34dd5004067ff06b0d3fbb92edc38f</p>
<p>When I saw this, I was livid. Our school constantly preaches about how they are against all of the bad in our culture, cancel culture, to name one, but I can't really think of the others they mentioned. And yet they still force  us to comply with the government mask mandates.</p>
<p>And now <strong><em>THIS?</em></strong> I am utterly and horrendously disgusted. <strong>They have officially turned us into second class citizens. They are shaming us into getting the vaccine and virtually discriminating against us if we don't.</strong> Of course I am anti vax, so I will not be getting the vaccine, but my fear is that, as more people get it, the kids who don't will be made fun of or pressured into getting it, maybe not on purpose, (There has never been a bullying problem in our school and I don't think there ever will be.) but subconsciously.</p>
<p>I'm really afraid that if I ever complain about having to wear a mask again, someone, probably one of the few liberal "pro mask pro vaccine" people will just tell me "Well, then get the vaccine." and I'll look like a hypocrite, because there is a way to get out of wearing a mask but I'm not taking it.</p>
<p>My parents are going to be talking to the administration soon, (They are unhappy with this decision by the school) although I doubt that will have much effect. I'm praying to God that this all blows over by the Fall, and that come next year, <strong>vaxxed and unvaxxed people will be treated equally, no segregation.</strong> I don't want to leave this school, and I don't think my parents want me to either. Besides, our school is honest probably the most lax on COVID protocol in the area, so anywhere else I transferred would just be more strict. But I just cannot stand for what the administration is doing.</p>
<p>I'm trying my best to rally up some of the strongly conservative students, how few they are, and see if we can devise some course of action to take, but honestly, it seems like there is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how a Catholic school can justify discriminating against it's students. They have claimed before that they are neither anti nor pro vaccine, following the teaching of the Catholic Church, and that it was up to the individual whether or not they should get it. But I think this action clearly puts them on one side of the fence.</p></p>

        <p>they've been trying to shame, guilt or bribe people into taking the vax since this regime took over. the level of propaganda is off the charts.</p>
<p>eventually it will take discrimination lawsuits but places will back off the mask bullshit.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt apologize for your full explanation, it adds a lot of context and we are here to discuss, listen, and empower.  I‚Äôm definitely happy to hear that your parents are fighting for you and your rights.  That‚Äôs a great start and I do hope they will be heard.  I wish I had more to say but do your best to keep your head up, keep the discussion going with the friends that you do trust and keep fighting.  I can‚Äôt imagine having to go through this at your age, this is beyond what I could have even imagined in high school, but i commend you for your critical thinking and strength to know what‚Äôs right.  It honestly only takes one person to speak up - you‚Äôre on the right side of history.</p>

<p>If I were you, I wouldn't wear a mask, and I wouldn't get the vaccine. Tell people to leave you alone and mind their own business. Use logic and facts if you sense someone might hear you, but otherwise, don't take bait. Just do your thing. When you look back on your life years from now, you'll be glad you had spine.</p>

        <p>It's up to you. You can comply and submit, or stand up for what you believe in and finish your schooling at home or elsewhere. Really, there's not that much personal harm from wearing a mask. It's true. But if I could change something about my life, not taking highschool so seriously would be near the top of the list. It's a joke.</p>

Camp outside of the administrative buildings with signs and write to your teachers. <strong>There is strength in numbers.</strong> Use slogans like "my body, my choice", make allusions to Nazi Germany and cite the Nuremberg Code. Someone on reddit even printed out a SS pass card to give to people who ask for " vaccine proof". Make them ashamed of their actions of violating fundamental human rights.</p>

        <p>I hardly think following national health standards is being on ‚Äúone side of the fence.‚Äù</p>
<p>Either way, this is not segregation. Segregation entails the separation of a specific race/class. You are not being separated from your peers.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Segregation is a physical separation between two parties. </p>
<p>Maybe you feel mentally segregated.</p>

        <p>This should be when you should start reading the Bible more closely and see that Catholicism is a brainwash. RCC is a control institute, working against humanity, against truth, against God. Covid clearly shows this. God bless, and stick with being different. The truth is only for a small group, the road is narrow. Most Christians are completely deluded, alas.</p>
