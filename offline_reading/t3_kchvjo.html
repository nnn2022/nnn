        <p>That article points to a dystopian aftermath. It shows how dehumanizing this whole thing has been. I will say after reading that article, I actually feel lucky that I never fully bought in to all the fear that the media peddled. My mental health has not exactly gone the ways mentioned in the article where I'd be distrustful of others seeing them as disease vectors. I feel grateful that I have found communities like this and r/LockdownSkepticism. </p>
<p>That's not to say my mind has been unaffected in other ways - I seem to have a stronger sense of despair with all the restrictions and removal of other liberties. Even then, when all this is over, I believe that the majority of people would return to normal.</p>

        <p>I was packed shoulder to shoulder at a bar this morning having brunch in a city where spread is supposedly very high. There were definitely way more bar stools at the bar than there were over the summer and I wasn’t that close to anyone when I had brunch in the summer. I rubbed shoulders with the girl next to me. It did not feel weird or wrong. We apologized for the imposition of space but I did that before covid when I was smushed in with people. We did not have masks on. It was completely and totally normal. You know who wasn’t at the restaurant with all of us packed in normally? The people this article is about. And maybe they never will be. And maybe a split society will exist where the germaphobes Covid has created remain mostly isolated and keep delivery drivers employed and just sort of end up in the background while the types of people who were at that bar today have parties and take vacations and have weddings and resume complete normalcy. </p>
<p>And that’s ok.</p>
<p>As long as neither part of society tells the other what they should be doing. </p>
<p>The world has always lived with agoraphobes. Some can be helped, some cannot. I expect some people to experience this. Therapy can help many regain society while some just may be scared beyond saving. </p>
<p>But realistically, there is a majority whether it be a silent or loud one, that will not tolerate this beyond a vaccine no matter what the internet hive thinks it knows.</p>

        <p>How do you think the ultra hysterical people will learn to let go of the fear of their fellow man.  At least with AIDS you could do some basic measures and basically be completely safe.</p>
