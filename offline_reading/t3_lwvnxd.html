    <strong>What's going on?</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been lurking here as of lately, because the pro-mask side just doesn't..sound right anymore. I'm happy there is a vaccine now, but now in the midst of that the government wants people to wear 2 masks? 3 masks? First they said it was one mask, now two masks? And why does everyone have to get second doses? I never wanted to look like a "covid denier" while in pro-lockdown spaces, so I just kept my mouth shut and hoped this was over. But now, it seems like bullshit. If Texas disconnected and deregulated it's electrical grid, and is now according to some making it's people die, then who would say any other state cares? Northern or Southern states, this government is worrying me. And the people who wish death on others over political orientation/not wearing masks are just flat out disgusting to me now. They said their side was right, that they were the nicest, then they would wish death on others. Every time you question them, you'd think they'd tell you and explain, but they just squabble with you like children. Truth and fiction are impossible to differ from at this point. This world, especially the USA, is turning into one big fat joke.</p>
<p>What do you think about the pro-mask side? Why do you think it's turned so..extreme in the past few months?</p></p>

        <p>It's true.  This has been the attitude for some years now.  Whether or not any particular cause is right or just or scientific is pretty immaterial.  If it's trendy enough, and lets people feel virtuous and superior and their facebook feed tells them they have to feel that way, they will.</p>

        <p>Because the pro mask side doesn’t have the so called “science” backing them up anymore so they resort to hostility because they want this to last for as long as possible. Look at their subreddits they love this. They love being home, working from home, not commuting. They don’t want life to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I'm scared. The pro-mask side is exploiting 500,000 deaths for their viewpoints, waving it around like a candy stick. But they don't mourn, they don't care, they only guilt trip you with actual people who have died. They said moderate was always good but it seems everyone is tipping towards the extreme.</p>

        <p>It's what happens when a narrative you believe begins to clash with reality especially if the difference is stark. It is about to become painfully obvious all of this was for nothing at an extremely high cost and it's going to be especially damning when people realized they aided it. This is the equivalent of someone getting close to finding out their partner is cheating. The signs are there and the suspicion is growing but they will violently vehemently deny their spouse is cheating. Then one day they catch them "in the act" and all hell breaks loose. At this point we're just before the reveal...</p>
