    <strong>I've been gaslit into submission</strong>
    <p><p>I give up. I can't take being made to feel like I'm nuts anymore. I can see with my own two eyes the rampant hypocrisy but it doesn't matter. It's as if everyone sees it too and knows it's hypocrisy but instead says without words, "So what bitch?" No one cares. The masks are like colored doo-rag gang attire accessories. They have absolutely nothing to do with public health. Distancing goes out the window whenever it's an approved political rally. I know lockdowns are coming this winter. Right after inauguration day. They'll probably at <em>least</em> last until spring if not summer.</p>
<p>Up until recently, specifically due to covid, I hadn't been political. Didn't vote in a presidential election since 2000 and then it was third-party. I saw the reaction to Trump in 2016 and at first was concerned but then came to think everyone had lost their minds and I became less concerned about Trump and more concerned about the reaction to him -- which turned out to be an extremely well-founded concern. Russiagate was such an obvious setup and nothing. Then the ridiculous impeachment and finally "covid" -- the most "horrifying" cold since, well, ever. Now all the "cases" and "deaths". I wonder how many deaths we'd see from the flu if we tested for it with PCR set to 40 cycles and considered any death with the flu a flu death. We'll never know because we only obsess over the single magic virus that only spreads at football games, Republican rallies, and church and not at Antifa riots etc. Never mind that all the data we have indicates by far the biggest spread happens at home. But I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole of fighting the restrictions or individual pieces of hysterical nonsense one by one anymore. It's pointless. The other side knows this is bullshit and the ones that don't are too far gone stupid anyway. </p>
<p>So what's the most rational thing to do given this? Drive myself crazy or figure out a way to live with this? I can't walk around in society like this. Staring at hypocrisy day in and day out. I really don't feel like seething with anger every single day of my life. I think the only reasonable thing to do is to check out. I'll hit the road and look and see how normal of a life I can carve out in some other state. But I'm going to leave my house of a decade, which I love, in a town I used to love. It's all ruined now. I came to California 20 years ago and it had so much potential but it's basically a mental institution at this point. Maybe nowhere is safe from this mania but I've got to try to figure something else out.</p></p>

<p>Yep, I cracked when I saw the pictures of celebratory crowds.</p>
<p>Agree 100% except I doubt they'll do lockdowns in America again - they don't need to destroy the economy now. Much of the rest will continue.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>I’m in very much the same boat. I feel numb and I’m sick of immersing myself in the never ending psychological warfare. I think this is what exhausted dissidents in the Soviet Union must have felt like: the costs to your physical and mental health are so great that you just give up resisting and do what you’re told.

        <p>I don't know where you live but I find it very unlikely there will be another, full force, "lock down". Where I live, I finally see real resistance. Businesses refusing to close despite the Governor's latest mandates. People saying, "Fck you, no more".  In Feb., it will be almost 1 year into the Covid crisis. Even mentally healthy people are beginning to "break" from corona fatigue. Unless the Biden administration gives us a HUGE stimulus package a lock down won't be possible. And if there was, they would need to have the National Guard and U.S. Army enforcing the locks downs. Most local police departments would not be enforcing this  shit.</p>

        <p>I am in CT and it's just as bad if not even worse here. I want to move to a more free state because this one is too collectively far gone. It wasn't the best before but it was tolerable. This place used to be what I could call home but now it's some dystopian nightmare on steroids. Lots of things holding me down here. Just going to the grocery store is obnoxious now and how fearful so many are is driving me up the wall. I remember when just going to the store was the most stress free experience I could have most of the time but since the masked lunatics have taken over it everything public has an air of hostility nowhere has had before. I would get a kick out of it if it wasn't playing a role in ruining everyone's lives. I spend a lot of time in the forest going along my usual trails nearby as a space where I could disconnect from it all for a while to silence my thoughts in general and some hobbies.</p>

        <p>seeusthroughthis, Brother, what we've gotta accept is that these things called civilizations go in cycles, just like the seasons. We may be entering a "dark winter" and a new dark age, but believe me, our descendants will one day live in a wondrous new renaissance. We simply got the short end of the stick by being born at the wrong time. But then again, we're kinda lucky to see such a liminal stage in history; these are times of mythical, biblical, and epic proportions. At least we got a taste of freedom before the lights went out for another millennium. And sooner or later the lights will come back on. Winter can't last forever. Eventually the ice will melt and the flowers will bloom once again. So be merry!</p>

        <p>Hang in there brother! Much love! We've just gotta fight the battles -- the survival battle, the mental battle, and the spiritual battle -- and we'll make it through okay. You're right, they're trying to gaslight us to death and shatter our sanity with psychological torture, but we're stronger than they think. We will carry on the memory of a (comparatively) free America, and do what we gotta do to slip through the cracks and live life on the edge of society as organic, free-range humans. We may have to live the rest of our lives in absolute squalor and poverty, but as long as we retain our spirits and our honour then we win.</p>
