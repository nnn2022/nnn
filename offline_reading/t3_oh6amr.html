    <strong>Do you think you must be with family in these dark times, even if it means sacrificing your job?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in a really tough spot right now. Currently, I'm away from family in another continent for my job. With the whole madness going on, I may be stuck where I'm for God knows how long. Travel has become incredibly difficult as you know countries can bar the unvaxxed from entry at any moment Only today, Malta issued a ban to the non-vaxxed, even though it's supposed to have the EU Digital Green Certificate in place, which allows entry of those with immunity or negative PCR. Basically, nothing can stop any country from imposing its own restrictions. </p>
<p>For months, I have contemplated going back home, but it's not an easy decision. My family survives on the remittances I send them. If I left my job, we'd be in a difficult financial situation. While I can do my job anywhere, I doubt my employer would allow me to work remotely in another country due to tax residency implications. In addition, my home country is a banana republic ruled by a terrible dictator. I expect that son of a bitch to resort to forced vaccination eventually. There are no decent electricity/internet/water services. Outages and shortages are awfully frequent. It would be difficult to work from home without a stable fast connection. </p>
<p>Should I go back and face the doom and gloom with my family? Or stay where I'm and face doom and gloom alone but support them financially? I think it's a matter of time before all countries go full-blown communist. I guess by now, you do realize that's human rights and freedoms have gone. Under the state of emergency, any government can do whatever it likes now. </p>
<p>How would I defend myself in the face of forced vaxxination alone in a foreign country? I keep imagining a scenario where armed men breaking into my place demanding I get vaxxed or else. Even if I had a gun, which sadly I don't, I wouldn't last in the face of a handful of armed thugs.</p>
<p>If things didn't get that bad (forced vaxxination), I'd still be separated from my family because banning the unvaxxed is 90% likely. My father is old and my brother is a little jobless loser who needs supervision. What if something happened to either of them while I'm away? Those thoughts are killing me!</p></p>

        <p>Sadly no. They depend entirely on my financial support. I can't afford to get them out.</p>

        <p>Well I think it’s more important to be with your family because you don’t know what’s going to happen and you would want to be with them if they start coming after people or ban travel. Plus money will be worthless very soon anyway.</p>

<p>The Philippines, OP?</p>
<p>On a related note to your question, I'd say it depends whether or not your family are fully-initiated Branch Covidians or not. If they are, I'd strongly suggest some physical distance from them, lest they turn you over to the Vaxstapo "for your own good."</p>

        <p>No they are not. They are refuseniks such as myself. I can't get them out of the country either. Our national passport gets us nowhere without a visa. It's not the Philippines but something similar/worse in Africa.</p>

        <p>It depends whether you think you can make enough money to feed your family if you return.  If the answer is no, then it's better to stay where you are.  (Although I do think your brother needs to take responsibility and find work if it's available.)</p>
