    <strong>A short summary of everything suspicious about this 'pandemic'</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>The  constant fearmongering – instead of trying to keep the population calm,  the media and governments are encouraging panic and fear. Using  manipulative pictures and videos to dramatize the situation.</li>
<li>Propaganda (especially propaganda targeting kids)</li>
<li>People  were not encouraged to eat healthy, exercise, go outside and socialise with family and friends, despite all of this contributing to a healthier  immune system. Instead, excessive hand sanitising, physical distancing,  masking… etc. were pushed, all of which are either useless OR make the  situation worse.</li>
<li>The pointless lockdowns, restrictions… etc. that make no real difference</li>
<li>Turning people against others – encouraging hate and blame towards “anti-maskers” “anti-lockdowners”, “anti-vaxxers” etc.</li>
<li>Mass  censoring and condemning of any opinions going against the mainstream  (YouTube videos deleted, websites deleted, experts silenced). Shutting  down any and all alternative discussion, claiming that the science is  settled (it never is) and that there is no room at all for disagreement.  Doctors and scientists with views that differ from the government  narrative having their videos and articles removed from the internet.  The censoring of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals.</li>
<li>How  much the testing and death counts have been fucked up everywhere; the  exaggeration and overblowing of the ‘pandemic’. People being written  down as having died from COVID-19 when they haven’t, written down as  having died FROM the virus instead of WITH, the incredible unreliability  of PCR tests, the high number of false positives… etc.</li>
<li>Claiming  that asymptomatic people spread the virus when they don’t, or at least  not to any significant degree. Locking up HEALTHY people.</li>
<li>The complete infringement on our rights via lockdowns and mandates</li>
<li>Not acknowledging or taking into account the detrimental effects of lockdowns</li>
<li>The  hypocrisy observed among health and government officials (“rules for  thee but not for me”), ignoring or breaking the very rules and mandates  they created.</li>
<li>The  total insistence that every single person be vaccinated because it’s  the only way to stop the virus – even though there are other treatments  that have worked from the start (like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and strengthening one’s immune system). Also ignoring natural herd immunity.</li>
<li>Profits for Big Pharma and Big Tech. They gain a lot from the pandemic.</li>
<li>The  insistence that the world will never return to normal and that we are  now living in ‘the new normal’ – that our previous way of life was bad  and that we must use this pandemic to make the most of it and change our  lives forever. That we need a Great Reset of humanity. The term ‘new  normal’ was thrown around as early as February 2020. Governments and  leaders from all around the world all using the same terms  simultaneously, such as ‘build back better’.</li>
<li>Claiming  that the hospitals are overrun when they are not. Hundreds of videos of  dancing nurses and hospital staff even though the narrative is that  they are working 24/7 to save people from the virus.</li>
<li>Hiding  or lying about any of the negative aspects of the vaccine, assuring  people that it is perfectly safe when it is not (even if there was  nothing nefarious going on, a vaccine will always have side-effects)</li>
<li>Calling it a vaccine (in the case of the mRNA gene therapy) when it’s not, really </li>
<li>Vaccine  manufacturers are completely protected from liability (if you are  harmed because of the vaccine, you cannot sue or take any action against  them)</li>
<li>Sending  sick elderly people back into nursing homes, which significantly  increased deaths (the majority of virus deaths occurred in nursing  homes)</li>
<li>The  changing of definitions and of science that was considered perfectly  correct up until last year (the definition of herd immunity by the WHO,  the complete 180 surrounding the effectiveness of masks… etc.)</li>
<li>Monetary incentives for hospitals to declare someone as having died from COVID-19 (definitely abused in many cases)</li>
<li>The  hypocrisy surrounding mass-gatherings and protests – BLM protests are  fine, Biden rallies are fine, Trump rallies are not, anti-lockdown and  anti-mask protests are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear  in mind that this isn't even really getting into the fact that the  pandemic was planned, or at the very least, that it is being used to  push several agendas. This is just a quick list I made. Please feel free  to share any more points that I may have missed!</p></p>

        <p>That's on the surface, good list. Once you start to look into the "science" behind it all, it gets even worse. There is literally no science behind it all, except lies and assumptions and reliance on a 150 year old unproven theory: germ theory.</p>

        <p>-This is the 7th version of coronavirus (sars,swine flu, bird flu)
-The PCR test was never meant for diagnoses and it only tests for a small genome sequence found in many living and even non living things
The CDC has admitted that they are counting Covid positive people as covid deaths even if they have died of something else
-they are using inflated and distorted figures to justify lockdowns and mask wearing mandates which hurt your microbiome in your mouth which in turn negativity is affects your heart. 
everything is a system and they are making it so your immune system is very weak by sanitizing everything, six feet apart and lack of vitiman D (which coincidendally coincides with covid symptoms)</p>
<p>the Vaccine copypasta i found:
Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.</p>
<p>Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).</p>
