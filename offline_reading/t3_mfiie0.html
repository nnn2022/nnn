        <p>As a Montanan I am both hopeful and anxious from this. While it’s good to see things starting to return to what we remember as “normal,” depending on how many people got the COVID vaccine here, as well as how many are wearing masks, it could be a sign of how things might be moving forward. That being said, given the subreddit this is posted in, I think it’s going to be at least 3-5 years before we see anything as what we remember to be “normal.”</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why this is downvoted, but I would agree. It's not a simple matter of returning to normal. It's also about reversing all the other effects the lockdowns have brought. Some of those such as close buisnesses and automation may not be reversible.</p>
<p>It seems that more blue collar areas are eager to get back to normal as we cannot afford to just stay home and do everything from home.</p>
<p>If it were not for the bears and climate I would consider moving.</p>

        <p>Yes, a beautiful sight of people spreading disease and breaking rules that scientists and researches have determined are the best and most effective way of lowering death rates. Why do you people think that the pandemic has lasted a year, especially in America? Because too many people did shit like this and spread covid. If you had all listened when you were told to and worn a mask, stayed distanced from people, and been smart, we wouldn't be here a year later.when people encourage bad and irresponsible behavior like this, it really pisses me off. You people are the reason that I missed the last half of my school year last year, and missed 3 quarters if this year. You people are the reason that I've developed depression because of the hopelessness of the situation we're in. You people are the reason that some ofmy best friends I've lost contact with. If you could all just stay home and binge watch Netflix like you used to before the pandemic, but as soon as you're told no, I guess you just have to break the rules.</p>

        <p>Lmao you're so mad but you're not mad at the right people bro. This disease has a 99.7% survival rate but you still want me to mask up everywhere and lock myself in my house while I lose my job and struggle to pay rent? Or is that just what's necessary, for millions of people to lose everything they had just so you can feel a little more secure and we can save another grandma?</p>

        <p>I never said I was mad, and if I came off as mad then I'm sorry. you losing your job is not what anyone wants, and the anxiety and stuff that lockdown causes isn't desired. but what's necessary is being as safe as possible, and I believe that you losing your job is the fault of the trump administration's failure to put onace an effective lockdown. if they'd done a good job, this would've been over in three weeks like we were promised</p>

<p>Sorry, 0.2% mortality per the CDC numbers. Remind me again why we closed the global economy? Remind me why flu cases are at 1/5th of the level they were during the very low 2011-12 season?</p>
<p>Tell me why you're whipped into a frenzy over a cough, sniffle, and your hurt feelings. Tell me why your perceived safety is more important than my real liberty.</p>
<p>Had to edit because you got me so salty. There's no way you can possibly blame the hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs on broken systems bro! You shut down everything in the name of safety, and then refused to let it re open, and still refuse (TwELvE PeRcEnT CaPAcItY). The small business owners that got crippled by Walmart/door dash/Amazon because your were so insistent on safety should be on YOUR conscience, not MINE. This is not THEIR Fault, nor is the SYSTEMS fault, it's YOUR FUCKING FAULT, for literally begging to be forced into your house.</p>

        <p>So someone else pointed out a math error in that I added extra decimals, it is actually 2% mortality. And even in action, 500000 dead is not a lot. That's what the world loses in an average flu season. </p>
<p>Is it sad that all those people have died? Of course. Do I wish any of them had died? No. Does it make sense to grind the world to a standstill while miniscule numbers of people die? No.</p>

        <p>500k is in the US alone. if 500,000 is the worldwide death rate for a year of the flu, this is actually extremely bad. 500k in one country, then (assuming it'll be the same for other countries) multiply that by however many countries struggled with covid. that's already millions dead, then factor in countries like Italy that got hit harder. 500k dead is a lot, a humongous amount that could've been prevented</p>

        <p>You're failing to see the big picture; the amount of deaths on the global scale DO NOT match the response given to them. We are in an absolute frenzy over something that is extremely comparable to the swine flu or the SARS outbreak from the middle east a while back, neither of which brought the world to a grinding halt. </p>
<p>500,000 / 330,000,000. And A HUGE number of the 330mil have had years, if not decades, of their lives altered because of the really bad flu.</p>

        <p>How many more people need to lose everything that makes life worth being alive for before you give it the fuck up? Jesus. You were fed a bunch of bullshit lies that it’s possible to stop a respiratory virus if 100% of the population just follows all the arbitrary bullshit rules like how people can go to work but aren’t allowed to do anything but work. You’re a fucking serf. Congratulations. Hope the boot tastes good.</p>

        <p>We are not the reason for any of that. A tyrannical government implementing unconstitutional lockdowns is. We are normal people living normal lives instead of cowering in fear of a bad case of the flu.</p>
