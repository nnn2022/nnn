    <strong>The rift between vax vs. un-vaxed</strong>
    <p><p>This is just my biased personal experience.</p>
<p>I've come to notice that the people around me and in those websites I visit, tend to focus on placing themselves in a group, akin to a tribal group. They see themselves as the ones who have done the right thing and on the opposite side, the ones who "will pay the consequences for their stupid decision".</p>
<p>The people who refuse this "vaccine", see the vaxed people as gullible idiots who have fallen for the globalists/elite/bigpharmafia tricks, and so, they're doomed with no possible saving. They're the enemy since they want to limit our liberties and force vax our kids. They're also a threat if they start "shedding", turning into zombies, or going Cell movie 2016.</p>
<p>The people who took the "vaccine", see the unvaxed as gullible idiots who have fallen for the fascist/Qtards/Trump tricks, and they're doomed with no possible saving.  They're the enemy since they want to put our lives at risk for not being vaccinated and going around without face diapers. They're also a threat because they push their "fake science" theories that the media is quickly to label as "The next covid wave is upon us!"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On both sides I see enough virtue signalling to drown a desert, no discussion, each side claiming the other is against science... lying and manipulation mostly done by the pro-vax and "The Media™" for sure... </p>
<p>I'm not above this. I'm guilty of this too. I'm on the side that thinks this is all a fucking scam and they want to end our liberties with the excuse of covid. This is not something about myself I can control so I can't demand it from others.</p>
<p>I think this will end very badly if they push the force vaccination because that's the hill I'm going to die on. Perhaps that's why they want. Perhaps they want to cull humanity by making us kill each other... Perhaps 90% of the people are getting injected with just some innocuous saline solution and using the other 10% to experiment new technology on because doing it on everyone would be a dead give away of what they're doing.</p>
<p>This is not a post to move people into rationality, this is a reassurance to myself and a reflection of myself. I think I'm correct and I will die before they start putting some fucking gene therapy experiment in my arm and I reckon people who have kids will do even worse.</p>
<p>This all escapes the limits of my intelligence but I know for a fact this is a milestone in humanity, just like the thousands our ancestors had to go over. </p>
<p>So fuck it. Perhaps we're tribal and it is survival of the fittest and we're not as smart as we think. I know I'm not.</p></p>

        <p>Why do they want to end your liberty?</p>
<p>That's the one thing I'm always confused of when it comes to conspiracies. Why?</p>
<p>Why are "they" doing this?</p>

        <p>I’ve found that most (not all) people on the pro vax side are against the means to physically defend themselves and would rather rely on the state to keep them safe. </p>
<p>If this is to come to a tribal war, it’s not going to end well for their side.</p>
