    <strong>People never cared about the disease</strong>
    <p><p>The only thing they care about is following orders. And knowing this, if there was a real pandemic we would all be dead because of the reckless, unquestioning, painfully oblivious thinking of the many.</p>
<p>After the release of the videos from Wuhan with all it's apocalyptic atmosphere, nobody questioned why even a remotely close event never happened anywhere on earth.</p>
<p>After New York City becoming the "center" of the pandemic, nobody questioned the empty hospitals. I guess they didn't care to search on youtube.</p>
<p>USA, UK, and Italy have shown the same copy pasted video as if it's from separate hospitals. People didn't care.</p>
<p>Never had they questioned how eating and drinking in a closed area wouldn't spread the virus, why it's even allowed, and why and how wearing a mask outside should be a strict rule...</p>
<p>They never cared to check that surgical masks dont' protect yourself from others and you would need ffp2 or ffp3.</p>
<p>People didn't care to listen the alternative views from certified doctors just because it's a minority.</p>
<p>Never had they questioned the ever-changing, contradictive narrative regarding masks, mandates, variants, and restrictions thats been altered a hundred times since last year.</p>
<p>Never had they questioned why lockdowns aren't just limited to a variant's country of origin.</p>
<p>And people never questioned why they are even allowed to go to resorts and why they are full of thousands of people yet nobody's dropping dead. Thus never questioning why restrictions become even harsher after holiday seasons.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy is too much. And they are ready and willing to attack us if given the order.</p></p>

        <p>That's what messes with me the most.</p>
<p>There is no logic in any of the rules.</p>
<p>Wanna eat in a restaurant? Fine but you have to wear a mask while walking to your table.</p>
<p>All of this makes it very understandable how authoritarian regimes are able to last that long.</p>
