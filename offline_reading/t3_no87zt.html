    <strong>How to Quickly Spot a Clown/COINTELPRO</strong>

<p>Hello guys, this was pasted from elsewhere and I edited a little bit to remove that which doesn't apply to forums other than from where I found it.  </p>
<p>I've been seeing a lot of these tactics take place in subs that threaten the Great Reset, so I figured I would post it here, especially to those that are recently finding out about what is going on in the world.  However, it's great for old-timers to go through as well and I recommend this to all as a defense against their demoralization campaign against you.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: One thing to bear in mind that this is not a license to stop thinking once you detect what could be an operative.  Be mindful of their gameplan of feeding into paranoia.  Observe, don't react!</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>How to Quickly Spot a Clown/COINTELPRO</strong></p>
<p><strong>They will:</strong></p>
<p>- Attempt to get a divisive or emotional response from you to derail discussion/research.</p>
<p>- Concern troll and copy/pasta spam shill to contradict confirmed findings.</p>
<p>- Employ faux debate tactics: Generalizations, gas-lighting, projection, misdirection, false equivalences, confusing correlation with causation, appeal to authority, transference, false precepts, personal attacks, straw-men, red herrings, etc.</p>
<p>- Promote social ethics that are disingenuous like doxxing, "reverse psychology", or promoting propaganda.</p>
<p>- Promote tactics that are unethical, illegal or involve violence outside the scope of the Law.</p>
<p>- Employ Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt to dissuade research.</p>
<p><strong>Topic sliding</strong> - If information of a sensitive nature has been posted on a discussion forum, it can be quickly removed from public view by topic sliding. In this technique a large number of unrelated posts, or posts aimed at diluting the information presented, are submitted in an effort to trigger a topic slide to literally push content out of view. Operators can control several fake UIDs via the bots they make use of; these can also be called upon in the other techniques to mask the intent of the operator from the users at large. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and bogus postings. </p>
<p><strong>Seeding bad information</strong> Operatives will insert flawed or bogus information from time to time as an ongoing tactic, depending on their skill set and the needs of their mission. Their most common ruse is providing information or evidence which is backed by bad source material in the hope that the "source of the source" is never checked. This serves several objectives, mainly resource consumption, evidence pollution, discouragement and misdirection.</p>
<p><strong>Astroturfing consensus</strong> This is a technique that attempts to build a manufactured consensus around a flawed set of statements or compromised information. This is related to consensus cracking, where false evidence is injected in an attempt to dispute or discredit what the current consensus is, and push it towards the desired false consensus.  Misleading and false evidence and information are often salted into the evidence pool, with an aim to impede organic consensus building, while also poisoning the available information and evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivating tacit approval</strong> (The legal term for this is 'silent agreement') Attempting to attain this state is done using a technique where operators will try to convince the user population to ignore, or not respond to bad information or false assertions. This is done in a bid to reduce push-back against the above mentioned tactics. It's worth noting that the reply filtering mechanism of the boards (which currently can't be disabled without code changes from the site admin) is used as a weapon of sorts in this tactic: Filtering with software prevents users from defending against seeding bad information and astroturfing consensus. This is why the operators push so hard to condition users into filtering material they disagree with.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>How to spot a Clown's bot</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEVER DIRECTLY ENGAGE A BOT</strong> It just wastes space with their responses, and hands them a target to programmatically lock on to without handler interaction. It seems that the easiest way to foil the bots is to point them out by proxy, by copy/pasting the user's ID as a quoted reference and intentionally breaking its thread in your response, and/or answering it with a meme until they start misfiring because they can't parse the response to lock onto a target correctly.. Doing this can also make the bots look artificially erratic and easier for other users to spot.</p>
<p>What we know about the cl0wnbots</p>
<p>- Are used to facilitate topic sliding, manufacturing consensus, obfuscation of intent, and general disruption</p>
<p>- Require a handler to watch for and be in the thread</p>
<p>- Cannot enter threads themselves</p>
<p>- Respond to replies and each other, and can create replies</p>
<p>- Activate on lists of trigger words; these can change over time</p>
<p>- Use a combination of legit frequently pasted lines, pre-written points, or spam targeted at various objectives.</p>
<p>- Have unwittingly pasted frequent supportive replies</p>
<p>- Are employed mostly at night and on weekends (US time)</p>
<p>- Can be filtered by ID once they are observed</p>
<p>- Are not perfected and can be easily spotted</p>
<p>- Have certain flaws that can cause them to misfire in sometimes comical ways</p>
<p>- The handlers can make bogus clown posts, but also can be confused by accidental ones</p>
<p>- Still can not meme</p></p>

        <p>Hope this helps, I'm not really an expert on much but if you have any questions I maybe could help you out.</p>
<p>Think smart, you are a threat to those that wish to control you and one should expect to be treated as such.</p>

        <p>Thank you fellow 4channer this is all applicable to r*ddit as well, maybe even moreso. It's so easy to astroturf shit here because of the upvotes and the censorship</p>
