    <p><p>On May 24, 2021, the court upheld the FDA ban on raw butter. In doing so, the judge suggested that the FDA has the power to ban foods indefinitely under a public-health law meant only for emergencies. This decision presents broad implications on FDA authority, such as raw food. As explained by FTCLDF attorney Mahesha Subbaraman, “if the FDA can use the PHSA to evade” limitation on FDA authority, “the FDA is free to ban not only raw butter but also apples, oysters, sushi, and every other raw food that Americans hold dear.”</p>
