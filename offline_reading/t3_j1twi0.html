    <strong>The Australian government is obfuscating suicide and overdose data for 2020</strong>
    <p><p>I find <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-27/no-spike-in-suicide-rates-in-victoria-during-covid-19-lockdowns/12602060?utm_source=abc_news&amp;utm_medium=content_shared&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_campaign=abc_news">this article</a> from Australia's government-run ABC News to be so completely unbelievable.  It states that from Jan-Aug 2019, there were 468 suicides in Australia. And in 2020, under some of the harshest lockdown rules in the world, there have been 466 suicides. The difference of just two less cases is ridiculous and completely unbelievable. How did they access this data?</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-07/national-suicide-register-needed-coronavirus-surge/12208668">here's another ABC article</a> where they say suicide data here has a two-year lag. Okay so how do we know what's happening in 2020 already? Conveniently curving lockdown scepticism with obfuscation? Also, in the first ABC article, it says Australia has 750 suicides annually, the second says 3000. What's happening here? Read the news closely. Doublethink? Lies? Propaganda?</p>
<p>There is also no mention of overdoses in this ABC article, which is something we need to be aligning with suicide statistics. This will help gain a clear picture of the negative effects of these lockdowns on people's mental health. So far, Australia has had 850 COVID deaths and annually we average 750 suicides and over 2000 overdoses. Watch as the powers that be do everything in their power to keep the suicide number lower than the COVID numbers. A good way to do this is to categorise overdoses as something separate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/mind/coronavirus-australia-mental-health-crisis-looms-as-covid19-impacts-all-aspects-of-life/news-story/7e5c3cafb13375ca0904c216569f6a8c">Here's another article</a> - in this one, it says:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% of Australians say their mental health has worsened since COVID.</li>
<li>4 in 5 Australians are uncertain about their future</li>
<li>Crisis hotline Lifeline has seen a 25% increase in calls, almost 90,000 calls for help (the equivalent of one call every 30 seconds)</li>
<li>Counselling sessions for Veterans and their families have increased by 50%</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/09/10/ment-s10.html">And one more article with mental health statistics</a>, stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Youth crisis service Headspace has seen a 50% rise in referrals of young people to the emergency department due to a mental health crisis</li>
<li>A 33% increase from 2019 in young people presenting to hospital with self-harm injuries</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of these statistics - somehow the government tells us suicides are down? By two less than last year?? I just don't believe it. At all. Also, one convenient piece of missing data is <em>the number of overdoses.</em> According to that second article, Australia experienced over 2000 overdoses in 2019. Yet somehow, <em>that</em> data for 2020 also won't be available until 2022???? Handy handy handy! It would be great to know the effect these lockdowns are having on people in 2020 but we won't know until 2022.</p>
<p>So, in short, we somehow have access to suicide data in August because it shows a lower number than COVID deaths and a lower number of suicides to the same time last year, but no access to actual suicide or overdose data until 2022. And there are blatantly conflicting numbers in two separate ABC articles.</p>
<p>Gotcha. Cool. Well played.</p></p>

        <p>As a guy whos actually living in Melbourne rn, all of you really make it seem like it's worse than it actually is</p>
<p>Our current premier Daniel Andrews have significantly lowered the cases from above 700 a day to just 10 today, yesterday it was 5 which is quite significant, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/21/australia/australia-coronavirus-lockdown-intl-hnk/index.html">it has even been given international praise</a></p>
<p>As for those suicide numbers. I saw those stats earlier myself when I was arguing with a bunch of people in sky news comment sections, while we find common ground that the brutal lockdown has impacted mental health, the evidence you have supplied is insufficient to determine that suicides have indeed gone up, you can speculate all you want and give stats to relate to it, however if you cannot prove that the government is lying then I simply cannot believe it call me a shill all you want, believe ppl already have</p>
<p>I have been following a few independent data analytics. According to the graphs it states that we should hit the requirements that are needed to open up and we will be hopefully out by Christmas, things are looking up</p>

        <p>Wow you are so brainwashed it’s hilarious. Do you work for the government? </p>
<p>You point to case numbers and I point to actual death numbers. Just like the media. </p>
<p>Neither of us can prove that the government is or isn’t lying. Do you think governments have always told the truth? </p>
<p>All I know is that I know considerably more people who have been impacted by mental health and suicide than people effected by the virus.</p>
<p>The median death age for covid in Aus is 83 years old (life expectancy in Australia is 82). Suicide occurs most frequently between people ages 15-44. Are we seriously saving lives of the elderly, those about to die, in sacrifice of people who have an entire lifetime ahead of them?</p>

<p>Those "about to die" are our parents, grandparents, great grandparents. How do you think the loss of those lives is going to affect their descendants?</p>
<p>It appears as if you are trying to cheapen their deaths by implying "they're old so their lives don't matter".  That's a pretty fucked up attitude.</p>

        <p>And I guess on the flip side, you’re saying the lifelong negative impacts of mental health and the lives of our siblings, friends, daughters, sons, nieces and nephews, are way less important than those who have already lived a full life. </p>
<p>That’s pretty fucked too.</p>

        <p>Somebody hates old people. If you can only go off anecdotal evidence and not even mention I said there is currently not enough proof to prove suicides have gone up then well, there you are. Call me a shill but I'm trusting an already trusted source then 'someone on reddit said so it must be true'</p>
<p>Plus since cases are going down that will mean less dead people. Suprisenly those two do corelate, that's how you don't get 200 000, you want more people to die? Not only old people but <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/12121772">young people as well?</a> Because opening up is how you can do that</p>
