        <p>So that raises the question of what it is they're really trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>They obviously aren't interested in the safety of the people since they clearly know that the vaccines are untested and dangerous given they have plans to silence dissent against side effects they themselves acknowledge are very real, so what's the endgame?</p>
<p>What if the conspiracy theorists are right and there actually is something worse in those vaccines? Or even worse, what if they're planning on doing something else entirely and the vaccines, albeit untested, are just a red herring?</p>
<p>What in the world do we do? </p>
<p>We knew they're prepping a PR campaign to discredit dissent against the vaccine, but we know that's what they're going to do so we have an advantage. We need to come up with a plan to counteract their PR.</p>

        <p>Please share your thoughts. To me it isn’t obvious yet. I think they’re testing if mass vaccination will be accepted. Then a second fake pandemic and another vaccine. Thennn the 3rd one will be the chip or harmful substance. But I still don’t get what the goal is. Just asserting their control? Seems like that would get boring for them.</p>

        <p>This woman spells it all out in the most rational cohesive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C1-0XKYAZII">Catherine Austin fitts</a> I personally find it hard to believe they will be able to carry out their trans humanism plans. I don't believe it's possible and that part makes it sound like some wild conspiracy theory but maybe those at the top really believe they can do it.  Basically all of this covid BS is about the consolidation of power, money and control. 
  Everyone needs to watch this, I have never seen or heard anything in last few months make so much sense. It made everything fit together for me about why this is all happening.</p>

<p>The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028: A Futuristic Scenario to Facilitate Medical Countermeasure Communication Emily K. Brunson1 , Hannah Chandler2 , Gigi Kwik Gronvall3 , Sanjana Ravi3 , Tara Kirk Sell3 , Matthew P. Shearer3 , and Monica Schoch-Spana3 1. Department of Anthropology, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, USA 2. Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA 3. Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA ABSTRACT Effective communication about medical countermeasures—including drugs, devices, and biologics—is often critical in emergency situations. Such communication, however, does not just happen. It must be planned and prepared for. One mechanism to develop communication strategies is through the use of prospective scenarios, which allow readers the opportunity to rehearse responses while also weighing the implications of their actions. This article describes the development of such a scenario: The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028. Steps in this process included deciding on a time frame, identifying likely critical uncertainties, and then using this framework to construct a storyline covering both the response and recovery phases of a fictional emergency event. Lessons learned from the scenario development and how the scenario can be used to improve communication are also discussed. KEYWORDS: prospective scenario, medical countermeasures, risk communication, public health emergency, crisis communication Medical countermeasures (MCM)—including drugs, devices, and biologics (e.g., vaccines)—often play critical roles in curtailing the impacts of natural disease outbreaks as well as chemical, Nicholson School of Communication and Media University of Central Florida www.jicrcr.com JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL CRISIS AND RISK COMMUNICATION RESEARCH 2020, VOL 3, NO 1, 71–102 https://doi.org/10.30658/jicrcr.3.1.4 CONTACTS Monica Schoch-Spana, PhD • E-mail: mschoch@jhu.edu • Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, 621 East Pratt Street, Suite 210, Baltimore, MD 21202 © 2020 by Journal of International Crisis and Risk Communication Research. All rights reserved. 71 72 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) incidents (Courtney &amp; Sadove, 2015). It is not uncommon for members of the public, however, to misuse or hesitate to take recommended MCM (Liu et al., 2017; Quinn et al., 2008; Steelfisher et al., 2011). New and unfamiliar technology, an accelerated regulatory approval process, or discordant expert views may heighten perceived risks of MCM, leading to public aversion to the countermeasure and/or diminished public trust in MCM regulators or recommenders (Belongia et al., 2005; Carlsen &amp; Glenton, 2016; Henrich &amp; Holmes, 2011). In other cases, strong feelings of vulnerability in an emergency situation may prompt persons to demand unnecessary MCM, protest their lack of access to MCM with limited availability, and/or use an excessive amount of prescribed MCM (Dart et al., 2015; Durigon &amp; Kosatsky, 2012; Whitcomb et al., 2015). In still other situations, certain social groups may have limited access to MCM because some institutions are still in the process of learning how culture, race, language, and citizenship status produce barriers to health information sharing (Lin et al., 2014; Uscher-Pines et al., 2011). To mitigate all of these issues and ensure proper and timely use of MCM, good communication is key. From 2014 to 2016, the Center for Health Security undertook a research project to catalog MCM communication “dilemmas” (in the broad sense of a problem) in emergency situations and provide practical and strategic recommendations on how better to obtain desired population health outcomes through improved communication. The principal product was a casebook featuring recent health crises (e.g., 2014–2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak and 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant accident) that helped to illustrate the principles and conditions for effective MCM communication (Schoch-Spana et al., 2016). Much of the practice-oriented literature relies upon real crises to illustrate successful (or failed) approaches to risk and crisis communication (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018; Ulmer et al., 2017). The project team similarly used past health emergencies to advance understanding of how communication enables appropriate public use of MCMs, because case studies have compelling benefits for learning: People reason effectively through analogy and not just abstract principles,</p>

        <p>The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 73 contextualization makes broader principles meaningful and memorable, and cases promote reflective thinking and reinforce users’ abilities to apply that knowledge in novel settings (Allchin, 2013; Epling et al., 2003). Leveraging the same didactic qualities as retrospective cases (Varum &amp; Melo, 2010), the project team subsequently developed a fictionalized prospective scenario—The SPARS Pandemic 2025– 2028—to further prepare users for MCM-related risk and crisis communication dilemmas on the horizon. A scenario is an “analytically coherent” and “imaginatively engaging” story about a possible future state (Bishop et al., 2007) that spurs users to envision and exercise their role in shaping potential outcomes (Borjeson et al., 2006; Mahmoud et al., 2009; Wilkinson &amp; Eidinow, 2008). Outlined in this paper and available in full online (Schoch-Spana et al., 2017), the SPARS scenario is intended to help authorities better anticipate MCM emergency communication dilemmas, understand the larger contexts, practice effective responses, and develop acuity and agility for addressing unforeseen problems. The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 features MCM communication dilemmas both of the enduring and emerging kind—especially those in relation to evolving information and communication technologies (ICT). Benefits of Scenarios and Simulations in Preparing for Disasters and Epidemics The forward-looking SPARS scenario is a tool meant to prompt readers to imagine the dynamic and oftentimes conflicted circumstances in which MCM emergency communication takes place. By engaging readers with a rigorous, simulated health emergency the scenario provides opportunities for readers to mentally “rehearse” responses while also weighing the implications of their actions (Borjeson et al., 2006). Apart from testing out responses to foreseeable events, the scenario also provides readers opportunities to consider potential measures in today’s environment that might avert comparable problems or classes of problems in the future; that is, consider how to create a preferred future (Bishop et al., 2007; Borjeson et al., 2006; Mahmoud et al., 2009; Wilkinson &amp; Eidinow, 2008).  74 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA Producing coherent and imaginative narratives about the future to inform decision-making in the present is an approach to planning and risk management that businesses, think tanks, governments, and non-governmental organizations have embraced for a half century or more, and a wide range of aims, applications, and techniques have evolved (Bishop et al., 2007; Varum &amp; Melo, 2010; Wilkinson &amp; Eidinow, 2008). In the case of a lowprobability high-consequence event like a pandemic or CBRN incident in which MCM may be deployed, scenario development provides a way—absent an actual emergency—for stakeholders to characterize specific impacts (based on the accepted science), create a shared vision of the threat, weigh alternatives futures with or without risk-reducing interventions, and stimulate action (Earthquake Engineering Research Institute [EERI], 2019; Preuss &amp; Godfrey, 2006). Earthquake and bioterrorism scenarios, for instance, have played important roles in motivating creative thinking about the need for novel policies and programs and in mobilizing new constituencies around seismic risk reduction (National Research Council [NRC], 2011) and public health emergency preparedness (Hamilton &amp; Smith, 2006; O’Toole et al., 2002), respectively. Scenarios that depict an unfolding crisis are valuable tools that can heighten awareness about complex hazards and also enable practical training for the management of disasters and epidemics through exercises (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC], 2014; Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], 2019; World Health Organization [WHO], 2018).</p>

        <p>Discussion-based exercises (often called tabletop exercises) help participants, typically decision-makers, become more familiar with emergency plans and procedures, individual and organizational roles and responsibilities, and special challenges posed by a particular threat to public health and safety. By contrast, operation-based exercises (such as drills, functional exercises, and field exercises) attempt to incorporate, to a lesser or greater degree, the front-line personnel, equipment, and physical spaces expected to be in play during an actual emergency (FEMA, 2019; Skryabina et al., 2017). A majority of studies on the effectiveness of training in emergency risk communication, in particular, conclude  The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 75 that the impacts of tabletop exercises and simulation for training include enhanced awareness, readiness, and knowledge (Miller et al., 2017). Social Media Challenges/Opportunities for Health and MCM Communication Like the previously mentioned earthquake and bioterrorism scenarios, the SPARS scenario is meant to prepare risk and crisis communicators for future emergencies, and in particular the complex conditions that rapidly-evolving ICT, including social media, are now generating around medicine/public health generally and MCM specifically. ICT use, including text, illustrations, photo, audio, videos, and diagrams communicated through blog posts, instant messages, video chats, and social network platforms, is now widespread and often used for health-related activities. Among members of the public, a 2010 survey by the Pew Research Center, for instance, showed that 8 in 10 internet users look online for health information, making it the third most popular online activity in the U.S. (Fox, 2011). Likewise, practitioners, public health officials, and other health experts are increasingly turning to ICT—which provides a means to reach the broadest possible population in the fastest, easiest, and least expensive manner (Hinton &amp; Hjorth, 2013)—for a variety of purposes. Clinician-to-patient and peerto-peer communication, investing individual patients in their own care, information exchanges among diverse healthcare and public health stakeholders, and detecting and managing disease outbreaks have been transformed through ITC (Charles-Smith et al., 2015; Grajales et al., 2014; Kreps &amp; Neuhauser, 2010; Rice &amp; Sara, 2018). While this situation may appear overwhelmingly positive, some aspects of ITC use and its popularity remain problematic. First, ITC use has altered the dynamics between health experts and the patients and populations they serve (Hawn, 2009). Social media in particular has provided a mechanism for laypersons to readily share their health-related experiential knowledge with each other, thus dislodging the centrality of health professionals’ authoritative knowledge in people’s decision-making and behavior (Hawn, 2009; Househ et al., 2014). 76 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA Second, ITC can, and is, used to spread false information. Wolfe and associates (2002), for example, found that 32% of antivaccine websites surveyed included pictures of “menacing needles” and 23% had pictures of children reported to have been harmed or killed by vaccines. As parents come across these images and their associated stories this can lead parents to place greater emphasis on personal and emotional experience rather than scientific evidence. Referred to as false consensus bias in the social psychology literature, parents may then hesitate to vaccinate or reject vaccines for their children altogether. What is particularly challenging in regard to social media is that such images and negative stories tend to have a greater impact than facts and positive messages. In their research of vaccinationrelated YouTube videos, for example, Keelan and associates (2007) found that while the majority (48%) of the 153 identified videos promoted vaccination and only 32% were negative toward vaccination, the most liked and viewed were the ones with negative content.</p>

        <p>The lowest rated and watched videos were provaccination public service announcements. These positive and negative aspects of ITC, in turn, influence what practitioners and the broader public understand about MCM safety and efficacy, thus presenting new challenges and opportunities for crisis and risk communicators. Medication users, for example, are increasingly sharing personal knowledge and experience of drug benefits and risks via online disease support networks, patient and drug forums, and microblogging (Matsuda, 2017; Sloane et al., 2015). Through social media, these individuals can find both practical information and a sense of community, while drug safety professionals have a new, rich data source with which to mine for potential evidence of adverse events, supplementing uneven healthcare provider reports (Edwards &amp; Lindquist, 2011; Inch et al., 2012). At the same time, great potential exists for the public to encounter misleading or dangerous information about pharmaceuticals, as non-expert consumers deliver their own drug product testimonials and illegal online pharmacies promote their services via social media (Tyrawski &amp; DeAndrea, 2015). Misinformation is proving especially challenging in connection with vaccines where  The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 77 social media users encounter disproportionate negative reporting and images, are more swayed by personal narratives about vaccination’s adverse effects than the science, and tend to judge disparate ideas about vaccines as equally valid, regardless of expertise (Guidry et al., 2015; Kata, 2012; Poland et al., 2009; Witteman &amp; Zikmund-Fisher, 2012). Thus, in this current ITC-rich environment, good communication, and good training for effective communication, is critical. Methods To develop the SPARS scenario a project team with expertise in a variety of areas, including epidemiology, public health preparedness, risk communication, and the biological and social sciences, was assembled.</p>

        <p>Utilizing these diverse perspectives, the team used a combination of the inductive and deductive heuristics delineated by Ogilvy and Schwartz (2004) to develop the scenario premise (Figure 1). This process began with selecting the timeframe for the scenario—the years 2025–2028. These dates, which were 10–13 years in the future at the time, were chosen to provide a timeline that allowed the development of future possibilities, but was not so far in the future as to make the scenario become a work of science fiction. After the timeframe was established, the project team turned to the focal question: What emergency communication issues around MCM are most likely to exist 10 years from now? To begin answering this question, the project team considered the key economic, environmental, political, social, and technological factors they felt were likely to emerge by 2025. Factors considered by the project team included prominent ones such as technological advances like the proliferation of tools to access the internet, increased use of the internet for things like social media and telemedicine, greater political and social polarizations, changing demographics in the United States including an aging baby boomer population, and climate change and urbanization that could result in the (re)emergence of zoonotic diseases. After careful discussion of each of these factors, which included consideration of existing literature and theoretical approaches, the team considered which factors seemed inevitable given present  78 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA FIGURE 1 The scenario generation process, adapted from Ogilvy and Schwartz (2004). #1 - Identify focal issue and time frame #2 - Brainstorm a list of "key drivers" #3 - Sort "drivers" into "predetermined trends" and "critical uncertainties" #4 - Select top 2 "critical uncertainties" and build 2x2 scenario matrix #5 - Select 1 of the 4 futures and elaborate on a complete storyline Deepen the plot through systems thinking Tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end Create characters Employ standard plot lines # 6 - Rene the plot through an iterative process of reection, research, and revision #7 - Explore the strategic implications of the scenario Single out a key decision or a strategic uncertainty that has long-range consequences important to the organization Consider notable forces shaping and inuencing the focal issue: social, technological, economic, natural, political Distinguish inevitable trends that will play out the same no matter what *versus* important trends whose impacts are unsure Reduce each critical uncertainty to an axis with polar cases at each extremity; overlay the 2 axes and produce 4 futures to explore Think of critical events, then delve into underlying patterns and structures that these events signal; use diagrams to see how forces interact Capture time and causality dimensions; rst this, then that; generate a series of headlines describing events over the course of the scenario Personify the magnitude and direction of change by using real or iconic gues Build on common narratives ("winners and losers" and "David and Goliath") Return to initial focal issue to determine gaps, vulnerabilities, options facing the organization The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 79 conditions and which were the most likely to impact the direction of the scenario. From this process, two critical uncertainties were identified: the extent of access to information technology, that the team felt was inevitable, and the degree of fragmentation among populations along social, political, religious, and cultural lines, which the team felt would lead to novel communication issues. The project team then used these uncertainties to construct a scenario matrix illustrating the four possible futures that could be shaped by these trends (Figure 2).</p>

        <p>After careful consideration, the team ultimately chose the “echo-chamber”—a world comprised of isolated and highly fragmented communities with widespread access to information technology—as the future in which the prospective scenario would take place.

        <p>80 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA From this point, scenario-specific storylines were developed, drawing on the subject matter expertise of the project group, interviews with expert working group (EWG) members associated with the larger project, historical accounts of past MCM crises, contemporary media reports, and scholarly literature in sociology, emergency preparedness, health education, and risk communication. This process allowed the project team to identify expected and new communication dilemmas to include in the scenario. As one example of this, the project team considered how the internet and social media affect the social dynamics of health communication. Using the theory of false consensus bias and the findings on vaccination in social media (described previously in the literature review section), the project team identified specific communication dilemmas to include in the scenario. One of these involved responding to a particularly emotional video that was widely spread via social media and then maintained in the public view for months afterward by teenagers who enjoyed the shock value of the images. This specific case, titled “Going Viral,” is presented later in this paper. Once different dilemmas were identified, the team considered how the different storylines could reasonably fit together and what characters were necessary in order for these events to occur. An outline for the scenario was then constructed using newspaper and other social media headlines as markers for key events; in many instances, these remained in the scenario in order to introduce the different dilemmas. Finally, the entire storyline was written in draft form as if the SPARS outbreak had occurred in the recent past, allowing some outcomes and conclusions to be drawn within the scenario. From this point, scenario development entailed a recursive process of continued research and analysis by the project team, review and feedback from EWG members (summer 2015), and two rounds of external review by authorities on risk communication and the MCM enterprise (four individuals in fall 2015, three individuals in summer 2017).</p>

        <p>Comprising the project EWG were risk and crisis communication scholars; MCM developers, producers, and regulators; practitioners in medicine, public health,  The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 81 and pharmacy science; and experienced public health emergency managers at all levels of government. Revisions were made after each review in order to increase the accuracy and usefulness of the material presented in the scenario. The final product, referred to hereafter as the SPARS scenario, is not intended to be a crystal ball of things to come; rather, it is meant to serve as a plausible narrative that illustrates a broad range of serious and frequently encountered challenges in the realm of risk and crisis communication. To increase the usefulness of the scenario, each response- and recovery-phase dilemma is followed by food for thought questions that are meant to prompt readers, reading as individuals or in training groups, to consider how they might respond to similar situations or how they might prevent similar problems or classes of problems from occurring in the first place. Like the studies of scenario-driven exercises (Skryabina et al., 2017) show, including those featuring emergency risk communication (Miller et al., 2017), the SPARS scenario is intended to prepare users for mitigating public health emergencies and managing MCM communication dilemmas more effectively. In the following sections, we outline the scenario environment and how the fictional outbreak begins. We then provide excerpts of two dilemma sections as examples of the larger document.

        <p>For this time period, the project team imagined a world that is simultaneously more connected and yet more divided. There is nearly universal access to wireless internet for even the poorest persons in the United States. Additionally, technological innovations and competition between technology companies have made an even wider range of information technology readily available to all. Despite the possibilities for these advancements to facilitate broad communication between individuals and communities, the project team also envisioned a future where many have chosen to self-restrict the sources they seek for information, often electing to interact  82 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA only with those whom they agree with on significant issues. This trend increasingly isolates cliques from one another, making communication across and between these groups more difficult. In relation to MCM communication more specifically, government agencies like the CDC have increasingly adopted social media technologies, including long-existing platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter, as well as emerging platforms like ZapQ—an interface that enables users to aggregate and archive media content from other platforms and communicate with cloud-based social groups based on common interests and current events. Federal and state public health organizations have also developed agency-specific applications and ramped up efforts to maintain and update agency websites.</p>

        <p>Challenging this technological grip, however, are the diversity of new platforms and the speed with which social media communities evolve. Moreover, while technologically savvy and capable, these agencies still lag in terms of their “multilingual” skills, cultural competence, and ability to be present on all forms of social media. These agencies also face budget constraints, which complicates their efforts to improve public communications efficiency and effectiveness by increasing their presence in existing and emerging social media platforms. SPARS After much consideration of possible emergency situations that would require MCM use, the project team decided on setting the storyline around a novel coronavirus that caused a mild, flu-like disease in most instances, but pneumonia and/or hypoxia requiring hospitalization and extensive medical treatment in a small minority of cases. The project team named this fictional pathogen the St. Paul Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, or SPARS for short, because in the scenario it is first identified in St. Paul, Minnesota. Two features of this disease are important to note because they impact how the storyline of the scenario plays out, as well as some of the communication dilemmas that occur.</p>

        <p>First, the project team decided to make SPARS have an extended incubation period  The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 83 (7 to 10 days) but a short latent period (4 to 5 days). This complicates the scenario because infected persons in the story are capable of spreading the virus for up to 6 days before showing symptoms of the disease themselves. This feature of SPARS makes isolation procedures in the scenario, like urging people to stay home if they think they might be sick, less effective than what is typically expected for airborne pathogens and thus introduces novel dilemmas in the storyline. Second, the project team decided to make the morbidity and mortality from SPARS both significantly higher in children than adults, and among pregnant women and those with chronic respiratory conditions. This parallels disease characteristics associated with past disease outbreaks, including the H1N1 pandemic, and allowed for some communication dilemmas from the past to be revisited under different future circumstances. In all, the SPARS scenario provides 19 specific storylines, and an associated 23 communication dilemmas for readers to consider. An outline of the entire storyline is available in Table 1, and a list of the communication dilemmas provided in the scenario can be found in Table 2. The following sections provide excerpts of two dilemmas included in the scenario as well as their associated communication dilemmas and food for thought questions.</p>

        <p>TABLE 1 Timeline of Events in the “SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028” Scenario 2025 October The first US deaths occurred due to SPARS. Initially, these deaths were thought to have been caused by influenza. November Cases of SPARS were reported across Minnesota and in six other states. Thanksgiving holiday travel and Black Friday shopping facilitated spread of SPARS beyond the Midwest (26 states and multiple other countries by mid-December). The WHO declared the SPARS pandemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. December No treatment or vaccine for SPARS existed, but there was some evidence that the antiviral Kalocivir could be effective as a therapeutic. 84 BRUNSON, CHANDLER, GRONVALL, RAVI, SELL, SHEARER, and SCHOCH-SPANA A proprietary vaccine developed and manufactured by a multinational livestock conglomerate (GMI) was proposed as a potential foundation for a human vaccine. The vaccine was developed to combat an outbreak of a similar respiratory coronavirus in hooved mammal populations in Southeast Asia, but the vaccine had not been licensed by any regulatory authority or tested in humans. There were concerns over potential side effects. 2026 January The US government contracted CynBio to develop and produce a human SPARS vaccine based on the GMI animal vaccine. The HHS Secretary invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) to provide liability protection for the vaccine manufacturer and providers. Congress authorized and appropriated emergency funds under the PREP Act to provide compensation for potential adverse side effects from the vaccine. Following reports of Kalocivir’s limited success in treating patients with severe SPARS infections, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the antiviral. Kalocivir had been evaluated as a therapeutic for SARS and MERS, and several million doses were maintained in the SNS, which could be deployed as necessary while production capacity was established to meet demand. The FDA, CDC, and NIH provided seemingly conflicting communications regarding the safety and efficacy of Kalocivir.</p>

        <p>In the United States, public anxiety around SPARS resulted in extensive use of Kalocivir, frequent self-reporting of SPARS symptoms, and a surge in demand for medical care. By late January SPARS was detected in 42 countries and all US states. February A lack of cultural competency in FDA and other governmental communication became apparent among various ethnic groups in the United States. A video of a 3-year-old vomiting and fainting after taking a dose of Kalocivir was widely and rapidly spread via social media, strengthening opposition to the EUA. The SPARS Pandemic 2025–2028 85 The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the European Medicines Agency jointly authorized the emergency use of a new antiviral, VMax, in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union. Some Americans attempted to gain access to VMax online or by traveling to Europe. April The CDC publicized an updated (and significantly lower) case fatality rate in the United States; the perception of lesser risk triggered a drop in public interest. May Production of Corovax, the SPARS vaccine produced by CynBio, was well underway. Federal agencies initiated a communications campaign using well-known public figures with mixed results. Polls indicated a 15–23% increase in SPARS and Kalocivir knowledge nationwide. Hip-hop icon BZee had success promoting public health messaging with an online video clip, but he lost credibility when he compared volunteers for Corovax trials with “volunteers” from the Tuskegee syphilis study.</p>

        <p>I don't think covid is fake, it makes sense that a new virus would pop with record population density. I do think the next virus that pops up in five years is though. they have found I tried and true method to steel our freedoms. what is important now is that we make sure this sort of thing can never happen again, the perpetrators must be brought to justice.</p>

        <p>In regards to your title, are you surprised that a research institution would host events discussing real-world scenarios?</p>
<p>In fact, it would be far more alarming if no simulation or preparation for a global pandemic was being managed by the most well-equipped universities we have.</p>
<p>And no, the simulation was not "identical" to the current pandemic.</p>
