        <p>You and me both, brother.</p>
<p>I say this in all seriousness; if you haven't already, stock up.</p>
<p>Buy anything &amp; everything you can. I mean; obvi don't be dumb about it, but stock your home with canned food; stuff that lasts a long time.</p>
<p>Don't buy stuff you'd never normally eat; but if you, for example, like canned chili like I do; get several cases instead of 3 cans.   </p>
<p>Same with canned veggies &amp; whatever else. </p>
<p>Stock up your freezer.</p>
<p>You DO have a large, stand-up, full-size freezer, right?</p>
<p>If not; that's your homework this weekend. Buy a full size freezer &amp; stock it with your favorite foods.</p>
<p>Stock up on medical supplies; just everything. There's so much to prepping.</p>
<p>I truly believe bad shit is coming....very bad.....</p>
<p>Sorry; I don't really mean actually "buy everything" but..... from a rational preparedness standpoint.....if that makes any sense.... üòëüòê</p>
<p>Buy guns if you don't have several. Buy more ammo than you can fit in your car.</p>
<p>Just stock the fuck up. I think we're in for a nasty next few years.</p>

        <p>Ok so. A friend of mine who knows someone who would know just told me this today as well. So I bought what is probably about 2 months worth of dirt cheap food off Amazon today for me and my family. I don't have much extra time so I just used amazon. Got one of those emergency kits. My husband just looked at me like I'm insane when I told him.</p>

        <p>Good.
Buy some extra canned food too; chili, vegetables, etc.
The idea with prepping is to buy stuff you'd normally buy and eat; just buy more of it. Slowly rotate through it so stuff doesn't go bad.
You do not want to buy food, stick in in a corner, forget about it and hope it's good when you need it....</p>
<p>You should always have a little emergency kit stashed away too, like you just did tho.... good job.</p>

        <p>I did buy a whole bunch of chili cause I was thinking of your comment. 10 pound bag of rice, beans, bunch of peanut butter etc. I hope this food shortage doesn't really happen because if so it will be more pain and suffering for people. The whole population is gonna have ptsd from life after 2020. My friend's source who is connected to the government said that it's something to do with food costing too much to import to usa, that it's supposed to be really bad and should probably happen soon. Wondering if you heard similar?</p>

        <p>Oh, nice!!
A couple more tips;</p>
<ul>
<li>Really do try to rotate your stocks, using oldest food first.</li>
<li>Quickly mark cans / containers with a sharpie of the month &amp; year you purchased.</li>
<li>Ensure you keep tabs on the environment your food is stored; significant temp swings, for example, are no good!</li>
</ul>
<p>All the stuff you say you‚Äôve bought is great! Lasts a long time, nutritious &amp; calorie dense.
At my local Smart &amp; Final, beans &amp; rice are RIDICULOUSLY cheap.</p>
<p>I got a ~20 lb bag of pinto beans. Wife cooked some up a short while ago &amp; DAMN: I could literally eat straight pinto‚Äôs with nothing else! They‚Äôre delicious!!</p>
<p>I too pray to God I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm preparing for the worst, just in case‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>If I am; then you don‚Äôt have to shop quite as often‚Ä¶ I think you will find great peace of mind from being so well stocked, though.</p>
<p>Regarding what your friend said;
I have precisely zero inside information on anything that is going on.</p>
<p>I simply read a lot and take in a TON of information before I even begin to draw any conclusions.</p>
<p>The conclusions I‚Äôve drawn, I only maintain as long as they are supportable by data points.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll listen to just about anybody on just about anything, but I look for patterns.</p>
<p>If one person in a hundred tells you some thing, you must weigh that differently compared to if 75 people out of 100 are telling you some thing.</p>
<p>I try to keep myself relatively well informed from any non-MSM source and at the end of the day, I‚Äôve always liked being prepared.</p>

        <p>Hey thank you for helping me out here with this. I loaded up some more and got some extra beans. Got some chickpeas too, could make hummus with those. I was thinking today that if this is an import issue like my source said, it's possible we see a coffee shortage as well. So I went ahead and bought 15 pounds of coffee beans lol. Can't go without that. I kinda have a feeling something like this will happen, I was kinda getting a hunch Sunday in the supermarket that I should do this and then I dismissed it. In particular I have a feeling we might see a honey shortage and no clue why I keep thinking that. One other thing, it occurred to me if this does happen, usa farm stocks/grocery stocks might do well so I bought a bit there.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the delay; took me a while to write this!</p>
<p>You are more than welcome!!</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm pretty blown away that you took action so quickly!! Good for you!!! üò≤üòé</p>
<p>And thank YOU! It drives me insane when I give advice &amp; it's totally ignored...LOL!</p>
<p>Anyway; there's SO much to prepping; it's quite the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times it has helped from a pure practical / everyday perspective; wife forgets to defrost meat or doesn't have time to run to the store; she can always just root around our pantry &amp; freezer and find everything she needs to pull together a healthy, filling &amp; delicious meal. üôÇ<br>
As for coffee &amp; similar small, everyday items; </p>
<p>In all seriousness; that's a CRITICAL part of prepping; if you drink coffee / caffeine regularly; have you ever had caffeine withdrawals?</p>
<p>For me; it is literally debilitating; awful, horrible nausea and splitting headache. Fortunately, I've learned to better recognize them creeping up, and keep very aware of my caffeine intake, so if I feel one coming on, I pop a caffeine pill (or half; whatever) and I'm good.</p>
<p>If you are a regular coffee drinker; YES; you HAVE to stock some coffee. I'd suggest you just work through the beans you just bought - great job! - and get some freeze dried Nescafe. Just like Mountain House (below); freeze dried coffee will last just about forever, with no real special care / storage.</p>
<p>They had freeze dried coffee a while ago at costco; two huge jars for a reasonable price; like $20 or something. It's very easy to find; it's a popular product.</p>
<p>I switched to just caffeine pills a long time ago because they're so much easier &amp; faster than coffee. LOL. So I keep stocked on those too!</p>
<p>Same with any other habit / vice; I'm not saying stock booze to plan on getting drunk, but a little for barter is a good idea. Vodka can seriously be used to clean wounds in a pinch &amp; other practical uses.</p>
<p>Stash away some small comfort foods &amp; items for yourself; if shit really goes sideways, you will need all the comfort you can get. Extra perfume / cologne; deodorant; candy; etc. Small comforts mean the world when we're stressed out.</p>
<p>Same with honey; it's got TONS of uses; both cooking / food and other; and it lasts just about forever. When it crystallizes; it's still fine; just heat to use. I don't think honey ever spoils / goes bad. Stock up!</p>
<p>Plus it's WAY better for you than any other sugar, and if you buy honey made in your area, it is very helpful in combatting allergies! I've tried it; works well. Well; bee pollen actually, but local honey's good for allergies too. :-)</p>
<p>It just feels great to be even mildly prepared; and I'm not even that big a "prepper" compared to many people!</p>
<p>Here are some more resources &amp; things you might consider:</p>
<p>This website is killer; it's run by and targeted to "normal" people who want to be prepared. Let's face it; there can be some interesting people in the prepper community; this site is useful for almost anyone, but again most helpful to the average person who wants to be generally and overall prepared:</p>
<p>https://theprepared.com/</p>
<p>I have several of these MH freeze dried food buckets stocked. Mountain House is far &amp; away the best freeze dried food on the market. It's been endlessly tested and has proven to hold up nutritionally and taste-wise, for 30-40 years:</p>
<p>Mountain House Bucket - 24 meals</p>
<p>https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-House-Backpacking-Servings-0081635A/dp/B0843HYLK9/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mountain+house+bucket&amp;qid=1628269812&amp;sr=8-5</p>
<p>It doesn't require any special care / handling / storage, so its great to toss in the closet or wherever &amp; have an extra stash of food that you really don't have to worry about.</p>
<p>I mean; don't put it in an outdoor, uninsulated shed where it's exposed to the elements, but if you keep it in a closet or cool &amp; dry basement, it should last almost forever. At least 30-40 years.</p>
<p>MRE's are also great to have on hand:</p>
<p>https://www.mredepot.com/</p>
<p>They are expensive per serving / per calorie, but they are 100% well; Ready to Eat (Meal Ready to Eat). They come with a little warming packet to heat the food if you want &amp; have time, but you can literally just rip 'em open &amp; start eating, anytime, any place, no heat, water, preparation of any sort required.</p>
<p>Lots of people use them for camping &amp; mundane uses. Shelf life is closer to 10-15 years (more the cooler they are stored) but just a good option to have on hand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Keep up the great work!!!</p>

        <p>Are you referring to their satanic compulsion / requirement to disclose intentions / get their victims approval?</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that for me please? I've heard of that in bits &amp; pieces.</p>
<p>I hear what you are saying about TV vs news, but if they openly came out with A HINT of "may cause fertility issues"; I believe that would really turn a ton of people off from it.</p>

        <p>Well, I looked at this YouTube and read comments there and my response here was actually.. for the comments there.  But yeah.  I‚Äôm saying- their little hints are complete shit and 90% of the population won‚Äôt be tipped off in the least.  Their black magic plan will be shit because of it!    (And, I only know about this stuff from comments and writs in conspiracy sub, and reading books)</p>
