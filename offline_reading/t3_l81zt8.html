    <strong>Would we like/need/enjoy a peer support space for those struggling with mental health and addiction, caused or worsened by lockdowns and other measures?</strong>
    <p><p>Would you like that, or would it be excessive? Obviously there're already mental health and addiction subs but I don't really feel free to speak openly about the causes of my current struggles. The bleak hopelessness and joylessness of it all... of this lockdown madness (in the Netherlands). And I'm not even particularly affected compared to some other people, but the absolute lack of good reason for it all makes it even worse. Places where I could normally find support, only make me feel like I have to lie and pretend even more, and to tolerate people's covid anxiety when I'm just really not in a mood for being polite and nice about this. I also feel like my current struggles are directly tied into how maddening this situation has become.</p>
<p>It's the evening here and I'm white-knuckling it really hard. After a few years of no drinking and no relapse I'm really gritting my teeth again. Last night too. I'm choosing not to do it, not to drink, but part of me thinks ''why the heck would it matter, it's all pointless and hopeless anyway. It's bleak, boring, tyrannical, pointless, meaningless, vain, void,dumb, insulting, humiliating and degrading and it's not going away anytime soon''.</p>
<p>I guess it's just a question... I'm neutral in this. I'd personally use such a sub, but I understand that it's good if we don't get too fragmented. And maybe (likely?) it wouldn't even get any traction. Maybe I mostly just want to talk to people who're in a similar boat, talking on an equal level with people about everything without having to go into pointless debates or be polite about understanding different viewpoints and all that blah.</p>
<p>I'm trying really hard not to turn into a reverse doomer but even the most ''optimistic'' scenario (freedom by autumn 2021) makes me want to drink to cope with the disgust and despair if I'm being really honest.</p>
<p>Have a nice evening, I wish you the best &lt;3</p></p>

        <p>I could use a sub like that a lot. I see people crying out for help in other lockdown critical subs. I think it would be good to have one centralized place just for venting doomer feelings about the lockdown madness.</p>

        <p>Okay, I'll keep it in mind... Hang in there. </p>
<p>Personally, I'm going to bed now, I'm exhausted. It's better to be exhausted in bed sober than exhausted and fighting this urge.</p>
<p>Have a good night :)</p>

        <p>The same elites have tried squeezing as many bodies as they could in communal living: Concentration Camps, Gulags, Kommunalkas. Now they are testing the opposite hypothesis. Be sure that the future generations will be living in optimal conditions in their specially crafted Project Pods.</p>
