    <strong>No, unvaccinated are not the reason why we're still in this, here's why</strong>
    <p><p>This seems increasingly harder to accept for doomers all around the world simply because that's what they've been repeatedly told by the media. </p>
<p>After all aren't unvaccinated people the perfect scapegoats ? It's so much easier to blame them than to start questionning the media and the government. The cold hard truth that we live in a world much darker than we think, that is ruled and controlled by evil people that only care about money and power...not you, is very hard to accept for the average person.</p>
<p>This propaganda campaign aimed at unvaccinated people is meant to divide. That is because if people are busy fighting against each other then their attention will be diverted from the real ennemy. An united population is what scares the ruling class, because they are the bringer of change. Did you notice that over the years people got more and more polarized, especially on social media ? Yeah this has been going on way before covid. </p>
<p>Going back on topic. People have been fed a lot of lies that we need to debunk.</p>
<p>First of, people naively believe that if 100% of the population get vaccinated the virus will magically disappear. That's not how it works and it never work that way. </p>
<p>Vaccinating close to 100% of the population, hell even more than 80% is absolutely impossible unless you're willing to go full Gestapo mode and send the army to force people to take the jab.
But let's assume 100% of the population gets vaccinated, why do you expect vaccines that were primarily made to reduce symptoms, not transmission, to be enough to make an incredibly resilient virus disappear ?
Here's what the CDC director recently had to say about the covid vaccines : “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.” 
Source : https://web.archive.org/web/20210805232759/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e</p>
<p>All of this is not even accounting for the fact that mass vaccinating during a pandemic is not only foolish but dangerous. Why ? Because "leaky" vaccines that aren't efficient enough at preventing transmission are the perfect breeding ground for more virulent variants.
Don't believe me ? That's fine, here's some research paper on the subject : https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</p>
<p>It was used as a reference for this interesting article : https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vaccines-enhance-spread-of-deadlier-chicken-viruses</p>
<p>So what can we do against covid is those experimental vaccines won't cut it ? Well, how about we actually start treating people that are infected with covid ? I'm still baffled that some of you believe that the government actually cares about saving lives when their response to the pandemic is "oh you got covid ? Sorry we're not going to do anything about it, just stay home and hopefully it doesn't get too bad to the point where you have to get to the hospital".</p>
<p>There are tons of effective treatments against covid. Hqc, ivermectin, azithromicin, zinc and so many other. Medecine that know is safe because they've all been FDA approved and used for decades. Unlike you dear vaccines whose long term side effects are still unknown to this day. </p>
<p>Anyways that'll be it for now, can people try to refute what I've said ?</p></p>

        <p>Exactly.  The Delta variant that is currently kicking ass came from India in... February?  March?  India had an aggressive vaccination program, they could not have reasonably vaccinated faster.  Unvaccinated by choice had nothing to do with it.</p>
