        <p>Humour me. Since you seem to be a one-trick anti-face-diaper pony at this point. </p>
<p>Someone is wearing a face diaper. In short order, it has pathogens from that person’s body on the inside of it, and pathogens from other people’s bodies on the outside of it. </p>
<p>In your mind, what percent of that person’s pathogens get pushed through the mask out into the air, and what percent get rebreathed?  </p>
<p>Then considering we breathe in and out with the same force, what percent of the other people’s pathogens get pulled through the mask and breathed in, and what percent get blown off the mask back into the air? </p>
<p>You can’t have it both ways. Either the pathogens go through the mask in both directions, or they don’t go through the mask in either direction. It’s not an asymmetrical membrane.</p>

        <p>Idiots that think they are clever...lol</p>
<p>- The OP never suggested at all that masks were asymmetrical</p>
<p>- The OP is merely stating that particles that adhere to the surface will eventually be inhaled.</p>
<p>- Particles will in fact travel through in both directions</p>
<p>- Some particles, mostly those contained in liquid, will absorb into the material, and some of those will be inhaled through the mask membrane, some exhausted, some will be rebreathed and some will be dispersed from the surface.</p>
<p>- Masks are primarily designed to stop the inhalation of external particles, except surgical which are designed to prevent "droplets" from falling into the open wound of a patient</p>
<p>- Of course you need to accept the fact that paper, cloth or even surgical are not designed to prevent particles as small as COVID from freely passing through period.</p>
<p>- As for Inhaling and exhaling, inhaling requires much more muscular exertion than exhaling. our lungs are like a balloon, its harder to blow it up then it is to exhaust the pressure.</p>
<p>- When we inhale with a mask, we create a negative pressure which the mask will then form a tighter seal around the face, forcing air to be drawn through the mask itself. Therefore any residual particles small enough to pass through which have been captured by a mask fiber, most likely will make their way through the membrane layers and be inhaled.</p>
<p>- When we exhale wearing a mask, we create positive pressure which will push the mask off our faces breaking the seal and allowing for more airflow to pass through the sides as opposed to through the mask. This can be measured just using a vacuum and sock that forms a gentle seal around the nozzle..Turn the vacuum on, watch and listen, now reverse the flow so its exhausting, again watch and listen...You can even replicate the process by using fine saw dust (which sawdust to socks is like COVID to masks) and keep switching flows like you are breathing, and if you are so inclined, follow up by dampening the sawdust, you will notice more particles collecting on the surface and you will also notice that the breathing mechanism (vacuum) as to work harder to pull air through, however, eventually those wet particles will dry and becasue they have been imbedded into the material fibers will have a better chance of being inhaled than dispersed...becasue of how the pressure works.... IT makes more a great experiment for those who  do not understand the basic dynamics of masks through positive and negative air flow. </p>
<p>- I've never officially measured the amount of particles that pass through, or get dispersed, but suffice it to say that more than enough will make it through..</p>
<p>I worked in the asbestos removal industry for years and if you want to debate masks, well I'm your man...However, it sounds like you are just making an attempt to be a clever idiot with absolutely no understanding of the subject matter you are attacking...I also see you are being an arrogant condescending prick by your responses below, but you can't even answer the questions yourself and you proceed to make false claims about how we inhale and exhale using the same force which is utter bullshit. Just breathe...how long does it take you to inhale, and how fast can you exhale that same air...And we are not talking about trying to exhale past the 0 pressure threshold, trying to empty the lung cavity.</p>
