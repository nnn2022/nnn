        <p>Oh. I thought you were the same person as the person above who DID say something about their grammar, sorry!</p>
<p>And honestly, I think it’s unlikely they’re a bot or lying, assuming I remember what they said correctly. I’d think that you’d just think they’re misinformed, and probably not intending malice. As someone who is from Florida and for masks, I truly have no desire except keeping people safe- not brainwashed, just alive and without long-term conditions. Now, I’m not a bot, and I’m not lying. Am I misinformed? Possibly. Almost tautologically, I don’t think I’m wrong or misinformed- and of course you don’t think you’re wrong or misinformed either, even if I think you are.</p>
<p>As for what he said about people who want the restrictions to be looser being selfish, or whatever it was... I do think there are some people who are selfish, and understand full well that what they do can possibly kill people like me (I have asthma) even if I do take all the proper precautions. It’s not always possible for me to be safe; for example, I urgently needed a tooth extraction recently, and I had no choice but to sit in a chair for an extended period with no mask. If other patients had COVID, maybe from going to one of the beaches in the above picture, I could have very easily gotten it despite doing everything right. (I am getting vaccinated as soon as I can, the first appointment I could get is actually tomorrow.) So I do think that some of those people are selfish.</p>
<p>But I also think there are others who aren’t selfish or anything, but just don’t really understand all the numbers. I don’t mean that as an insult in any way- hell, it’s hard for me to understand the numbers. One in a million and one in a billion feel the same to a human mind, despite the thousandfold difference- our minds simply can’t process large numbers well. And I think that there are a lot of people whose brains simply calculate the numbers in a way that, to no fault of their own, underplay the seriousness of the situation. </p>
<p>And is it possible I’m overplaying it? Maybe, I won’t say that’s not possible. The number I can most get my head around is that there have been a bit more than 29 million confirmed cases in the US, and the population of the US is around 328 million, so over 10% of the population has had COVID. I don’t really want to choose a number between 1 and 10 and get killed or have long-term lung damage if I guess the wrong one. </p>
<p>I do think that this sub does more harm than good, and the ideas present on it probably have cost a lot of people their lives- including a lot of people who tried to wear masks and do everything right. Now I don’t think that there’s malintent from most of the people here, as I said- but the continued perpetuation of the ideas does scare me. It’s like... A lot of the Christians on crusades back in the day probably genuinely thought they were saving souls and doing the right thing. I still don’t think they <em>were</em> doing the right thing. That’s sort of my view on this sub, anyway.</p>
<p>Sorry, I got sidetracked from my original point. At the end of the day, my point is this- please try to be open to the idea that we just want to keep people safe, just as I’ve accepted that you just want to keep people free. As for the question of trading freedom for safety... I think the decision should be up to the individual, and unfortunately that does mean that some freedoms should be restricted for everyone, because if your freedom makes me not safe then I don’t get to make the decision of my freedom vs my safety, in the same vein as how your freedom to murder is restricted for similar logic. I’m not calling you a murderer, I’m just drawing an analogy.</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text.</p>

        <p>No man, it's cool. I actually read all that. I do believe that you're worried about safety because you're misinformed. I've had the China virus( I too have asthma I work IT and my health is about three worst it's ever) been, my wife had it, my 2 young kids were sick but tested negative, my nephew just had it, my wife's entire office got it, 500-700 college football players and staff got it... not a single individual I just mentioned required anything but rest and Ibuprofen. No hospital visits, no serious cases, almost just like the flu. Btw, everyone I just mentioned was militant about wearing masks.</p>
<p>I for one was shocked, in my 30"s, to learn just last year that the flu kills on average 80k Americans every year. Dude, just in America 80k deaths. Average. 150k is not uncommon. I for sure thought those numbers were worldwide, but no, that's just America. Check out worldwide numbers. Blew me tf away honestly. Really put this shit in perspective. </p>
<p>Masks may have always been a good idea if you're sick or worried about pollution and the upside to all this that they won't be so taboo anymore. However, this is a reportedly extremely small, highly aerosolized virus that  doesn't get stopped by your standard mask. Looking at all the numbers, putting everything in perspective, mask mandates are no longer needed. IMO they never were. Not with all the other safety measure enacted.</p>
<p>At first, you may have had a point. A year into this, with the numbers and studies out, your fear and concern for public safety is unwarranted. At this point, if you're so worried about it, stay home. All this lockdown BS, mask mandates, selective business activity has to stop. It's on you to stay home now, the rest of us have lives to live.</p>

        <p>I do stay home! As best I can anyway. I never go out to eat, I always wear a mask out. But as I said, I can’t always- for example, when my tooth needed to be extracted, I didn’t have the option to stay home, and I do have to go out to shop.</p>
<p>As for what you said regarding the flu- that’s 80k deaths a year in the US. Coronavirus has been around and “big” for almost a year at this point, and there have been 530k deaths. That’s around six and a half times as much as the flu. And that’s with the measures that have been in place- even if I accept they aren’t super effective, I do believe they’ve lowered it by some amount. It’s the quantity that’s the question.</p>
<p>And in favor of the fact that the methods have been quite effective, if I have the right number (which I may not, but I think I do), there have been under a thousand flu deaths this year. That means the masks and stuff get rid of 79/80 deaths, which is a ton! If there were 80x as many COVID deaths, there would be 12% of the entire US dead.</p>
<p>Now, I do know you can’t directly compare the numbers like that, but I do think it at least helps to show that the masks and stuff do help.</p>
<p>As for your experience with COVID: I am truly happy that neither you nor anyone you know suffered ill effects. The percentage of those who die is only 1%, so that does check out, especially if a lot of the people weren’t high risk, and I’m not sure of the percentage of hospitalizations.</p>
<p>That said- there are 500,000 people who died from it, and I don’t know how many hospitalizations. Nobody you knew had horrible things happen to them, but some people- far too many people- did have horrible things happen to them. And if we can prevent that, shouldn’t we? </p>
<p>I do understand the toll it’s taking on people’s mental health and the economy and whatnot, don’t get me wrong. But the lives saved are saved, and asking people to stay at home and wear masks for a bit over a year until everyone (or most people) are vaccinated... I don’t think that’s a horrible request. It totally sucks, yeah. But I don’t want me living my life to make it so someone else can’t live theirs.</p>
<p>And the fact that everyone you mentioned was militant about wearing masks- that goes to my point! Even if you do the right things, you can catch it if other people don’t. That’s why, even if I’m willing to risk my own life, I still shouldn’t do it- because I’d be risking other people’s lives too, and they wouldn’t have a say in the matter.</p>
<p>As for the numbers you say that show your point- please, show them to me! If I’m wrong, I’d gladly hear it. However, if it’s something like California vs Florida, I’d recommend making sure that it accounts for confounding factors like different population densities before reading too heavily into it.</p>
<p>As a final note- can I ask why you call it the China Virus? It’s not an inaccurate term per se, given the known origin; but the use of the term really bothers a lot of people, and it doesn’t hurt at all to use COVID or Coronavirus instead. You seem like you aren’t the sort of person who would use it with the goal of bothering others, so I’m just a bit confused as to why you would. There may be a totally innocent reason! I’m not accusing you at all, I’m just asking. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to respond to me, by the way! It’s always nice to be able to discuss this sort of thing calmly, because there’s the sort of feeling that whatever the resolution is, the world is probably going to be a better place at the end of the discussion- whoever’s right!</p>

        <p>I say China virus bc there's lots of coronavirus' and I'm sick (pun intended) of hearing or using "covid". Not my problem if some half wit, racist moron attacks an Asian person bc we have a virus that came from Asia. Tired of dealing with morons, I'm gonna call a spade a spade and people's feelings and actions be damned. </p>
<p>I can't say what I'm about to say more earnestly but with less hesitation bc it's a hard pill to swallow....but the death numbers from the virus are grossly misreported and nobody knows the truth. There's specific cases that stand out like alcohol poisoning for ex. that were reported as "covid deaths" and I believe cases like that are misleading not only because they're so outrageous one might think it's a outlier, but also so outrageous it makes one wonder if that passed as a covid death, what else did? With that said, this is a brand new virus we weren't prepared for, we've dealt with the flu and had a vaccine for it my entire life and I'm not young! 80k deaths on average that go so unnoticed, so unreported that in my mid 30's I learn of the flu's impact for the first time. A brand new virus vs a similar virus we've had decades of vaccine research against......point is, this is America and we're supposed to do things differently. Yes the virus is real, yes it kills people, but GD'it this is America and it's my body, my choice. Please, urge me to do the right thing with my body especially if it affects you, but it's still my choice. That is unique, and very important in a modern, developed country</p>

        <p>So from my perspective, you’re saying the death numbers are grossly misreported. That may be! I can’t say for certain. That said, the benefits I can think of from misreporting them don’t really seem to outweigh the costs. And I’m also weighing the risk and reward of following what they say- Am I horribly inconvenienced for a year? Yeah. And it sucks. But everything I can think of would make it more likely than not that, even if the numbers aren’t precisely accurate, they’re at least in the right ballpark- and that’s a big enough deal I don’t want to risk it.</p>
<p>As for “my body my choice”- I couldn’t agree more! The problem is, MY choice is to not get the infection into MY body, and how do we decide if your choice to risk infecting me outweighs my choice to not get infected? </p>
<p>Again, murder is a useful analogy- not because I’m comparing you to a murderer, but because extremes often help distill the core principles of an argument with the least amount of confounding elements possible. I could say “It’s my body, and I want to go around using my body to stab people, and that’s my choice since it’s my body”- well, the problem is that it’s <em>not</em> just your body that’s affected, but it’s the body of the victim too. And of course you wouldn’t intentionally spread COVID, but when you can’t be guaranteed that you aren’t spreading it, and a simple restriction can be put in place to guarantee you don’t, then maybe it should.</p>
<p>Think of a mask like a speed limit on a road. It may be your car, and you may be able to go 80 miles an hour in a residential area without hitting anyone. But the risk is too great, so they put a speed limit to stop you- even though it’s your car.</p>
<p>And yeah, it is America! We should absolutely do our best to be a shining beacon to the world. But having so many deaths... well, it doesn’t look great. I don’t want it to be said that Americans wanted to be <em>American</em>, that’s a tautology. I want it said that Americans want to be the best. And this is how I see that happening.</p>

        <p>So you know you basically just made a great, sound argument against abortion? I really took you as more of a pro choice kinda guy, yet here you are arguing against my body my choice if it negatively affects society. </p>
<p>And you're absolutely right about the speed limit. It's been my go to analogy ever since I felt the lockdowns were too much. We could make the speed limit 15mph everywhere, and we'd have 0 traffic deaths. We don't bc we have agreed to acceptable risk. After we figured this virus out, got the necessary PPE, never over loaded the hospitals, we still continued with the lockdowns, mask mandates, etc. IMO it was all too allow mail in voting to very bad orange man out of office. I'm a Bernie Bro, don't think I'm some conspiracy theorist Trump supporter. With that said, this last election was a total fraud and it only happened because of the pandemic. </p>
<p>We might just have to disagree about America. IMO, an important part of the American spirit is our flippant, caution to wind 'free-dumbs'. We laugh and make jokes about the stupidity of what I just said, and it is funny, but it's also serious. We should never lose that part of the American spirit or I believe we'll lose America</p>

        <p>Oh, I am pro-choice. That isn’t because I disagree with any of the arguments pro-life people make; they’d be valid in most cases IF you believe life starts at conception, which I don’t. More accurately, I believe life starts at conception, but it doesn’t have sentience for months, so it’s more comparable to a blade of grass ethically than a human. But that’s a disagreement from starting axioms and so it isn’t something debate can really change.</p>
<p>As for car crashes- the level of risk we’ve deemed acceptable is giving 36,000 deaths per year in the US. Coronavirus is giving over thirteen times that amount, and that isn’t deemed acceptable. The fact that one number is acceptable doesn’t mean they all are.</p>
<p>We continued with the mask mandates and lockdowns because just because we figured the virus out didn’t mean we slowed it to an acceptable level. Hospitals were still overloaded and hundreds of thousands of people were still dying. As for it happening to get Trump out of office... I mean, I kind of do think you’re a conspiracy guy when you say that, even if you aren’t a Trump supporter. The virus exists all over the world, there have been lockdowns all over the world- even if the necessary people in America teamed up to get Trump out of office this way, do you really think everyone in other countries would as well? </p>
<p>And I don’t want to lose America either. But the American spirit should strive to be the best! Not just to be free, but to be <em>responsibly</em> free- otherwise we’d have no laws at all.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna take offense to that, it's not a conspiracy that Clinton rigged the primary against Bernie in 2016. Bernie isn't an establishment politician who got massively wealthy while serving public office and he's not "one of them". He's about as wealthy as any guy his age should be who made good decisions and worked a decent paying job his whole life. Say what you want about Trump, but he's not an establishment politician either. Mail in voting(not absentee, different things)is blatantly open to fraud, yes so is any voting, but mass mail in voting would be laughable if it weren't really happening. To not think the Democrats used the unwarranted, manufactured fear of the Commie Cough(now I'm just being silly) to open the door of opportunity for control over house, Senate, and potus is beyond naive and just plain stupid. </p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, this has been the left's MO. Republicans have always been accused of voter suppression through lack of voting locations and ID requirements, but the Democrats have always been accused of manufacturing votes from dead people, wrong addresses, and immigrants. It's not like we're discussing the moon landing here my dude, this is pretty blatant fraud and not at a wild conspiracy. </p>
<p>Not everyone drives. Far less people drive than are susceptible to the Kung Flu. The analogy is almost perfect. Because of the other safety measures put in place, we have allowed a technically deadly speed limit on all of our roads for the sake of the economy. "Even if it saves one life", right? Well 15mph still let's us get from A to B but would save thousands and thousands of lives. Why don't we do that? End traffic deaths altogether by the end of the week. Why not? Now instead of '15 mph speed limit', say 'lockdowns'. </p>
<p>Lastly, be careful adding preceding adjectives to the word 'free'. There's only one kind of 'free', only one kind of 'freedom'. This low-brow, crude, often ridiculed 'American Free-dumb' is more precious and important than almost any of us realize bc we're all so smart and educated. Keep It Simple Stupid in the words of Gene Simmons. Lol</p>
<p>P.s. if you haven't, you gotta read the book 1984. It's fiction, but it's duly iconic literature with an aim at holding up a mirror to society. Kinda shows how good intentions pave the road to hell eventually. Freedom, baby, unadulterated freedom is the only way</p>

        <p>I have read 1984! And I want to point out that I’m not arguing about voter fraud as a whole, I’m specifically arguing about <em>covid being a hoax/exaggerated</em> to create voter fraud, because the discussion was about Covid.</p>
<p>As for the speed limit example- we DO do that. Not for 15 mph in particular, but we very much do have a speed limit. The delineation of what the speed limit should be is another matter, but we do have a speed limit- we do put restrictions on for safety.</p>
<p>And, regarding laws and freedom, I have two questions for you. They aren’t rhetorical, I’m curious as to your answer. </p>
<p>1) Do laws restrict freedoms, for example, the freedom to murder?</p>
<p>2) Should we have laws?</p>

        <p>The severity of the virus was largely overstated and that created the opportunity for mass voter fraud like we've never seen before. I do not in any way think it was exaggerated for the purpose of voter fraud, but bc the severity was so over exaggerated the opportunity was there. I have 2 friends teaching overseas, one in Germany the other in Cambodia. The government's play along with the pandemic, but the people aren't as scared as they are here by n large. </p>
<p>Lawlessness and freedom are not the same thing. It's apple's and oranges. I believe there are some laws that are overreaching to say the least, but having objective consequences for dubious actions in society is not anti freedom. Having some magnitude of order in one's tribe is as natural of a human instinct as any of them. </p>
<p>Back to the speed limit. If you wanna be nit picky about it, I'll be more specific. 15 mph on roads that aren't already* I could google but I'm busy typing, but how many thousands of people die on IH35 here in Texas each year? If we made the speed limit 15 mph on Interstate 35 throughout Texas, we'd have 0 traffic deaths on I35. Zero. We could do this tomorrow and save not just one life, but thousands. However we feel that with the other safety measures we have in place on the road and inside your vehicle that the very dangerous and deadly speed of 70mph, three cars abreast is acceptable..... even though thousands die each year bc of that. Lockdowns are comparable to 15 mph in the Interstate. If you're too scared, don't go out. "But I have to" isn't a good excuse to destroy my life, my career, my portfolio, my country.</p>
<p>I got Kung Flu, it sucked. I'd do it all over again if it meant you keeping your job, or your gf, or your sanity. And I don't even know you, much less even agree with you on most things apparently. But I'm serious. 80k avg deaths a yr from the Flu, which has overloaded hospitals in bad years, closed schools as well. Yet never a city-wide lockdown, much less a state wide lockdown or mask mandate. Weve gone up to Federal mandates with the Commie Cough. I've wanted to just go ahead and die I've had the flu so bad before. Puts things in perspective, just because we can do something as a society, doesn't mean we should.</p>

        <p>500 thousand is more than 80 thousand. I... I don’t really know how to make myself clearer. There is a line somewhere- I assume you’d agree to the lockdowns if the other choice was literally everyone dying- the question is where it belongs. And just about everyone agrees, COVID is on the “implement lockdowns and mask” side of that line. </p>
<p>And having objective consequences for dubious actions- that’s all I’m suggesting! And the dubious action is “not wearing a mask and exposing other people” here! That’s all it is!</p>
<p>And again- IH35 HAS a speed limit. I think it’s 75 if I looked this up correctly, it may not be, but it does have a speed limit. The speed limit isn’t 15, but it IS A LIMIT. Your driving on that highway IS limited. Lockdowns are not comparable to 15, they are comparable to 75 (or 70 or whatever it is). You’re arguing that you shouldn’t be restricted, by showing a point where you’re restricted but not as much as you could be.</p>

        <p>There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that me wearing a mask as a healthy or asymptomatic person reduces your chances of contracting a virus with a 99+% survival rate. Not a shred of evidence. A regular mask offers little to absolutely zero protection from most airborne viruses. Even said so on the box the masks came in. It's also common f'ing sense but whatever.</p>
<p>IH35 has varying speed limits, but not 15 mph. The speed limit on IH35 has never been so low that it killed small delivery and trucking companies. Lockdowns killed lots of small businesses and put lots of people out of work both directly and indirectly. It's an absolutely perfect analogy but too hard of a pill to swallow to admit it right at first. Think about it, I'm not arguing for lifting all safety measures at once, but locking down the greatest economy America has seen in decades after every other safety measure we took was the most asinine thing we've ever done as an American society. Perfect analogy </p>
<p>500k deaths from the China Virus is so wildly inaccurate it's frustrating to hear you keep regurgitating that number. But lets say that number is correct, break down the demographics of those deaths. Right at 400 last time I checked, 400 people under the age of 25 died from Kung Flu according to the CDC. The jaw dropping, overwhelming majority of the deaths from the Wuhan virus are from a very small percentage of our population. 73% of all reported deaths are from obese people here in America, again, CDC. So let's say 500k is right, the VAST majority of people you know and meet daily will have no problems getting over Kung Flu. Especially if you suggest diet, exercise, less alcohol, more sunshine instead of masks, shut in, liquor, and take out....which is exactly what happened.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, so normal they have to ask for permission to leave the country and the army prevents people from leaving public housing blocks. Which Australian city had dogs crapping indoors? Was it the same one that made people wear muzzles in their cars by themselves without a single other person around them? Aren't Australians on their 5th lockdown right now or are they in one of those periods where they make smug face at everyone who went slightly less apeshit over this bug. This "proper lockdown" shit the sheep fucker countries in the southern hemisphere gloat about is not a sustainable approach. The second they open up to the world the virus creeps in. As all contagious diseases always do. The proper approach still is and always was herd immunity: keep the hospitals ready to handle things and let the virus burn through the population. Eventually enough people will have it they're immune from reinfection.</p>

        <p>That’s what I’m not understanding. They’re telling people that essentially the vaccine won’t change anything, yet I get banned on subreddits for reiterating those same facts and explaining that it’s efficacy is still in question.</p>
<p>Like, where are these people getting their facts? I’m going straight off of what those at the top are TELLING YOU TO YOUR FACES. They’re so far gone. It’s insane.</p>

        <p>That’s because a lot of these people don’t want their freedoms back. They want coddled, they want to be told what they can or can not do. They’ll give it up for a false sense of safety and a false sense of belonging.</p>

        <p>I really tried going into that press conference with an open mind. Then he walks down an empty hallway with nobody around him, wearing his mask that's clearly just a prop and I knew it would be a typical politician speech where they ramble for 30 minutes and don't actually say anything.</p>
<p>I turned it off when he said people will be allowed to gather in small groups by the 4th of July. Fuck off Joe. I'm a grown ass adult who can make my own decisions about my health, and so are the people that I'll be spending time with regardless of what you or the CDC says is "allowed".</p>

        <p>Okay then ban cigarettes. Because secondhand smoke endangers other people.</p>
<p>And why is driving essential? Society operated for thousands of years without cars. Why is your time more important than the 40k people that die on roadways every year in the US alone, or the almost 5 million additional injuries severe enough to require hospitalization? At the very least, you must support only allowing driving for essential businesses &amp; services right?</p>

        <p>I am saying I'm dumb, I can't speak english properly to get your point, lots of hard words.</p>
<p>But from what I got I think you don't like the government regulations. While I think I get your frustration, I don't think it's fair comparing it to driving, because driving too has regulations that are supposed to protect yourself and other people. I don't say that every death and injury is from violating those regulations, but as far as I know most of them are.</p>
