        <p>How do any of these “enslave” you?</p>
<p>Taking away the right to vote (or interfering with people’s ability to vote), criminalizing criticism of the government, crippling the power of labor to advocate for itself while handing power to corporations: those are all steps on the road to enslavement.</p>
<p>Businesses are private property, and if a business wants to limit entry to their private property to only those wearing (or, not wearing) masks, that’s completely their decision and their right.</p>

<p>Actually, businesses are forced by the states to limit entry for unmasked/unvaccinated, otherwise they face fine going in the 10K's .. :) That's the reason, why I always put my mask on in shops, I don't want them to get fined. Outside the shop, I don't :) <br>
Also, businesses aren't allowed to limit entry for certain types of cultures or religions ... it's the same thing :D But in nazi Germany, there they did apply those rules to jews \^\^</p>

        <p>&rt; Businesses are private property, and if a business wants to limit entry to their private property to only those wearing (or, not wearing) masks, that’s completely their decision and their right.</p>
<p>yes, like how businesses were mandating masks way way before government came 'round bruteforcing that - wait</p>
<p>i mean i get it, maybe it doesn't happen in "the land of the ~~morbidly obese~~ free" but over in Europe, many governments just put restrictions in that unvaccinated people can't enter stores with a surface area of like 200 square meters, along with restrictions for restaurants and shit to be able to allow whether to seat only vaccinated people or everyone but require like a rapid test... while in the meantime, it's EU law that local governments can't create an environment that forces their subjects to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>i mean businesses are just chomping at the bits to artificially limit their clientele, right? that's a thing private businesses are know for right?</p>

<p>RFID chips have a range of about 100m and even some of those require battery packs. So I ask you, where is the receiver for the information and where is your evidence for these claims?</p>

        <p>fuck's sake, alright, i'll take you seriously for a second.</p>
<p>I can't say I know exactly where RFID technology currently is, because I'm not much of an expert on the subject (and I doubt <em>you</em> are). The fact that still remains that by just leaving your electronics at home or using a simple phone where you're only being tracked via cell towers (which AFAIK is a bit inaccurate) means you're already opting out of quite a bit of surveillance. Masks now make it easier for security cameras to track faces and acceptance of masks makes it harder for police to get accurate witness testimony when it comes to suspicious activity (what, a dude wearing a mask and nondescript clothing whipped out a gun in the middle of a store - go figure which dude with a mask). The way technology is going and the way governments worldwide are getting ever more totalitarian, that's where the global shitshow is heading. We're currently at the point in the dystopia before the cool cybernetic implants.</p>

<p>&rt;It's a subreddit for skepticism and here you are defending the prevailing COOF BAD, TRUST GOVERNMENT narrative.</p>
<p>Being skeptical about your claims doesn't mean I 100% agree with what you're skeptical of, obviously governments do shady shit all of the time but this isn't one of them and there's no evidence supporting this government tracking microchip conspiracy. </p>
<p>If you're a real skeptic, then you should be demanding evidence for any and all claims and not accepting those claims as true without proof. Skepticism isn't just doubting the mainstream narrative, it's rational thinking and funnily enough is exactly how the scientific process works. </p>
<p>That's why peer reviewed papers publish not only their results, but their methods so that you don't have to take their word for it you can do the experiment yourself if you want.</p>

        <p>because a couple of coomers over here want to make it a gotcha moment that i didn't reply to this here comment of yours here we go:</p>
<p>we're on <em>Reddit</em> so standards of proof usually go like so; "you must produce  69 peer-reviewed double-blind studies with 90000 participants each when defending this thing I disagree with" and "eh, a Vice article says it all for this thing I agree with".</p>
<p>i mentioned RFID tags as a form of passive transmitter, which often <em>doesn't</em> need external power. as i said i don't know exactly where the whole "passive transmitter" technology is at this point, but yes, that's where i think we're headed. yeah, i guess i should've made it clear i wasn't talking about RFIDs specifically, but about something RFID-like. i used to entertain the theory that 5G was the first step towards that, because it allegedly required more towers closer together, but i've somewhat stopped since i've lost interest in 5G. </p>
<p>and i dunno man, you just came off as a contrarian to me, what with focusing too much into the whole "chip" thing. i think the sign isn't all that wrong... and nowhere does it say that the vaccine somehow has a chip in it.</p>

        <p>&rt;we're on Reddit so standards of proof usually go like so; "you must produce 69 peer-reviewed double-blind studies</p>
<p>One study would be a good start.</p>
<p>&rt;i mentioned RFID tags as a form of passive transmitter, which often doesn't need external power.</p>
<p>That's fine but as I mentioned in my initial response to the mentioning of RFID chips, their range simply is not sufficient for tracking it's just not what they are designed to do. As for whether that technology COULD arise is a separate question but again, this is not something that exists at the moment. It's like worrying about what happens if we all start using teleporters. </p>
<p>&rt;what with focusing too much into the whole "chip" thing.</p>
<p>This is basically my last point again but I think it's worth repeating, because the technology this sticker is concerned about simply does not exist (yet at least). Now you may say "well they will develop it" but thats a claim that would need some evidence because aside from the practical technological issues ask yourself, why would the government want to track you all the time?</p>
<p>This is exactly why I mentioned smartphones and IP addresses in general, because they give you all of the useful location data (where someone lives and works at least even if they don't carry a device which cmon, they do it's 2021) AS WELL as information on an individual's behaviour. </p>
<p>This is exactly what social media companies (including Reddit btw) do all of the time. These services aren't free, they're paid for by advertising and to make as much money as possible they collect all the data they could possibly need to make it as likely as possible that you react to advertising. They track how long you use the apps, how long you look at certain regions, what time of day you do anything etc.</p>
<p>If you really want to fight tyrannical tracking then it's not the mythical microchips you need to worry about.</p>

<p>The device you're using to reply to these comments right now has the same chip in it. In fact if you're using a pc, you can even see exactly how someone can find out where you are by googling "what's my IP". </p>
<p>&rt;Soon you can be a cell phone look into it, you are the power source.</p>
<p>"Soon" indicates that this cannot be done yet and therefore cannot have been done in the past, so this conspiracy that vaccines have injected you with microchips that are powered by future technology is dead in the water. </p>
<p>I mentioned lack of evidence before and I'll repeat it here, you can end this whole argument by showing a picture of these microchips, with scale (do you know how small the exit of a needle is? Spoiler alert, smaller than a computer chip.) and demonstrating exactly how these chips are powered as well as how they transmit data. </p>
<p>We haven't developed WiFi that can maintain signal through concrete, do you seriously think there are secret miniscule microchips, powered by magic apparently, capable of sending and receiving information through the human body and surrounding environment, completely unaffected or damaged by the human body or blood flow turbulence? </p>
<p>Gonna need some evidence for that claim chief.</p>

<p>I asked for evidence for your super secret magic computer chips (that couldn't fit inside a needle exit but anyway) and you just sulk and leave? </p>

<p>But question. Are you only pretending to be so stupid that you can't understand why a totalitarian state would want a tracker that you can't remove or disable, in addition to the phone someone could jailbreak or leave on the counter when they go to talk to other malcontents?</p>
<p>Or are you actually stupid enough not to realize?</p>
<p>Oh, and just to disassemble the strawman really quick, once they become mandatory, there will be no need for them to be injectable, they can just tell you to make a 'free' appointment to get it surgically implanted, and you will lick their boots and thank them for the opportunity.</p>

        <p>&rt;Are you only pretending to be so stupid that you can't understand why a totalitarian state would want a tracker that you can't remove or disable</p>
<p>No I'm asking for evidence that a) these injectable trackers exist b) they can function independently forever without needing charging or repair and c) that they are being used as you claim they are. </p>

        <p>You started with the false premise that anybody in this post claimed there is a microchip in the vaccine, since that isn't what the sticker implies and you're a top level comment. When called out on being a moron and misreading it that hard, you keep pestering people to provide sources for a claim nobody has made. In fact, myself and at least one other person keep laughing at you directly for how desperately dishonest you are about it. </p>
<p>So here's the deal, bootlicker. Either link to any comment in this post that says "there is a microchip in this vaccine," not just some random statement that your oxygen-deprived brain decides <em>must</em> mean what you want it to, or prove that you're just here desperately trying to fellate your owners in hopes of getting a treat.</p>

<p>Or do you mean people  who demand honest discourse instead of state-sponsored propaganda? Cause I'm pretty sure neither was really a factor back when people believed that demons caused sickness and keeping a pocket full of flowers cured it.</p>
<p>But I'm gonna make an educated guess here. You're young, college-indoctrinated, and a self-professed liberal or progressive. So I can confidently say that 'your kind,' to borrow your offensive terminology, is why bubonic plague is making a comeback in San Francisco these days.</p>

        <p>i work at a vet clinic and we microchip animals daily. microchips (only used to identify pets, not GPS tracking ick who thinks that lol) are inserted with 12g needles, nothing smaller or it won’t be inserted properly. vaccines are administered using 22g needles. i don’t understand how people think a microchip (that’s actually roughly the size of a grain of rice or bigger) can fit through a syringe with liquid in it.</p>
<p>as someone with multiple body piercings, i would never let someone poke me with anything bigger than a 16g - which is a normal size for face and body piercings.</p>
<p>if that doesn’t put the size of a microchip into perspective, then people are ignorant and won’t be changed.</p>

<p>&rt;Some organizations have started giving employees the option to be chipped, including Three Square Market, a Wisconsin-based technology company, that made national headlines after microchipping nearly 100 employees in 2017, and Epicenter, a Swedish start-up that has microchipped an estimated 150 employees since 2015. BioTeq, a Swedish firm that implants microchips into both individuals and other organizations’ employees, fitted 150 microchips in the U.K. as of 2018.</p>
<p>Anyway,  this poster is about the idea that things that seemed unthinkable slowly become almost unavoidable.  It's not unreasonable at all. </p>
<p>A parallel example: in my hometown, in the 90s, after public outcry, they removed the first automated traffic camera that issued speed citations. The literal chief of police said it strayed too far into big brother territory. </p>
<p>In the space of a generation, we've gone to having ubiquitous and linked public safety cameras, equipped with facial recognition,  that are searchable by the authorities with AI tools, automated license plate scanners, police stingrays, etc</p>

        <p>Chip will be put in ppls arms, but not by vaccine. It will just become mandatory, like ID cards became mandatory one day. The vaccines are more just like testing a new technology. Before new medicine is ready, you need to test on gullible masses. In 10-15 years, we will have better vaccines in general. But those getting it now, are the test subjects.</p>

        <p>It's an RFID chip with a range of a few metres, that's why he has to put his hand next to anything instead of it going off when he enters the building. </p>

<p>Try to see the bigger picture. Self making vaccine chips, has your bank info, ID, health record. Pretty much tracks you... </p>
<p>GPS hasn't been disclosed to the public but it is a possibility. The tech isn't going to be injected via needle because that's way too small.</p>
<p>They need consent. Create a virus, sell the solution. People will beg for protection against the vAriAnts</p>

        <p>&rt;Self making vaccine chips, has your bank info, ID, health record. Pretty much tracks you... </p>
<p>No it doesn't and your first video says exactly that. What the subdermal chip does is monitor reactions in your blood, basically the same way we use infrared light to measure oxygen content. Your claim is unsubstantiated, there is no evidence of "self making vaccine chips" that have your bank information, ID and medical record.</p>
<p>&rt;The tech isn't going to be injected via needle because that's way too small.</p>
<p>Then how is it doing to be delivered and what evidence do you have?</p>
<p>&rt;Create a virus, sell the solution.</p>
<p>Again you need to prove that this virus has been created for the purpose of selling the solution, you can't just claim it for it to be true. Coronaviruses are pretty familiar to us, SARS and MERS being the obvious examples. Interestingly enough a virus was identified in bats 5 years prior to the pandemic that was a 95% genetic match for covid-19, unfortunately evolution is unpredictable (especially for zoonotic viruses) and most likely mutated to be able to infect humans.</p>
<p>You're connecting random dots here and assuming that there must be a causation because you see a correlation.</p>

        <p>Yeah you are...</p>
<p>Bill Gates has made it very clear that overpopulation is a big issue for humanity and one look at our population over time confirms that. However, his solution is not to kill living people, it's to do exactly what we've done as a society for decades;</p>
<p>1) High death rate due to poor medicine, people have more kids to account for this hence a high birth rate. </p>
<p>2) Death rate lowers as medicine improves but people still have a high number of children, hence a baby boom. </p>
<p>3) Birth rate lowers as fewer infants die, population growth slows and stabilises. </p>
<p>Kurzgesagt do a great video on this showing how it took a nation like Bangladesh to go through this process very quickly relative to Victorian England for example. Better healthcare is the solution to overpopulation, pandemic prevention and vaccinations are a crucial part of that. </p>
<p>If you don't believe me go look up how many people would die of smallpox or polio or measles before vaccines were developed.</p>

        <p>&rt;I've shown you all these videos quantum micro needles self making vaccine. Dude whatever...</p>
<p>There is not a single mention of "self making vaccines" in either of the videos you have provided, that is simply a lie. </p>
<p>&rt;???? What? No I'm saying microchips aren't going to be delivered via needles.</p>
<p>That wasn't my question, my question is how do you propose these trackers would be delivered if not through needles and what evidence do you have?</p>
<p>&rt;Now prove to me covid is the end all virus that will kill me.</p>
<p>I never claimed it would and it probably won't, but not everything is about you. At the time of writing this, 3.98 million people have died with covid-19, and those are just the people who were able to be tested 28 days before their death or subsequent testing in some cases. The actual number is likely notably higher when you consider the lack of testing infrastructure in poorer nations who have still had infections and deaths. </p>
<p>That number also doesn't include complications of having had covid-19 in the past, which we still don't know the full ramifications of because it simply hasn't been around long enough to study yet (although early indications show the damage can be long lasting).</p>
<p>&rt;Prove to me vaccines are 100% safe.</p>
<p>Nothing is 100% safe, from driving a car to drinking a glass of tap water, because in the nicest way what do you mean? Here's a much more important fact that we have proven, being vaccinated is much safer than contracting covid-19 at all. </p>
<p>People have adverse reactions to everything all of the time, be it nylon, pollen, food, etc, and we do everything we can to make sure vaccines are as safe as possible for as many people as possible. That's literally what the different stages of clinical trials are for.</p>
<p>We start with an animal like a mouse, if it's safe and effective there then with enough data and permission from the government you can do small scale human testing and repeat until you have tested it on enough people of different medical conditions and ages that we can say it's reasonably safe. </p>
<p>I was vaccinated recently and given a big ole sheet of facts from the manufacturer, including the potential side effects and how common they are. In fact, you have to wait for a few minutes after you've been vaccinated to make sure you don't have a serious reaction to it.</p>
