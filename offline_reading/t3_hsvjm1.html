        <p>Seriously infuriating. God forbid people are doing something beneficial such as exercising while getting fresh air. I’m so, so tired of restrictions becoming more and more petty.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this has been a thing that's been happening in my area since March. My neighbors seem convinced that people walking or jogging in the area will increase the spread, even outdoors, so they scare and pick fights with people who dare to go outside. Though lately they seem to allow it, but only if people are wearing masks while doing so.</p>

        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; Mayor Tim Dougherty said many South Street restaurants are relying on outdoor dining amid the coronavirus pandemic and that there is not enough space for runners, and their customers, to follow social distancing recommendations.</p>
<p>&rt; In a post on the town’s Facebook page, Dougherty asserted that runners should stay 12 to 16 feet away from others, well beyond state and federal guidelines specifying a minimum 6 feet for all, “due to their heavier breathing.”</p>
<p>&rt; “Please consider NOT using South Street as a running path during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Dougherty wrote.</p>
<p>&rt; “Many of our restaurants are utilizing outdoor dining to keep their businesses afloat. Diners will not be wearing face masks while eating and patronizing these restaurants,” he added.</p>
<p>&rt; South Street is a major draw in Morristown’s downtown and also popular with runners, with some using it as a way to reach a nearby county park and its trail network. U.S . Sen. Cory Booker led a group run that culminated on South Street in 2013, during his first campaign for Senate, and a running store is among the businesses on the street.</p>
<p>&rt; Dougherty’s request — he made no indication of seeking to enforce a running ban on the street — goes further than Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive orders aimed at encouraging at least 6 feet of social distancing for everyone in New Jersey.</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy regularly runs with his wife, Tammy, and posts photos to social media in which both are shown wearing masks. The governor has mandated face coverings for anyone, not just runners, who are unable to maintain the 6 feet of social distancing.</p>
<p>&rt; Dougherty’s request drew support from one local runner, who told NJ Advance Media it made sense. Heather McDermott said barriers were recently placed on South Street, aimed at protecting outdoor diners from cars, and runners generally use the sidewalks.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Dougherty, in his Facebook post, noted that runners in Morristown have plenty of other options.</p>
<p>&rt; “Morristown has many beautiful side roads, trails and parks that are perfect for our runners and walkers,” the mayor wrote.</p>

        <p>They should be warning the obese that are eating and breathing heavy instead. They are at a much higher risk.</p>
