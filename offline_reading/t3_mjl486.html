        <p>Ah igy, yeah I agree in some ways (if I’m understanding what you’re saying - don’t hesitate to shout if I’m not) are you saying that the virus has affected Asians more than other races? I agree, and have said from the beginning, that China hasn’t been open about this virus in the early stages but do you have anything supporting that it’s more dangerous to Asians? (Again, not a righteous warrior just would be genuinely interested in anything I haven’t read)  </p>
<p>As far as BAME, it’s a term referring to Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (although anyone is free to tell me I’m wrong and I’ll face the embarrassment😂) </p>
<p>But funnily enough I heard of BAME people being affected worse but can’t remember the article to support it so my claim is as substantial as yours 😂</p>

        <p>Thank for the explanation and no I have no evidence to prove this claim. Just an experiment with a bot on Reddit that I cannot believe. It really is fascinating what results I'm getting though.✌💛</p>
<p>&rt;are you saying that the virus has affected Asians more than other races?</p>
<p>This is the results I'm getting from the experiment.</p>
<p>It also produced a total number I cannot believe  314696403 people have died from covid19 in China. This can't be fucking true.✌💛</p>

        <p>That actually sounds really interesting taking the sample of the experiment from a platform like reddit. </p>
<p>Not to be rude to Mr Jinping but you’re more likely to get results closer to the truth from reddit rather than China itself 😂 that does sound like a high number though, I wonder if though that factors in every death (whatever the cause) where the doe had Covid in the system? And how would you factor out causes that weren’t related to COVID?</p>

        <p>The experiment started with autocorrect bot. It seemed to not be able to correct simple spelling errors and would try to suggest inflammatory responses in predictive text when I tried to have a civil discussion with ppl who disagree with me. ✌💛 plz help to balance bot by practicing civil discourse 🆘️☯️🤖defined</p>

        <p>I thought this sub was about using what we learnt from the last year to inspire change from what we’ve been told is normal for decades but apparently it’s just full of people who say COVID isn’t real? Happy to read what you guys have to say in the comments, personally just hoped the ‘no new normal’ aimed more at not going back to how things have been pre-pandemic as opposed to denying the scale of what’s happening</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone here believes that “COVID isn’t real.” It’s just hugely exaggerated. For the vast majority of people it’s just an inconvenience, and for the rest what they need is focused protection.</p>

        <p>Having seen some of the top posts over the past week or so I think that a lot of people in this sub don’t think COVID is real, I feel like there’s been this huge surge of people posting about how every measure meant to reduce the spread is a government plan to “control” people. I do get why it could be seen as exaggerated but I do also think that that isn’t a bad thing. I suppose for me personally it presents a learning opportunity, just because it’s happened before, whether it’s been worse or not, there’s something to be learned from it. In my mind it’s like looking at an incoming tsunami, and think “it’s been bigger before so why are we doing anything to try and stop it” sounds like a very backwards way of thinking.</p>
<p>I do have to say though, and this is what I was initially hoping when I found this sub, is that we are currently at the peak of human interaction across social media and the internet, and the “old” normal that has been created should in the near future be replaced by what should be the “new normal” in so much as the utilisation of the technology we have around us, and I think this pandemic (for all the horror and sadness it’s brought us) would’ve been a great stepping stone to try and reach that</p>

<p>And I said why the threat of COVID could BE SEEN as exaggerated by people who aren’t close to it and that I DON’T THINK IT’S a BAD thing because there’s been a load of peoples who have DIED which I thought other NORMAL people might empathise with</p>

        <p>Thought the posts said covid wasn't real, not that the threat wasn't appreciated? Moving the goalposts like a pro, and by the way a virus with a 99.9% survival rate isn't a real threat.</p>

        <p>There isn’t a threat. Germ theory isn’t proven. Do your own research into the suppression into the way terrain theory was suppressed by people with certain Wikipedia early lives. Don’t just trust everything our greatest allies tell you.</p>
