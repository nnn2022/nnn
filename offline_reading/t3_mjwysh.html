<p>&rt;As the popular destination dangles on a precipice of a new wave of <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/covid">Covid</a>-19 infections, Spanish authorities said it will be mandatory for all people aged six and over to wear face coverings “on public streets, in outdoor spaces and in any closed space that has a public use or is open to the public”. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This will apply to people who are sunbathing or even swimming in the sea.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/spain-holidays-delayed-summer-vaccines-b900809.html">Masks were already mandatory in all public spaces</a>, including outdoors, when a distance of less than 1.5 meters couldn’t be kept between people.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But the social distancing aspect will be removed from Wednesday making masks essential no matter what the distance.</p></p>

        <p>I am from Spain and our government is really awful. Just to let you know, we can't move to different provinces even if it's to see family since Christmas ended and still can't see the end to that, yet they allow tourism but only for foreigners. I certainly live in Spain, but with a silent S. Thanks, government!</p>

        <p>Every single EU country has shown that it has never been democratic. I remember reading about the stupid international-versus-domestic tourism rules in El Mundo (or was it El Pais). I honestly think that the reason Spain, Italy and France have been under extremely draconian laws is because your populations are generally more vaccine hesitant than the rest of Europe. TPTB want to break your wills so that you accept whatever they give you out of emotional and mental exhaustion.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is that trying to justify it they ended up saying that we have the same rights as tourists, we can take planes too and if we want to move to a different place on Spain instead of going by car we should take a plane to another european country first and then take another one back to Spain to the place we actually wanted to visit, which sounds ridiculous. </p>

<p>Maybe you have a point on that. I haven't taken a vaccine since I was a kid, and not because I'm an anti-vax or something like that... I just didn't get ill besides the ocasional cold on winter and didn't see a point on taking one. And I'm sure not going to take the covid one, ever since they started talking about it I always got the feeling it was too new and rushed to be safe.</p>
