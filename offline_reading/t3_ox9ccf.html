    <strong>Like many of you, I am being perma banned for having an opinion and my association with a "disease vector" sub</strong>
    <p><p>Just received the following: </p>
<p>"You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ pics. You can still view and subscribe to r/ pics, but you won't be able to post or comment.</p>
<p>You have been banned forparticipating in r/nonewnormal, which is known for being a disease vector to other subreddits and society.</p>
<p>This action was performed by a bot which does not check the context of your comment.</p>
<p>To be unbanned respond to this message with a promise to avoid that subreddit.</p>
<p>Any other response will be ignored and is consent for us to mute you."</p>
<p>I accept. And also fuck you. </p>
<p>Watching all of this unfold on a daily basis is absolutely mind blowing as I remember life before the internet. As I stated in a comment on this apparently "disease vector" sub, where are all the antifascists at? They sure got quiet at the first sign of real bonafide fascism. Imagine my shock...</p>
<p>If people cannot see what's happening in Australia and NYC and not be urged to action to resist, I don't know what else to say other than:</p>
<p>Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. </p>
<p>Resist! Remember that slogan? What a friggin' joke. Resist, goddamn it! Do not comply. Help and support each other because it's gonna get real fucking ugly real fast. Watching people cheer this shit on is chilling. </p>
<p>Buckle up, kids. It's gonna be an interesting end to the year. In solidarity. </p>
