    <strong>Auckland Covid-19 mass vaccination: Health officials scramble to fill places</strong>
    <p><p>Health officials have had to scramble to find 12,000 more people so it can go ahead on Friday.</p>
<p>The three-day event starts Friday at the Vodafone Events Centre in Manukau with an aim to vaccinate at least 15,500 people.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be limited to Manukau Institute of Technology  students and their families to stop it being overrun with vaccine  hopefuls - but that did not turn out to be a problem.</p>
<p>About 12,500 students and teachers were sent invitations and told their families could book too.</p>
<p>Only about 3000 booked a place.</p>
<p>Auckland's district health boards said they then widened the  invitation to 82,000 MƒÅori and Pacific people, but they still did not  get enough bookings.</p>
<p>They eventually sent a total of 140,000 invitations before they had the numbers they needed.</p>
<p>South Auckland general practitioner Dr Api Talemaitoga said the mass rollout was a great initiative but Friday's event lacked MƒÅori and Pasifika input.</p>
<p>The invitation was boring for event-loving south Aucklanders, he said.</p>
<p>"I think the organisers should have thought about making it a celebration or an event that is like a festival where people come along with their friends, can listen to a bit of music, or watch a bit of  entertainment or dancing. Have a bit of food and then get vaccinated." üòÇ</p>
