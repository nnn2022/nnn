    <strong>Wuhan man made Fauci involved BS</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve noticed over the past couple of weeks numerous are following for this new media and government narrative that the virus was man made and Fauci funded money and knew.. Blah Blah </p>
<p>Especially people here in the NoNewNormal were people are constantly posting about it, his emails and media articles...</p>
<p>Let me explain something and this might be hard for many of you, anything that supposedly leaks out is purposely done so because they want it out. This is a tactic to distract the masses and further divide people due to the fact some say, “see I told you so” while others argue it proves nothing.</p>
<p>This narrative that the virus was created and may be a biological weapon released upon us is nothing but a ploy to scare people more, make those they deem conspiracy theorist go crazy ranting saying “ha I knew it, we tried to tell you and we’re mocked” and to get people to accept the non stop mutated strains they keep claiming.</p>
<p>If they can get you to believe the virus is man made, then they got you... You’ll believe people are sick, that hospitals did have numerous dying and that it can mutate and spread worse. And if you believe that, you’ll start believing you need a cure.</p>
<p>But remember, last year hospitals were empty! There is much proof of that all around, nurses around the world made dance videos and the media was constantly faking deaths. <br>
Never have you see anyone really sick, collapsing or dying in public. You don’t walk into WalMart or Costco and see a couple of dead bodies lying in the isles or being following over. Yet the media would like you to think that happened in China and now also India.</p>
<p>Lets be honest, if there was truly a pandemic you would see it. You’d be scared shitless of people around getting sick and dying. You’d be begging for a cure.</p>
<p>Covid is nothing more than the common cold and flu relabeled as a new virus. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>The elites of the World Economic Forum &amp; their Satanic little puppets are the ones truly behind this. They planned it out years in advance and then did a mock simulation “Event 201” in 2019 just 3 months before this pandemic. These fucks are now trying to take the spot light off of them, and blame China and Fauci using that as their scape goat. Meanwhile, they are now doing these false flag cyber attacks blaming Russia as they prepare and plan to do a massive one that cripples the world’s economies. <br>
These are the REAL fuckers behind all this, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Soros, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, CDC, WHO, all vaccine companies and all the puppets pushing this crap upon us.</p>
<p>These are the ones we should be going after, these are the ones we MUST STOP at all cost before it’s to late.</p>
<p>If we do not stop them, soon it will be lights out, no internet or food. Once that happens it’s to late. With no internet we can not get out information about what’s going on and they literally could do anything. They could start grabbing people and taking them to camps and hardly anyone would know...</p>
<p>We must put an end to the World Economic Forum and all these elites. They are the cause of this. Do not let them distract you with their propaganda bull shit like the Fauci emails and his connection. YES Fauci is apart of this, he’s one of their puppets. But NO... The virus is not man made, it is FAKE</p>

        <p>Exactly this. THERE IS NO VIRUS. This narrative is being driven to lend legitimacy and incite fear in the masses that there is a bIOLoGiCAL WEaPoN on the loose thanks to China (the new enemy).</p>

        <p>Are you kidding? The media is completely covering up Fauci's role in funding the Wuhan lab. He's still constantly appearing on CNN and MSNBC, and even went with Jill Biden to a Harlem vaccination site. He's getting praised by the neoliberal media as much as ever.</p>

        <p>Holy shit this went a different route than I was expecting. Now I'm wondering if I joined another branch off of r/conspiracy. If you brought in the reptilians or aliens at least that read would have been fun.</p>

        <p>I agree with you totally that the vaccine companies helped create COVID.</p>
<p>The CDC and WHO? Eh, I'm going to need a little evidence there. I hate what they've done during COVID, but I've seen nothing to suggest they helped create COVID.</p>

        <p>Think you misread. He didn't say covid was created by anyone. In fact, the opposite, it doesn't exist.</p>
