        <p>They don't want to "feel better". This is their moment to have a spotlight (however minuscule) and to make themselves believe that their lives MATTER by pushing the narrative that they've been assigned. They genuinely believe that this is for the better of humanity,  and your comments challenge their fragile self worth and fragile world view...</p>

        <p>By saying "feel better" you are implying that the precious lifesaving vaccine has made them ill and that can't be possible because they are a miracle and only make people healthy and strong</p>

        <p>Given the amount of censorship there, the fact as much gets through does is one heck of a warning to everyone.</p>
<p>I'll say this though... Between that subreddit and this one --- we're being used for something. There's a reason we aren't shut down here (yet) and there's a reason they allowed so much of the side effect posts through over there.</p>
<p>Everything we're concerned about here is real, and 100% an issue -- but ON TOP OF THAT -- we are also being used as a distraction and as a scapegoat to transfer other people's hate and frustration.</p>
<p>Instead of getting mad at politicians and lockdown profiteers -- their rage is directed against us.</p>
<p>The conflict and division that is happening is distraction from the economic side of what's happening, and it's looking more and more like September/October may be when it his. The financial burst... And it also may be when the longterm side effects from the vaccines hit. So they'll have a "variant" to blame it on and distract people from what's happening...</p>
<p>And we'll probably get the cyberattack and power outage right in the midst of this, which conveniently keeps common people from being able to access their retirement accounts while the wealthy and connected move their monies to safety right as the crash unfolds.</p>
<p>It will be the greatest scandal of our lives, but just like those senators that profited from knowledge the lockdown was coming before anyone else knew --- it will all be lost amidst a period of chaos as everyone is trying to save their sick family members who are getting the vaccine long term side effects... (Pathogenic priming? Prion disease? Clotting disorders) </p>
<p>Meanwhile the news will tell everyone the whole thing -- including the economic collapse -- is happening because of the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>And suddenly we'll understand why they have been dehumanizing "anti-maskers" and "anti-vaxxers" all this time.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% about this, but it's absolutely one possible outcome and it's a likely enough scenario that yeah, I'm worried.</p>
