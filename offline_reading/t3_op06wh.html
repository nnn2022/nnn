    <strong>yeah but... VaCcInE PaSsPoRtS aRe NoT NeW - ever hear about YELLOW FEVER!!!</strong>
    <p><p>so - this post is just a bit of information about Yellow Fever!</p>
<p>It is a disease caused by a virus </p>
<p>The disease is quite nasty - headache, fever, sensitivity to light and in severe cases, jaundice (thats when your skin and eyes turn yellow) delirium, coma, death.</p>
<p>It is spread by mosquito bites - infact - historical claim-to-fame - it was the first disease where the transmission was proven to be via mosquito bite.</p>
<p>You cannot get it from close contact with someone who has it.</p>
<p>No mosquitos, no transmission.</p>
<p>Furthermore - it is only spread by <strong>certain species</strong> of mosquitos. Not every species of mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus.</p>
<p>If you're interested to learn what species of mosquitos can transmit the virus and where they live... do an internet search!</p>
<p>So - historically - when you travel to a country where yellow fever is present - you are advised to take a yellow-fever vaccine before visiting.</p>
<p>1 - because it protects you</p>
<p>and 2 - because it helps protect the country you are visiting - you are one less vector for the virus to hop to, and it stops you potentially needing to make a trip to the local hospital where doctors will need to take the time to deal with you.</p>
<p>Is there a danger you'll bring the virus home with you and spread it around your community?</p>
<p>well that kinda depends where your home is. (And of course - you've done your independent internet search to learn what the mosquito species are and where they live...)</p>
<p>But if you're reading this in Europe, North Africa, China, Russia, (Most of) North America (sorry Florida!) - the answer is no - you cannot spread yellow fever to your community when you return - because - the wrong type of mosquitos.</p>
<p>How is this different from Coronaviruses?</p>
<p>1stly - Coronaviruses are ubiquitos - that means - they are found everywhere in all corners of the world. Coronaviruses already exist in the country you are visiting - and they already exist in the country you call home.</p>
<p>Your clotshot is not going to stop a coronavirus from circulating the planet. </p>
<p>Secondly - the coronavirus jabs are not 100% effective. They are what we call "Leaky Vaccines" ie. they don't work that well.</p>
<p>I appreciate this is not the most detailed post - but I thought I would share this because it might get some people thinking about the debate for vaccine passports - and how useful (or not) they could be in preventing virus spread.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you - I'd seen it as well - so I thought it would be worth knowing a little bit about it. And when you learn something - why not share it.</p>

        <p>Thats what we were told - we know from the original studies submitted by pfizer, moderna, J&amp;J etc. that plenty of people in the jab group were testing positive for coronavirus. This isn't "new news" - its been know since day 1 when the studies were presented for emergency use authorisation.</p>
<p>The definition of a leaky vaccine is a "less-than-perfect" vaccine. Jabbed individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.</p>

        <p>Before traveling to Malaria Countries, you have to get Prophylaxis, with a recipe from a Tropical Doctor. Traveling to African Countries (not included the North African Countries) you also need a Visa. Because even an US Passport or European Passport is worthless down there. </p>
<p>Alltrough there is no Vaccine against Malaria. But the Prophylaxis are a Life-Safer for any Situation.</p>
<p>I don’t think a Vaccine Passport is Required for Malaria Countries. Make sure you get those Prophylaxis.</p>
