    <strong>"I think masks and social distancing aren't so bad"</strong>
    <p><p>I was having a conversation with someone online two days ago and this is what they told me. "I think masks and social distancing aren't so bad" I responded by blocking them immediately, but I just want to say, that if you think that they're not so bad, then I'm sorry but your life is sad. You're a sad human being, no matter who you are or how much money you have or what you did, your existence is sad. Because nothing has a value, if you don't have your freedom. </p>
<p>You only think they're not so bad because now everyone will have to sit at home and be a loser like you (or so you think because I will never be like you) and we all know all you do is sit at home and masturbate to hentai all day, you sad sad person. </p>
<p>Also fuck you.</p></p>

        <p>i think you are a bit extreme, didn't sound as if they were the "you grandma killer" type.</p>
<p>i don't give 2 shits if someone wears a mask forever , all i care about is our liberties and being shamed for not falling in line. </p>
<p>wearing a mask, and liking it is this persons liberty that deserves as much consideration as yours.</p>

        <p>People can do whatever they want to do with their lives. They're free to hide their faces if that's what they likes to. As long they don't force me or others to wear masks or follow these restrictions by laws it's okay.</p>
<p>I still hope teachers can show some consideration for their students that's either dependent on lip reading or facial expressions. I hope masks don't get normalized and permanently the cultural ideal. Communication definitively gets more difficult with them. If people wants to wear mask and talk to me, I'm free to bring with me pen and paper - and see if they're willingly to write down what they want to say.</p>
