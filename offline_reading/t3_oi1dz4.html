    <strong>It's difficult for people to accept that world leaders aren't just corrupt, they're malevolent.</strong>
    <p><p>It's one thing to recognize that politicians are apathetic and greedy, but the idea that a small group of people has a plan to drastically reduce quality of life for the world population?</p>
<p>I understand the skepticism, to a point. But all it takes is looking up the great reset to realize more is going on than meets the eye. We can't fight an enemy we're unaware exists.</p></p>

        <p>I have said this for ages.   </p>
<p>I think we look at the elites the same way we look at each other. This is incorrect. You need to look at the elites the same way you think of street thugs and crack whores. Ohhh your opinion of people slightly dipped didn't it? Yeaaah... Now imagine you are king asshole of the world. You own major infrastructure and no longer "work" for a living. You have enough money to buy a country. They never have to exert effort into starting a business, supporting a family, paying for school, or putting food on the table. They travel the world the same way you go for a walk.</p>
<p>They think of you the same way you think of criminals and beatniks. Except they have proof they are better than you because they can literally own you. Why do you think so many elites are pedo's? Those "things" aren't children to them. They think of children the same way people pay hobo's to fight coz it's funny (no awareness that is the degradation of another human being and praying on their desperation and suffering).  </p>
<p>So, add this all together. Assumed divine greatness due to their wealth and power, and supreme boredom because they can buy the world. What do you do? <br>
You either seek to rule the world or change history.   </p>
<p>The elites are power-hungry and BORED. Or come from a long line of dictators. Or both.  </p>
<p>It bugs me when people still insist it is incompetence. Shyeah, maybe on the local level. Your stores manager is incompetent. You don't get to be at the table of power and be a dumbass. If you see a dumbass in power it is because someone let them be there.<br>
Why. wouldn't. it. be. intentional? Just look at the Kim family in North Korea. You think they give a shit?</p>

They cannot agree on everything all the time.</p>

        <p>I do think this may be one thing that prevents true world domination. It is easy for them to cooperate while they each have their own dominion (country etc), but once the New World Order sets in and all of the resources and manufacturing is owned by the state, the number of total stakeholders will have to shrink. I can't see them too eager to share or lower themselves in the hierarchy. You can have subordinates, but you can only have one person at the tippity top.  </p>
<p>We will likely be having a tough time by then though.</p>
<p>The strength and weakness of a dictatorship is the leader is easily replaced. You may get a truly good dictator, but the seat is still open for an evil person to eventually take.</p>

        <p>They cannot keep this up forever. Just not how nature works. Eventually the magnetic pole shift will set us back to stone age and our way of life was nothing but a dream. Same as atlantis before the last magnetic shift. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VPfZ_XzisU not the best channel to learn real shit from but this is related to what I speak of.</p>
