    <strong>Any incidents of individuals and/or communities who started out in support of lockdowns as a primary way to fight this who were able ti be swayed by evidence?</strong>
    <p><p>What would be great to know if there's been any fundamental changes in mindsets due to the overwhelming evidence of lockdowns costing nore than the bring in just about everything. Meaning going well beyond just economies and employment and into education, visitng or for that matter starting families, having vital social interaction, mental health issues from isolation, missed medical issues and so on. Even various televised medical avdisers have been slowly but surely changing tunes about the ability to have a functioning society. ANd making sure to note that there's little evidence the vaccines won't be effective against mutated strains. To the extent they;ve been enjoying their influence and status as international heroes, it's probably registered they'll be losing all of it if they end up trying to make 2021 same as this year.</p>
<p>Any changes been seen among relatives, friends, communities, on reddit, fb or irl?</p></p>

        <p>Well my family are ignoring a few rules. But still complain about rule breakers. Theyre so deeply submerged in the fear, but can't keep up with the rule changes. Theyve resorted to common sense, which is great. I just wish they'd stop bashing others who are also breaking rules.</p>
<p>"Youre complaining that theyre breaking x rule, while you're breaking this rule. Am I hearing you right?" 
That usually shuts them up. Until next time.</p>

<p>Bad post, misinformation, people aren't swayed by evidence any more.  People will change their minds only when the news tells them to, or it affects them personally.</p>
