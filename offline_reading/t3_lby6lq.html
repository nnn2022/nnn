    <strong>Campus is a real dreary place these days</strong>
    <p><p>I just returned to school as an older student, I know, wonderful timing. We have some classes in person that are socially distanced and masked, there are a decent number of students on campus. I have never seen such a dreary bunch of college students, this is a university that is known for being a fun place but the way it is now makes community college look like a giant party. Nobody talks before and after class, there is this thick layer of resistance around socializing and a depressing aura all around. More people are walking alone than I have ever seen on a campus. It is pretty clear that this isolation has taken a heavy toll, even as we move towards some semblance of normality, the submission has crushed people’s spirits and their courage to interact with new people. Witnessing this is very disappointing, it makes me think that instead of a wave of people who are ready to have fun and get out of their bubbles, it is going to be a long period of trying to break the momentum of the new normal.</p>
<p>I am one of the only people who refuse to wear a mask walking around campus outside, I have seen a few other people and there is instant respect. I have to wear one inside or I will get kicked out of the class or even school, seriously. I have just lost so much respect for people, 99% just submit, no questions asked. It disgusts me and it is hugely disappointing. Just trying my best to persevere but it’s hard when the future isn’t looking very bright.</p></p>
