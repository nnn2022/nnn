    <strong>Civil discussion: does this sub not realise that Your opinion is really selfish?</strong>
    <p><p>I dunno it seems really childish to not just follow guidelines. you still have your freedom, it isnt like we are made to be robots, we just have to follow some rules to keep each other safe. Believe me half of You do not have it as hard as you think you do, staying indoors eating ice cream on the couch is not the governments way of taking control of our minds</p></p>

        <p>It’s easy for somebody to have that take when their life revolves around doing things on a screen (you). Tell that to business owners, parents with multiple small children and people that have been forced to wait for a stimulus check to afford said ice cream.</p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>It's frustrating as all hell watching people who have lost nothing forcing others to lose everything.  In addition to this unequal level of sacrifice, <em>we're</em> the ones being called "selfish".</p>
<p>I haven't heard a single one of these people apologizing or expressing thanks for my sacrifice.  Not once.  It's only, "do it, or you will see my fist."</p>
<p>Said by the same people who still have a job.</p>
<p><em>That's</em> selfish.</p>

        <p>Many people lost thier jobs due to the lockdowns. Depression, suicide, drug use, and domestic abuse all went way up. Many children couldn't properly socialise with other kids during the most important formative years of their young lives.</p>

        <p>How can you expect us to have a "civil discussion" yet say we are selfish?</p>
<p>Anyways here's a question I would like to ask you. Aren't the ones who want to make everyone else mask up and distance the selfish ones here? You clearly don't know the mental health toll the guidelines have caused on people.</p>
<p>You don't know what it's like people that are struggling with anxiety with this whole mask and distancing shit. You don't know what it's like for those who lost their jobs because their business couldn't comply. Not even because they refused mind you, a lot of small businesses couldn't keep going because of this shit and the capticity limits that ultimately did them in. </p>
<p>You really need to think how the guideline are affecting people before you judge everyone for being selfish.</p>

        <p>Civil discussion opens with "you're being childish". Lol. This'll be good.</p>
<p>Counterpoint does OP not realize that your opinion is extremely authoritarian? Over the last year, you have given away freedom of assembly (unless BLM related), and freedom of movement. You have allowed the government to tell you what to wear and stood by as they flexed their power to regulate businesses in a way that was completely unprecedented and has left a lot of people destitute. Many of these mandates and requirements were struck down by the courts (which meant that in the meantime, your rights were being restricted), or only made it through because the government declared a state of emergency (I don't know about you, but after a year and a bit, I think we need to stop using the word emergency -this is something else. </p>
<p>Now that we're getting the vaccine, it's not enough. You still have to forfeit these rights even though you're vaccinated? When does that stop making sense? Are you content to do this for the rest of your life? Because this thing is <em>going to become endemic</em>. It mutates in ways that make the vaccines much less effective and is pretty contagious. If the logic thus far has been "it's too dangerous without a vaccine" and now "it's too dangerous even if you have a vaccine because the vaccine doesn't make you immune/unable to spread esp. variants" then by your own standards you'll be living like this forever. If that's okay with you, then fine, but you should understand why others aren't just going to go along with that  If it's not okay with you then you'll join up someday, just need to figure out where your line in the sand is where you're no longer to hand over your freedoms any longer. </p>
<p>This isn't r-antimask some people here mask some don't some people are absolutely going to get the vaccine some won't. We're collectively opposed to this virus being used to selectively strip citizens of freedoms guaranteed by the constitutions of countries across the world and by basic morality. Issues you're either selectively or intentionally ignoring: mandatory vaccinations, vaccine passports, social gathering size limits, business closures, dodgy info on vaccine side effects, no legal liability for vaccine providers I could go on.</p>
<p>Yes, this sub is probably leans slightly more right wing and more libertarian than others because a)members get kicked out of other places on Reddit and b) that's the position more likely to think that freedom from government infringement on our lives, and personal responsibility matter, even in a collective action problem. That does not mean we are childish or stupid or selfish, it just means our moral reasoning is different from yours. Are there stupid fuckers on this subreddit? Yes. Are there stupid fuckers on every subreddit? Also yes.</p>

        <p>Most of us don't get to stay indoors and eat ice cream on the couch. I still have to go to work and do all the un-fun things I had to do before, but I'm not allowed to do a lot of the fun things. And work is harder than it was before because of all the new silly rules.</p>
<p>We do not have the freedom we had just a year and a half ago, and even then we weren't as free as we should have been. Just because it could be worse doesn't mean it's okay.</p>
<p>I don't worship safety. I don't think it's appropriate to sacrifice liberty and dignity for it, especially when that safety is illusory and the threat is much smaller than claimed. I believe people should be able to make their own risk assessments and do what they think is best for themselves, regardless of whether I personally would choose more or fewer precautions. If someone wants to wear three masks and get experimental shots and shelter in place for the entire year, that's fine - as long as they're only making that choice for themselves and don't try to force others.</p>

        <p>It is not my responsibility to keep you safe, that's your responsibility.  I am not willing to give up my constitutionally protected rights because you think I should.
