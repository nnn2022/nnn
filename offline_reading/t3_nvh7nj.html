    <strong>Remote job requiring vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Over the last couple years I have worked for an IT company part time. At first I was in person, but have since transitioned to remote (permanently, not just because of lockdowns and such). </p>
<p>My employer informed us that they are requiring vaccines as they transition the in-person employees back to the office. I did not inform them of my vaccination status since I assumed it would be unnecessary since I will never come into the office. However, my boss let me know in my recent conference call that they would still need to know if I have been vaccinated. There are exemption requests, but I am just flabbergasted they would even ask such a thing. I am 100% against vaccine requirements for any job, but as a remote worker I feel there is literally no justification for it.</p>
<p>I will not be getting the vaccine for any reason, but this one really stings because I have already needed to put in an exemption request for my main job (result pending), and I was banking on this job for income in case my request is not granted.</p></p>
