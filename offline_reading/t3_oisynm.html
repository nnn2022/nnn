    <strong>How risky is it to hang out with vaxxed people?</strong>
    <p><p>I am too autistic for this, and how do I make decisions when I don't what's true or not.</p>
<p>I'm still worried about getting spike proteins. Maybe I am reading too much prion stuff. </p>
<p>But I have been so isolated, it is frightening outside of marriage, and it's taking a toll. I wish I knew one or two unvaxxed people IRL but I don't. </p>
<p>I have one group I can return to now but the rules are you have to wear a mask if you are unvaxxed. That freaks me out because I would be singled out. EVERYONE would know.</p>
<p>I was on a Zoom [they are doing hybrid] and noticed one woman in the room out of 40, had a mask on, she sat in the back. All the vaxxed people looked so happy and hopeful, aka they believe this is all over with. They still look more sick to me. There's got to be a few liars in the crowd or ones who got saline, because they still have light in eyes and don't look sick.</p>
<p>I have an invite to go to another group, in about a month, car ride for around 40 minutes to get there, with vaxxed person driving, enjoyable activity. I would be around some people in a room, probably most vaxxed. That doesn't bug me, since I am seeing people all over in stores as much and usually sat on the side anyhow.</p>
<p>I told the person who wants to give me the ride I'm not vaxxed, they know someone mutually I did tell, they asked me to wear a mask. I said okay but I find myself wondering how many years will I be forced to mask up, 3, 4, 5? I feel weary.  </p>
<p>I can't live isolated forever, I mean two years is coming soon. I am high risk with bad lungs, sometimes I just think the powers that be have destroyed my life. There's no one to talk to but on here and a few long distant friends online.</p>
<p>It sucks not to know anyone who is local to talk about this. </p>
<p>Husband worried me because he said "oh they will fix the vaxx problem and they will become more safe". I said hell no, they will still deliver spike proteins in other type!!! Will these other folks influence him to join the "system". While he doesn't trust the vaxx medically, he is brushing off worries about the door to door stuff and the fact they may make it mandatory. He thinks I am "overreacting". I found myself telling him one day, I plan to flee and hopefully this will be with you, if it comes to that. Like the happy and hopeful vaxxed people he thinks life is going to return to normal.</p>
<p>I keep telling self to harden up and to not care anymore. Even religion has failed me, I mean why would God/Source warn me the vaxx is evil, and leave me alone in this world without anyone who is refusing it or doesn't see through any of this where everyone who does is far away? </p>
<p>Husband I feel I am working hard to keep him from joining the NPCs. I already lost the family that was abusive, my health and so much else. </p>
<p>It gets hard trying to keep up a "face", in my case with 4 I told I used medical reasons, I did not tell them what I think. I know some here may think I am a coward, but I struggled to breathe and almost died of lung problems before.  </p>
<p>The only reason I am putting one foot in front of another is my husband but if he joins the NPCs all will be lost. I get afraid of the vaxxed people in these groups influencing him. I tell him I care about all the friendly kind people we know, but he doesn't know how I am feeling inside, that they bought into all this and it horrifies me so deeply. He thinks this is all going to be over soon, and it's just a megacorporate money clean-out exploiting people's fears. </p>
<p>I care about the vaxxed people in the mix, the only social ties I had, so the pain here is immense. I figure I could just return to life, but I feel all twisted in knots. Imagine feeling afraid of people knowing what you really think. Imagine having no one you can talk to. I can to husband SOME but I have the whole "conspiracy" barrier with this topic. Husband's best friend is NPC who believes in the system too. </p>
<p>So I worry about the medical risks of hanging out with vaxxed people but there's other risks too. </p>
<p>I worry too, they lie to us, to divide, and don't want to be someone blowing off vaxxed people with lies from the other side.</p>
<p>I live a life where 99 percent of people I know I have been vaccinated. I only know one holistic health person locally who has not and that is an acquaintanceship at best.</p>
<p>I may just have to go live life and if I die I die. I figure I am going to get prions anyway because I have to get medical care and food. The spike proteins worry me, but what can I do about it. I can't live in a cage forever. </p>
<p>I feel like life has been made worse than even conspiracy and bible prophecy people warned about. Even the preppers and fundamentalist Christians made it out like you would have people around you supporting all on the same page. That's a laugh. </p>
<p>I feel like a spy in the enemy camp, keep a smile on, act like you believe all this, or if you do deviate offer other reasons. There's probably other people who have done a better job of remaining under the radar. A few of the vaxx-less people I know in other states told me they are keeping mouths shut, trying to blend in. I know I have taken too much risk with the 4. With the one group not happily joining in sans mask pretending I got the vaxx, I probably am already singled out.</p>
<p>This is more than an autistic can take. I wonder if I am in hell now and already died, I am not going schizoaffective, I know implicitly these thoughts are "delusional" but they are there.</p></p>

        <p>-I feel like a spy in enemy camp...</p>
<p>That really is the truth for me as well. All I can say is fake it until you make it. Ask vaccinated people to put on a mask around you. Put them in their place.  After all, they should care just as much about your safety as their own. Act like you belong where you are at and no one will question. This is a basic body language technique. Humans tend to ignore others who aren't out of place. </p>
<p>About 90% of my clients are vaccinated and they just assume I am too. I mask up for clients with cancer, T1D with 1 kidney etc.....The extreme cases because I give a shit about protecting their health just in case. Everyone else is vaccinated so what's the worry, right?</p>

        <p>The vaccinated people aren't wearing masks, in the one group that met, 40 had no masks, but they expect the unvaxxed to wear them. With the car trip guy, I didn't think to do that. I probably should have just lied and gone maskless from the start and told everyone I got the vaxx. I may as well have worn a flashing sign UNVAXXED "UNCLEAN" showing up to the hybrid, on computer.</p>
<p>But I feared being blamed or "found out". I warned one or two.  With stores, it doesn't matter, I DGAF what people think just walk around doing what I want but other social things it is more complicated. I have visible disabilities too. If I was in good shape without bad lungs, I could just have joined the liar brigade too for safety, --I did fear whatever virus is out there. Glad most of your clients assume you are vaccinated. I did this all wrong and talked too much. I regret even telling the "ride friend". Being on the autistic spectrum I am screwing all of this up. We aren't good liars either.  Body language gets complicated too.</p>

        <p>Well, a secondary approach is to tell the vaccinated, "Thank you for getting vaccinated so people like me are safe and can return to normal life. My immunologist told me I should not get vaccinated based on my extensive medical history."</p>
<p>Or lie and tell 'em you got a J&amp;J Jab because it uses traditional vaccine technology.</p>

        <p>I am telling them it's all because of my extensive medical history which is true. The few I have told, and that numbers to 4-5 people [2 were a couple]. I dance on the edges on my FB but realized none of that was going to wake any up. I have used words like "immuno-suppressive" and history of "anaphylaxis". I am on the edge of lupus now and have serious recurring anemia now among multitudes of other health problems and rare autoimmune stuff.  However the whole being "singled" out thing is freaking me out.</p>

        <p>The vax up mask down promotion is to get people to vax up if they want to return to the old normal. Obviously there are still risks for the vaxed people going around without masks.</p>
<p>They have calculated the risks and rewards, if everyone us vaxxed but mask down, they can still keep the pandemic under control, compared to half the people not getting vaxed.</p>
<p>I dont know where they got their calculations from though...</p>

        <p>Yes the vaxx are useless.</p>
<p>us Aspies tend to be detailed thinkers, I keep thinking, they are all hanging out together eating etc, the vaxx doesn't stop transmission for any real virus out there. Why is the ride friend and the group afraid of unvaxxed me where I have to wear a mask but they don't? These vaxxes are so utterly useless. I shouldn't be worried like this.</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like an apologist, but  I don't think there is a great danger.</p>
<p>If someone has been vaccinated they will produce spike proteins.  But a limited amount, because they don't have the virus, just a dosage of the vax.  If they shed some of these proteins you might be exposed to a small amount.  But your body will not create more, it's not a virus. And if they were shedding they will shed everywhere always.  So how much of that load is likely to find its way to you?  </p>
<p>You mention being autistic.  Turn that to your advantage.  Think of it as a type of Drake's equation, multiplying probabilities.  </p>
<p>P1 * P2 * P3 * P4 * P5.    Remember the spike protein is not contagious, you won't produce it.  So the probability that you will encounter, be exposed,  absorb, metaboize, and then react is a really small number.</p>
