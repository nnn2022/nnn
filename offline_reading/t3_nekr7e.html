        <p>I like how every post in that sub about whatever terrible side effect a person is having must always start with, "first of all, I'm super duper pro-vax and I'm glad I got my Fauci Ouchie and I voted for Biden 3 times."</p>

        <p>I find myself growing pissed they are allowing no medical exemptions or even discussion of those with extreme autoimmune disease. I have several. I had a bad flare of my rheumatological disorder over the weekend, extreme dry eyes, painful joints, chills, extreme exhaustion, with NO Covid vaxx.  I feel like this is abuse of the chronically ill and ableism to the extreme. Them telling a woman with EDS to get this vaccine is insane too.</p>

        <p>the doctors all seem controlled. Mine actually went from, "I understand if you decide not to get it, it is your choice due to your history" to "you need to get the vaccine". I told him point blank, my chances of death are probably 50/50 on vaccine day due to my history of anphylaxis, and I will die of another disorder. I also told him all these healthy people got sick who I know so what's supposed to happen to me?</p>

        <p>I have a family member with autoimmune (I have a few of them too) and when she asked why I didn't get the vaccine yet I told her that's why.  She said no, all I have to do is go off my AI meds and then I can get the covid vaccine. </p>
<p>First of all, I don't take meds for it and prefer a more natural approach.  Secondly the reason I think I have it in the first place is after taking flu vaccines - never had it until I was vaccinated through work a few decades ago and I'm pretty certain that's what gave me autoimmune problems to begin with.  I was completely healthy before that and falling for the herd mentality of "needing" vaccines for everything under the sun is truly what I think messed me up.</p>
<p>My position is that I am not going to further disrupt my immune response with yet another vaccine that I don't need, and certainly not one that has little data on those with autoimmune.  I'll let others be guinea pigs, not doing it. If they want to prohibit my movement and freedoms because of that, it's between them and their god.  I'm good with mine.</p>

        <p>"Thrown under the bus to reach herd immunity"  It has been YOUR choice all along - at least up until this point.  I cannot stand this mentality that I MUST do x y or z including injecting myself with an experimental vaccine for which no clinical studies exist for people in my situation as an autoimmune person for the greater good.  Then get angry at 'others' for MY choice.  </p>
<p>I personally am not getting this now for a variety of reasons but one of the primary ones is that I'd like to see what the government tries to do with me.  If it starts becoming mandated in any way it will just reinforce to me that something is very wrong here with this whole situation.</p>

        <p>Why go with it willingly if you even suspect you are being thrown under the bus? I mean why line up? I know as a chronically ill disabled person in this eugenics society they don't care about me, and if they give me something, that makes me even sicker or puts me in a nursing home, or harms my husband if he were to take it, they won't give a damn and will tell me the same BS I already see the afflicated on that board having like there's a woman today who had her retina detach just out of the blue no injury doing it, who had this happen right after taking the vaccine and the doctors are telling her it's not related. Give me a break. I won't take it even if they threaten me with the worse, because my chances of death or a destructive illness happening are so high. I am already deaf, I already get chills, I spent years dizzy from Meniere's, I have chronic fatigue, can't even list everything that is wrong, my body is done up but I know there's far worse that can happen to me and I am not signing up. I am so pissed at the ableism and sheer neglect of the disabled, you can't even imagine. .</p>
