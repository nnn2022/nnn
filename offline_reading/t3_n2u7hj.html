<title>Went to dinner with the in-laws back in March for the first time in a year. We saw one family enter before us with masks. The ENTIRE staff and rest of the patrons were maskless,including us. It was beautiful. Took a pic of this sign as we were leaving, it was a wonderful night.</title>

        <p>This is exactly how it should be. Everyone should be allowed to go on with their lives, and options should be offered so you can properly take responsibility for your own health. If you are at risk, consider that before entering an establishment. The government can help by offering at risk people options to allow them to work from home, or temporary accommodation if they live in a multi generational household, for example, as well as implementing support and measures for high risk environments and hospitals, but at the end of the day it should be a choice for everyone including at risk people to take up these options.</p>
