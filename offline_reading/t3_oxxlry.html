        <p>Private businesses do not fall into any of these entities. It’s about medical records and data.</p>
<p>Covered Entities
The following types of individuals and organizations are subject to the Privacy Rule and considered covered entities:</p>
<p>Healthcare providers: Every healthcare provider, regardless of size of practice, who electronically transmits health information in connection with certain transactions. These transactions include claims, benefit eligibility inquiries, referral authorization requests, and other transactions for which HHS has established standards under the HIPAA Transactions Rule.
Health plans: Entities that provide or pay the cost of medical care. Health plans include health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurers; health maintenance organizations (HMOs); Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare+Choice, and Medicare supplement insurers; and long-term care insurers (excluding nursing home fixed-indemnity policies). Health plans also include employer-sponsored group health plans, government- and church-sponsored health plans, and multi-employer health plans.
Exception: A group health plan with fewer than 50 participants that is administered solely by the employer that established and maintains the plan is not a covered entity.
Healthcare clearinghouses: Entities that process nonstandard information they receive from another entity into a standard (i.e., standard format or data content), or vice versa. In most instances, healthcare clearinghouses will receive individually identifiable health information only when they are providing these processing services to a health plan or healthcare provider as a business associate.
Business associates: A person or organization (other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce) using or disclosing individually identifiable health information to perform or provide functions, activities, or services for a covered entity. These functions, activities, or services include claims processing, data analysis, utilization review, and billing.</p>

        <p>No one can demand protected patient information. Vaccine status on its own is not protected. PHI and PII are complex and also settled law on what constitutes a business associate. </p>
<p>However they can deny you service based on your vaccine status against during a public emergency. This is settled law in Jacobson v Massachusetts. The state can demand it. I believe the state legislature can create a law that says you can’t ask for it (Florida) and that is considered constitutional. I don’t know if the penalties would actually be enforceable though. I guess we’ll see if someone appeals it and it makes it’s way through the courts</p>
