        <p>First of all how fucking dare you compare your privileged ass life to fucking Stalinist Russia you entitled prick.</p>
<p>Wearing a piece of cloth on your face and spending time indoors is definitely equal to the torture, forced labour and mass executions and starvations of the USSR. My family lived through it. The people of my country (Estonia) lived in abject poverty and complete totalitarianism under the Stalin regime and nearly 1/3 of our population was deported to Syberia. Don't ever presume to compare your privileged life in a first world country to the USSR.</p>
<p>Secondly, the virus has killed millions already and it has been going on for just a year. Is it really that hard to just fucking wear a piece of cloth on your face and stay indoors more?</p>

        <p>Get over it. Your time under Stalin is done but what's most disturbing is you not realizing that though it isn't at that level of brutality YET, we are rapidly approaching it. Also the fact that you yourself said " It's just a piece of cloth" and for you to expect that "a piece of cloth" is sufficient enough to stop a "deadly virus" is beyond insane. Wake up and quit living in fear! You are in your twilight of your life and I implore you to not spend your waning moments in such a fearful mindset.</p>

        <p>There is a difference between a government literally just trying to stop a pandemic and a dictatorship.</p>
<p>You have no idea how totalitarian regimes form. They are all opposed to the establishment. The USSR was the result of a revolution. Nazi Germany was mainly voted in by fringe conspiracy theory believing conservatives. Dictatorships happen when people are unsatisfied by the current government and start to distance themselves from main society.</p>
<p>And yes, all it takes is a simple piece of cloth to slow down transmission. It doesn't stop the virus leaving but it slows the air you breathe out meaning it doesn't shoot out like a blow drier.</p>

        <p>So USSR went from some type of normalcy to forced labor and mass executions overnight?  Of course not, it took years and it happened through steady erosion.  So maybe we're not at that stage yet (I'm not suggesting the stages will be the same) but what is happening now can escalate into something much more, just like what happened in USSR.</p>
