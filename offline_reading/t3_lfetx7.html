    <strong>Did we focus on the wrong outcome</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a physician who works Covid for the state and interact a lot with people who have varying views on the severity of Covid.  I hear a lot that it’s not a big deal because most people survive it and those who don’t are typically older.  So I wonder, do you think focusing so much on the death rate was a mistake? Did we lose so many of you because your immediate thought was “I’ll survive it”?  </p>
<p>I’m currently having a wave of younger people admitted to the hospital recently.  I have two 49 year olds on the vent. I have a 21 year old in the ICU as well.  I believe all of these people will likely survive but their financial and cognitive lives will likely be different.  One of my 49 year olds is on day 16 of being here.  I have no doubt his employer is no longer holding his job for him. He may be losing his health insurance. The plan at this point is to trach him and move him to an acute care facility.  But he will be considered a success story, because he wouldn’t have died.  For all practical purposes his life as he and his family knew it is gone. My 21 year old dropped out of school.  He’s also lost his job and his father is the 49 year old I spoke of previously. He is in no condition to become the “man of the family”. Here’s a family that is devastated and yet they are considered a COVID success story.  </p>
<p>The deaths are awful but they are mostly old people. The carnage on people in their prime working years though is so often ignored.  Do you think we should have focused more on that?</p></p>

        <p>I think the problem with these stories (and the bollocks around "long covid") is the same as the problems with the death rate - it is really rare and really specific. If you are not over 80 or obese, then covid simply isn't a risk. It is <em>less</em> risky (by any measure) than influenza for the young.</p>
<p>As an example, 10 days after I had my daughter, I had a massive hemorrhage (technically a post-partum hemorrhage, but have it that much later is very very rare). I ended up needing 6 units of whole blood, 14 units of blood products, I was on a vent and sedated for a day, and they did an emergency D&amp;C to clear the blood clots but I was too weak to do a hysterectomy (thankfully!). The first day, they thought I was going to die. I was in ICU for 4 days at a cost of over $65,000.</p>
<p>That is real. That is a thing that happened. It could happen to other people. <strong>However</strong>. If I tried to pass that off as a risk of pregnancy that requires changing all of society to accommodate it - I would be insane. If I tried to mandate rules around sex, dating, talking to the opposite sex, birth control, pregnancy, marriage, insurance, financial planning, and access to medical care for non-pregnancy related conditions, I would be insane and also a misanthropic sociopath.</p>
<p>This is the response to covid.</p>

        <p>I think that’s reasonable, and I’m sorry that happened to you.  But at which point is it not rare enough to make changes. Again, all the patients I see are hospitalized. We put them on Remdesivir and that’s a five day treatment course. So patients are typically in for at least five days. To me that’s a significant amount of time and  cost.  to them.</p>

        <p>They lost me completely when they switched from deaths to cases. I couldn't wrap my brain around that. Focusing on cases immediately told me the death rates were not as high as predicted.</p>

        <p>I think cases aren’t nearly as important as deaths and hospitalizations.  I don’t find them to be that useful
Of a marker except to see whether things are getting better or worse.  Hospitalizations to me are a useful metric because 1) I work there and when things are bad, it’s bad but 2) these are the people who are going to suffer the most financially and medically. </p>
<p>I follow the positivity rate pretty high.  My kids attend in person school and my trigger for pulling them out has been positivity rate.  Right now cases are dropping, now some of that is because the government run testing sites have been converted to vaccination sites. But as someone front line, hospitalizations are dropping too.  Which is great</p>

        <p>I was able to recognize from the start that covid won't just go away. It was destined to become endemic to the human population. Lockdowns and social distancing beyond the initial two weeks to allow hospitals to prepare only serve to spread roughly the same deaths out over a longer period of time. Lockdown are not without significant cost to mental health, childrens education, and small businesses. Apparantly 1000 deaths in a day is worse than 1500 deaths in a month.</p>

        <p>It won’t go away but it is becoming more manageable.  Initially it was treated solely as a respiratory disease, and that was an error.  We weren’t nearly as focused on the other systems that are affected.  Now we have patients on high dose blood thinners, and that’s preventing a lot of the clotting and complications that happened earlier.  When I think of the clotting and amputations that were happening in the beginning, it’s sad. Israel has some new meds their seeing potential with and I’m excited about that.</p>

        <p>I’m not a virologist, so for me I look at the patients themselves. I’ve been there for a bronch on a covid patient ( we stick a tube down the nose into the lungs) and their lungs are just oozing pus and the tissue sloughs off.  I could care less whether it’s a virus, fungus or other pathogen. I Care that the patients are drowning in this stuff.  I can look at a CT scan and see all the stuff in their lungs that doesn’t belong.  So I leave the research to the researchers.</p>

        <p>Everything isn’t covid. I still see bread and butter stuff, when I work straight ER shifts, but not nearly as much. But I work Covid right now.  It’s my job. When your a hammer, everything is a nail. </p>
<p>That being said, covid has some very characteristic CT findings and lab abnormalities.  If you tell me a covid patients oxygen saturation level, I can usually tell you what their labs will look like. Most pneumonia’s only affected one lobe or one side We used to call it “double pneumonia” if you had it in both lungs.  Covid though: front back, left right, and upper lower. So yes, I’ve gotten very good and diagnosing covid without tests.</p>

        <p>If by ventilator injury, you mean a popped lung, then I’d say 5-10% require a chest tube.  Vent management has changed in that we are going with less pressure and faster respiration’s. </p>
<p>Now all patients on extended ventilation will need to have a trach placed.  The trachea is not designed to have anything except air in it and begins to be damaged by the ET tube. I am at a hospital that typically will trach after 2- 3 weeks and moved then to an acute care  setting if they are otherwise stable on the vent.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this it's very enlightening. I always felt it concerning that from stories those I heard that when a patient would be admitted with COVID symptoms some hospitals would preemptively put the man/woman on a ventilator. I understand that ventilators should be a last resort?</p>
