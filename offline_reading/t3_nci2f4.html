    <strong>Any evidence that the jabs do not reduce transmission?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm struggling with this... I feel as though healthy people are at risk of complications etc from taking the vax, and to me it makes more sense for a best effort approach where it is offered to the vulnerable (which it basically now has) and we can start to get back to normal.</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing any great conspiracy fully, but I am not dismissing any either. I just feel like there is at least some biased information on both sides of the argument. Ultimately I believe that the rollout is down to making money for big pharma and the likes. Maybe with the intention to spin a public health narrative that leads us further down the rabbit hole of control (more tracking with a move to digital currencies). </p>
<p>Anyway, the main thing I would like to discuss is the title. I am having a hard time discussing with my folks why I should not get the vax myself, they are very wrapped up in main stream media narrative here in the UK. </p>
<p>It seems we are being told now that the vaccine does help reduce transmission. If that were the case then this would reduce variants and also protect potentially vulnerable people who are unable to get the vaccine due to health concerns...</p>
<p>I think this is the main point of contention as to why I would consider getting this. However much I do not want it... Please convince me otherwise haha.</p>
<p>I hope this can be a good discussion as I have not found many people debunk this other than saying it doesn't reduce the spread - but studies/articles (if to be believed) seem to show otherwise within the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Any credible materials to look at would be very kind. Also thanks to those who contribute here, I find it very valuable!</p></p>

        <p>Before the vaccines were out, there was a study performed with 10 million people involved in Wuhan, and they <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/wuhan-mass-testing-coronavirus-covid-19-1.5597856"><strong>only found 300 asymptomatic cases of where they thought transmission from one person to another occurred</strong></a>.</p>
<p>*NOTE: Please don't let the lame-stream-media continually lie to you about the word "asymptomatic", because it just means a healthy person who might or might not be a carrier. It's fucking disgusting and disingenuous that the WHO and other world powers have made healthy people into potential carriers by continually using the word "asymptomatic". </p>
<p>Anyways, going back to the article, what the article means is that there was almost zero chance of catching it from someone who showed no signs of having it. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695"><strong>It wasn't as infectious as they thnought</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now going back to your original question, do any of these jabs reduce transmission? What if I said <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>these jabs are capable of creating a horrific situation where someone who gets the shot then transmits the disease to another via viral shedding</strong></a>?</p>
<p>Look, I don't know what to say to you, but just ask yourself why are governments on every level, employers, insurers, and the media all pushing for everyone to get these shots if the virus itself was not harmful to those below 55 years of age? Pfizer is already saying they have a vaccine for kids between 10 to 19. Like, wtf is up with that!?</p>
