    <strong>This sub is compromised - I just had the following post removed</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/politics/texas-house-democrats-covid-positive/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/politics/texas-house-democrats-covid-positive/index.html</a></p>
<p>I've read some shit in my life, but this may take the cake.</p>
<p>" All three members who tested positive are fully vaccinated, according to the caucus. "</p>
<p>- Ok. Some people who are vaccinated will still get covid, fair enough. Statistics are just that and nothing is certain. But if this is the case - why were they not masked on the flight?</p>
<p>"Texas House Democratic Caucus Chairman Chris Turner said in the statement that his group is following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and protocols, and has contacted public health experts in Texas for additional guidance"</p>
<p>- Actually no - they completely disregarded the health protocols by traveling across the country and not wearing masks on the flight, further putting everyone around them in danger. Now, after they got caught not wearing the masks, contracted the virus even after being vaccinated... They are now following protocols, fine. But they were breaking the rules prior to all this.</p>
<p>"This is a sober reminder that COVID is still with us, and though vaccinations offer tremendous protection, we still must take necessary precautions," he said. "</p>
<p>- If this is the case - will these lockdowns ever end? They were vaccinated - at what point do we stop the masks and lockdowns - how can we do this if vaccinated people catch covid (spoiler alert they won't)</p>
<p>Fully vaccinated people who have been exposed to Covid-19 but are not showing symptoms do not need to quarantine or get tested for the virus following their exposure, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html#anchor_1617376555813">current CDC guidance</a>, unless they are in a correctional or detention facility or a homeless shelter.</p>
<p>- WOW - JUST FUCKING WOW. Ok so first - there are more rules if your in jail or homeless (jail maybe but why homeless?). If they were all vaccinated and still contracted it, but do not need quarantine... are you telling us that vaccinated people cannot spread the disease? Cause otherwise.... Just wow on this whole sentence....</p>
<p>MIND YOU - they said that if you are not homeless or in jail, YOU NEED NOT QUARANTINE. That means the CDC is allowing people with the virus to go out in public and spread it ALL OVER THE PLACE - why? Bc they're 'vaccinated'? That shit makes no sense</p>
<p>"Based on the timeline of these positive tests, it was determined the Vice President and her staff present at the meeting were not at risk of exposure because they were not in close contact with those who tested positive and therefore do not need to be tested or quarantined," Sanders said, adding that the vice president and her staff are fully vaccinated. "</p>
<p>- Fair enough. I don't have the time to research this but I'd bet they weren't all wearing masks and maintaining 6ft during the meeting. Alas, it says the VP and staff are fully vaccinated..... so were the 3 texas dems?!?!?!</p>
<p>"It brought health risk because there's an active pandemic and many of our members are over the age of 65, yet they chose to travel because this is so much bigger than one politician. It's so much bigger than you or I," Talarico said of their fight to protect access to the ballot box. "This is about the American experiment and whether it's going to survive for future generations."</p>
<p>- Final sentence and the biggest WHOPPING BULLSHIT I have ever read. I digress. So, the idea is SOOO much bigger than one politician.. so big, they follow the 'rules for thee and not for me' by not following protocols of masks, on an airplane or travelling across the country spreading this deadly virus.... That last sentence can probably be construed many ways but what the shit. The American EXPERIMENT?</p></p>

        <p>My response to your original post:</p>
<p>AFAIC this is just part of the groundwork to prepare us for more lockdowns.  The more this cycle repeats where they seem to be inventing excuses to strangle the economy, the more the whole pandemic looks like an actual economic and politically driven civil war.</p>
<p>Pandemic is one tool, and climate change is another.  It wouldn't shock me if there were more.  The objective seems to be bringing certain economies to their knees and instigating deep civil instability.</p>

        <p>Considering the PCR Test, it will pick up past infections, so a 'case' doesn't mean much.</p>
<p>It cannot determine if the detected 'viral material' is live, dead, infectious or from past infection.</p>
<p>A vaccine won't eliminate this out of their system if it was already there.</p>
<p>The core of all this BS is the PCR Test.</p>
