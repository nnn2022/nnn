    <strong>I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES' WILD RIDE</strong>
    <p><p>We never fucking consented to any of this. We were never given a choice or even a chance to voice our concerns about where this was all headed. There was no vote or poll taken to see who was for and against lockdowns and masks. Our lives changed on a dime and we were expected to just go along with it and knuckle under, to abandon our friends, families, jobs, freedoms and basic human rights to collectively combat a meme virus so weak that only the elderly, obese and immunocompromised die WITH it and so random that having no symptoms IS a symptom.</p>
<p>Basic logic and reasoning has flown the coop. Compassion and love have been replaced with virtue-signaling and hate. Fear and idiocy informs every action the government, media and doomers take towards prolonging this pandemic. Covid is a cult and The Science is their religion. If you question anything or make a complaint they respond with anger and death threats. Doomer cucks push for further restrictions, corrupt-ass governments and shady politicians introduce dystopian and discriminatory vaccine passports like the belming, taint-licking gooch-sweat they are, and amoral Scientists and money-grubbing "Experts" wantonly circumvent traditional ethical and moral boundaries, attempting to vaccinate children without their parents consent, breaking the Nuremberg Code with a cheeky shit-eating grin before acting all innocent, puppy-dog eyed with a finger to their perced lips, emitting a nasally Steve Urkel shriek of "DID IT DO THAATTTT?"</p>
<p>I don't know how I ended up on this never-ending rollercoaster because I never queued for the fucking thing or purchased a ticket. I'm on here for my safety apparently but I've seen a bunch of people jump overboard and splatter on the pavement just to escape the fucking nightmare. The chubby guy squeezed in next to me with the "I heckin love science" shirt on, whose spent the entire ride enjoying himself watching Netflix on his phone, eating junk food and furiously masturbating, keeps performing a Mexican wave every time someone leaps to their death. He insists that those who can't handle the ride should never have gotten on it in the first place; he scoffs when I point out they weren't given a choice. Further down the track, far away from the lever that would bring the ride to a screeching halt, I can see the coaster operators pointing and laughing in our direction, money guffawing out of their padded pockets and pooling around their ankles.</p></p>

        <p>Historically we've consented to very little if anything governments pull.</p>
<p>The trick isn't to win our consent, but to fool us into believing we've consented.</p>

        <p>It's the classic carrot on a stick. As society gets more complex and stratified with the internet and constant immigration, the carrots are easier to lie about.</p>
<p>Because covid is a big deal when you're distancing in line for a plane, but then you spend six hours in a tube where you can take your mask off.</p>
<p>And covid is so deadly we had to shut down parks, and many places e.g. Ontario and Portland still are. But the experts say protesting for black live was ok and worth the risk.</p>

        <p>Hate to break it to you but this ride never ends. Until drastic measures are taken by the people at least. Sorry Canada and Europe.</p>
