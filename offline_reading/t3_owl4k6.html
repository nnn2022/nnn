        <p>Doctors and scientists said they needed 5 years to create a safe vaccine. Trump removed red tape and paved the way to get vaccines faster.</p>
<p>Funny enough those protections would have prevented a lot of adverse reactions we’re seeing today. Liberals are embracing de-regulation and less safety in the name of vaccination while conservatives don’t trust it. Novavax sounds decent though. I hope that gets approved so people have a safer vaccine should they choose to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Because you have to create vaccines for a pandemic and that’s what he kicked into action. He doesn’t know if it’s safe just like he doesn’t know how safe scientifically Coca Cola is to drink at high levels daily, but he promotes that too lol. He champions America and trying to win. He wants to overcome this ChinaVirus debacle and get back to winning. If it means promoting a vaccine that helps in the current for people but could be costly for certain age groups in the long run (as is anything) then what’s the question here? It’s an obvious, of course. I advocate for anyone scared of dying from Covid-19 age 60 and up, anyone scared of dying of Covid-19 with health issues, and anyone in general who is not scared to get the vaccine to get it. Same with yearly flu shots.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your thoughts! I would love to agree with you, but as most of us know here there really wasn’t much of a Covid debacle at all. The survival rate is 99.7% Trump is not stupid and clearly knew this stat, considering the resources he had as POTUS. So, what is there really for a vaccine to “help”?</p>

        <p>Also, if you haven’t noticed during Trumps term, and shortly what’s come about after he didn’t necessarily have a team backing him and steering him how they should’ve. Fauci seems less critical of Biden during this “Delta flair” he’s been on TV about, and he’s constantly facing backlash everywhere from even within his admin.</p>

        <p>He's always been just a Patsy.  The dnc used him to radicalize the center, left and the super left.  Now everyone is color blind and can't see logic or reason after 4 years of pure misguided hate for him.  Trump was literally the trump card of the nwo.  </p>
<p>Evidence: in 2016 trump had the most free press of any political figure in history.  The news MSM mind you, gave him over 2 billion dollars of free tv time. His last name was the most frequently used work on tv the entire year. And then they benched Bernie and gave us the worst Clinton. </p>
<p>It's a 6D chess move if true. And would have plated the last 18 months perfectly.  Setting us up for the currently in process phase.</p>

        <p>He's part of it. He played an important role in upsetting the left to the point all they had to say was "Trump supporters don't want the vaccines" and the left responded "Make them mandatory, then!"</p>
<p>Look up Executive Order 13887. Look when it was passed.</p>
<p>At some point you guys have to realize Trump doesn't represent our interests any more than Biden does. There are two teams here, and it's them against us.</p>
<p>From day one with Trump: "Fayykkee neyyywwwz" was a setup for the censorship that came later. He's an actor, playing a role in this.</p>
<p>That's why he uses weasel words instead of calling this thing out for what it is. But you guys WANT to believe in him so you can't see through it.</p>
<p>It's identical to how the left is obsessed with Covid-19 and can't see through that.</p>

        <p>The only thing they had on him was covid. He was headed for a landslide victory (probably got one anyway, but that's another argument for another time and place). russia was an exposed hoax.  the economy and employment was great.  real incomes for the middle/working class actually rose for the first time since the early 80s.  no new wars, and drawdowns where they continued, despite resistance from the neocons.</p>
<p>He thought the vaccine would stop them in their tracks, as well as all the programs and money he ordered spent on garbage like ventilators and hospital ships.  What he got was a garbage treatment mislabeled as a vaccine, but he's not the type to backtrack.</p>

        <p>It’s not a trump thing I don’t know why y’all Americans are obsessed by trump he’s an idiot and so is Biden. My guess is the way the media are portraying it everyone supports the vaccine so he has to otherwise he’s got no chance next time he runs for presidency and maybe he also has shares in some companies that profit of it.</p>

        <p>A leader of the country can only make decisions on the information given to him by experts/staff.<br>
Now, we know that the experts/staff had differing agendas than Trump, and it wasn’t known how bad it was until he was out of office.  He suspected, but any talk of firing the experts/staff was met with wild animal hooting from the opposing party, so he didn’t replace them. 
Remember, the experts that were advising him have been proven to be consistently inconsistent except in that they have been wrong most of the time.</p>
