    <strong>I'm so sick of this "new normal" and I can't stop thinking of killing myself to escape</strong>
    <p><pre><code>I'm relatively young and life has already been put on hold for over a year. I lost my job and the lockdowns have left me empty and depressed. I'm stuck in California with an idiot governor and a gullible family who worships that propaganda machine we call 'news'.

At first, when they just started reporting on the 'mysterious virus', I was actually fearful. I was glued to the news. Then they started suggesting masks and I was like "totally. If it helps our country survive this horrible disease everyone's talking about, I'll do it." Then the lockdowns started and my naive self was like "Wow, okay this must be really bad!"

Then it just kept going further and further. Recommendations became mandates and lockdowns became normal. It didn't take long for me to see through the BS. I realize now that an entire year or our lives have been wasted and many lives have been destroyed- all because of a virus with a 99.8% survival rate?!

Now its 2021 and I just want to die so bad, but I'm a coward and could never go through with it. I can't take this anymore. Life has been so mundane, just waking up and doing the same routine over and over every single day. I'm just thankful to have a home and necessities while I can still get them. I don't know how you guys do it, but I'm reaching a severe breaking point. How much of our lives will we lose to this charade? Whats the point of seeing it through when all the future seems to hold is a bleak, unavoidable agenda? I'm just losing hope. Everyone I know is so engulfed in propaganda, its gross. Even my own mother, who tries so hard to be open minded, has been hypnotized into believing in the government. No matter what I tell her she doesn't believe me, or writes me off as paranoid. Nearly my entire family is like this and I don't know what to do for them anymore. I'm worried they're too far gone. My crazy aunt is all for vaccines and mandatory masks and thinks I'm one of those "selfish anti-maskers" and it hurts to feel my family turn against me just because I refuse to participate in the government's tyrannical game. This COVID agenda has turned us against each other and its horrible. I'm just so pissed off and depressed. Man, fuck this life.

And I hate to sound so wimpy. I'm not usually like this, but I just needed to get this off my chest to people who wouldn't judge or call me a 'grandma killer'.

        <p>I’m a lady but this resonated with me, too. </p>
<p>My partner (a dude) recently said that the powers that be are trying to erase and shame “masculine” traits - self reliance, self respect, assertiveness. I thought it was silly at first but it rings truer every day. An emasculated, adrift populace is easier to control. </p>
<p>Loyalty to true friends; care for the family and the home; knowledge of oneself and care for one’s own body... these are the basics we’ve moved away from. Answers and solutions don’t lie deeper in the internet, that’s for damned sure.</p>

        <p>Its an agenda that has been going on a long time</p>
<p>Think of TV, sitcoms, The Simpsons etc...all the countless examples of weak pathetic men, dominated and laughed at by their women-folk and we the audience are expected to laugh along too</p>
<p>Over-use of soy...hormones in water... constant push for men to 'get in touch with their feelings'</p>
<p>They don't <em>want</em> strong alpha males, because strong alpha males will fight and protect...they want a bunch of weak beta males</p>
<p>The feminist agenda is helping it all along nicely too</p>
<p>Divide and rule... it's always been their way...</p>

<p>Man and woman are symbiotic and synergetic. They need each other and feed off each other. Women who realize and understand what is happening to men (as your partner pointed out), and adjust their behavior to counteract it, are <em>very</em> desirable partners for longterm relationships. It resonates with men in a primal, harmonious way.</p>

        <p>I see myself as an (old school, I guess?) feminist... but I also think biological sex is real (wow it’s really come to the point we have to say that). I am a pretty self-possessed and assertive woman and I think the fact that I have always shamelessly embraced my “masculine” traits when necessary made me more sensitive to the face that yes, those in power are trying to squash these traits in ALL people, with men being perhaps their main target (cue the “toxic masculinity is spreading covid” think pieces). </p>
<p>It’s yin and yang and there’s a time and place for strong masculine characteristics - like self possession, assertiveness, being a provider and protector of one’s family... and a time for strong “feminine” characteristics like diplomacy, self expression, and interdependence.</p>
<p>But they don’t want us to embrace the full breadth of our humanity. They want us to have self-hate, self-doubt, no self knowledge, no self possession, no valuable skills in home mechanics, home economics, health/medicine, or food production... and to be in a constant flustered state of hysteria and to be constantly apologizing for existing and looking to the government for permission and solutions. No thanks!</p>

        <p>Maybe use this as your opportunity to move somewhere else, even temporarily. Youre family isnt helping you, theres no job to lose, and cali is just a miserable shithole. Throw out some job applications in areas of interest and move to wherever they hire you. Even if it doesnt work out long term, you have the satisfaction of knowing you didnt sit back and let the govt dictate your life.</p>

        <p>OP, I’m so sorry to hear this! I would say, first, you are more important than you know because you acknowledge the truth about all of this. I think I speak for others when I say that it makes my day to see someone else seeing through all of this bullshit. If there’s anything more worthwhile in life than seeking out the truth and living your life by it, I don’t know what it is. Seriously, what would the rest of us do without people like you? </p>
<p>Okay, regarding practical matters, I live in Houston but am home visiting my parents on the AL gulf coast for the holidays. I went to the florabama for NYE and we basically spent the entire time on the FL side. IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL THERE. I was telling a coworker today that going to Florida and experiencing 2019 life again was worth 100 hours of therapy. I’m not kidding it was glorious. There were packed bars with not a soul wearing a mask. All else failing, move to Perdido, FL, get a job as a bartender and rent a cheap apartment down there. Texas isn’t terrible restriction-wise but FL is way better.</p>

        <p>That sounds like heaven honestly. Looking at the free states is like looking through iron bars from CA. I'd rather get sick and risk dying a free person than be trapped in a miserable cage, walking on eggshell mandates. Really, just knowing that there are people out there who feel the same way is so reassuring and a breath of fresh air, honestly.</p>

        <p>Move if you can. Otherwise, meet with people who are also against lockdowns and form your own gatherings. It's really hard to remain hopeful when all the media does is lie and give us hope that this will end in X amount of time, only to keep dragging it out. I'm grateful that there are this many people who oppose the lockdowns and mandatory masks. Before I found this subreddit and others like it, I thought most people were perfectly okay with what was happening and I was selfish for wanting my life back. The more I do my own research, I find more and more people who agree and want to go back to normal. I've heard many red states are operating as normal. Arizona, Texas, Florida, etc. It's like there's no pandemic in those places. There's still hope that this will end. I believe people will find ways to remove themselves from the systems slowly being put in place by forming communities and resisting together. Hang in there</p>

        <p>Yes, I thought I was alone before I started seeing subs like this. I try to believe that we are the silent majority and hopefully enough of us will eventually rise up to fight back. It sucks that most of the people I find who want their freedom back only appear to be online. Most of my family and friends would rather beg for government control, unfortunately. Those red states look like paradise from here. Got my eyes on Florida.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if moving is an option, but if it is, you should. My mom isn’t as bad as yours sounds, but when she decided to try to force me to stop going out with my friends, I moved. I actually had more fun last year than any other before it, just because of how much time I spent with my friends. Doing that saved me from getting depressed. If you can, find good people who you can hang out with regularly.</p>
