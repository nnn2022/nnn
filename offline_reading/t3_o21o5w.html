    <strong>I Have Officially Lost It…</strong>
    <p><p>So I’ve been listening to NPR for years almost solely because I’m a nerd and I like the special interest stories. Yes I know they lean left but for awhile I felt they were as close to unbiased as you could get for mainstream media… until COVID hit. Then I feel like they stopped asking hard questions and fell in line with the narrative. </p>
<p>But what broke me was the propaganda piece this morning. They did a segment basically saying that the VAERS database is bullshit and that the numbers are unreliable because antivaxers lodge fake reports. AND that… get this… the death numbers are inflated because so many old people get the vaccine and they probably were just ready to die anyway. WTAF!?!</p>
<p>This is the same media outlet that had Steve Inskeep proudly announcing the death toll from COVID every morning and refusing to acknowledge co-morbidities are a factor. </p>

        <p>"Public" media, including NPR and PBS, benefit from the veneer of neutrality and their coma-inducing measured tones, but they're 100% corporate democrat, both by personal politics and by abiding by their sponsors' interests. Do you think Johnson &amp; Johnson wants balanced stories about the vaccines? Does Fidelity want stories on the broken financial system? Does Northrop-Grumman want anti-war stories? Does ADM wants stories on the dangers of GMO foods? No they do not, which is why you won't hear any of those stories.</p>

        <p>100% agreed. It was the stories about the declining barnacle population off Indonesia or interviews with obscure authors/artists that kept me listening. But there’s way less of that now. 80% of the programming is dedicated to stories about the Pandemic and Racial Equality. It’s extremely disproportionate and I can’t handle it anymore</p>

        <p>Just listened to how bad they’re catering to certain races. White guy drives his car through protestors and kills a black person. They make sure to mention both races. Black guy commits a mass shooting and they are careful not to mention race of the shooter. The stories were reported one behind the other so the contrast was easy to notice.</p>

        <p>That actually was my point. It seems people forgot or they just weren't around for the 80's and 90's. </p>
<p>What people can't seem to realize is the media is always portraying everyone in a negative light. They prime people for this shit, and people eat it up and then make broad statements that are patently false about whatever race is being discussed. Right now they're trying to start a race war, hell they've been trying for that.</p>
<p>They want white people to think the media is trying to protect black criminals and that all blacks support BLM and if they don't they're a Trump supporter. They want whites to think we don't hold ourselves accountable and that we all live in section 8 to game the system.</p>

        <p>It matters because if the mass shooter was a white guy, even he shot only white people, it would be fodder for mainstream media. </p>
<p>It’s also dangerous for news outlets to refuse to release information that might help the public safety or bring a suspect to justice. </p>
<p>“ The Austin American-Statesman is not including the description as it is too vague at this time to be useful in identifying the shooter and such publication could be harmful in perpetuating stereotypes.” </p>
<p>The police description wasn’t even vague.</p>

        <p>Leftism is defined by the idea that it is the role of the state to shape the world in our image, so yeah it is not a surprise to literally any libertarian that public media turns into a propaganda outlet for the ideas of social engineering and central planning. I'm sure if you could dig up some newspapers from when these things were first being funded, you could find people arguing against it specifically because they knew this would happen.</p>

        <p>&rt;Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.</p>

        <p>the thing is - even if you do a vaers search and take the over 60s out of equation and then when reading the descriptions take the already very sick with grain of salt (my question is why are they getting something that affects immune system so severely in frist place)  the patterns are disturbing...  and pretty clear.  the argument it is all made up is bs too.  you have to sign off under penalty of law many times and there is also a  review step...  delusional those who have taken vaccine.....  and believe in it and all the bs...</p>

        <p>I noticed a huge change in NPR after the Acorn kerfuffle.  A lot of funding was taken away after that.  During one presidential campaign, they actively ignored Ron Paul and disconnected callers who brought him up.  The 2016 campaign was the lynch pin for me.  During their fundraising in the Fall, I remember them saying "Let us interpret the news for you."</p>

        <p>&rt;   They did a segment basically saying that the VAERS database is bullshit and that the numbers are unreliable because antivaxers lodge fake reports. </p>
<p>They conveniently left out the bit that it's a Federal crime and a Felony to file false VARES reports.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I support prosecuting any of these jokers to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>But they are correct in a way, VARES is bullshit, if that Harvard study was correct and only a small portion of actual events get recorded.  So, it could be worse than reported.</p>

        <p>welcome to the dark side, Han.</p>
<p>i've been in your shoes since last summer. in my office, we can't visit a lot of sites, so my listening is limited to NPR, local news and weather, and a classical station they haven't blocked yet.  i'm now restricted to WTOP and WETA (actually better off for it, but YMMV).</p>
<p>last June, after the George Floyd riots, our local station ran some BS story about how <a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/06/08/even-in-a-pandemic-who-believes-that-public-protests-are-important/">it's FINE and GOOD to protest racial injustice and okay to gather in large groups and socialize and scream and shout</a>, but it's BAD and EVIL to protest economic shutdowns because LoCkDoWnS sAvE lIvEs OkAy?? WhY dO YoU hAtE gRaNdMa???</p>
<p>then they ran some BS headline like, "<a href="https://wamu.org/story/20/07/06/d-c-has-not-seen-a-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-linked-to-protests-city-says/">it's okay to not ask covid-19 positive people if they've participated in BLM rallies or tried to burn down Lafayette Square, because the 'Rona knows if you're marching in the name of SOCIO-ECONOMIC JUSTICE or if you're just a selfish jerk who wants to go to bars!</a>"</p>
<p>oh and if i hear ONE MORE TIME that COVID-19 is Trump's fault, i'm going to lose my goddamn mind. they refuse to report the truth on the origin of the virus, and they refuse to ask any questions. <a href="https://wamu.org/story/21/06/17/the-mystery-of-the-origins-of-the-pandemic-can-it-be-solved/">guess we'll just take China's word for it!</a></p>
<p>p.s. still livid that protesters literally lit Lafayette Square on fire, burned down a restroom, nearly burned down historic St John's Church, and forced the President to evacuate to a bunker, all while the journos flirted with the mob. my city was on FIRE for DAYS and the local news media sat on it, twiddled their thumbs, and said Orange Man BAD. I GET IT YOU DON'T LIKE HIM WHO DOES BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO STORM THE WHITE HOUSE COULD WE GET SOME PERSPECTIVE HERE??!!</p>

        <p>&rt;the death numbers are inflated because so many old people get the vaccine and they probably were just ready to die anyway. WTAF!?!</p>
<p>This. I get this on other coronavirus subs. If someone dies from vaccine it is anecdotal and they probably were going to die soon anyway. But fuck if a 100 year old in a nursing home dies with covid then it was 100% covid and nothing else. Then they are all sad that this 100 y.o dies from covid. But the 30 y.o dying with vaccine then it is just shrugging shoulders.</p>

        <p>NPR used to lean left up to about 2014. After that, something (or perhaps someone) entered the political arena and caused lots of people to lose their minds. Since then, NPR has leaned harder and harder. About the time covid broke, they fell over completely.</p>

        <p>Isn't it the job of journalists to, you know, actually investigate stuff?  Not just brush things aside and assume everything is ok?  </p>
<p>The VAERS reports are off the charts, so this is either:</p>
<p>1) A concerted effort by an organized group to make false reports to undermine these vaccines</p>
<p>2) A suspiciously large number of disconnected individuals making false reports for various individual reasons</p>
<p>3) The deadliest vaccine in history, by far</p>
<p>Shouldn't journalists be interested in ANY of these options?  Each one of those things seems like a big story that you would want to understand and would capture the public interest.  If there truly is a shadowy cabal of "anti-vaxxers" making fake reports by the thousands, I dunno, maybe go out and <em>find out who they are?</em>  Isn't that the job of journalist?</p>

        <p>I feel you. I listened to CBC radio my whole life (Canada’s state media corp). I have watched them decline during Covid into a pure propaganda outlet. It has been jaw-dropping. I still listen more mornings for a few minutes, and it’s fear porn mixed with a huge glob of obvious narrative control.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the club. N PR was my main listen until 2015. Then I saw how they treated trump versus Hillary, and how they would cover trump speeches. </p>
<p>I watched one of the first Trump rallies live, then the next AM listens to NPR( commute to work) and it was insane how much they twisted his words, took out of context and just found things that weren’t there. They clearly had an idea of what they wanted to report and did that, not report the truth. I can see  now, they deserve zero tax dollars.</p>

        <p>You're just noticing it late. I figured it out \~15 years ago when they were telling everyone that "social security is broken" and wouldn't allow callers on that talked about lifting the cap as a solution... And when they would lie to get through the call screener, they would quickly say, "Everyone knows that-" --- hang up on them --- and then change the subject.</p>
<p>After I heard that pattern repeatedly I realized NPR is as compromised as any other mainstream news source.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it would be good if they didn't have to rely on corporate sponsors but the cuts to their funding under Trump and Obama kind of forced it to happen. Hopefully that changes but old Joe is about as neoliberal as they come.</p>

        <p>I stopped listening to npr after moving from a red state to am extremely left leaning state. They straight up wouldn't get donations in Texas if they ran the same npr that runs in  St. Louis. It's literally just propaganda, all of it.
They completely changed prairie home companion from this amazing show to "another hour of leftist propaganda".</p>
<p>I was the odd one out,  a Democrat in Texas my whole life,  thanks to my mothers influence (she was born in st louis). After actually moving to the st Louis area and seeing what a "great" job democrats have been doing with the city in the decades they have been in control, it jaded me bad.</p>

        <p>From NPR, "It's good for doctors and patients to be aware that there might be a connection between the messenger RNA vaccines and heart inflammation, and to report to their pediatrician anything they see in that first week of vaccination. But it is also important, the CDC notes, to recognize that even if this does turn out to be an extremely rare side effect of the vaccine, 'most patients who received care responded well to medicine and rest quickly felt better.' And the serious risks of COVID-19 -even for healthy young people- outweigh the risks of any possible side effects from the vaccine"</p>
<p>So you gotta take more medicine to treat the symptoms of the drug that is supposed to reduce the symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>I don't know how they can say this shit is safe and then say that they basically don't know what the side effects might be in the same sentence.</p>

        <p>They started leaning hard left WAY before the coronavirus.  As soon as it was clear that Donald Trump was going to be the Republican nominee in 2016, that is when NPR started their hard slide off the left side of the mountain and into the valley of leftist misinformation and half-truths.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the club. N PR was my main listen until 2015. Then I saw how they treated trump versus Hillary, and how they would cover trump speeches. </p>
<p>I watched one of the first Trump rallies live, then the next AM listens to NPR( commute to work) and it was insane how much they twisted his words, took out of context and just found things that weren’t there. They clearly had an idea of what they wanted to report and did that, not report the truth. I can see  now, they deserve zero tax dollars.</p>

        <p>This isn't new.  In 2003 they turned all squishie around the subject of the invasion of Iraq.  Super softball towards the Bush administration because they were afraid of the 9/11 backlash.</p>
<p>(By the way, if you want a parallel to how liberals are acting now, just look to 2003 when seemingly smart and sane conservatives literally thought that Saddam Hussein had caused 9/11 and we had to invade Iraq for revenge.)</p>
