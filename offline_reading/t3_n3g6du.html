    <strong>So I got my text message to book in for a vaccine....</strong>
    <p><p>I don't really know what to do. I'm honestly surprised - here in England they do it by age order and I thought it wouldn't be my turn until maybe summer. Last time I checked they were doing 45+ so I thought I had more time. Guess they're faster than I thought! (I'm 38)</p>
<p>I don't really need the vaccine - I have no underlying conditions, I'm generally healthy. I'm not obese, perhaps slightly overweight but I'm trying to fix that. I think that the risk of a side effect from the vaccine is probably low, but I also think me having serious issues after potential Covid infection would be also really low. </p>
<p>I'm just not sure because they're talking about vaccine passports to get into places like restaurants or airplanes. I'm not planning to travel anywhere in the foreseeable future but at some point I probably will. I just don't want to miss out on things. My partner who's 50 has had his first dose. </p>
<p>I have little kids and I'm not going anywhere without them anyway and they certainly won't be vaccinated. England won't vaccine people under 18. Not sure how that's going to work because if they will require a vaccine passport from the grown ups, will they just let kids in anyway? I just don't really know what to do.</p></p>

<p>A vaccine passport is a really dystopian overreaction.  If that's what they're turning things into I'd rather not play.</p>

        <p>I think this is exactly what I need to do. "Proactively obedient" is the perfect way to put it, actually. If vaccine passport does happen, I'm sure I'll figure something out there and then. I won't worry about it for now.</p>

        <p>My college was all-online this year (what a waste it was) but still, they started tracking me through my cell phone and kept sending reminders not to leave my house and how they apparently know if I do. At first, I was like, yeah right, but literally if I would leave my house it would send me a warning message. In case you're wondering what totalitarian country I'm in, I live in the freaking US. I would get constant warning texts, and even when I didn't leave the house, I'd get "friendly (eyeroll) reminders." I couldn't even just block them because it was a different number every time. My friend's college, also online, was even worse. They went door to door checking to make sure you're home. I just threw my cell phone out and now I only use a landline, which I much prefer anyway. I'd like to see those idiots track me on my rotary phone.</p>

        <p>Get it, any small risk you take by getting the vaccine is heavily outweighed by the risks of even mild COVID. Plus do you want to be in bed for 2 weeks with a shitty cough and fever when we have a 80-95% (depending which one it is) effective vaccine offered to you?</p>

        <p>And don't you do the same? You keep terrible diseases spreading around getting people sick. If it wasn't for antivax morons like you we could have had polio eliminated by now but no instead it still circulates in Afghanistan because the taliban views vaccines as the devil's weed.</p>

        <p>Lol vaccines prevent you from getting diseases, that's how they've always worked. I believe in this radical concept called choice and taking care of yourself. Maybe you should try one of them sometime. It's amazing to see the lengths you go to demonize and dehumanize people like me, very interesting. I wonder why you have so much anger and hatred in your heart...</p>
<p>We should debate on discord sometime, it would be a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>Sigh.... interesting how they don't respond to an invitation for real discussion... it's almost like they know they won't win in a debate with me 🤭 oh well, it's still funny to see you spout your hatred and anger, along with your delusions and insanity. Let me know if you'd like to have a conversation! 😋</p>
