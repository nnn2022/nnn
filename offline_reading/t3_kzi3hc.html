    <strong>RE: Roman Barber, the Canadian MP who got fired</strong>
    <p><p>...was he instructed by Ford to do, what he did?</p>
<p>How can he fuck up the IFRs six months into them being public (he quotes the CDC) by a factor of 100? He claims the IFR for Covid-19 is 0.054% for those over 70, but it's actually a ratio, not a percentage. It is actually 5.4%, and we've known this for quite some time now.</p>
<p>That little mistake costs him the rest of his credibility.</p>
<p>It's such an amateur mistake, that I seriously have to ask: Was he instructed by Ford to be the fall-guy? Was he instructed to pull-off a scheme to make the lockdown skeptics lose all credibility, and to strengthen the pro-lockdown agenda by implying only "fools who can't do basic math" are among our ranks?</p>
<p>You kinda wish he'd never had written that letter, and call me a conspiracy nut, but I'm starting to believe that that's precisely the reason it got written in the first place.</p></p>

        <p>I think he made a mistake in good faith. He just needed to remove the percentage icon. The chart itself was correct and copied exactly from the CDC table.</p>
<p>The reason I say this is because he seems to be quite an effective voice on his Twitter account here https://mobile.twitter.com/Roman_Baber</p>
<p>What about turning the conspiracy theory on its head and asking if he was assigned this task by Ford, but that it is really to get the media talking about the harm of lockdowns?  I think Ford is stuck because of the media.</p>
