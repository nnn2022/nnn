    <strong>World Medical Association President, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, just told that masks will never go away. Even after the pandemic masks have to stay. And regularly re-vaccinations will there be too.</strong>
    <p><p>During an interview with the German "Europamagazin", World Medical Association President Frank Ulrich Montgomery, just told the following:</p>
<p>&rt;When asked whether he saw a point in time when Corona could be viewed as a completely normal disease, that the point had been reached when 85 percent of the population had been immunized through vaccination and going through the disease . “But we will never get rid of Corona again. In certain situations we will always have to wear masks, wash our hands, keep our distance and we will have to re-vaccinate regularly, as we know from the flu,” he added.</p>
<p>If you ask yourself "did i not read that name before somewhere?". Yes. It is the guy from this thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nvz3nh/new_normal_in_germany_part_16x_the_world_medical/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nvz3nh/new_normal_in_germany_part_16x_the_world_medical/</a> A few weeks ago there was an interview and the highlight was the following Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Q: "What consequences would that have  in the second half of the year if we don't come to a vaccination rate  of 80 percent, which you just mentioned?"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A:  "Then we will have to introduce Lockdown measures again. There is  already a little bit of talk in the background about the impending  fourth wave in autumn."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So to summarise: Lockdowns will come, re-vaccinations will come and masks will stay forever. </p>
