    <strong>Customer service is dead. Courtesy of the 'Rona...</strong>
    <p><p>It seems that businesses have adopted a completely garbage attitude (even more than usual) towards customers of late. Business trends that were visible post 9/11 have really become really open now - anyone remember how, in the aftermath of the Twin Towers, War on Terror "security theatre" was used as the go-to excuse for piss-poor service, lineups, removal of amenities, and a general attitude of "Fuck you, customer. What are ya gonna do about it?"</p>
<p>The best example of this was the constant performance art of some bored-looking company or government drone throwing common-sense out the window before your eyes while intoning "You're being rude, sir. Do you want to fly today?"</p>
<p><em>The die was cast for you - the customer - to be grateful for having the awesome "privilege" of taking it up the ass, and being expected to say "thank you" for it.</em></p>
<p>Fast-forward twenty years, and now it's the 'Rona used for this.</p>
<p>- Cut staff. Or at least those that assist customers. I have no doubt that HR, legal, and public relations departments are still fully-manned.</p>
<p>- Longer lineups and waits. Close off self-checkouts, remove the ability to print things like tickets/boarding passes yourself. We need the revenue saved for more spy cameras and rent-a-cops to enforce mask rules!</p>
<p>- Close amenities like washrooms, bar seating, block off benches. Make the customer "grab his shit and get out".</p>
<p>- Bullshit lineups for stupid temperature scans, and "20 questions" at the door. Imagine what it will be like when it's "Show me your vaccine papers, please!"</p>
<p>- Disguising information phishing as "We need your name, address, phone number, and boob size for ~~targeted advertising~~ contact tracing purposes".</p>
<p>- A general attitude of "You, the customer, will conform to what I, the business owner want. Not the 'old normal' way, where it was my job as a business owner to meet your needs."</p>
<p>Disagree with any of this? Then it's "You are being rude, sir. You are violating our Coronavirus safety rules. I'm going to have to ask you to leave." And they have the full backing of government goons to behave this way.</p>
<p>Fuck 'em. They can all go out of business for all I care.</p></p>

        <p>COVID has become a bulletproof excuse for bad customer service. Even when you're on hold, you hear " due to the coronavirus pandemic, wait times may be extended". Bro you're a car insurance company</p>

        <p>Seen this everywhere. Airlines are the worst. They don't even serve food now or do anything. Flight attendants are literally making easy money doing 1/4 of the work they used to. Same will indoor dining pretty much gone in 80% of the country zero effort to open it back up because that means cleaning the dining room again, and dealing with customers as regular people and not disease vectors.</p>
