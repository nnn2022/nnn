    <strong>Discussion about vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>Like the title says, this is meant to be a catch-all thread for the sub to discuss the upcoming vaccines. All viewpoints are welcome here, whether you can’t wait to get it so this shit can be over or think it’s a conspiracy to sterilize people or implant 5G-powered microchips. (I’m not making fun of people who believe that and encourage others not to, and I even welcome those who are anti-vaccine across the board as I’m interested to hear why. I just want to see what the overall views on this sub are regarding this topic.)</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t believe in the more speculative theories such as the above, but I still don’t plan on getting one any time soon. I’m not anti-vax in general, but due to the rushed timeline, the fact that mRNA vaccines are a brand-new technology and the financial incentives for the companies involved I have serious safety concerns. And I CERTAINLY don’t think they should be mandatory, for anyone under any circumstances.</p></p>

        <p>Pharmacist that won’t be getting it. The virus has a 99.9% survival rate, the vaccine is rushed and untested, we don’t know the long term side effects from the vaccine, and it won’t even prevent you from spreading it, so what’s the point? It’s not worth the potential side effects from the vaccine</p>

        <p>Yeah, from the AZ vaccine only... Nothing from Pfizer and Moderna's which are ahead (so far) even then, there is not enough evidence for your claim. We just don't have enough data to prove or DISPROVE that yet</p>

        <p>I won’t be taking it. I grew up in the period where a lot of young girls were harmed by the HPV vaccine and I’m not willing to roll the dice on an experimental vaccine for a virus I’ve already survived (was a long-hauler who recovered completely in late May). I’m very much pro-medical freedom so I’m bracing for all the things that make life worth living they’ll try to bar us from if we don’t vaccinate.</p>

        <p>I don’t like masks, but the difference is you can take it off any time. You can’t get something out of your body once it’s been injected. I’m not as anti mask as some people on this sub (I am anti mandate and think it should be a personal choice, I know some people have a harder time with wearing them than I do for a plethora of reasons and I respect that) but I do think there’s a less than zero chance that masks are being used as a way to condition people into doing something they don’t want to do in order to participate in society. The next step being mandatory vaccination.</p>
<p>Edit: off topic but I like your username and agree :)</p>

        <p>I agree that’s it’s worse than masks. I’m anti mask mandate and hate the harassment that has come with them and I think it’s escalating. They want too much.Masks outside, masks in a difficult exercise class. I have a hard time wearing one but I do to do some things I need to do. Other than that I don’t go out because of masks. It’s hard. I really hope your right that people controlling who comes inside somewhere doesn’t escalate. I hope I’m wrong but I never imagined any of this.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear you’ve recovered. I’m curious to learn more about what happened with the HPV vaccine. How were they harmed? And was it Gardasil? Because I’ve had that one. Nothing happened to me, but I’m not at all saying I don’t believe you, maybe I got lucky.</p>

        <p>I think vaccine ingredients need to be listed on the insert. Every personal care, cosmetic and food product lists ingredients. If I get to know what’s in my toothpaste which is only going to be in my mouth for a few minutes how does it make sense that I don’t also get to know what’s getting injected into my body? I know they say it’s because “trade secrets” but screw that, couldn’t a shampoo or makeup manufacturer make the same claims about “trade secrets”? Why are vaccines held to an entirely different standard? Sorry for the rant, it just doesn’t make sense.</p>

        <p>Vaccines do have an insert that lists everything contained, doctors/nurses that give you a vaccine have to show it to you if you ask. No one really asks, and if you do, the doctor could just kick you out or lie and claim that they don't have that info. Happened to my sister, she asked to see it and they asked her to leave</p>

        <p>I’m not being coerced to take medicine I don’t need. That’s already happened to me and I have long term health problems from it. I’m fully expecting to eventually not be allowed inside buildings and not have access to medical care , exercise, concerts, travel. This will probably be the future because most people think if businesses mandate it that’s fine because it’s not the government doing it.</p>

        <p>I will not get the vaccine under any circumstances. Could it be chipped? Poisonous? I don't know. But I have to question the eagerness of most world governments to vaccinate every citizen for a supposed disease that isn't very deadly. They obviously have an agenda, and I think it goes deeper than making money.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it, but if this vaccine hurts people, and it will, Trump will be blamed mercilessly. </p>
<p>And rightfully so. I support him, I really do. But this is playing with fire and he should have continued to call this a hoax; like he did right in the beginning. </p>
<p>Maybe he knew he had to play politics with this thing, but the vaccine can’t be good enough yet. Or maybe it is. </p>
<p>Just don’t expect me to be anywhere near the front of any vaccine line. My immune system will suffice for now.</p>

        <p>The pharma companies that make this rushed it through, made a lot of money, and are exempt from liability. Though except for the rush job, this is par for the course with vaccines released since 1986. mRNA vaccines have never been approved before, and they approved one with a fraction of the short-term testing and NONE of the long-term that other shots, even post-1986, have had to go through. Hell, no.</p>
<p>I still think it's a money and power scheme. It's not a trick to get you to inject something that will hurt you. It's more that they don't give a shit if it hurts you or not as long as they make money and get the go-ahead to force you to use even more of their products.</p>

        <p>I am terrified. I don't want it, I'm scared if I don't get it I won't be able to do certain things...maybe like work? I can't afford to live without my job..maybe I can somehow forge vaccination papers? I'm just scared, this vaccine was rushed..I do not trust it.</p>
<p>Edit: With all that being said, this reminds me of how my mindset was when covid first started. Every bad thing I thought would happen then, has not happened..so I hope this is the same..</p>

        <p>I hear you. I’ve been up at night worrying about this. I have a bad feeling. Can you imagine at the beginning of this thinking you wouldn’t be allowed anywhere without a face covering long term?  Most of the things I was worried about with the covid response did happen.</p>

        <p>I worried about some pretty extreme things. Martial law, everywhere including grocery stores and gas stations closing, government sending food to individual households and one day just stopping. Masks and social distancing are bad enough but in my opinion it's not exactly apocalyptic. The state I live in is pretty much back to normal, aside from a few things here and there. I have a boss at work who is totally against this crap as well, he wouldn't fire us for not getting a vaccine but it might not be his call either..</p>

        <p>I’m glad that things are back to normal in your state more or less and that things are better than your thought they would be. Where I am you get yelled at if you don’t wear a mask in the woods and most small businesses are closing because the governor is a narcissist who won’t let people live.</p>

        <p>Do I believe the scientists working on it are actually doing their best ? Probably.. but are they also being <em>majorly</em> pressured or even forced to work outside their comfort of capabilities and/or to rush and skimp ? Very likely.</p>
<p>I don't trust a vaccine that is supposedly 0-100 within a year's time. That isn't possible and safe at the same time, period. Just isn't.. especially when there's a supposed huge panic about it making everyone (who actually cares) feel major pressure to ignore big red flags in favor of "saving the world".</p>
<p>I also believe it's nothing but a control tactic for those high above the people making it and they will, if they can, end up coercing everyone into getting it and those who still resist may or may not be downright physically forced...but at the very least shunned from modern society as a whole and not be allowed to do, well, anything. No bank accounts, groceries, utility hookups, education, work opportunity, drivers license, birth certificate... Hell they may just stay stealing kids and putting them into orphanages to brainwash them and adopt them out.</p>
<p>Obviously that's all <em>worst case scenario shit hits the fan</em> talk.. but do I think it's their <em>eventual</em> endgame whether they actually accomplish it or not ? Yeah. Absolutely... How far will they get before the people stand up and literally kill them in resistance ? I do not know.</p>
<p>How many will turn against the resistors out of either fear of association or truly believing the propaganda ? A lot, I am afraid.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's just a prop.</p>

        <p>This will be a completely new type of vaccine, developed for a disease they haven't been able to fully isolate. Safety tests have been rushed or skipped altogether. In Ireland they said that information on the safety of this vaccine will be known after the first few months of giving it to the population! In England, they are developing new software to deal with the "predicted large volume of adverse reactions".</p>
<p>Regardless how i feel about other vaccines, giving (or even worse, forcing) a rushed, dangerously experimental vaccine for a disease i have as good a chance to recover from as the flu, to me is criminal and amounts to assault. I can't believe anyone would want to take it, let alone be among the first!</p>
