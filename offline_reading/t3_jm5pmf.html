    <strong>Last night</strong>
    <p><p>I went to a huge Halloween party. Had to have been at least 500 people there. No one wore masks. No one social distanced. It felt normal. I finally felt alive for the first time in months.</p></p>

        <p>Are you in the US? My parents worked in diplomacy, so I lived in many different countries throughout my life, I have friends all over the world. I can assure you that in most of the world, people are not buying all these lies and none sense. The world is massively rejecting masks, social distancing, lockdowns, etc. Be hopeful buddy, I really feel we are winning. It's just that the US has the biggest and strongest media propaganda system on earth. Don' buy their crap, I can feel they are desperate. I think the <strong>CoronaHOAX</strong> is going to be their doom.</p>

<p>Can you? As a Dutch guy this is not what I see at all. Europe is almost entirely on lockdown. Even Sweden, hailed for their "lax" approach, still <a href="https://www.krisinformation.se/en/hazards-and-risks/disasters-and-incidents/2020/official-information-on-the-new-coronavirus/restriktioner-och-forbud">bans gatherings</a> and events with more than 50 people and applies social distancing rules.</p>

        <p>Hey, so how is that Proof of Germany or any other western European country rejecting masks and social distancing? I can go to my kiosk and take a picture of people in masks, social distancing and with a clear sign that masks are mandatory. Hell, if I say it's for a dunce that makes shit up, I bet I can get one person to hold a sign with your username saying you're a dunce, all in German.</p>
<p>Can you in any capacity show all of us how majority of the world is rejecting those measures?</p>

        <p>First of all, the fact that you need to insult me just because you have a different opinion, proves how wrong, childish and immature you are. Try getting an education first. </p>
<p>Secondly, who said anything about proof? Try getting some reading comprehension lessons, it will suit you well. What I say is what I see all around me. Some people reject the restrictions. May more comply but are highly suspicious about everything, and their patience is growing thin. </p>
<p>The only people that fully support all these measures are the KARENS of the world, who can't stand a different opinion, who react with childish insults when they hear something that doesn't fit their narrative. </p>
<p>So chill, Karen, you don't need to get triggered here. Relax.</p>

        <p>&rt;Are you in the US? My parents worked in diplomacy, so I lived in many different countries throughout my life, I have friends all over the world. I can assure you that in most of the world, people are not buying all these lies and none sense. The world is massively rejecting masks, social distancing, lockdowns, etc. </p>
<p>Well, you can assure us, but how? Your word means quite literally nothing here without any actual proof of what you're saying. For all we know, you're a dunce in a basement, not a kid of diplomats with friends all over the world. So I'll ask again, <em>how</em> can you assure us the world is massively rejecting masks, social distancing and lockdowns, especially since you live in Germany for the last 6 years, given that Kanzlerin Merkel literally gave a speech about a soft lockdown? HOw can you assure us the world is rejecting masks, when in <em>EVERY STORE, OFFICIAL BUILDING</em> any basically any other establishment where people meet, you <em>HAVE</em> to wear masks? Not maybe, not "if you want", you literally <strong>HAVE</strong> to or you will not be served and asked to leave - if you don't, police will be called (as I've witnessed in Aldi in June, for example) and you <em>will</em> be removed and fined afaik 150 EUR.</p>
<p>So how can you assure us? Please, do assure us.</p>
<p>As for insults, hell, dunce is the nicest descriptor I could find for people like you - namely lying assholes that make shit up about themselves and their parents and when called out, there's radio silence. My english isn't the best, so there might have been a better descriptor of your kind, but I couldn't find one.</p>
<p>&rt;What I say is what I see all around me. Some people reject the restrictions, I've been part of massive protests showing discontent. </p>
<p>What you said, and what prompted my response, is not what you said here. What you said previously is verbatim "the world is massively rejecting masks, social distancing and lock downs". Not <em>some people</em>. You said specifically <strong>THE WORLD</strong>. See how you're trying to weasel out of your own words when called out? That's cute. How about that reading comprehension now? Maybe you have dementia and don't actually remember what you wrote? No worries, it's quoted here.</p>
<p>&rt; insult me just because you have a different opinion, </p>
<p>That's not your opinion - you're quite literally lying, which can be proven by using google and checking on world leaders announcing lockdown in France, Germany etc. It's not an opinion any more than "gravity isn't real" is one. There's reality, which can be objectively proven with actual speeches from world leaders, and then there's your lies, which you're trying to sell as opinions. I didn't insult you because of your opinions, I insulted you because you're a lying asshole that runs when confronted about what he said.</p>
<p>&rt;The only people who fully support all these measres, the vast minority, are the KARENS of the world</p>
<p>Mate you're literally lying through your teeth, and I have already stated how <em>ANYONE</em> with internet access can prove it. Do you not comprehend that?</p>
<p>&rt;who can't stand a different opinion, who react with childish insults when they hear something that doesn't fit the official narrative </p>
<p>"The official narrative" as in, literally reality? Yeah, when you make shit up in hopes of someone taking you seriously for the first time in your life, and the reality quickly and efficiently contradicts you, of course I'll say you're a dunce. Why wouldn't I? I'm not the one making up lies to make my life more interesting, mr diplomat's kid.</p>

        <p>And in Australia, one of the countries that has dealt with this pandemic most successfully, the opposite to what you claim has happened.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were implement, travellers were isolated, people are wearing masks and are respecting social distancing whether in shops or on public transport and guess what happened - we have single figure numbers of new cases across the entire country and the majority of those are returned travellers in isolation. New Zealand were even more successful in how they treated the virus.</p>
<p>Countries that have rejected the guidance of the medical community are now seeing transmission rates that were modelled. In the case of the US, you never recovered from the first or second wave and you are charging straight towards breaking records in numbers of new cases.</p>

        <p>Spoken like someone with zero understanding of the symptoms of COVID-19, its mortality and its sequelae.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why the first wave saw a greater mortality than the second wave: demographics, treatment, virus subtype, underestimate of first wave infections but ultimately this pandemic has seen more than 1.2M people die that otherwise would not have and you would have to be either ignorant or callous to say that this was "jack shit". In a world seeing evermore increasing levels of infections, taking the ostrich approach and pretending everything is fine will end in disaster.</p>

        <p>Remember last time in late June when we were breaking daily case records and there were no overwhelmed hospitals or mass graves or massive spikes in death toll two weeks later anywhere in our entire country?</p>
<p>Yeah I remember that. It's almost like a spike in cases for a virus with a .2% IFR that the majority of people end up asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms won't shatter the fabric of society or lead to an abnormal amount of excess deaths.</p>
<p>You know what does shatter the fabric of society? With mass unemployment, poverty, starvation and homelessness? All things that shorten lifespans, lead to low quality of life and lack of access to healthcare. Lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I will agree that second wave deaths in the US peaked at roughly 60% of wave 1 deaths despite there being 2.5x as many cases and can think of the following reasons below. That said, the peak rate of deaths in wave two as a 7 day average was also 2.5x greater than the lows seen after wave one (1)</p>
<ul>
<li>The NY/wave one infection rate was actually much larger and testing did not detect the full number of infected individuals - the true figure could have been 10x higher than thought</li>
<li>Medical treatment has improved so deaths are now less frequent - Dexamethasone for example</li>
<li>There is a new sub-type of the virus that is both more infectious and less lethal (2) - giving a higher total of infections and a lower percentage of deaths </li>
<li>The demographics of other cases are much younger with an associated lower mortality</li>
<li>There is a longer lag between infection and hospitalisation/death so we are yet to see the true death rate for wave 3</li>
</ul>
<p>IFR by itself does not take into account all other sequelae so does not represent the true impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have shown how effective lockdowns can be but there is a massive difference between those two countries and the US in their approach. Australia created an enormous social safety net with the job keeper and job maker payments to prevent exactly the issues you call out - poverty, homelessness, unemployment and starvation - let alone access to publicly funded healthcare. The US social and health systems are practically broken and this shows how flawed they are when a brief lockdown causes society to implode.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that well written response. I personally dont anticipate this current rise in daily cases being anything worth worrying about. As you say, death rates have declined (not that they were very high in the first place) and treatments have improved. </p>
<p>&rt;IFR by itself does not take into account all other sequelae so does not represent the true impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>There is no proof that a substantial amount of people infected will experience long term side effects. </p>
<p>The measures taken in Victoria (most of AU is nowhere near the levels of draconian as Victoria) and New Zealand are also not sustainable or even likely a good idea and they certainly aren't comparable to the US. I would definitely stop short of saying "theyre proven to work." At some point, they're going to have to open back up to the rest of the world without forcing every visitor to quarantine for 2 weeks. This opens the door for covid to slip into a population with no immunity built up. The social systems you speak of are fantastic, I wish we had similar in the US. Problem being, with the circumstances of lockdowns, they are not going to last long term without resulting in hyperinflation. It violates basic principles of capitalist economies (which AU and NZ are) to provide so much to the population without being able to collect taxes. Even in socialist economies, those things are unsustainable without allowing the working class to work. The government can not work magic to make things happen and will ultimately fail if they excessively print money to make ends meet. So at this rate, AU and NZ will not be able to provide these social saftey nets if lockdowns are dragged on too long. And cutting themselves off from the international community would be economically devastating. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I would say the response in Victoria and NZ is as over the top as could be. Covid is not a big threat to humanity. Not even close. It's going to end up being another strain of the seasonal flu if immunity turns out to be short lived and life will move on. The damage of lockdowns will be done and hopefully it wont take too long to recover from great depression levels of economic collapse.</p>

        <p>I'm assuming that you are in the US?</p>
<p>With yields on government bonds being so low I would argue that now is exactly the time to take on debt. The 10 year T-Bill is at 0.88% so QE is not required. There are few things more capitalistic than taking on debt to invest in your country and generate a return greater than the NPV of your coupon payments.</p>
<p>I'm also slightly confused by your comment on lockdowns as a long term solution as that is not what I am saying. I live in Australia and have a very good understanding of how they were implemented and what they did. The Melbourne lockdown was longer than hoped for but look at the results. Remote working where possible and increased heath requirements and regulations for those that do have to physically be present to work was a key part of these - I was technically classified as an essential worker.</p>
<p>The long term solution is not herd immunity either since re-infections have been demonstrated to occur and it is not another strain of the seasonal flu. Not only is it a completely different phylum of virii but the mortality and how infectious it is is far greater. We will beat this thing with a combination of vaccines, a change in our lifestyle and a subtype that is not as lethal.</p>

        <p>Two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>When you say, "We will beat this thing," what exactly do you mean? What is your specific end goal for the world?</li>
<li>What exactly does, "a change in our lifestyle" entail? What specific changes do you think are necessary or appropriate? </li>

<p>It's easy to talk about strategies and success when you haven't even defined what success is. It is also easy to trivialize harmful restrictions by calling them by another name.</p>

        <p>Same here. My neighborhood doesn't have many kids, but I know about 5 or 6 families that do have kids. I will say, everyone had tables out and you could just walk up and grab the candy, but people still tried. About half the adults wore masks, the other half didn't. It was refreshing, making me think not everyone is a fucking sheep. This was in a suburb in MD outside DC, too.</p>
<p>All my friends though (late 20s to early 30s, so super low risk) are all still scared shitless of this thing that has a 99.98% survival rate for our age group. It's quite sad... </p>

        <p>I was surprised how many parties happened last night and how many bars were packed. And I saw some of the staunchest lockdown supporters I know at parties. It was great. I went to one...many people wore masks when they weren’t drinking/eating/taking pics...which wasn’t a lot of the time. </p>

        <p>Parties everywhere. </p>
<p>As an aside, we went to a fall festival (like a farmer's market with trick or treating) and there were 1,000 people there. Many not wearing masks. TONS of Trump supporters (in the Seattle area no less). </p>
<p>As another aside, if Trump gets his base like before then the people sick of kids not being in class plus the people sick of riots plus the people sick of lockdowns etc Trump might win in a landslide.</p>

        <p>Went to a party too. First time since all this shitshow began. It was the most odd feeling,like, yes, beling alive. I don’t think I’ve felt so happy in months. I’m not sure I’m an introvert after all..</p>

        <p>I only had a few trick or treaters but that’s cause my neighborhood doesn’t have lots of young kids    My cousins from Texas came up with their little kids they had a blast no masks or anything too when they went to trick or treat.  Then I went to a  party with my fiancé. Good time, no masks and good amount of people.  We really stuck it to Fuher Murphy</p>

        <p>I had a small get-together at my house, outside. At one point, two cops rode up on bikes. They didn't have masks on. They said hi, commented on the kids' costumes, and rode off. It's nice to live in a small town.</p>

        <p>There was a pretty big Halloween event in my towns downtown last night. It was fucking awesome. And this is in California near the bay area. Normally the event is put on and sanctioned by the city, but this year it was unofficial. Tons of people still out having a great time. Dancing, live music and street performers, bars and restaurants poppin, excellent costumes. Probably 50-60% covid masks, but still awesome to see so many without here in a place that has been very Doomerville since March. Also awesome in general to see so many people out and about having fun after what's been a long fucking year around these parts.</p>
