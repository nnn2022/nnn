    <strong>My advice for the students worried about mandatory vaccines in the Fall</strong>
    <p><p>I know you're in a tight spot right now, the best thing I think you should do is start looking for an internship or co-op opportunity now and take a gap year in the upcoming Fall 2021. That gives you like 8 months to look for a position that would strongly benefit you and help you make money as well as gain experience! It also buys you a ton of time to wait all this madness out. Trust me, nobody knows how long these vaccine mandates are going to last, a lot of people on this sub also think the mandates are temporary scare tactics to get people hopping into the vaccine queue out of fear.</p>
<p>We can't predict the length of these mandates, or even how our world will look like next Summer, what if the fake Variants get out of hand? Will the first covid vaccines even be relevant a year from now or will everyone have boosters? I'm thinking the mandates will eventually be scrapped from history down the line after the universities/colleges and other businesses loses a ton of profit because of all the people who transferred or dropped out or took their dollars elsewhere.</p>
<p>I know it's easy to get caught up in the dystopia we're in, but I strongly believe we are in the middle of a population control program. This will all blow over mark my words, those vaccines are dangerous, a ton of research points to numerous deaths. Over 9000 people in 4 months died from the vaccines so far in America according to VAERS and remember only about 1% of the deaths even get reported, the deaths are increasing exponentially now. In the coming years, I truly believe the vaccinated will die on mass of heart complications sadly, and I'll leave you off with a source for that. Once the deaths of the vaccinated start, the gig is up, the mandates are off, people will rebel when their families are harmed and we'll enter a new era.</p>

        <p>Also, the VAERs data now says up to 11,000 Americans have died due to the vaccine.</p>
<p>When I wrote this just 5 days ago, it was only about 9000.</p>

        <p>Great advice! There is nothing wrong with taking a year off college to work and gain valuable life experience... and what better year than this one?</p>

        <p>Surprisingly level-headed advice on the college situation. Most people have been saying to fight the colleges, almost a guaranteed loss. </p>
<p>I did a similar thing last year due to fear they were going to require the “vaccine” mid semester, and came out a lot wealthier.</p>

        <p>Check out the policy language for UC. By showing proof of vaccination, participants agree to comply with future boosters or repeat vaccinations on a recurring basis and according to CDC recommendations. Diabolical, and I'm hoping illegal. </p>
<p>"Participation: Participation in the COVID-19 Vaccination Program (by providing proof of vaccination or obtaining an approved Exception or Deferral under this policy). Participation is a condition of Physical Presence at any University Location or Program as set forth in this policy. For Covered Individuals who must be vaccinated under this policy, <strong>Participation compliance will require repeat vaccinations or boosters on an annual or recurring basis consistent with FDA-approved labeling and CDC recommendations</strong>."</p>
<p>"FDA approved labeling" refers to laws under U.S. Code &rt; Title 21 &rt; CHAPTER 9 &rt; SUBCHAPTER V that require any medical treatment authorized for emergency medical use to be clearly labeled in regards to how the treatment may be used and administered. </p>
