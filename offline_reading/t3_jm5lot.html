    <strong>Skeptic from my local corona sub</strong>
    <p><p>I copy/pasted this from my local sub:</p>
<p>I struggle Really hard with the covid death numbers. I have known personally 4 people labeled as "covid" deaths, but none of them died from covid symptoms. They had tested positive anywhere from two weeks to a few days before passing, but none of them suffered with any kind of Covid symptoms, none put on ventilators. Of the ones I personally know, two were cancer deaths, in that they had been battling cancer for more than 2 years each. and finally succumbed to it, another one Had a heart attack, not their first, and not even their 2nd. They were very over weight and had had heart complications because of it for years, and the last was over 93 years old Passed in his sleep. Again, 0 covid symptoms. I was talking to our neighbor this morning who just got back from a funeral. she had a nephew that committed suicide, his death was ruled as covid because he had a positive covid test, shortly after which he took a bunch of pills, and never woke up. So out of all the people I personally know who died from "covid" none of them actually died of covid. They did WITH covid, sure, but not FROM covid.</p>
<p>Some other information - I found this site:</p>
<p>https://covidtracking.com/data/state/arizona/hospitalization</p>
<p>Hospitalization numbers. Lets pull them out and do some maths:</p>
<p>Positive cases - 245,962</p>
<p>hospitalizations - 21,424</p>
<p>% of people hospitalized - 8.7%</p>
<p>% of people hospitalized put on ventilators (quick math) about 15% ish.</p>
<p>so 3214 people put on ventilator.</p>
<p>survival rates for people put on ventilators hovers around 67% depending on the site you look at (anywhere from 90-1% mortality rate... most are in the 30% range though so I'm using that number).</p>
<p>So of people hospitalized and then put on a ventilator 1060 passed? (if somebody has better numbers I am more than welcome to seeing them.)</p>
<p>With nearly 6000 dead supposedly from covid... where did the other nearly 5000 people die? did they die before they could be put on ventilators? I know in AZ at least, we never overwhelmed our hospital system, or ran out of available ventilators - are there symptoms of covid that kill you other than filling your lungs with fluid? Does it only kill you if you are already very weak due to other underlying issues? Did they die alone, never treated, or tested? Did they get hospitalized and released? It's not like this illness sneaks up on you, as far as I'm aware, having had it myself, it's like the flu but worse, Fever, chills, hard to breath, IF you have sever symptoms. Most of the people I know who've had it, had very mild symptoms, loss of taste for a few days, Maybe a fever for a few days and a cough. But when you get very sick, you don't just sit there, you go to the doctor, were these people not able to go to the doctor and get treatment? we have the ACA, everybody should have health coverage, right?</p>
<p>I personally know of 0 people who died directly due to covid symptoms. Do you (royal you) know of any who actually died of complications from covid? How old were they? did they have any underlying health issues? did they seek treatment for covid before passing?</p>
<p>I 100% agree that there are some people who are at high risk. My father in law is 76, has Alzheimer's, has an infection from a knee surgery that never healed properly, and has heart and other health issues. You bet your butt we wear new masks, sanitize the heck out of our hands, do fever checks, and if there is any question of ANY illness with our kids, they do not visit grandpa. But this is true regardless of a pandemic. People who are at high risk of covid are at high risk of.... well anything else. My grandpa had a serious accident about 10 years ago, and we've done similar care with visiting him, because a simple cold has nearly killed him a few times. That has been the last 10 years, not just this year.</p>
<p>Anyways, Thanks for any personal information you have, or any hard data you can shed light on that I haven't seen.</p></p>

        <p>It's all a <strong>HOAX</strong> my friend, from the beginning to the end. They are just counting people with the flu (influenza virus) or with colds (coronaviruses and rinoviruses) as COVID-19 cases. Plus the "tests" are known to return over 50% of false positives. <strong>It's all a big global scam.</strong></p>
<p>In my case is the same as you, the people that I indirectly knew who died from "covid-19", actually died over heart attacks and pre-existing illnesses, they all died at home, with no respiratory symptoms of any kind.</p>

        <p>Probably the latter.</p>
<p>The virus is real, it's just not even a portion of the deadliness the media claims it is.</p>
<p>My coworker had it, said it felt like a cold. She was just tired and had some head fog and that was it.</p>

        <p>The media and the government are not exaggerating, <strong>they are OPENLY LYING and also CENSORING anyone that goes against their narrative.</strong> The whole internet is going under the fiercest censoring campaign we have seen in the western countries in history. In Australia they have even arrested people for Facebook posts. Do you find that normal?... <strong>The internet feels like China at this point.</strong> If you think this is just an "exaggeration", I envy your optimism buddy.</p>

        <p><strong>I think the virus itself isn't real.</strong> </p>
<p>I mean, I cannot confirm it, since I don't have a laboratory in my home. But so far, they haven't been able to make it meet Koch's postulates and everything they have been telling us are <strong>complete lies</strong> (the effectiveness of masks, lockdowns, social distancing, etc.) If I know they are lying to me all the time, why would I believe them, even in the smallest thing, when they don't have the scientific confirmation of the virus's existence? <strong>Liars are liars. A hoax is a hoax, from the begging to the end.</strong></p>
<p>Plus, you can clearly see that all the oppression system they are implementing the western countries is highly planed and coordinated. <strong>This has been planned for decades.</strong> Do you think they waited for a "new virus" to appear in order to roll out their schemes? <strong>Check for the 2016 video of the World Economic Forum entitled: "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy"</strong>. It is clear that they have had this planned for many many years.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the CDC confirmed the SARS-Cov-2 virus has not met Koch's postulates yet. Koch's postulates is the only way to scientifically confirm that a virus exists. Not only they haven't been able to do so, but they have lied about it continuously. </p>
