    <strong>This should feel like good news but it doesn't...</strong>
    <p><p>"Boris Johnson planning to remove all restrictions by 19th July" (thanks to Sajid Javid, unlike hypocrite Matt Hancock)</p>
<p>"Biden declaring the US is close to normal at last on July 4th"</p>
<p>I see the rest of social media and even people in real life celebrating (of course with some pessimism from the occasional doomer, but overall the vibe is much brighter compared to this exact time last year), but right now I can't help but think we're standing here before a huge tidal wave is about to hit.</p>
<p>If they are finally letting go of the Covid narrative, then that means that they have the next thing ready to take it's place. Plenty of people on this sub theorize about the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oek8xz/here_we_go_folks_cyber_polygon_the_next_crisis_is/">cyber pandemic that Klaus Schwab promised would make Covid look like a joke</a>. People need to start thinking about what is about to come. "They" didn't work this hard for 18 months to just let it all go. All the constant commercials, restrictions, propaganda, they clearly put A LOT of effort into it, so no fucking way are they just throwing all that away so quickly.</p>
<p>Then also combine that with the fact that the elites are clearly capable of hiding any info they want, like for example Robert Malone (mRNA) being  erased and censored or even the secret changing of "herd immunity" or "anti-vaxxers" definitions, very 1984 style, and yet they allowed the public to see Fauci's leaked emails or even acknowledged the Wuhan lab theory that had been constantly denied over and over until May 2021? <strong>Here's the bottom line. This might seem like a victory, and conspiracy theorists might even feel "vindicated", but thats them playing 4d chess. If they didn't want you to know, you wouldn't. They allowed that info to leak for a reason, they have all the capabilities to hide and erase that if they wanted, as they have demonstrated in the past, time and time again. This is simply the elites widening the prison cell and pretending you're all "free". Their meticulous hands are still in control of the chess board.</strong> </p>
<p>"They" pretty much laughed in everyone's faces when the world leaders gathered during that G7 summit with absolutely no social distancing or covid rules (they only social distanced when the cameras were on) and before anyone here says "but they're vaccinated", well there's still restrictions EVEN FOR the vaccinated in some countries...</p>
<p>Along with how much they've been pushing constant restrictions that make no sense... until May 13, 2021, where it felt like the exact opposite of March 11, 2020, in that the fear propaganda started to subside and the news started becoming overall more optimistic. It seemed that the propaganda had served its purpose and the people behind the curtains got what they wanted, so now they changed their tune on May 13, 2021, similar to March 11, 2020 when it all first started. Very creepy.</p>
<p>So now as the "pandemic" subsides, now's even more important to keep following what the World Economic Forum is up to.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong, and if nothing bad happens, then you're all welcome to laugh and knock the tin foil hat off my head, I'd 100% take that over the dreaded "great reset" actually happening...</p></p>

        <p>If the government call an end to all restrictions on day X,  the sheep will firmly believe that up until that point covid is as deadly as war and after day X you can basically lick each others faces without worry.. If the government want cases and deaths to simply go away, they will and people will praise the vaccine. The problem is that whatever is being planned in the future, they know who the compliant people are. They can lean on these people immediately with threats of what happened last time and they will comply all over again. How easily these people roll over will make easy to push any agendas in the future. What we are going through right now is a massive social experiment to see how easily we can be divided and who is complicit.</p>

        <p>I say that it'll affect Europe and North America the most. It'll be more than just a power cut: it'll wipe out bank accounts, equity/bond/derivatives/commodities markets, shut down transportation, production and entire supply chains. I am expecting a Bronze Age redux for anything from 33 days to 8 weeks. Imagine living close to a nuclear reactor that is going through a 5-stage meltdown!?!?</p>

        <p>At least in the UK, I think it's playing out like last summer.  Oh remember last summer? Less hospitalizations than this summer, zero vaccinations.  The UK government are gaslighting the public, playing the Hokey Cokey - in out in out, shake it all about.  Literally yesterday - as you say - BoJo was saying "no turning back, this is it, freedom forever, let's live with the virus like we live with the flu".  OK.  But wait up - literally hours later, good 'ol SAGE pop-up so utterly predictaby and the likes of the good 'ol Daily Mail saying <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9758739/Sage-warns-freedoms-WEEKS-Boris-Johnson-tells-Britons-NOT-demob-happy.html">Sage warns freedoms may only last for WEEKS amid surging Delta cases surge as Boris Johnson tells Britons NOT to get 'demob happy' when he relaxes (almost) all the rules in 'Big Bang' July 19 reopening</a>.  </p>
<p>By October, hospitalizations will go up <em>because more people die when the weather's cold</em> (shock, horror) and more people will die "with Covid".  Scary charts will be shown in the Daily Mail and we're back to lockdown 7.2 Electric Boogaloo, masks and booster shots.  </p>
<p>I'll eat my hat if it doesn't play out this way...BUT...BUT I 100% take your point that if it doesn't, and really we are at the end of the virus-as-a-means-of-control, then for sure, we'll move onto the next boogeyman.</p>

        <p>Expected behaviour for the "Watchers on the Wall" types...</p>
<p>Yep, opening a bit too fast and liberal all of a sudden. Going from draconian lockdowns to skipping the basic guidelines to full opening. seems a bit strange..</p>
<p>Then seeing provinces and states all have the same timeline...</p>
<p>I'm not letting my guard down and I don't forget the last 12 months of watching my and other's rights and freedoms get trampled on, and the glee of the Cult of the Mask in being enabled to do it.</p>
<p>Canadians taught me in the last year they don't give a flying beaver about their rights or the rights of others, and are now trained to obey.</p>
<p>We're only open not because covid19 is gone, but on the good graces of our benevolent Health Officers, who could just as easily turn around and lock us all down again.. There hasn't been any accountability to them, no checks and balances, no reviews.. THEY WENT 12 MONTHS OF MASK MANDATES UNCHALLENGED and for an indefinite time...</p>
<p>Look at Ford in Ontario. Dude is a little dictator also with no checks and balances. He can keep that province locked down as long as he likes.</p>
