    <strong>Some random thoughts about the psychology of what we are living under.</strong>
    <p><p>I was just listening to a YouTube video where the topic was governors telling people not to get haircuts (but not following their own advice).</p>
<p>It made me think of something. Just as masks are all about making you feel dirty &amp; infected, I think they want you to let your appearance go to further demoralize you and make you feel small. </p>
<p>I recently bought some makeup and got a free lipstick that was normally a pricey item. Then it hit me. They can't sell lipstick because people have to cover their mouth. It will just get all over the inside of the mask. </p>
<p>These people have been studying the human mind and how to get people to comply for a long time. Even just recently, a university was tasked with studying the best "message" (manipulation) to use to convince people to take the covid vaccine. Some of the options were peer pressure, guilt, the greater good, etc. </p>
<p>We don't realize how small things contribute to our mentality. When I was a teenager, I temporary moved in with my dad. I was having behavioral problems and my parents (divorced) thought the change in environment would be good. I had an air mattress on the floor that was supposed to be temporary. My dad said "we need to get you a real bed". I said "I don't mind it". He told me that sleeping on the floor would cause an inferiority complex and subconsciously hurt my self worth. At the time, I thought he was reading into it too deep. Now that my dad is gone, and I have more life experience, I think he was right.</p>
<p>So if an air mattress on the floor contributes to an inferiority complex, what do you think covering your face, not getting a haircut &amp; other self care services does? This is not an accident. This is intentional. This is psychological, asymmetrical warfare.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly this. You know the boiling frog metaphor? If you drop a frog into a pot of boiling water heâ€™ll immediately jump out. But if you put him in the water an slowly turn up the heat, you will have a boiled from. </p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>

        <p>Certainly. I've been saying for years, the little things add up, even if we don't notice it on a day to day basis. Small things that happened to you as a child contributed to your personality today, just as little things like this will slowly demoralize someone.</p>
