    <strong>I don’t really understand what this sub thinks</strong>
    <p><p>Like, this sub used to be about skeptism about masks and not wanting it to become “The new normal” which i think is fine, but now that things can go back to normal with the vaccines this sub has turned Anti-vax? Can someone just explain what you want?</p></p>

        <p>OP, when I first started lurking in this sub-reddit, there about 2000 (???) members or so. That was about last July, it was very small, but people where questioning the narrative and were resisting the new normal as best as they could, and can. Now, we are 73000 members strong, and I would like for you to notice a common denominator since the roll out of the vaccine: questioning the vaccine.</p>
<p>I have had the measles, and I think it was the small pox vaccine, I am not against vaccines. As a matter of fact, the vast majority of us are not against vaccines. Want to know what we are against? We are against rushed, untested, and unproven vaccines because of the potential harm they can do. That's it. Yes, you will find that there some here that are purely against vaccines, that's fine; it is their right and that's okay. </p>
<p>There is a reason why we are posting information, and news articles about the dangers of these COVID-19 vaccines. Did you know there is a chemical ingredient in one of the vaccines (Moderna) called SM-102 and is very dangerous? Did you know that? Research it.</p>
<p>I think one of the most beautiful acts of kindness are people in this sub-reddit alerting others about the possible dangers of taking a very questionable EXPERIMENTAL vaccine. People are getting sick, becoming paralyzed, and even up to dying from the EXPERIMENTAL vaccines, that should be a cause for concern.</p>

<p>The only real common denominator about vaccines is we believe that no one should be forced or coerced to take the COVID injections. There are people who think it's good but should be voluntary, people who are against it for some or all people but fine with FDA-approved existing vaccines, people who judge each vaccine on a case-by-case basis and come to different conclusions about different ones, and people who are against them all. It's a huge space and anybody who isn't in favor of forcing others to get experimental therapies against their will fits into it.</p>

        <p>The notion of a new normal isn't just about masks, it's about mandating and compelling health measures. Let me ask you this... how is compulsory covid vaxxing not a "new normal?" Outside of the military, public schools, and the healthcare industry compulsory vaccination doesn't exist (in the US anyway)… and even within those industries it's compulsory for the employees,  not customers or visitors (I would call students in school employees, not customers), and there are exemptions. The push with covid vaxxing is unlike any other vax, the proponents want it mandatory for everyone without exception. That is not normal.</p>

        <p>I'm not "ant-vaxx", per se. I don't take any myself. And it's not because I don't believe they're safe or not effective. I don't take them because I don't need to.  </p>
<p>That applies in particular to the COVID vaccines. Which I honestly do not trust, due to how quickly they were developed and rushed out. Makes no sense, based on what I know about the proper timelines for vaccine development. But I'm not going to stop anyone (other than my family and kids - they're my responsibility) from getting this vaccine. They can do right ahead. If it works, it works, you'll be safe and so will grandma. There won't be any need for them to berate anyone with their tired old game of "YOU need to mask up and get the jab because if YOU don't you're putting MY safety at risk!" (which is a horse shit way for them to frame it on its face, but that's a whole other discussion).</p>

        <p>It is all different people. 'The new normal' can be seen to be the imposition of limits on freedom. Obviously spurious and unneccessary, untested and redundant vaccines are part of that. This has all been done upon the basis of false claims that there is something happening in the world in terms of infectious disease - that is new and unusual, and which has not been happening continuously and regularly and for all of our lives. Suggesting that we can 'go back to normal' because of a vaccine developed in a global marketing campaign designed to rebrand influenza as a global emergency - is preposterous to say the least.</p>

        <p>Most aren't "Antivaxx" anyways. I believe whole heartedly the science behind vaccines, though I do not get the yearly Flu as it seems unnecessary. The covid vaccine will be given yearly also, I'd prefer to let my body do the work rather than inject my self constantly. </p>
<p>The government forcing us to take it is all the more unease and a whole other topic of its own.</p>

        <p>Probably because people are starting to wake up to the fact they are trying to tie literal freedom to a vaccine that is experimental, and suppressing anyone who dares question the vaccine at all. And now trying to push it on children who have a 99.997% survivability rate. I think people are starting to understand that vaccination should be a choice and that freedoms being held hostage unless vaccinated, i’d absolutely criminal</p>
