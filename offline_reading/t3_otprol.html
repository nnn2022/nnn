    <strong>Parallels between Vaxxed vs Unvaxxed, and White folk vs Blacks folk</strong>
    <p><p>Am I the only one who seems any similarities between the relationship between these two groups? </p>
<p>Maybe because I’m a black chick it’s easier for me to see, but I find the arguments of the unvaccinated eerily similar to the arguments of blacks, and the same with the vaxxed and white folk. It seems like this is another social program to divide people and strip away power of the people, while making the few elite rich; sound familiar? </p>
<p>Even the spirit/attitude in which vaxxed people have against the unvaccinated feels the same as that racial ‘uncomfortableness’ that occurs when people do racist shit. And the constant arguments regarding basic human rights also sound ridiculously familiar. </p>
<p>I’m used to people not knowing me feeling like I don’t have the right to have an opinion or money, and all that other constitutional awesomeness, but it’s surreal watching the world go thru this. </p>
<p>In my opinion, vaccination status is the new racism.</p></p>

        <p>I see your point, but like many have stated the main theme is division. </p>
<p>Divided among politics
Among family (increasing divorce rates over the past decades) 
Divided among vax status
Divided among gender
Divided among sex
Divided among age
Divided among income</p>
<p>So many things are used to make us fight against each other. Divide and conqueror</p>

<p>No, that's exactly what it is, OP.</p>
<p>Seen the thread last night with the "Vaccinated only" high school cafeteria? It was my very first thought.</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating things is about this for me is that the "woke" crowd sees literally no problem with Jim CrowVID since it's in the name of "public health."</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of them actually dehumanize the unvaccinated as "plague rats" and "vermin" and call for daddy government to "deal with" us in various ways. As anyone with any historical literacy at all can tell you, that sort of shit literally <em>never</em> ends anywhere good.</p>

        <p>As a native american this is like Smallpox 2.0 on steroids. Smallpox is something both black and white people used as biological weapon on us. And here we are again, this time it's global. The goofy linear binary black/white world view is also really primitive and why we are in this world wide mess to begin with. Yes, we've been tired of both settler groups and their nonsense.</p>

        <p>It is the same. There are other things that are very similiar in how they work.</p>
<p>Whether intentional or not, it always starts with people fucking up, but instead of owning their own shortcoming and fixing the problem,  they start playing the blamegame.</p>
<p>As such we have cultivated a society that treats symptoms as causes and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this goes into every direction, people are way too quick to judge and  let their bias cloud their judgement.</p>
<p>Take police-violence on Blacks in the US. There are people who scream that every cop is bastard due to violence, there are people who scream that the violence is deserved. Both are right. Both are wrong.</p>
<p>People seem to be only interrested in who did something wrong. Not why they did it, maybe that is because the answer often includes themselves and their own shortcoming.</p>

        <p>Sure... Answer these questions:</p>
<p>Did you chose to be black?</p>
<p>Does you being black put people around you at a greater risk of dying?</p>
<p>Does you being black inherently put your health at risk?</p>
<p>If your answer to all the above is Yes, then you might have a point.</p>
