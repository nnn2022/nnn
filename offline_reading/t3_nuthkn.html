        <p>I've found that some of the most indoctrinated, brainwashed people are people that went to college. Getting good grades doesn't make someone intelligent, it mostly means they're good at memorizing things for tests, not thinking critically.</p>

        <p>Good thing that IQ tests largely measure your cognitive ability. A college degree these days is a sign of ignorance. The entire Foundation of their intellect is based on critical race Theory. So their entire intellect is not based in any reality.</p>

        <p>No I just got lucky and went before academia became nothing but a cult. We need to get these people out of our school systems, but the fact is, if you're getting a college degree now, you're walking out more ignorant than you went in.</p>

        <p>It depends on what degree you get. If you get a STEM degree you're probably alright. But if you're majoring in Gender and Women's Studies or Art History you are wasting your time and money...</p>

        <p>You're not speaking subjectively though, you just think everyone in every college is some kind of SJW? How do you expect someone to make more than 35k year without getting super lucky AND busting their ass to become some lame ass manager? It may be a cult but it's not a new one, it's been like that for a very long time to keep upper echelon people smart and working class stuck in the working class. So contrary to what you think from your high horse in a glass house, college is a chance at something better regardless of what you've experienced.</p>

        <p>Are you implying you can't make more than 35k without a degree or grinding to become a McDonalds manager? Ever heard of the trades? They pay you to get trained, and then to work for them. And they pay well. Really well.</p>

        <p>Yeah im well aware of trades, thanks though. I've been in construction for 4 years so I could move out and pay for said college. This old dope above seems to think you can't be in college and be sensible too, like college hasn't attracted hippies and ultra progressive people since the 60s.</p>

        <p>You say that but I've gone to college twice. First time it was more about education and being taught hands on how to get a job and people there were normal people you'd meet in the real world. 15 years later went for dome extra education to change careers and was blown away by the college culture that is around now.</p>
<p>No one ever really socialized with each other, massively in debt and believed others should pay for their gender studies education :/. Posters all over saying if two adults make bad life choices and got drunk and had sex its some how the mans fault?? Implying that even though a women is at the legal age to be considered an adult people seem to think they are incapable of making decisions for themselves and still need to be protected as children.</p>
<p>Also most of these people had their cars, phones and most other expenses paid for them so they don't understand responsibility and believed they are owed what ever they want. Thus they can't really think or problem solve for themselves and just want shit given to them. Unlike me or others when we were growing up I had to earn everything and it gave me a more realistic view on the world.</p>
<p>The whole culture there was no one should have responsibility for themselves and everything just given to them with out going through the hardship of earning it and thus have made generations of people that will just do what they are told to get what they want without questioning anything.</p>

        <p>Holy shit dude, all you do is generalize and you wrote that like you had to reach a word count, maybe too much college? Also, the elaboration of your ideas doesn't get better with quantity and repetition, it's better to be concise and especially on the internet. Your view is yours and yours alone, it is SUBJECTIVE to what college you went to, not all are like that. It's also an issue with the collective consciousness and every generation is more "progressive" than the last but it seems every older person has no introspection at all and can't see that their generation was just a radical as ours. You really think your parents and their parents were ok with The grateful dead, tripping/smoking weed, no Sunday church or better yet the next chapter of rock n roll and punkstyled clothes. You just think all of this is extra crazy because you've fallen victim to a classic trope, you can't get with the times and it frustrates you, it makes you an angry bitter old man that has to panic about his fragile world on fucking reddit. Heed my words and ironically........grow up.</p>

        <p>&rt;you can't get with the times</p>
<p>I mean if the "times" are blaming others for your poor choices and wanting to be communist then your right. I will never want to get with those " times" and any sane, rational person with a modicum of morals and intelligence would not either.</p>
<p>Thankfully my children are already ahead in terms of education and will be raised to be successful without these institutions.</p>
<p>Sadly though it looks as if your parents failed you by trusting your education to others and I wish you luck in life!</p>

        <p>Do you even know why this has been proposed? I'll say it so you don't have to ask me, it's because it assures you have the lowest chance possible to spread whatever you're vaccinated for to other countries. I had to take a shot of the yellow fever vaccine again because I wouldn't be able to travel to another country without having proof that I had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>This isn't anything new, it's just that in your little world you never had to deal with this before. Since parts of the world are finally keeping it under control they don't want to take any chances.</p>
