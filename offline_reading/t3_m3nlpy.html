    <strong>How to not wear a face shield without getting suspended?</strong>
    <p><p>So, I'm in public high school in New Jersey. They've finally got it together enough to bring kids into school 4 days a week (still letting a sizable portion stay virtual of course) but now are mandating face shields at all times. There was no mention of this of course when we committed to coming back to school. Not to mention, face shields are uncomfortable, ugly, and degrading. We already have to wear masks all day and this will only force more rules on us for no reason other than the illusion of safety and need to do "something". But I have no way of just opting out without being suspended, right before graduating. My parents don't support me, my mom has a very "go with the flow" attitude toward authority and would sooner let them anal swab me before I'm allowed to go into school than push back. There's no way I'm wearing an ugly plastic film just to be able to get an effective education, but I have no way to challenge administration, or get more people on my "team" without being mocked left and right by doomers my age and above. Anyone have ideas for what I could do?</p></p>

        <p>Shit man, couldn’t even imagine this. I’ve been out of high school for almost 10 years but this would be a nightmare for me.. </p>
<p>Can you not just opt to take virtual classes? Not advising but I guarantee in the next year or two once things quiet down a bit there is going to be a slew of lawsuits coming in, I could see suspension and no graduation due to not wearing a shield even though you wore a mask could be a good case</p>

        <p>Unfortunately they made us confirm we were coming back into school before they dropped the bomb, so if I sign into virtual class instead of coming in I'll be counted absent. I only have 3 months left before graduation, which sucks because I just wanted to get through it without anymore bs.</p>

        <p>I guarantee you there are students that feel the exact way as you do. Do your best to find them and organize together to get them off. </p>
<p>Nobody can do anything to you if you organize peacefully and create a compelling case against them. If they do try something, it is basically newsworthy youll probably end up on tucker carlson and have a kickass constitutional lawyer come to your aid for the publicity. </p>
<p>Good luck OP.</p>

        <p>They threaten you with suspension? I've not been doing the whole mask thing in school and I've never been threatened. I don't know, isn't there anything legal that could be done against that? Or even get a bunch of students not do because what can they really do then, suspend everyone?</p>

        <p>Masks and shields? I have worn one of those shield before with no mask, it was better in the way I could breath properly but they are uncomfortable around your head for hours on end and still suck. I would also do virtual if you can because that's insane. If it was me in school now I would just drop out altogether.</p>

        <p>Ultimately you need to refuse. Full stop. Fuck the consequences. It’s too degrading as you mentioned. </p>
<p>Personally? Nothing is worth degrading myself to that degree. Not even my life.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I can't stand it myself because I'm right on the edge of being an adult, with many of the responsibilities but few of the privileges, because I'm still stuck in high school and treated like a child. Besides, I'm graduating in 3 months.</p>

        <p>I think face shields are easier to use than masks for most people.  I guess you could try to get permission to either wear just a mask or just a face shield.  The main drawback to face shields is that they look pretty weird.  Masks both can cause skin irritation as well as looking weird.  Going virtual probably would be best in this case though, especially if you are not allowed an exemption from wearing both of them.</p>
