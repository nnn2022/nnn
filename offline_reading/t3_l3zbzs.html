    <strong>Now that cases in Ontario are dropping, I have a question</strong>
    <p><p>We all knew this was bound to happen with the seasonal drop, but of course the narrative getting pushed is "lockdowns are working." </p>
<p>But here's the thing, when Doug Ford announced the lockdown in Ontario, followed by the stay at home order, all the pro lockdowners chimed in unison that thisv wasn't a true lockdown and much harsher measures were needed.</p>
<p>So my question is, do you think that if they follow their narrative that it's the lockdowns working (and not seasonality), will they also concede that the measures turned out to be just fine and didn't need to be any harsher?</p></p>

        <p>They won't concede anything. They'll simply twist their story to fit whatever makes them feel better about themselves. But who cares what they think anyway. Focus on you and what you can do.</p>
