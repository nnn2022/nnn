    <strong>Any ex-doomers here?</strong>
    <p><p>From April 2020 perhaps?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not to brag, but I was never a doomer, and I felt lonely. I'm glad people have been getting woker and woker since May 2020.</p></p>

        <p>I was a doomer for the first couple of months, until I saw different standards applied to different people.  Then I learned about infected people being sent to nursing homes while the government virtue signalled about killing grandmas.  </p>
<p>Finally I just accepted that the whole mess was bullshit.  The virus is real, the crisis is manufactured.</p>

        <p>I was a little bit scared in March 2020 but the instant the lockdowns started I knew that they would be long term and that something fishy was going on. By April I fully understood that the measures being taken are not about health nor safety.</p>

        <p>I've never been supportive of the government taking any action to keep people at home or interfere with a business' ability to support itself- though I did support giving an advisory to take extra sanitary precautions and be aware of flu symptoms because a new virus was spreading and we knew jackshit about it. Unfortunately, that didn't produce a panic that people wanted, so quickly the narrative changed from a new strain of flu to a new Black Plague.</p>

        <p>Was a doomer for maybe the first month. But the whole thing felt like the Truman show, things just not adding up and I felt it in my gut something was off.</p>
<p>The toilet paper mania is what kinda tipped me off. Seeing how easily the masses were manipulated into panic over toilet paper raised my eyebrows. </p>
<p>Then the “wear a mask to protect others” narrative started and I knew right away that was the wedge they were going to use. Then the incessant virtue signalling started and I was out.</p>

        <p>I was never afraid especially when I didn't see dead bodies all over the city. I knew it was bullshit in March 2020.</p>

        <p>I was a doomer starting in January 2020. I used to follow an alternative news source that pushed the doom and gloom of covid long before the mainstream media. I saw videos from China of people collapsing in the street, crowds overrunning hospitals, giant disinfectant spraying of the streets, and stories of Wuhan crematoriums working 24/7, all appearing to be phone audios or videos ‘smuggled’ out of Chinese sensors by citizens risking their lives to do so. It was terrifying. I stocked up big at Costco in February.  </p>
<p>Then it started to gain attention in the MSM. Red flag. Then the British couple on the cruise ship situation started getting suspicious, and after some digging I found they had ties to media and Freemasons. Then I saw a video of a hospital video being faked in China. I became extremely disillusioned and disenfranchised, and I had to admit it was a fraud when it showed up here but it wasn’t killing anyone not already about to die of other causes or causing anything like the ccp videos. I ditched my alternative media source as it was obviously controlled opposition. I watched in horror as due to the government and msm everyone around me fell into the same trap as I did, but they had proof of it with their own eyes that nothing was different than the day before, yet they were all convinced a common cold virus had become a pandemic. And here we are a year later and they’re still brainwashed with zero eye witness evidence.</p>
