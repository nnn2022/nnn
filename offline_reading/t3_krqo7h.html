    <strong>Let's talk about Natural selection</strong>
    <p><p>Since the term has been thrown around a lot these past 10 months, and used inappropriately nearly every time, I thought it'd be a good thing to discuss here. Frequently, it is said by pseudo intellectual, psychopathic Doomers that "Natural selection will take care of the Anti maskers." What they don't seem to understand, is that by it's very name, natural SELECTION does not kill everyone in a given population, only the "weak", allowing the "strong" to survive and proliferate, making the group "stronger" and more fit with each consecutive generation. If it killed the entire population, then it would be an extinction event. I put "weak" and "strong" in quotations, because natural selection doesn't necessarily target the weak, just those most susceptible to a pathogen, or those least adapted to certain conditions. You could be the physically strongest, tallest person on an island, but since resources are limited on an island, you would be selected against. Natural selection is different from sexual selection in that, with natural selection, traits that are favorable to survival are selected for, as individuals who possess those traits survive to reproduce, passing them on to the next generation. Sexual selection is when the opposite sex selects a certain trait because they find it attractive, thus allowing individuals who possess that trait greater reproductive success. Sexual and natural selection are not mutually exclusive or always in accordance with each other, as sometimes a trait that is considered attractive is not conducive to survival in a given environment. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.</p></p>

        <p>Also, even the maskers say "It's not to protect me, it's to protect you!" so that completely takes away their "natural selection" attempt at an argument.</p>

        <p>Direct natural selection impact of the virus on humans is negligible. The average covid death-age is something like 80+. This is well past your reproductive years.</p>
<p>I am more concerned about the natural selection impact of our mitigation measures (masks/distancing/mandatory vaccination) on viruses. Let’s not forget, viruses are evolutionary entities in their own right.</p>
