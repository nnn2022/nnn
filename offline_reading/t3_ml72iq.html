    <strong>How many of you have been sick with Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I want to point out that while I believe the virus is real, the numbers are HEAVILY manufactured - particularly the death rates. Here in the UK last year there were ‘zero flu cases’, yet tons of Covid cases apparently, which feature surprisingly similar symptoms. Then there’s the fact that the NHS admitted to counting ALL deaths as Covid deaths if they tested positive 14 days earlier, and the fact that the inventor of the PCR testing machine said they were not designed for mass testing.</p>
<p>That said, how many of you have been sick with it since the ‘PaNdEMic’ began? Just curious. My family and myself are not afraid of it at all, we never wear masks unless we absolutely have to and none of us have been infected with it, which is mad when it’s SUCH a deadly and infectious virus.</p>
<p>Also, if you did have the virus, how bad was it and how long did it last?</p></p>

        <p>Well, I was diagnosed with it and roughly a month later serology showed antibodies in my system so I suppose I really was infected, but since I didn't have any symptoms, I don't think that counts as being sick.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with you on that one. As I’ve said, my family are not afraid of the virus or cautious, and none of us have been infected. Those I know that have been have all been a-symptomatic with the exception of one woman who was (not to be rude) quite obese and had preexisting health conditions. After about 13 days of being ill and about 4 of those at the hospital, she came back, recovered fast and is feeling perfectly fine now though. I mean is this really the threat that we should ruin society, mental health and the economy for?</p>

        <p>Back in September, me &amp; my sister started to develop a bad cough so we had to get tested. Mine was negative but hers was positive, bearing in mind I was much worse than her and she also has asthma. It's just scare mongering shite. It was no worse than having the flu, lol.</p>

        <p>Yo... I have to admit that it was the worst illness I have had since I was 6 and got hit by a car, snuffing road debris into my lungs.</p>
<p>That said, I was also 240 pounds at the time at 5'8" so yeah... quite overweight.</p>
<p>The surprise here was that CoVid managed to kill my mother, who was right weight for her height and was healthier by the merits than me by far.</p>
<p>Still wondering if the issue was that they treated her for CoVid and she actually had bacterial pneumonia.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for your loss :(</p>
<p>That’s definitely a possibility though. Like I said in the post a lot of people dying of Covid, aren’t dying of Covid, they just tested positive and died of some other unrelated problem such as heart disease or cancer</p>
<p>Hopefully you start recovering from your loss soon, I’ve never had someone that close to me die so I can’t imagine it</p>
<p>Keep marching on!</p>

        <p>I have and i wish it would have killed me.</p>
<p>I feel like im living behind a wall. I dont feel like me, i dont even feel like im on the same planet.</p>
<p>Ive been an athlete my entire adult life. I have no prexisting conditions and by all markers im healthy. I had mild covid. About a day of fever and feeling sick and then started to get better.</p>
<p>But the neurological issues. Id have rather been hospitalized than deal with the nightmare that is my post covid reality. I hate it, i can see the world and how it used to be but i dont experience reality that way anymore. Its like living is just beyond my reach.</p>
<p>I suspect covid related suicide will be something we have to deal with in the future.</p>

        <p>Not even Covid related suicide. Government related suicide. The day my Government has complete and utter control over every aspect and shuns me for wrongthink (we’re already close to this) is the day I’ll find it very hard staying motivated to keep living. If not for my girlfriend and family amongst other things, my mental health would be non-existent rn.</p>

        <p>I tested 3 times and went to my GP.</p>
<p>Also ive had chest pain like ive never in my life that coincided with flu like symptoms. I cant smell or taste anything.</p>
<p>There was no lifestyle change that led to this. I just had a full blood panel done last month (i get them every 5 years) everything came back perfect. I eat all organic and healthy, no medications, im active.</p>
<p>The actual being sick part wasnt a big deal. It was like a baby cold. If we werent in covid times, i wouldnt even have paid attention to. Its these lingering symtoms, waking up at night with anxiety, feeling like im in an alien dimension, like im in a bubble seperated from real life that is the scariest thing. I dont wish this upon anyone.</p>

        <p>Hear me out - I think it exists, but I also think it’s bundled in with a bunch of other things such as the flu to make the cases seem larger - as well as just straight up lying about the cases. Whether you believe it’s made by the government or not is up for debate because it’s not exactly hard to bring something like that into existence. It’s being used as an excuse and it was always part of the plan, though, whether “Covid” or some bird flu or anything else, a pandemic was always the perfect excuse. “Covid” just happens to be the catalyst and excuse they found the most fitting for this time.</p>

        <p>Well if we are on the same page, yeah it does "exist" since like 2016 in the USA. You are right about everything else, this isn't their first rodeo with invisible diseases: https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/i0s3u7/dr_robert_willner_accuses_anthony_fauci_of/ But I'm not talking about a "virus" because it was never isolated. I'm talking about new, and longer-lingering symptoms. Period.  </p>
<p>Anyways big fucking deal, there was a new flu variant in 2006 too and many of my friends got really sick for 2 weeks instead of 1 week. Personally I had the worst sinus infection of my life in 2006 from a customer at my store. For the last 5 years, the cdc and big pharma have 'guessed' the wrong flu variant for the flu vaccine (I've never taken one and never will because I'm not a moron) over and over and over again. Why people think they know what they are doing is completely beyond me. It is brainwashing, there is no other excuse for people accepting the word of proven liars.</p>
<p>If you want more I have enough ammunition to bury these criminals in court till next century.</p>

<p>It wasn't too bad. Swine flu was horrific however - really threw me for a loop. I was ill for two weeks. Covid, a few days.</p>
<p>I have a lung disease too so hypothetically I should be dead but it wasn't really much worse than your run-of-the-mill 1-2 days of a fever, aches, and so on, and a cough that lingered for a month or so which due to my condition could be related to Covid and could also not be.</p>

        <p>I got it a couple months ago, and before I knew I was sick I gave it to my wife and two kids. I had a little sinus congestion and lost my sense of smell for about a week. My wife had the same congestion, but lost her sense of taste, not smell. My two kids were not noticeably sick at all, just bored as hell during our quarantine. </p>
<p>My wife lived in abject terror for the past year hiding from this thing. Now that she has had it and recovered, she is telling everyone who will listen that they should go find someone who is positive and get it over with...</p>

        <p>It might be fake. But I don’t know, I’ve heard a lot of stories online of people getting infected and it being awful (for around two weeks but then they’re perfectly fine), and sure, that could be flu, they could just be lying, but I rarely heard anyone talk about the flu before. I know a woman with preexisting health conditions who tested positive, and had to go to hospital, but was then fine after about two weeks. </p>
<p>Maybe it is just the flu. It’s definitely a possibility. I don’t trust the government and their lies as far as I can spit and I wouldn’t put it past them.</p>
<p>But honestly, whether Covid exists or not is irrelevant though, because let’s say for argument’s sake that it does - the “threat” is nowhere NEAR big enough to justify lockdowns for over a year as well as enforced social distancing, enforced mask wearing, enforced vaccinations and social ruin to this who dare question it.</p>

        <p>people talk about covid because the media talk about covid. if the media had talked about the bubonic plague, Ebola, or even scurvy, the sheep will necessarily have followed the story. now people who sneeze or cough and have fever are going to get tested with pcr tests which are absolutely irrelevant. before 2020, those people with the flu would have just said they had caught a cold. so I wanted to tell you something that should really alarm you: if governments around the world have pushed this story, it means that what is coming is even more terrible than the current restrictions. I think we are heading straight for the end of our civilizations.<em>📷</em></p>

        <p>No one in my family was sick with it - my sis and bro had some cold and cough for few days month or so ago, but they never tested - what one doesn't know doesn't hurt them. My relative who I live practically door to door - about 5-6 of them - all had it. We all visited each other and hang out with one another 'till the day they fell ill. All flu like symptoms. Now my place is going thru 2nd surge &amp; relatives of my relatives are in isolation for the 2nd time loooool Then there's my family, doesn't give a shit &amp; didn't caught it once. We're like Florida of a family.</p>

        <p>Been over a year. I don't wear masks unless I absolutely have to (and the one I wear is open on the bottom so it's literally just to make people feel better) and I go out all the time. Haven't been sick. Not getting the vaccine either. Only person to get it is my sibling and they got over it like a head cold.</p>

        <p>Technically I was. I had a stuffy nose and my throat was a little sore for a few days. Then it disappeared and so did my sense of smell for about 3 more days. That was it. Had antibodies a few weeks later.</p>
<p>On a sickness scale of 1 to 10 where perfectly healthy is a 1 and media portrayal of big scary COVID is a 10, my "case" was a 1.5 or 2.</p>
<p>Most people in my family have had it, too, confirmed with either PCR (admittedly not reliable) or serology. We're split about 50-50 on slight symptoms vs full cold or flu symptoms, nobody got sicker than they would with a seasonal flu. Of course, we're all in good or okay health overall, nobody's clinically obese, and nobody is over 70, so it might be different if someone was very old or 100 pounds heavier.</p>

        <p>I assume I had it in March of last year. I was definitely sick--had a dry cough for nearly a month, and about a two-week period in there of intermittent fever/chills and fatigue. But it was never sick enough to warrant seeking medical attention.</p>
<p>I couldn't get even tested at the time because unless you were sick enough to be hospitalized they were still only testing you if you'd recently come back from China, or had close contact with somebody who had. So that's why I say I assume I had it, even though I'm certain I did.</p>
