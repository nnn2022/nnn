    <strong>How to fight the new normal? Step 2: Provide feedback</strong>
    <p><p>Hello again!</p>
<p>Yesterday’s post generated some good discussion, including some insightful comments from u/RIPTonyBourdain regarding the difficulties about living life anywhere close to the ‘old normal’ in places still under severe lockdown, and from u/Doing_It_In_The_Butt regarding how ‘voting with your wallet’ can be misconstrued by companies as a result of them not being intense enough with their security theater performance, rather than a criticism of being too intense. (Note: I still think you should avoid these businesses from a principles perspective.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, I had some ideas for Step 2: Provide feedback. The intent here is to clearly provide messages back to decision makers - not just in government, but at corporations &amp; the media as well - that the new normal is rejected by many. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seek out online surveys from your government agencies regarding Covid19; there are TONS and often you can add comments, and at least you can be part of the stats the media keeps reporting on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you usually go to a business where the staff wear masks, or where patrons are required to wear masks, write an email to management or leave an anonymous review indicating you are less likely to patronize the location due to their mask policy. If you want to get detailed, include that the WHO recently indicated asymptomatic transmission is very unlikely, while there are studies that show masks harm the healthy; so if their staff are sick they should stay home, and if they aren’t sick they don’t need to wear masks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one is really trite but here goes: write your representatives. Do it on the local level, the regional (state/provincial) level, the federal level. You know these reps are getting calls and emails from terrified Karens who want us all to stay locked down until a vaccine, who want masks and gloves to be mandatory, who want physical touch to be banned. We need to also reach out to these people so they hear the other side. Think of how many of us feel reassured by this sub &amp; r/lockdownskepticism, but if you go to r/coronavirus you can feel totally overwhelmed with doom &amp; gloom. We need to provide an alternate view to gov reps, so they don’t get caught in the negative. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I truly believe that more people want to live freely, than want to live in fear - it’s just that the fearful minority is louder. We need to raise our voices where possible.</p>
<p>Any other ideas on how to provide anti-new normal feedback?</p></p>

        <p>I just wrote an email to the local nature center, expressing my disappointment in their absurd policy of asking people to wear a mask while hiking on their trails. It is insane.</p>
<p>It was previously one of my handful of "happy places," and I refuse to renew my membership until they give up this mask bs. </p>
<p>Even then, I think my anger will linger. They will never seem the same to me and I feel that something really wonderful and spiritually fulfilling has been permanently taken from me. I told them so.</p>

        <p>I am glad you made that clear to them! I hope you don't lose access to that place forever - - I doubt their mask policy will last long, especially with people responding the way you did</p>

        <p>Excellent post!</p>
<p>If anyone is interested, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/fypo3r/a_quick_suggestion_participate_in_research_studies">here</a> is a post I wrote on r/LockdownSkepticism about places where research studies can be found. Most are quick and easy, and many will pay you. (Side note: another to consider, which I didn’t put on the list, is the receipt-scanning app ReceiptPal. Normally all they do is give you points for photos of your receipts, but I’ve been getting a weekly survey from them about the virus and lockdown etc. policies that’s definitely worth taking if it’s still open for new participants.)</p>
<p>I also really recommend taking surveys associated with stores you may visit. Many stores give you a code to take a survey about your experience which can be found on your receipt (Kroger is good about this, for example). Complain about new policies. Emphasize that they are inconvenient and express that you want them to be temporary and to be gone as soon as possible. Even if it is something the store is being required to enforce outside of their own volition, I’d still recommend bringing it up. You can be polite and still express a complaint; even if it isn’t quite their decision, get the idea out there that these restrictions are bad and unwanted. Even if you don’t get a survey, it might be worthwhile to send emails directly to the company just for the sake of complaining.</p>
<p>Lastly, I second writing your representatives! I’ve been drafting an email specifically to express concern about the concept of “new normal.” I think it’s important to underscore that any proposed long-term changes stemming from this situation are <em>very</em> unnecessary and certainly unwanted.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the long post :) surveys and the like are kind of my thing (lol) and this issue is far too important to ignore.</p>
<p>Edit: one more note — when taking surveys, be very wary of questions that are worded in tricky ways. This is more commonly an issue with casual, less academically-oriented surveys than actual surveys for research purposes, but sometimes questions are framed in a way that leads you to a certain answer that can be re-framed as something you would likely not agree with. Make sure you’re interpreting questions correctly, and make sure your answer reflects what you really want to say, or at least the closest available option. I’ve also seen a lot of surveys asking variants of “would you be willing to do (activity) this summer?” with regard to the virus. I usually answer these questions hypothetically; for example, I don’t normally go to sporting events, but I’m not opposed to going strictly because of the virus, so I say I’d be willing to attend.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reminder, I just sent an e-mail to a grocery store (thankfully not my primary one) that suddenly put up a rather aggressive "MUST WEAR MASKS" sign this week.</p>
