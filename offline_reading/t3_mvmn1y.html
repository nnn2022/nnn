    <strong>I feel like I've lost part of my humanity</strong>
    <p><p>A bit of a rant, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>I used to be an extremely empathetic person. I would go out of my way to help people, even if they caused themselves to get hurt. I just didn't want to see people suffer. Over the past year though, I've seen more and more people complaining about lockdowns and COVID restrictions, and I just don't care anymore. I actually enjoy seeing these posts now because this is what people wanted. For so long, people called me a conspiracy theorist, murderer, and Nazi, and now they're complaining about what I complained about a year ago. I just saw a post over in r/ventpolitics about Canadians sending an SOS code over the border to complain about their new restrictions allowing police to stop their vehicles for any reason. A quote:</p>
<p>&rt;"Ontario said that police would be given the authority to ask anyone outside or in a car why they are not at home for the mandated stay-at-home order and demand personal information"</p>
<p>My first thought was "Serves you right." We could have fought this together in the beginning, but instead I was demonized. How am I supposed to have sympathy for these people when I was their enemy for so long?</p></p>

        <p>One way to look at things is that brainwashed people are not fully to blame for their brainwashing.</p>
<p>The techniques being used are quite sophisticated and have been in place for a long time.  The real enemies are using all forms of media, communications, corporations and government agencies to herd people in the direction they want them to go.</p>
<p>The country isn't bad.   The citizens aren't bad.   The people manipulating information and pitting us against each other - those are the bad guys.</p>

        <p>One of the first rules of rhetoric. Pathos: appeal to the emotions. This is what the media and elite have done. They've used words like "in this together" "we care" the grandma thing it's all to elicit an emotional response from people. In fact Hitler used "the children" to do the same. Most people are not logical thinkers (Logos) they are emotional sacks of meat. The elite knew that would be the only way to turn people against each other. Emotional arguments always do the trick.</p>

        <p>Not empathy, but pity. In the words of a very wise man, forgive them because they don’t know what they do. The sheep are sheep because they’re mindless doers. They don’t comprehend the gravity of what they’re doing—they don’t know they’re being used, or what they’re being used for. Most don’t have bad intentions—they genuinely think they’re being helpful. So pity them, even if you don’t empathize with them. And have sympathy for them because they are like a flock of sheep, happy and unaware they’re being walked to the slaughterhouse.</p>

        <p>When they shake off the brainwashing and switch sides, they're no longer the same peole who denigrated you. Even those still in the dark can be swayed when reminded what life used to be (with actions, not words). Be a lightbringer.</p>

        <p>YES. They're so slow that it took them a whole year to realize what we realized near the beginning! Now some that implied I should be locked up for my views actually want me to sympathize with them getting tired of being in lockdown!</p>
