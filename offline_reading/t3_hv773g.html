        <p>Yeah, the worst thing about this lockdown mess is the politicization. This screed is guilty of the same. Started off pretty well, then got off topic and kinda diminished whatever chance it had at changing minds.</p>

        <p>I get that this is supposed to be a non political issue and I agree that in a perfect world it SHOULD be, but unfortunately in recent years a majority of questioning the government and asking for less intrusion HAS COME from the right, especially from right libertarians. This isn't to say that the right is incapable of being authoritarian (certain camps of people will blindly love Trump no matter what kind of pro-govt shit he says) and this isnt to say that the left is incapable of promoting freedoms; however in recent years and especially during this pandemic, liberals have really bent over to kiss the government's boots any chance they get and really encourage ratting people out to the authorities. If you disagree youre a far right science denier. All of the support of that from highly liberal media outlets and the only skepticism coming from right wing sources. We don't have to agree with everything right wing to see a trend. They're the ones doing most of the speaking up here.</p>

        <p>Yeah it goes from genuine concern about the virus being used an excuse to remove our freedoms (which I agree with) to mindless pro conservative anti BLM gibberish. I hate how this virus thing has been brought into left Vs right; why can't I be left wing and hate the way their dealing with the virus situation at the same time?</p>

        <p>There are those of us who see everything happening in today's society as connected. Not by motive necessarily, but by values or by fundamental beliefs such as what is the role government should be playing in our lives or in society. So many people on the right try to draw those parallels.</p>
<p>But you don't need to see them or agree with them and that's fine. Just cause you're on this side of this battle doesn't mean you need to drink the whole jug of conservative cool aide. I only ask that you take the things you've seen in the handling of this virus and try to see who the same sort of mentalities and the same sort of tactics have been used elsewhere. You may be surprised what you find. Or not! But at least you'll have looked.</p>
<p>As for this poem... Yeah I wish it sort of had a more cohesive message. Loootttaa stuff in there that, to the "right" crowd will be permitted, but to who the actual target audience should be, or pretends to be (aka people who say "it's just a mask"), yeah they're gonna write it off pretty quickly. It should point out the slope we've slipped down only as it pertains to the very short and immediately forgotten history of the last few months as it pertains to the virus.</p>

        <p>I’m also in science. But like for real. I’m not making it up, like everything you said on your deleted comment earlier. </p>
<p>There is consensus when there is clear evidence with empirical data and peer-reviewed research. Which we now have plenty of. And you can look through the very comments you were perusing earlier for just the tip of the iceberg. You say there’s no consensus because YOUR OPINION is such. The fact is, every disease expert that has actually been heard of - and not some random whackjob who just got his doctorate at trump university - has been resoundingly clear on what we need to do. But it doesn’t matter because ignorant folk like you and the remainder on this subreddit are too worried about wearing a mask for small snippets of their day to help save tens of thousands of lives, in this country, in 2020 alone, no matter what anybody says or shows you. Go ahead. Every other country will listen to their experts and keep their numbers down - as we have clearly seen - while clowns like you and those on this subreddit act like there’s nothing they can do.</p>
<p>Also, science literally is infallible. You would not be working in science if you thought that. The laws of thermodynamics don’t just apply some of the time. Pi doesn’t become inaccurate on thursdays. When you have enough empirical evidence, then you have the answer. It’s not hard.</p>

        <p>Oh, I don’t care if the mask is effective.  Now, studies that weren’t rushed out recently to support this nonsense (read some published before 2020) say that medical masks that are changed every 4 hours are effective.  Im skeptical of the re-used germ colony masks and the pieces of fabric.  But even if you prove scientifically that they are effective, I don’t care.

        <p>Ah yes yes, cause those things have so much in common with an easily transmittable disease! Especially one that is now putting profound strain on our hospital system to where people with non-covid issues may not be able to get in the ICU right away. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it. So what you’re saying is, if you can’t do every single positive thing no matter the size of its effect on people, you shouldn’t do any? Even the ones that have zero impact on your day to day life and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/07/10/study-face-masks-could-reduce-covid-19-infections-deaths-by-november.html">could prevent over 45,000 deaths by Nov. 1 in the US alone? </a>? That makes sense. You should write some books or start teaching!</p>
<p>Edit: and what a good assumption you made about me not caring to kill you with my car. Yep. Definitely. I’m always looking to get as many points as I can.</p>

        <p>Yeah unfortunately car crashes aren't the number you should go with there. But other preventable diseases or medical malpractice would be good numbers to go with. Easily in the hundreds of thousands for malpractice and over 400,000 from heart disease alone. Every year. But we don't arrest McDonald's for "killing people". Because at the end of the day humanity has always understood that life goes on, people do what they're gonna do, and people die.

        <p>There are not millions of studies that support the use of masks in general populations. Actually, the majority conclude that even in hospital environment they are ineffective for reducing viral spread of respiratory illness like influenzas. Some of these randomised controlled studies indicate their use may increase spread. The minimal evidence in support of mask mandates for general population is extremely weak. All prior to 2020 when panic and politics overtook it all it was not recommended for good reason.</p>
<p>That first study, by the way, has poor methodology. It can be torn apart by anyone with a scientific background. It assumes a correlation between masks and the natural reduction in cases equals causation. It does not. It doesn't take into account all other factors occurring, and under normal circumstances would be unlikely to have passed peer review. One of those factors is that cases had already peaked, the curve was trending down or about to as viruses do. This same pattern occurred in countries without shutdowns and/or without masks...</p>
<p>Look at California. Cases increasing despite mask mandates and compliance. This is because the virus isn't exactly spread by passing someone who has no symptoms in a supermarket.</p>

        <p>There is no consensus in science and <strong><em>many</em></strong> scientists were highly concerned and tried to warn that the consequences of these measures are worse than the virus, but no one listened. Even though they were backed by decades of evidence, even though many of the harms are well known. </p>
<p>Science has no consensus and we have known for a long time that this virus isn't a major threat, that it has a low IFR (varies by study as again it's ongoing and that's how science works but it's LOW) that will only get lower as the true spread is known, and who the vulnerable are. Existing immunity as a result of other coronaviruses. Still we carried on with measures doing disproportionate harm.</p>
<p>Scientists, ones who are well respected were blasted if they dared go against the narrative and raise concerns about these actions, concerns which are actually strongly supported by evidence. </p>
<p><strong>Science isn't a religion</strong>. The way it has been carried out and used the past few months is shameful. It's not how science works. </p>

        <p>“No consensus” because we have people like you ignoring the vast empirical evidence because of their opinion. There is consensus among the top professionals. The evidence is clear. Please check my other comments if you need any, or just do a google search.</p>

        <p>No, there is NO CONSENSUS IN SCIENCE EVER. </p>
<p>That's not how science works. Debate and research without bias and decided conclusions is a part of science and should always be. Science is active and nit stagnant. Not stuck in one place on one opinion, one consensus. </p>
<p>I have a science background. I've actually been involved in research. I have friends who chose to go into research. Scientists never all agree and science isn't infallible. It's not a religion. Your belief that there is a consensus among experts is alarming.</p>
<p>There is NOT consensus among top professionals, many of whom have spoken out and despite their expertise been attacked or ignored or even censored. There was little if any evidence behind extreme measures like lockdowns, travel bans, etc and the majority of previous research concluded against such measures. For good reason. In fact, pandemic guides based in evidence ruled these extreme and harmful measures out because of their ineffectiveness and/or catastrophic and long lasting secondary effects - effects that lead to increased morbidity and mortality across the board.</p>
<p>You people have an inability to accept that mistakes were made. Harm was done - harm greater and more long-lasting than this virus. Bad science was at play and blindly followed. That there are so many experts who are top in their field around the world who were against this.</p>
<p>Edited to add - there isn't vast empirical evidence of these extreme measures and never was. Quite the opposite, the evidence went <strong><em>against</em></strong> them. This knowledge was thrown out the window in a panic...</p>
