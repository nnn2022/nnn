    <strong>Church services under Corona.</strong>
    <p><p>I know Reddit is not normally a place to talk about going to church. I don't actively go to church but I tried to watch Live streams of Mass from the local church. There is no choir singing, just this one guy who plays the piano in the corner and sings pretty loudly from his Mic, coupled with a female singer alongside. He himself is a good vocalist in person (he sang at my mother's funeral), but the YouTube video doesn't do his voice justice. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I've never actually attended an in-person service there before Corona (except the funeral). I was thinking of attending that church because it's near me but I have a feeling that there used to be a choir before all this and now we get one guy singing whose voice sounds compromised on the recording, and the songs seem to be the same simple songs I heard last week. Did the "pandemic" (I hate saying that word) cause the degeneration in quality of church services?</p></p>

        <p>Not a church goer but have been on occasion in the past. Church is repetitive. Thereâ€™s only so much material and only so many songs a volunteer group of singers can memorize and perform, they tend to be simple and sound somewhat the same. If your reason for  attending is entertainment value I suggest you look elsewhere.</p>
