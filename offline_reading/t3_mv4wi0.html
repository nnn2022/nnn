    <strong>What sort of "victim cards" have been pulled on you to make you wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>I've had a lot of my fellow students on campus pull some of these on me to guilt me into wearing a mask. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. Here's some of the few I've experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'm immunocompromised." (Bonus if this comes from someone with a preventable disease, such as type 2 diabetes or obesity)</li>
<li>"I'm fully vaccinated, but I'm protecting others by continuing to wear a mask."</li>
<li>"It's [insert institution name]'s policy."</li>
<li>"Someone complained about you to the front desk."</li>
<li>"You could be asymptomatic."</li>
<li>"You don't care about others."</li>
<li>"If we're going to be future doctors and scientists, we should listen to the doctors and scientists."</li>
<li>This was said to me by one of my fellow biology majors, where a lot of us are Pre-Med/Pre-PA/Pre-Dent, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>What sort of things have you guys heard?</p></p>

        <p>From what I've observed you are more likely to get confronted in the US than here in the UK, and I'm wondering why.  Is it the more extroverted, outgoing, less reserved behaviour of Americans that makes some of them actually want to come over to you and start an argument in public about masks? Or, is it that it is not the law there that you have to wear one, so people are actively debating it because it's not legally enforced?  Here in the UK, if I don't wear a mask I don't get challenged, occasionally in shops, but never by random members of the public.  Also, even though masks here must legally be worn inside public places, they are not legally required outside and there is no pressure from people to wear them outside, and even pro maskers generally don't wear masks outside.</p>

        <p>Even in places where is mandated in public, law enforcement will very rarely if ever say or do anything about it. No one in their right mind wants to risk a confrontation and therefore their careers or lives over a mask mandate. The only thing I ever do in terms of enforcement is if a private establishment wants someone kicked out. In that case my hands are tied since a private establishment can technically kick anyone out for any reason. Even if they are in the wrong, they can kick anyone out whom they want. And dispute over being wrongfully kicked out is considered a civil matter and has to be addressed through a civil suit. </p>
<p>That being said, I will do everything I can to de-escalate the situation. For example if a store manager is kicking someone out over a mask I will try and ask the manager if they will just allow the person to quickly complete their transaction or make some accommodation. I also try to reason with the subject being kicked out to understand that it’s a crappy situation but the manager technically has the right to refuse service at will. I will only issue a trespass notification (we only issue a notification for a first time offense) which says they can’t come back to the establishment for an x amount of time as a last resort. I will only make an arrest if someone truly becomes violent and combative. So far I haven’t had any one become violent except for one person and in that case it was actually the person who made the complaint in the first place who decided to strike the person they wanted kicked out right in front of me.</p>

        <p>I just think a stoic, almost psychotic stare is the best answer. No words. After all, without a mask, you're able to communicate far better than the shithead standing in front of you as most communication is non-verbal. Use that power and let your stance for freedom speak for itself.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard them all but I either ignore them or if they keep pushing it I tell them to fuck off. 99% of the time they have a blank look on their face because it’s the first time anyone told them to shove it.</p>

        <p>April 17th 2020 was the victim card that led me to wear a mask. This day was when the number of covid deaths passed 34,200 in the US, the amount that the flu killed in the whole 2019 season, as compared to less than 2 months from the first American covid death. That's when I realized that this was obviously worse than the flu and needed action, even if it was only me wearing a mask in public to help slow the spread. Seemed like an easy sacrifice at the time, and even easier now that there are more than 560k deaths in America. I guess empathy is the victim card that got me in the end.</p>

        <p>Yes, because the majority of Americans are not fully vaccinated. Once that tips, obviously the need for masks will decrease. This isn't a new normal, this is a way back to normal. I can't wait to not wear a mask, but I have no issue wearing one until everyone who wants vaccinated is.</p>
