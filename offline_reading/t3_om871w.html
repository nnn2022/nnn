    <strong>How are you all dealing with this mentally?</strong>
    <p><p>I hope this kind of post is allowed. I have gone back and forth every few months with keeping up with the bs that’s happening, crying and spiralling, and then refusing to acknowledge any of it for my sanity. I was doing great for about a month until someone online harassed me for simply saying I didn’t want to get the vaccine. I let it go but then I started hearing/seeing posts all over of how bad things are getting in Canada (in relation to vaccine passports) and I am spiralling all over again. I hardly feel happy anymore. I wake up and I’m stressed to live in this world. I have to distract myself however I can or I am consumed by my thoughts. It’s so hard to ignore though. I am only 28 and feel like everything I’ve worked for was for nothing. I feel like nothing really matters anymore. There’s no reason to save money, to care about getting married one day, etc.. I’m too concerned with how my quality of life is gonna look over the next few years. It just feels like we’re living in a nightmare..</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same way. Only 25 here. I no longer care about careers, finding a girl, making friends, or even going to do anything. All I’ve managed to do is work a dead end job and exercise to pass time/feel somewhat better. It feels so pointless, and outside of this sub I have nobody to share this with. I don’t think the situation is the worst part of this. I think the general public’s complete inability to see it for what it is is the saddest part of it.</p>

        <p>Welcome to 'survival mode'. It's a natural response to a threat to one's security, safety and future.</p>
<p>The key is to maintain  your awareness and ability to make decisions clearly, as 'survival mode' can get you to make silly decisions. If you are aware of this fact,  you can guard against it.</p>

The extraction of one’s self from all the bs of society that was never truely apart of you to begin with. This is a normal stage you must get through to come to wisdom and understanding.

        <p>I'm 25 too, I feel the same way. I feel like all the hope I had for the future is gone. And even if things get better eventually, the amount of retardation I've seen in the last year have made a permanent mark on me. I don't see people the same way anymore.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Europe has it really bad. I hope people over there start fighting and set an example to the entire world that this is unacceptable. I have friends in the UK and friends in Australia. I’m hoping we can all stand up and fight together before they completely take the internet away from us.</p>

The entire point of everything that's been happening is to break us down individually, so they can usher in their brand-new system. Stay strong, stay alert, and do try to relax.</p>

        <p>I'm literally the only one in my family who sees what's going on and doesn't get the shot. It's pretty lonely to be honest. I constantly have to hear the same hysterical arguments from my brother about why I need the vaccine. Fortunately my wife thinks the same as me but she also gets the passive aggressive comments and "concern" from her pro COVID 19 vax family...</p>

        <p>Yes, you're telling me. We don't live near them but are part of chat groups with them on Signal etc and the topic of COVID constantly comes up alongside the usual links to sob stories. I used to combat all their claims quite successfully as I'm pretty well researched on the topic but now I can't be bothered. They'll never listen. I just want to avoid the topic completely. My wife's family just think I'm an alt-right conspiracy theory crackpot but they're as left leaning and establishment as it gets so hardly a surprise...</p>

        <p>We’ve tried. My mom called my grandma on Easter and I heard the entire conversation.. my grandma went off how some of our family members are getting together and that it’s sooo awful and my mom just said “I think if you want to see your family you should be able to and if not then you should be able to stay home” and she completely twisted her words and an hour later my grandma called back bitching at my mom making her cry. They aren’t open to listening. They sit in front of the news all day long. They got double vaxxed and are still scared to see us and it’s been a year. I’m kinda over it and I’m sad thinking I may never see them again before they die. It’s fucked up. The only one they’ll ever listen to is my dad (we don’t know why lmao they just will) but we haven’t been over there so 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

I don’t know when this will be over, but I feel your every word. Please hang on. All I know (feel?) is that we need to support each other. 
With regards to everyone which is actively against unvaccinated people, an eye for an eye will get us all blind. So keep in mind that kindness, remaining calm and waiting for the right time is different from being weak. These are our strengths</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. I think sometimes I feel weak by not speaking up, and then it gets people angry and we have a vicious back and forth. Kindness and remaining calm will always win.</p>

        <p>And by calm I don’t mean “idle” or passive. I am a very impulsive person, speak loud and get kind of aggressive (excited, in my opinion, but I have to recognize it I guess 😅). 99% of the times, people end up shutting me off just because of my tone.
So, what I mean is that being calm and not letting our feelings get in the way of clear communication and reasoning is what beats “hysterical” and “fanatic”.
We need to keep finding wholes in the narrative, need to keep paying attention to our surroundings. And have a plan B for everything.
Judging by how fast shit is hitting the fan, something’s about to break soon</p>

I’m not a fan of Biden whatsoever but honestly our prime minister is a complete joke too.

        <p>I’m not gonna lie, it might be hard for you to find a job if you come over illegally, but I still think you should do it cause Canada seems like a lost cause. My bf is from the UK, and had a lot of trouble getting by when he first came over. Not that some immigrants can’t easily game the system, but you have to be a certain color and have the right kind of accent.</p>

        <p>Maybe…it is easier to legally immigrate here than Canada, I’ve heard. You might be able to find a job to sponsor you if you’re skilled, but it’s not that common. You’re best bet is to move to a red state, meet someone, and get married. Might not be that hard if you’re around like-minded ppl! You also might have to work a labor or service industry job in the meantime, but try to come before our extra unemployment money runs out in September, cause the job market will be flooded after that!</p>

        <p>You and I are in similar situations. Due to record low vacancy rates I found a decent place that is very affordable and I have been banking the savings since - in some ways it prepared me for current events - to be able to weather it a bit better and able to have some leeway. Still unsure as how to proceed from here, but I'm certainly not as stressed as others in the same situation, but more on the line.</p>

        <p>I go back and forth, between ignoring it all and living with a looming sense of dread. I have it pretty good in Florida, in terms of freedoms/passports/etc. We don’t wear masks and I don’t feel like forced vax is in my near future. The thing I’ve been struggling the most with is my kids. We have two and they’re still young. We want more kids. And sometimes i question if I want to bring more innocent humans into the world the way it’s headed. One day I won’t be here to protect them and who the hell knows what the world will look like then. But, I’m also religious and trying to trust God. That He’s on our side and won’t leave us or forsake us. And that I can raise my kids to stand up for truth and freedoms and be a hope to a dark world. I have to cling to that.</p>

        <p>I’m pregnant right now so I feel you. I’m with two hearts - I’m full of love and excitement, and also a little worried. But I’ve decided that I’m going to enjoy every moment and only worry about the things that are within my sphere of influence. Everything else, I have no choice but to leave in the hands of God.</p>

        <p>I don't think it will get to a point of forceful vaccination but we may be barred from may places. Id rather stand my ground, and not be a part of this society and next time I leave Canada I probably won't come back because they might even ban citizens in the future or put us in real prison for not being vaxxed.</p>

        <p>I know but that’s bad enough. I’m seeing business in Ontario take a stand and say they don’t agree with passports (our premier said he wouldn’t want them either but we’ll see). I wish so badly I could run away and move to Florida. 😭</p>

        <p>Kenny said the same thing but it means nothing unless they ban the use of passports. I think underground establishments and society's will emerge, but most of the corporation's will probably push for a passport.</p>

        <p>I agree shit’s about to get worse. But for my own sanity I feel like trying to live as normally as possible right now is best for me. If prepping is what makes you feel safe then by all means do this.

        <p>You're operating from a flawed premise. Your future is only hopeless if you let it be. If you start organizing IN PERSON with like minded people in your community, we will prevail over this evil. Sitting around worrying about the future and what other people think will be enough to keep you in that state of depression. I also suggest taking time off of your phone, computer, and tv. Spend time in the real world. If you live in a city where you can't live normally, take a vacation to  a red state, out in the country. You have to detach from the constant negativity and surround yourself IN REAL LIFE with people who agree with you. This community is great, but we all need to start organizing in person as if it were 1950 during the civil rights era. Find your purpose. You will be ok. I know this sounds like tough love, but I say this because I have been where you are. I felt like that back in January after the Biden Regime usurped our constitution and stole power. I came to realize the only solution is ACTIVISM. But not the online kind. If we are going to win this war, it has to operate outside of their control. Billboards, crazy blowup sheep with messages, make tshirts to wear with messaging. There is strength in numbers and once we start to do that IN REAL LIFE, the evil cannot win. There are more of us than there are of them</p>
<p>EDIT - PS - I'm 29. So I get it. I am right there with you. I'm single and live under the dictatorship of Mayor Beetlejuice in Chicago. But if I can find a community of like minded activists with patriotism and willingness to stand up for what is right in one of the most communist areas of the country, ANYONE can too.</p>

        <p>I agree. Thankfully my family keeps me sane when I am able to make my weekly visits. Outside of them, I don’t have anyone who really gets it. As for purpose, 2020 was the year I finally started my career. What a year to start. But it’s getting crazy as it’s a government job (I’m in Canada btw) and there have been and will continue to be scary changes I will forced to comply with. I wish I lived in the USA where I could just move to a state like Florida or Texas. Unfortunately most provinces in Canada are all the same so it’s hard. And I obviously can’t cross the border right now. </p>
<p>You are absolutely right though, I need to find like minded people in my community and stick with them. There is a Facebook group in my town and protests have been organized. I would’ve gone to them all if I wasn’t potentially jeopardizing my job.</p>

        <p>I feel you. </p>
<p>Every day i feel different. Some days i feel like fighting and arguing about this covid mambo jambo... But only to regret even trying to get a government sheep to understand. Some days i feel at peace, knowing that i know as much as i know and being able to think critically. And some days i feel like trying to not care at all.. </p>
<p>So both bad and good mentally.  I guess.. If you ignore what is happening it wont even exist.
The best thing mentally is just shut down every news channel, delete your social media, find intrests out in nature, like go fishing or just ger out in the forest. </p>
<p>Since covid started i have bought hiking equipment. I have seen more of Sweden during this half year than i have in 20 years. Wish i didnt have to work... Or i would be going in many more places!</p>

        <p>My dad told me there’s no point as I’m not going to be able to change their minds and it’s true. I dont see it as me wanting to change their minds rather than it being an outlet for me to express my bottles up frustration and anger. Obviously it doesn’t work so well when the other person retaliates and pisses me off even more lol. I’ve considered deleting social media tbh.. might be necessary.</p>

Yeah but lol, i actully just unfollowed most of my "friends" On facebook.. and instagram. So im left with people who dont express their minds... and that is so peaceful.</p>

<p>What im trying to say to you is... Your life has changed, but it has not get to be bad. Its all about what you will do about your time. Your money should be going into assets, like silver/gold to save wealth because the economy is going to shit. 
Your time will go to improvement, build your empire.</p>

        <p>It’s not easy but it’s not as hard as some people make it seem. It’s just expensive and kind of a lengthy process, but if you’re not in a desperate position, it won’t feel horrible. You can usually even come to the states before the process is complete - you just won’t be able to work yet. If you get a work based visa, the employer will pay for most of it. Start looking now if you’re serious.</p>

        <p>24 here. I'm fine, but I suppose that's because I'm fine living in the woods, by myself. So no matter what would happen, I'd pack my bag and just go. I'm actually fine with prison or death, too, so I guess that's the reason.</p>
<p>When it comes to the society, I'm fine as well. I've gone through my stages of grief some time ago, so I'm just doing the things I normally would and don't pay much attention to covid things. At this point, they are more of a curiosity, rather than a worry.</p>
<p>I pity and worry about people I know that have gotten the vaccine and are still asleep, but there is nothing much I can do for them.</p>

        <p>I think the key is to be aware, but not too aware. You need a balance for you’re own mental health and sanity. You can’t let yourself spend too much time scrolling this sub or ‘conspiracy’ subs or it’ll just contribute to depression and anxiety. </p>
<p>Individually we can’t stop or control what they have planned in the future. Unless enough people wake up, all you can do is sit there and dread it, so it’s best to not obsess over it all. All we can do is take it as it comes and adapt to the possible challenges, and have faith we will find a way to navigate through them and end up alright. </p>
<p>All of this can easily consume you and leave you depressed and feeling alone if you aren’t careful, and all that will do for you is ruin the time you have now.</p>

        <p>Yes! Sometimes I don’t realize I am slowly falling back down the rabbit hole of scrolling and reacting. And that’s a great point.. by worrying endlessly we are wasting our lives and the time we have right now. Honestly I am so grateful I posted this and got the response I did. This morning I woke up so miserable and cried a bit.. I think I just needed to vent to like-minded people and feel less alone. I feel so much better.</p>

        <p>Yep it’s so easy to fall down the rabbit hole. Seeing through the illusion and knowing the reality of things and how blind most people are to it isn’t a fun time. With some things in life you have to be proactive and try to be prepared, but a lot of this stuff falls into ‘it’s out of your control, deal with whatever happens as it comes’ territory. </p>
<p>I believe you’ll figure it out and get through whatever they might have planned. It might not be fun or easy, but you’ll make it out on the other side of it. Have hope, not paralyzing fear like they want you to.</p>

<p>If I could, I'd flee to the moon and hide out up there until this all blows over. </p>
<p>I feel people are being pit against each-other as a distraction. </p>
<p>My family was vaccinated with very few side effects. I'm still holding out because I'm concerned about ADE or it aggravating my tinnitus. (There's a tinnitus forum I hang out on, quite a few people have had worsened tinnitus, some still do.)</p>

        <p>Agreed. I really didn’t expect to know anyone with awful side effects but my grandma, shortly after getting her 2nd vax, has suddenly had leg pain in one leg so bad she can barely go for walks anymore (something she loves to do). And also had a random rash there. Doctor doesn’t k ow what it is (surprise). She would never admit it’s the vax through, she’s been hounding us to get it. Of course there are people who may have zero side effects  but we also need to consider what the long term effects will be as it hasn’t been long enough.. it’s all scary. I hope your family will be ok though.</p>

        <p>My family's fine. I'm just holding off because I have bad luck. I'm a hypochondriac as well so potential side effects almost always manifest, either physically or psychosomatically. (You could probably inject saline into my arm, claim you injected a lethal dosage of cyanide, and I'd somehow still end up dying.)</p>
<p>I think the vaccine is mostly safe, but I am still concerned. </p>
<p>I'm personally holding out until winter at least to see if everyone drops dead from ADE or not. </p>
<p>I personally see myself as paranoid but I'm not tin-foil 5G levels of conspiracy theorist. I don't think the vaccine is a microchip. I don't think this is some kind of depopulation gambit. (If it was, all the "sheeple" would die and you'd be left with pissed off people who would rebel)</p>
<p>I just don't trust the government.</p>

        <p>I agree, I’m not a major conspiracy theorist either but it does scare me that even though people haven’t died from the vax, a lot have awfu side effects that are potentially permanent. I would ONLY be open to getting the vax once a significant amount of time has passed. But even then I’d be disappointed in myself for giving in to the control and bullshit.</p>

        <p>I am in my mid-20s as well. The world has gone mad, but I have kids and husband and a house to take care of, so I gotta keep on keeping on. We are getting into preparedness and saving to buy land right now (we currently live in the suburbs). </p>
<p>I have always been into self-sufficiency, since I was a teenager, and this crisis has simply underscored what I have always felt: the need to disconnect from our sick society that is so dependent on the elites, and to become self-reliant and capable. I feel like I've been preparing for this time for ten years mentally--I am more determined than ever to prepare, find a community, and make the big move to off grid in the near(ish) future.</p>

        <p>Im sad and pissed as a parent. When I’m just trying to get through this and my kid gets badgered by other kids who’s parents live in perpetual fear and stupidity. And I have to find a way to explain that they „just believe differently than we do“ when I actually want to tell him „they’re single filing into tyranny and they’re happy about it“ he wouldn’t understand that any more than the little girl Talking about „science“</p>

        <p>I think kids and teens understand more than we give them credit for. My opinion is that is important to make them see early on how the world operates, the good, the bad and the ugly. And that the world is full fecal matter disguised as a delicious chocolate bar.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel for all of you guys going through this. I live in Texas, rarely see a mask and I work half the day of a shift in retail. Had two family members get the stick and no one else wants it. It's literally not an issue where I live and watching what you guys are going through dealing with everything makes my blood boil. </p>

        <p>I have really just stopped talking about it unless someone actually seems receptive. I limit my news to about once a week. I’m no longer going to damage my health by fixating on it or trying to convince others. I’m fortunate that 99% of my family is on the same page, and I’ve made peace with potentially losing friends, although it hasn’t come to that thankfully. Occasionally I do have intrusive thoughts, but if I can’t do anything productive with them, I try not to dwell. Your focus creates your reality. I have to have faith that my husband and I will endure and find a way no matter what, even through difficulties.</p>

I think it’s just hard when I’m not actively looking for this none sense and I’ll be on tiktok and see a random video that pisses me off, or a YouTube I really like putting in their bs two cents for no reason.. it can be hard to escape.</p>

        <p>Yes, it’s pretty much inescapable online. I just try to stay off of it and find other things to listen to. I love listening to podcasts now, especially episodes from pre-2020. Honestly, where we live in the States, you can pretty much pretend 2020 never happened if you don’t watch TV or go online much. There are people who still wear masks but that’s about it. </p>
<p>I really think everything is so saturated with negative talk to make us feel like most of the world is doing this “new normal” thing. They don’t want you to know there are tons of people still living a normal life.</p>
<p>So while I try to remain informed, I keep it to a minimum and try to enjoy the things that are still normal. And try to put more normalcy in the world by my own thoughts and actions. Sending you my support. I know sometimes it’s easy to feel weighed down.</p>

        <p>I'm lucky enough not to live in a insane asylum like the US and Canada has become, so honestly not getting the vaccine hasn't really affected me at all. Me and my family have all worked our usual hours since Covid started. For now it's still just a choice you make and if you choose not to it's not a big deal. For the most part everything is back to normal, there are certain restrictions with concerts and football games like the amount of people allowed. Vaxxed or not, you can still go to these if you want, but you need to have tested negative two days beforehand. I think even this is too crazy for a virus like Covid though. Pubs you can just go to whenever now, vaccinated or not. Most people don't really give a shit if you're vaccinated or not, no one asks, we have a couple of those doomers as well, irrelevant though. Most of us young people have not taken the vaccine, and if they have, they've only taken one dose. The supposedly "persons at risk" have taken two doses. It's getting less and less relevant, hardly ever see any masks either and I speak to hundreds of people a regular day at work. </p>
<p>I can hardly believe everything that's happening in the US, Canada, France to be honest. You've gone absolute bonkers. It's funny but I really wanted to move to the states a few years ago... Stay strong though, most countries have not gone bonkers. This farce will fall apart by itself due to it.</p>

        <p>I really didn't mean for the post to seem like gloating at you guys though, I think it's horrible abuse of human rights that you're being subjected to. It is insanity. More like trying to cheer you up that things can and will go back to normal. The world can't function with a few countries in an insane asylum, while the others are getting back on track for better or worse. That's why the farce will inevitably fall apart soon enough.</p>

        <p>I'm doing totally fine.  For some reason I inordinately positive about it all.  Not that I think suffering and death are good things but all of this, the whole big picture of corruption and greed and power, I think is on the verge of ending.  It's a pile up of shit like this that either makes us or breaks us as a human race and I just feel this knowing that everything is going to be okay when all is said and done.  A lot of sacrifice will be had to get us to that okay place though.  But I feel lucky to feel at total peace with it all and I'm just taking it in as I continue to live my life the best I can.</p>

        <p>That’s amazing. You sound a lot like my dad. He’s constantly staying up to date with things but he doesn’t let him affect him. I’ve never been good at “trusting the process” per se. I think I need to have a stronger sense of faith and trust in what’s to come. And honestly I feel like it’s one of those things where I need to let go of my need for control and just let things unfold naturally as they are meant to. I’m not sure why I even get worked up over it .. there’s nothing I can do to stop anything right now.</p>

        <p>Ya, sometimes it's just good to let it all go and keep any ounce of news out of your life for a while if you can.  The outside world will still be there to go back to but if you can just be in your own world for a while and see and appreciate the details around you rather than all the big stuff "out there" it's helps to ground you.  Makes you realize just how much doesn't even have to touch you unless you let it.  Even I feel like I can get saturated because I can't help but suck in whatever information I can but I'll take breaks and it does help balance my perspective on life and what really matters.  I hope you can find a balance with all of it :)</p>

        <p>Take a step back from the media and social media and live in the real world, surround yourself with like minded people. I have done that since the start and only check back here a couple times a week, I deleted Facebook, Instagram all of it. And just surrounded myself with my friends and family. You are not alone, they just want you to feel alone and it appears to have made you very miserable.</p>

        <p>For me personally, tuning into people who are discussing this issue from a spiritual perspective helps me. I especially like people that are spiritual but don’t hold anything back.
IG: @philgoodlife @thehoodhealer (she had to move most of her content to only fans because she kept being censored on IG. / www.oraclegirl.org has meditations (more like pep talks?!) that are relevant (some of it might be a bit “out there” but not all of it) / Amanda Ellis &amp; Lorie Ladd on YouTube.

        <p>It is definitely a struggle. If I had known then what I know now I probably wouldn't have had my daughter. She's 18 months now and has spent most of her life in lockdown and not really seeing other's faces aside from her family. At the same time she's a major reason for me to keep fighting for freedom. I daresay many mothers felt this way at the start of the world wars, or the Troubles here in N. Ireland.</p>
<p>The way I cope is gaming or crafting during my free time, getting out for at least some exercise each day, clearing off out of the house at the weekends (working at home sucks, used to be out and about all over the place). Probably most important of all is limiting my time online. I've started a bit of prepping too, rather late to the game probably. Husband thinks I'm a bit nuts on that one, but it helps me cope so he's going along with it.</p>

        <p>Omg I feel that. I decided I 100% do not want children simply because I do not want to bring up a child in this messed up world. To be honest I never really wanted kids but now I know it’s a for sure kinda thing. It’s sad that there’s adults like us that a struggling meanwhile children are being robbed of a normal childhood.</p>

        <p>I think it's even worse for older kids who are at school. Many kids have panic attacks and/or depression. A friend of mine in Germany days that child psychologists are booked up for at least a year. They don't even see depressed like anymore unless they're suicidal. At least your little one is too little to know much about what's going on.</p>
<p>We have kids of a similar age and their crèche has mainly been open during the lockdown. I do agree with you that social interaction with other children is important.</p>

        <p>Honestly nothing really changed much for me, I’ve been working as normal the entire scamdemic and I spend most of my time alone anyway so lockdowns didn’t really affect me much. Waiting in line for 15 minutes to buy groceries was annoying though. I think the later stages of this situation have been the worst as we start to see the true nature of what’s happening.</p>

        <p>I’m introverted and enjoy being alone most of the time as well so that didn’t bother me either. And I’ve also been working the whole time. But you’re right, it’s the other stuff that’s really scary.</p>

        <p>My brain is mush after developing PTSD 9 months after waking up from a coma. My point is that I'm like retarded now and my brain thinks I'm dying every day.. I'm on standard protocol of Zoloft and therapy but I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>With that said when you think your dying every day it don't really matter so I'm going to keep smoking weed. Eating healthy and keep my weapon. If there is mandatory vaccines there will be death. I'm 33 but I really believe some NWO shit going on so I give my self to 35 when they can work up the nutts to come  to Florida so they can force there vaccines on me.</p>

        <p>I don't know how I'm mentally together in any way lol. My childhood was mostly abuse, manipulation, and being locked down by my parents. I never got to travel or see a concert. I was only free for a few years- trying to piece my life back together when this happened. I'd been homeless ish for 3 before the pandemic shit even.
I had plans but I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if anything's worth it.</p>

        <p>Not very well. For the last 10 months, ever since I realised what's going on, and what sort of future awaits us, I have been grieving the loss of the old world, the innocent old me, and the life and hopes and dreams I had that will now never come to pass. I was 17 when all of this started, and just turned 19 last month. I'm too <em>young</em>! I'm supposed to have a - a <em>life!</em> I'm supposed to <em>live!</em> But I've barely gotten the chance. I've spent my entire adult life in this madness, and will probably continue to do so until I die.</p>
<p>Grieving. Filled not with fear for the future - although it's scary, and I have my moments - but more so with anger, and an overwhelming feeling of sadness and sorrow. I distract myself a lot. I have good days, I still have fun, I don't feel down 24/7, I enjoy myself and have a pretty happy life in general despite everything. But underneath, there is always that sadness, and it doesn't matter how many times I distract myself, or for how long. It always comes back eventually.</p>
<p>It's getting better. <em>I'm</em> getting better. I have to. It's been almost a year.  It was extremely difficult in the beginning, but... things are better, now. There are still a lot of ups and downs, but I'm not drowning in it all as much as I was at the end of last year.</p>
<p>There are days I'm swept away by the current, and find myself drowning in it, unable to resurface, surrounded by - and filled with - chaos and turmoil and <em>pain</em>. The water never goes away. But most days, I am able to stand up in it, and simply feel it against me, wet and cold.</p>
