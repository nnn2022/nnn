    <strong>This has to stop. They are risking my CHILDHOOD over a cold.</strong>
    <p><p>I have been at home for around 100 days. That’s 100 days of my youth that I will never get back. Those 100 days are worth so much more than someone’s decrepit last one’s dying in a nursing home (alone, without any family aside them), and I should not have had to give them up. </p>
<p>I am not killing your grandma. You are killing me. Do you think I am going to be thankful to attend Zoom prom? Do you seriously think I am going to fucking praise you on my hands and knees for forcing me into a mask so that my first boyfriend will never be able to see my smile? Do you think this will mold me into some acquiescent, government-praising citizen? </p>
<p>It won’t. I went from a socialist Liberal who thought the government’s involvement was the key to every issue to a Libertarian who sees the fucking light now. I will not be following your bullshit rules, and I will not be playing your bullshit game. I’m not old enough to vote, but I’m old enough to know how absolutely evil the world can be.</p>
<p>So. Anyways. Thanks doomers! I’m so glad to have been locked in my home. Did you know that when I go back to school I will be hugging my friends? And when I go on dates I will be taking my mask off and kissing someone who’s <em>not</em> in my family bubble? Maybe we’ll even hold hands. I will be going to the library and going to festivals and shows (HELL YEAH will I be supporting live musicians) and parties and restaurants. No, I will not be Amazon Priming a movie or buying music off of Apple or having my food sent via Uber Eats. I will be paying in cash and sharing appetizers and feeling everything that’s real. </p>
<p>Because it’s mine. Because I deserve the end years of my childhood. Because doomers can seriously stay home forever if they really think they’re gonna win this one.</p>
<p>Gen Z/whatever you wanna call us, IS DONE with your lockdown bullshit. We’re not paying for your degeneracy.</p></p>

        <p>What, you mean you don’t want to shut yourself in, order junk food, stare at a screen and be a good little consumer until it’s time to inject yourself with a rushed and inadequately tested vaccine? I mean, it sounds so tempting!</p>

        <p>If they succeed in their agenda, they’ll probably rewrite the history entirely, and idiots like the doomer above us ^ will take it at face value, despite the fact that the Left has criticized (and to be fair, rightfully so, but it highlights their hypocrisy) the American’s white-washed, glorified history in our curriculums. </p>

        <p>Ah yes, the ol the government is repressing us by forcing us to stay at home. Every other country was able to do it and guess what? They aren't being plagued by covid anymore. When our government suggested it people fought back attending "covid parties" Do you have a better plan? What's your plan I'm sure you have this all thought out.</p>

        <p>Please elaborate. Build herd immunity? You mean get people sick with covid so they become immune? You know the virus is mutating and people have been getting sick in 3 weeks minimum. Also do you support masks or no? It's a cloth that prevents the virus from spreading with nurses and doctors proving that it doesnt suffocate airflow. And just fuck old people who cant fend for themselves and high risk individuals? Good plan</p>

        <p>oh boi you are so clueless it is not even funny. First of all, avoiding sick people does fuckall when the virus can be transmitted long before symptoms occur. In fact you are most likely to get others sick before you have symptoms. 
Herd immunity might be a thing in a few year, when this new virus has really spread through the population. But right now we deal with a virus that kills 5% of all people who where tested positive. So following your plan 5% of the us population has to die. So you can go party. But I am the one on the wrong side of history ? HOLY FUCK you are narcissistic.</p>

        <p>so far we had 14,321,132 cases worldwide that had an outcome, 13,571,905 of those recovered, 749,227 or 5% died (even a bit more then 5% actually). For the us the numbers look even worse with 2,783,447 recovered versus 168,574 I know you hate facts, but so far everything I said is a fact. All you do is spout personal attacks.

        <p>this is not nonsense these are the official numbers published by official sources like the CDC and the WHO. So stop projecting, just because you, spread nonsense with nothing to base it on, does not mean everybody else does as well. So far all you do is deny every fact I present (which I always back up with a reliable source), with nothing to back it up, and instead try to attack my person and my character. You act like a stubborn 5 year old. But hey present evidence i am off by  a factor of 100. OH WAIT you can´ t since you just pulled that out of your ass.</p>
<p>The mental gymnastics you undertake so you keep denying the truth are pathetic. I mean come on  claiming I get paid to l talk to a single person on reddit, in  a thread nobody reads anymore ? That is beyond denial, that is staight up delusional.  Now either present your own evidence , with reliable sources, that debunk me, or you automatically admit what  a huge jackass you are.</p>
<p>Listen kid, i know you are scared by this pandemic.  But just trying to deny it, and using ad hominem attacks on everybody trying to tell you the truth, only makes it worse and puts yourself  in harms way.  I know you think you are young and healthy so covid is not  a threat to you, and that is fucked up for many reasons, especially that you are risking the lives of other people that way who might for example have a weak immune system . But you do not care about that. You are ok with another 50.000 people dying if it means you do not have to change your lifestyle, right ? What an unbelievable narcissist.</p>
<p>Well since you only care about yourself, let me show you few who thought like you ; "I am young and healthy, so covid is no problem for me. It only hits old and sick people" well y-o re wrong about that, young healthy teens also have died and will keep dying, just at a lower rate :</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you do not end up in intensive care before you realize your mistake.</p>

        <p>Cus herd immunity works so well with the normal flu and common cold(which is a corona virus). If only our doctors had thought of that. You should get right on the job of informing them all immediately.</p>

        <p>Its not a cold OP, I can't believe you still buy that pipe dream of a conspiracy, the US has more fatalities to covid19 than the soldiers who died ON BOTH SIDES in the Korean and Vietnam War combined. with no end in sight mostly because the US failed to coesivly provide leadership to flatten the curve, instead the graph is like a camel grim reaper. But go ahead and continue to spread misinformation, thats what the internet is good for these days. I hope at least one person in this sub actually challenges their views and verifies sources.</p>

        <p>The death% on that isn't useful because it only counts tracked cases and doesn't update recovered unless the country specifically does so, so it's a CFR at best.</p>
<p>America will suffer more for the same reason the UK will - a huge number of overweight/obese individuals (something like 5x that of Sweden in the UK at least). The curve will look the same though, no intense lockdown or lasting draconian restrictions required.</p>

        <p>Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s thoughts like these that make me have faith in humanity.

<p>Some people say oh it’s not so bad, but it’s only a matter of time until they realize that their favorite things in life are off limits because some government official said so. Not to mention everyone who’s now unemployed because of it. That’s no life to live.</p>

        <p>You will lose karma for using an incorrect statistic. </p>
<p>The death rate is not 1.4%. For me, a very very fitness-obsessed powerlifter with 12% bodyfat,  healthy man in his early 30's with no preexisting health conditions, the death rate is basically zero. Hell, the chance of me <strong>even knowing I have the virus is incredibly damn low</strong>. </p>
<p>But since you asked, I would rather a 1.4% chance of death if it means I'm allowed to go outside instead of dealing with my once-beautiful city now being a police state. Because I'm not a neurotic, scared, paranoid child who hides from death <strong>because he's too afraid to live.</strong></p>

        <p>Yes only a few grow up and become actual adults capable of questioning and verifying outrageous claims of the criminals who rule over them in government.</p>
<p>For example, these 2 nurses spent a month each in the "epicenter of the epicenter" and revealed how the govt/medical complex was able to gin up local death numbers bigger than a normal flu-season only by murdering poor, minority patients by un-necessary intubations, do-not-resuscitate orders, and other means (sorry if they didn't show this to you on TV):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.lbryplayer.xyz/api/v3/streams/free/Nurse-Nicole-Sirotek-tells-of-murder/b3212968fd8259aabaa4ff0a86a59f1ac2fa6a5e/9d7dcf">https://cdn.lbryplayer.xyz/api/v3/streams/free/Nurse-Nicole-Sirotek-tells-of-murder/b3212968fd8259aabaa4ff0a86a59f1ac2fa6a5e/9d7dcf</a></p>
<p>And of course if you're an adult, early on you immediately sought out those critical of the Govt/TV Freak Out such as German Pulminologist Wolfgang Wodarg's March 13, 2020 explanation of what Wuhan virologists and their western benefactors were up to:</p>
<p><a href="https://lbry.tv/@WGA:4/Stunning-insights-into-the-Corona-panic-by-Dr.-Wolfgang-Wodarg.:c">https://lbry.tv/@WGA:4/Stunning-insights-into-the-Corona-panic-by-Dr.-Wolfgang-Wodarg.:c</a> </p>
<p>And then evaluated his explanation objectively and compared to the evidence presented by TV/Govt.</p>
<p>And of course, 2 months later when TV/Govt shouted to you "THE CASES! THE CASES!", as an adult you went back to your 3rd grade arithmetic book and re-read the chapter on fractions and denominators and concluded that whatever they're testing for, only dishonesty and not stupidity can account for them shouting that the numerator is increasing without reference to the denominator also increasing even faster due to "THE MEGA-TESTING! THE MEGA-TESTING!" being performed by every frightened business owner scared shitless that the FULLY-FUNDED police would shut them down if they don't send their diaper-faced minimum-wage workers to the lab for frequent tests.</p>

        <p>It is about banning things.  People that don't care about being social and dislike working in an office or in the service industry don't give a damn when bars are closed, the entertainment industry is dead, and people aren't allowed to have parties.  But you can bet your ass if governors started shutting down parks and non-essential retail, limiting mail to essential items only, or shutting down non-essential manufacturing, people would start losing their shit.</p>

<p><strong>it's avoiding being close to large groups of people</strong></p>
<p>The places and entertainment that can manage this are already open or in the process of reopening. </p>
<p>The same as every country that implemented it on mass and now has a flattened curve like here in the UK. </p>
<p>We adopted masks and our entertainment is reopened without a second spike yet, </p>

        <p>How much immunity already existed in the population?  Why do we assume 60% antibodies is the magical number?  Why do we assume antibodies are needed for immunity when t-cell immunity also exists?</p>
<p>Or how about I turn the tables on you.  Why did daily cases jump from 1000 per day in late-March to 5000 by mid-April <strong>during lockdowns</strong>, but after reopening you're staying below 1000 per day?  What explanation do you have that isn't herd immunity?</p>

        <p>It was a brand new virus. There was no natural immunity. What are you even talking about?</p>
<p>Let alone believing we suddenly went to 60 - 80% needed for herd immunity? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53433824">"We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy."</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53433824">On Sunday 15 March, the health secretary appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr and Sky's Sophy Ridge programmes, restating that herd immunity was not the government's policy</a></p>
<p>&rt; Why did daily cases jump from 1000 per day in late-March to 5000 by mid-April during lockdowns</p>
<p>Because there is a three week delay between lockdown being announced and the massive spike causes by the hot weather as lockdown was announced and massive events...it's also why the cases dropped rapidly after that as the effects of social distancing and lockdown worked <strong>and why our curve flattened</strong>. </p>
<p>Please though. Show us your evidence of 40 million cases of covid in the UK as you believe against our figure of 311,000 cases total. </p>

        <p>Yeah. They can also die from the flu. If people want to stay at home and live in fear their whole lives, go for it. But don’t force people to. We can’t just tell people to stay unemployed until a vaccine comes that could take years</p>

        <p>What is it with you people and the flu? Coronavirus is measurably worse than the flu in almost all respects, research this shit.</p>
<p>Whole lives? Chief, the whole point of quarantine is to limit the virus, thus removing it quicker than if it spreads through the population. </p>
<p>Being unemployed sucks, I'd be a lot better if the government actually owned up and gave the unemployed money though, or is that too socialist? The government is to fault for their shitty response and lack of support for the unemployed. We should be able to stay home and save people's lives while not worrying about rent, it's not the two choices "unemployed or coronavirus" like in your fucked up world</p>

        <p>And crash the dollar and causing inflation while we’re at it? No thanks. How about we tell people to focus on their health so if they do catch the virus then they’re better prepared instead of telling people to stay inside and avoid the sun that gives you vitamin d. Why is herd immunity something talked about by epidemiologists but suddenly so taboo regarding coronavirus and if you even mention herd immunity then apparently you don’t care about people’s lives and want people to die</p>

        <p>I'm glad more like you are waking up to the bs, OP</p>
<p>Stay strong! Any opportunities you can see to spread the message/protest/whatever, take them!</p>
<p>I don't want to spend the rest of my 30s, and possibly the entire dating/courtship and marriage of whoever I end up with living in some kind of quasi-Martial Law where we are pushed into ordering online and never being able to talk closely with people and see their faces and have physical interaction.</p>
<p>I did do a funny rebellion that I think you'll like: one time last month when my best friend and I were at an In-N-Out, we finished eating our meals and as we were walking to our cars and saying goodbye we both instinctively hugged eachother tight in the parking lot and kissed eachother's cheeks, obviously no masks being worn, all while the drive-thru lanes were packed. One guy in the drive-thru lane gave me the longest stink-eye as he was wearing a mask in his car with fully rolled-up windows. It was hilarious.</p>

        <p>What are your stats for "rarely"? Not disputing the gist of what you're saying (that on average, it doesn't pose a risk). It's just that I know a significant number people under 80 who had symptoms, but the main point is, for many those symptoms were mild and not a single person required medical intervention.</p>
<p>Truly asymptomatic cases are estimated at up to 50% afaik -- a considerable share but not enough to support your statement that infected people "rarely" have symptoms.</p>

        <p>Glad to see some younger people who feel this way.  Young people are the ones who have almost a 0% chance of being affected by covid in the slightest.  Actually people under 75 have almost a 0% chance of being affected by it.  It is wicked and evil to sacrifice the childhood and futures of the youth because octogenarians may possibly get sick but probably won’t.  Not following their covid rules is the only way we will ever end this nonsense.  There is no debating or reasoning with these mask wearing lunatics.   They have no plans to ever go back to normal under any circumstances.  We will have to disregard their rules, live normally, and drag these nut jobs back to normality kicking and screaming.  Not complying is the only way we end this lockdown social distancing bullshit.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the people who make these decisions are happily working from home. They have an unaffected office job or work safely in government and occasionally wonder what it would be like to feel empathy to the proles who face destitution whilst sunning themselves in their expansive back garden. They've been stuck in their mansion for months. The kids are happily homeschooled with zero distractions. Hubby and wife have not kissed in 30years and are basically self isolating.</p>
<p>They joke about how they have to order food to their door instead of going to get it. They look at their tech stocks and rub their hands together. The takeaways are paid for by by the lack of commuting bills, I mean gas bills they would never be irresponsable enough to use public transport these days.</p>

        <p>Definitely check out YoungRippa59 on Youtube if you haven't already. He's one of my favorite Libertarians that I follow, and he's been debunking the mainstream narrative for a while now.</p>

        <p>You can look at it this way - you found out how the world works in your youth, which really sets you up in life. A lot of people find out in their middle years that the government rarely acts (if ever) in your best interest - and it's up to you to protect your own health, your own livelihood and your family.</p>

        <p>God i feel you so much and i’m 23. I’ve had my highschool graduation years ago. But this year (as in this month) i got my bachelor at  university and it seems likely there will be no ceremony. Which sucks. </p>
<p>I had made a vow last newyear to start going out more with friends and look for a boyfriend. Thats not gonna happen now. I was gonna travel, now i’ve resigned myself to learning the language before i go there instead of learning while traveling as i planned.  </p>
<p>Im annoyed by all this. But i’m older. I cant even imagine how this is impacting the younger adults. The 18 year old graduates who never got their big diploma party and the big ball afterwards. Who never got their “lets mess up the school”-day. And who, as has just bern announced, will now also not get to have a big “introduction week” at their university or colleges as firstyears. (Not sure if thats a thing in other countries but its BIG here and its where i made loads of friends that very first week that lasted me all through uni.) to miss that as well, on top of missing high school graduation must be heartbreaking. And apparently they can join student groups/societies. But since Intro-week is cut out there is hardly any chance to get to know any student groups. All of it is online. Even Hazing is forbidden en any meet ups must take place online. </p>
<p>Its all so pathetic. I’m not even missing thát much at my age. University graduation would have been nice. But its usually more “wear a fancy dress and shake hands with the dean when your name is called” than a proper party. So while im sad im not very very upset. </p>
<p>We all miss so much. Especially the young adults. And it isnt right. Not one bit</p>

        <p>You're still very right to feel dismayed at this. I missed my very final day of high school due to illness and I fucking regret it - wish I had just gone in, illness be damned. It feels so weird to not that have that definitive endpoint to something you invested so much of your life in - it's like it never really finished!</p>

        <p>If I was your age when all this went down, it scares me to think what I would’ve done in retribution. I would love to see the kids with the balls in your generation just go OFF on all these government degenerates. Also welcome to the libertarian side of things. We are pretty chill because we don’t like the government being up our asses. I started to turn when I was your age as well. </p>
<p>Hang in there kid. Some day your generation will get to rule and when it does, I hope you tell the commies of your generation to fuck off while the rest of you clean up the mess after seeing exactly what you do DONT want for the world.</p>

        <p>God bless. There are adults out there who are being vocal about ending this and getting back to normal life for our own sake and for yours. Don't lose hope, it really can't go on forever (like mathmatically it doesnt work; as much as pro lockdowners say "just keep handing out money," it doesnt really work that way for the larger part of the economy) and I do believe that something will cause the optics of needing lockdown to peter out eventually. Hopefully sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>In the meantime, write to your local and state representatives (senator and congresspeople) to let them know how you feel. Copy paste this message if you want and mail it along. As a young person, your voice is unique. They mostly only hear from old people because many young people dont think writing does anything. It does. Use your voice. And take care of yourself! We will get through this...and return to normal.</p>

        <p>More interesting information in regards to Hydroxychloroquine  - DOCTORS LOVE IT, FAUCI HATES IT. WHY?  With so many frontline doctors speaking up on their success treating #Covid19 with a 65-year-old FDA approved malaria drug, many wonder what would motivate our top health officials and social media platforms to silence their voices. Well, The HighWire found one BIG reason.

        <p>&rt;  I went from a socialist Liberal who thought the government’s involvement was the key to every issue to a Libertarian who sees the fucking light now.</p>
<p>I hope there's more and more of this.  Sadly I think it pushed some people into supporting even more government medling but it's definitely made a lot of people realize the government does more harm than good.  </p>
<p>The whole unemployment $600 bonus thing is a perfect example of the deliberate traps the Democrats lay.  People are making more on unemployment and refusing to get jobs, thus keeping them subservient to whoever will give them their $600 fix. All while leaving primarily the middle class to work harder, and pay to keep their subjects afloat.  It's all incredibly evil, yet its the bleeding heart types that fall for it.  People are such fools.</p>

Yeah it does suck staying inside but we need to stop this shit so we can go back to normal. I lost the musical I had been working on 2 months straight, I lost my class trip to Yellowstone which we had raised over $30,000 for over 2 years for, I lost seeing my boyfriend for months, I lost my prom, I lost my graduation, I lost the last 3 months of high school with some people I have knows since I was 3 years old. And I wouldn’t change a thing, I have a dad who is 70 and a mom who is 60, both of them having mild underlying health conditions. The reason we have had to keep the lockdown going on for this long is from idiots like you who want go out and party.</p>

        <p>Gen Z also checking in! I totally disagree. Please, listen to medical professionals and continue taking this virus seriously. It's my senior year, and it sucks having that interrupted, but people's lives are more important.</p>

        <p>Millennial here, actually I kind of the border of Gen Z and Millennial generations... anyhow I think it's important to remember that literally NO ONE wants this. </p>
<p>No one wants to socially distance, no one wants to sit at home and never step outside, no one wants to order Uner eats and cook at home all the damn time.</p>
<p>Also no one blames you (the students) as the reason teachers and schools are hesitant on reopening.</p>
<p>No one blames you for causing this virus. </p>
<p>It's critical that we as a society lose our ego in all of this, we need to drop that selfish attitude we have in this moment. Our selfish desire to do whatever the fuck we want when ever we want to because it's 'our lives being ruined' or whatever bullshit.... because at the end of the day this virus is very new, it's showing signs of having lasting effects on young and old people, and much of the data and details around it are largely speculative and so we just dont know. Which makes it 1000000x more frustrating, I get it. Trust me I do.</p>
<p>We all feel that way. But this is a time in history where we can make sacrifices in our own lives (like going to bars, or parties, or dinner dates) in order to slow this plague and prevent any of us from having to deal with the long term side effects this virus is doing to people. Improvise, adapt, overcome.</p>
<p>What you suggest is selfish, ignorant, and will 100% make this situation last longer than it already has...</p>
<p>Hell, I played virtual beer pong for 4 hours last night with some friends all in different states. Improvise, adapt, overcome. This is not the new 'normal', this is the new reality, and if you don't move with the change you'll be left behind.</p>

        <p>And then spread it further because you're asymptomatic and perpetuating the problem and then more debate of lockdown or not happens and people on both sides (pro or con social distancing, lockdown etc) get disgruntled and fed up with the situation not changing. NEVER FUCKING MIND the blatant selfish disregard for others because mY aGE grOuP Is nOT At RiSK. Its not about the individual but about the community. Which is why this sub disgusts me, I hope you don't honestly believe that because you or OP is safe that it absolved of all responsibility to help participate to alleviate the stress of said pandemic. Btw closing note, if people locked down and distanced with consensus we'd reopen the economy and be "normal" sooner. But let's keep doing ourselves and see how that goes this next school semester.</p>

        <p>How selfish are you? I’m gen z and I am not going to stop wearing my mask because it is safe. Seatbelts aren’t fun but why do you wear them? Because it keeps you safe!!!!! Also the older generation has done SO MUCH for us and I would never risk putting their lives in danger unless absolutely necessary. I love the older generation because at least they aren’t stupid enough to go outside without a mask and touch everything around them. It baffles me that you have so many upvotes from such an entitled post. I hate being part of gen z because we are full of absolute idiots like you who refuse to take mild safety precautions because your bulging and swelling ego won’t let you. I hope that you realize just how wrong you are and what an entitled person your being. Good luck finding a boyfriend when your in a hospital bed. The two of you will have fun talking about how many families lives you could have just altered</p>

        <p>Everyone with this mentality is selfish. How dare you place your life over others? It doesn’t matter if someone is old and is starting to face their sunset months, that doesn’t mean you can go out and be ignorant. What makes you so special that the older generations should bow down to you? And besides, you growing old is not guaranteed, especially not with this attitude.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m also a Gen Z and it did suck to have to miss out on the last year of high school like this, but damn, some of you are so entitled. If it means staying home and taking your classes online to ensure the safety of those around you and yourself, how can you possibly try to justify you risking others getting sick just because you’re missing the “end years of your childhood”? Grow up! You’re not the only one in this position, yet somehow you manage to turn a global pandemic around and focus in on no one other than yourself.</p>
<p>“I deserve the end years of my childhood”. Really? That’s your argument? Look, I don’t want to say the the last years of your childhood doesn’t matter and that you don’t deserve it, because these years do matter and you do deserve to get it, but not at the expense of others. Darling, in case you haven’t realized, this pandemic is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me, than your neighbor, bigger than all of us! You can’t just walk around blindly saying “this virus doesn’t exist because it hasn’t reached me or my personal life!” because it’s impacted more people than you can even imagine. If you go out and don’t listen to what health care officials have to say to keep you safe, it WILL reach you. Act foolish, get foolish results. </p>
<p>There is nothing scarier than ignorant people who think they’re right.</p>

<p>While I respect your right to stay inside and do what is safest for you, I don't think it's fair to impose it on everyone else.</p>
<p>let's flip the argument here; people who want lockdown are saying "I deserve to live in a place where everyone is compliant to the same things I believe in." Someone who believes in lockdown for everyone has ALSO affected more people than they can imagine. The ones advocating for this have caused the deterioration fo other people's mental healths, their economic well being, and even their physical healths. Those who think that lockdown is also saying "nothing else - like loss of social life, mental health, etc. matters because i haven't experienced it myself. it hasn't reached my personal life."   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And I urge you to do your research - many public health officials (though not the ones on the mainstream media) have advocated for going back to school and reopening. Why? because mental health issues are starting to ensue. We act on foolish policies, we get foolish results.</p>

<p>I have actually looked into both sides of this. You know, the side saying “the government is right, listen to them” and the side saying “the government is lying, don’t follow what they say”. However, the only side that’s been able to pull its weight on this is the first one, the one saying to that the government is right. Now don’t get me wrong, I know there are corrupt parts of the government, but when it comes to health, the government is on their a-game.</p>
<p>There are licensed health officials with professional medical training telling us what we need to do to help lower the spread of this virus. Yes, I have seen posts about how things that they say are wrong, such as how masks hurt you more than help you, but I have not seen any of them come from credible sources.</p>
<p>I urge you to go back on every post or article you’ve ever read that has swayed you over to your side of this. Are the people publishing those articles or posts credible? What are their credentials? Is the piece peer-reviewed? Or, is it just someone’s mother who saw a friend spread false information on Facebook and brought it upon their self to tell the world, believing it to be true?</p>
<p>If there is one thing I need everyone to hear, it’s that our health is not a political issue. There’s nothing political about this—or at least, there shouldn’t be. It doesn’t matter what party is in power, regardless of what your party is, the ones in power are looking out for you, even if they don’t hold the same political views that you do.</p>
<p>To touch on your argument about how lockdown has started deteriorating people’s mental health and their physical health, it’s only right to the people who don’t try to make the best out of their situation.</p>
<p>There are many many things people can do while following rules in order to maintain their mental health. For example, what people can do, (at least in my country) is that if they are feeling like they have been isolated from people for too long, they can actually go out, say to a park, and meet with a small group of friends as long as they all have a mask on and distance their self. They can also FaceTime, call, text, or even play video games to stay in touch with those they miss. Not only that, they can go on walks as much as they want, granted they follow the rules of what their government issues. There are many ways to help keep your mental health healthy while going through this, you just have to actually think about it instead of complaining about what’s going on. </p>
<p>In terms of physical health, there’s also options while in times like now. You can do home friendly workouts. You don’t need gym equipment to see results, that’s just what people say to their self to make things seem worse than what they actually are. If you live in a house, you can do almost anything with body weight workouts. And for those in an apartment, there are PLENTY of no-jump and no-run workouts on YouTube to be found for you. Once your 2 week quarantine is done, you could also go on a run or walk as well. The only difference is that you can’t go to the gym, but even with that, it’s not a big deal. </p>
<p>There is no excuse to put your own political views above the health and safety of others. That would just make you another entitled person thinking they are too good to follow what everyone else has to. Yes, I understand that as humans we need that social connection, and given the technological advancements, we can actually do that while separated in the comforts of our own home. There’s no reason to have to risk getting others sick. We live in a digital age now. We can maintain our social connections through social platforms. I know this isn’t normal for us to do, but we are not living in a normal time. What part of a global pandemic is normal?</p>

<p>actually, there are ALSO licensed professionals who have said that lockdowns don't actually work and it simply delays the spike in cases. You have made an arbitrary determination that the government is somehow right in this. I also have read peer-reviewed articles and talk about the consequences of the lockdown and surveyed both sides. I've also observed the data to see patterns and I can easily tell you that the lockdowns are likely not as effective as we think they are, otherwise. It's up to you to believe what you want to believe, but its also up to me to make the same judgment. There are always multiple ways to interpret data. I want to remind you that even in science, there is an art to it; it is imperfect so there are scientists who may come out on both ends of the spectrum.  Assuming we are both rational people, to each their own.</p>
<p>To touch on this point, I don't think the gov is necessarily lying, but i DO think it's one of the "road to hell is paved with good intentions" scenario. They're operating out of fear as opposed to logic.</p>
<p>I urge you to take a look at some of the articles you've been reading and see how the data is presented to you. If they say a "spike" in cases, does that truly imply that there has been a "spike" in cases? If they say there is permanent lung damage due to covid, ask yourself, how would they know if the virus has only been around for 6 months or so? There are many other illnesses that take months to recover from, and we've never freaked out and closed all schools bc of it. As much as I will take a look and evaluate my sources, I hope you do too.</p>
<p>Additionally, you err when you think that my views are political. I am actually not being political at all. I am stating that there are consequences that come out of the lockdown that may not be tangible at first but could have long term effects. This has nothing to do with my political views. you making that assumption is where the problem lies. You're assuming I'm acting on politics. No. you and I just have come to different conclusions as to what should be prioritized. To insinuate this is political is absolutely presumptuous.</p>
<p>You say I can maintain social connection through social media platforms, and use gyms at home, etc. for the "safety of others." I don't see why people who have higher risk tolerances can't go out, while people who have lower risk tolerances stay home? Why impose it on everyone? If you are so afraid, then you stay home, and be comfortable in your own home. No one is stopping you. You can get your grocery delivered, and order delivery/take out. We have the technology for you to order everything to your door just like how we have the technology to maintain our social media networks no? They don't have to go outside right? That's also a good alternative right?  it's analogous to asking me to maintain my social connections online, and using a makeshift gym.</p>
<p>I think each individual has different risk tolerances and values different things, so they should act according to those values. If you value survival so much, then take steps to make sure you survive - by staying at home, and staying away from other people. If someone else values social connection, mental health, and even their physical health (once again, I have to emphasize that mental health CAN AND OFTEN DOES LEADS to physical health problems), then they should act accordingly. everyone is responsible for their own health and have the right to take steps they think works best for them.</p>

        <p>This made me almost cry! I just finished my freshman year of college and you put into words precisely the anger and frustration I’ve felt at having what’s supposed to be the best (and last) years of my youth ripped away from me for no reason. I’m moving back to college next week, but with so much safety theater and bullshit guidelines I don’t even know if it’s worth it. Our generation is being forced to grow up too quickly and give up everything that makes life worth living “for the greater good”, and is it even a little bit worth it? NO!</p>
<p>I hope you’re able to find your youth again very soon. Those 100 days are gone, unfortunately, but another 100 days are starting now and you will be able to make the best of them. Go to live shows! Pay with fucking cash! Hug your friends! Go on dates!! Youth is NOT meant to be spent inside, cowering at a disease that won’t kill you or (based on the odds being so low) anyone you care about (OR anyone’s grandma, unless they happen to get a really unlucky draw). Good on you, and good luck!</p>

        <p>YOU are part of the fucking reasons we’ll have to stay like this for years. If you had more than 3 braincells you’d understand that wearing masks and social distancing lowers community transition. New Zealand did exactly this, they immediately started wearing masks and social distancing, they haven’t had any community transitions for over 100 days, and they lifted all safety measures which means they can go back to normal. meanwhile america is over here with 70’000 new cases PER DAY because idiots are not wearing masks, going outside, going to parties, not social distancing, and not caring. Also do you realize that you can still die from covid?? Just because you’re young doesn’t mean you’re immune. Im 15 almost 16 and extremely high risk, if i get covid i will 100% die. If yall want want to stop living your lives at home, think for once and do what health officials say, like wearing masks and social distancing.</p>

        <p>its been 5 months because not everyone has been taking precautions. People are still protesting against masks and social distancing, people are having parties, and do you know where that went? it lead to america having the most cases, now because of idiots who think they dont need to do jackshit America will have to stay like that for alot longer. And guess whats making it worse? People like you, who dont give a fuck. You “took precautions” in the beginning but now you aren’t. Thats leading places like America downhill, if you guys were anything like New Zealand you’d have a normal life, they wore masks, they social distanced, they didn’t protest against masks, now they get to lift all restrictions because they haven’t had any community transitions in over 100 days. YOU people are selfish because YOU are spreading the virus and killing people</p>

        <p>Everyone agrees that lockdown sucks, but fuck, have some perspective. I hate to break it to anyone that agrees with the original post, but your final two months of school being on zoom and having to wear a mask in front of your boyfriend are not worth the death of anyone’s grandma. Yo he childhood would be much worse without parents, wouldn’t it? Most people are having a harder time than you in this pandemic, so stop being selfish, suck it up and wear your mask.</p>

        <p>Tbh I like my grandma and would me willing to put a thin piece of cloth over my mouth for the rest of my life if it kept her alive. It doesn’t cause me any pain.

        <p>I fail to see how one being a coronavirus and the other being an influenza virus makes any difference from a public policy standpoint. They're both respiratory viruses that can spread asymptomatically, and seasonal flu kills tens of thousands of Americans a year, even with a vaccine.</p>

        <p>The flu still kills people. The flu vaccine is only 40%-60%~ effective if we use that as the baseline model. How <em>dare</em> you even think of going outside and risking the lives of others with that? You have to rot inside your house forever until the risk of death is 0.</p>

        <p>Yes I fear it - its human righ? but the flu doesn't fuck such a large population up as much as covid does. It is due to people getting vaccines and taking precautions. Making parts of the population immune.</p>
<p>The flu estimated kill rate compared to the flu is from what I found on Google (2020-2021) is half of what covid has claimed - 157,631 deaths just this year in US alone (as of August 6th).</p>
<p>I don't understand why you assume I want to hide indoors like it's a nuclear holocaust out there, I won't go full lock yourself up - Trust me, lockdown in the UK sucked, - but realising to take actions such as wearing a mask is a minimum For the protection of others and myself. </p>
<p>A person needs to start somewhere right, to help everyone and avoiding mass spread throughout big gatherings is one of them. </p>
<p>I don't think you will realise how much it affects people, the socialisation and such, until you've been personally affected, bit be kind to others and tale actions to save others.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that's hate speech.</p>
<p>JK :P The thing is, people die from respiratory viruses all the time. The flu killed about 60,000 Americans during the 2017/18 flu season. In principle, we could have reduced that number if we locked down, social distanced, and maybe wore masks for a few months. Do you think we should have?</p>
<p>Right now, COVID is on its way out throughout the western world, including the US. The prospect of a second wave seems increasingly unlikely. In Canada, there were five COVID deaths yesterday. Five! In a country of 37 million. And yet the mask mandates are spreading like wildfire. How on earth is this justified? Why do we attach so much disproportionate importance to COVID deaths, as opposed to deaths from other causes? Could you imagine if we did that with traffic? "Yesterday, X people died in highway accidents, so effective immediately, the speed limit on all highways will be reduced to 35 mph." It's insane.</p>

        <p>So basically you want to put everyone in danger for your own selfish “needs”? You’re gonna have plenty of time to date, party and do whatever you want when this is all over, your life does not stop when you reach adulthood. There are plenty of 20-something year olds who still party, get wasted, date and enjoy their lives</p>
<p>You will not die from waiting a lil longer to party and do meaningless shit you’re still gonna have the chance to do when this is all over, on the other hand by not wearing a mask and social distancing you put yourself and others at risk of dying.

        <p>&rt; Those 100 days are worth so much more than someone’s decrepit last one’s dying in a nursing home</p>
<p>While I agree with, and encourage your anger, I'm going to take issue here.  I am not in a nursing home, but certainly am old enough to be one of the at risk groups.</p>
<p>If I am incredibly lucky, I get 20 more summers. Statistically closer to 10.  I can count them on my fingers.   I just lost one.  That's a spring and summer I will never get back.  No spring training.  No back yard bbqs.  No outdoor concerts.  (I live for live music). No nothing.</p>
<p>So kindly fuck off your moral equivalency.   You've got a lot of summers to look forward to.  We all got robbed, and some of us more than you.</p>
<p>Edit:  I love this subreddit.  And I am really disappointed at the response I've received.  I am not advocating anything here.  I receive downvotes and totally irrelevant comments simply because of a fair opinion.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but a 16 year old has not lost more because of lockdown than I have.   We have all lost.  It is arguable that those with fewer remaining days loose proportionally more.  If you disagree, make a comment and we can discuss it.  But the comments to date are shameful and more appropriate to the intelligence level of /r/Coronavirus .</p>

<p>We should shutdown society because 90% of Covid patients can't control what they put in their mouths? A lockdown on heart disease would mean most people have to change their diet completely. Food for thought -- it's one of the safe foods.</p>

        <p>no because you’re afraid to be called out and not accepted by society thus ending up alone and so-called isolated. this will make you feel lonely and the same thing with that pussy doctor. therefore you conform to societal expectations to gain some feeling of being part of the group. same shit every cuck has been doing since childhood. i was like you until i noticed this truth, and i do not want people to like me. good luck</p>

        <p>I understand your frustration and you are partially right. Your government reacted way too late and now everyone is paying the price. Keep that in mind for when you are old enough to vote and make a change. </p>
<p>Referring to the virus as a cold however is wrong. While it might not be dangerous to you directly, it could eventually still shorten your life span or even kill you. Recent studies suggest that many people who were infected have suffered permanent damage to their hearts and/or brains. We simply know too little about the long term consequences to become careless.</p>
<p>Also you shouldn't only think about yourself. Sure, you are currently missing out on a lot of fun, new experiences and life in general. But it's not the end of the world. You can still find ways to enjoy yourself, acquire new skills, like many others have.
Think about what the "doomers", like you call them, went through at your age. When my grandma was in her teens she suffered through war and struggled to survive. And you can't even stay at home to protect people like her? That's just sad.</p>

        <p>You do realize most of the lockdown now is not being enforced by the government, right? I mean socialist or libertarian, be whatever you want. But schools or counties are making the individual choices to close or open. Companies are making the decisions to require masks in their stores outside of government mandates. 
You have the right to get sick if you want but do your parents have health issues? You do realize this virus has long term health effects, right? 
You may be fine, but it’s not just old people that are going to suffer harsh consequences for getting the virus. You very well could get extremely sick on the off chance ur body’s immune system sucks at fighting this particular virus. </p>
<p>No one was ever asking you to be an acquiescent government-praising citizen and it would be really horrible if you ever were that. This fucking sucks for everyone but this sort of reaction isn’t good for anyone. My only advice is to try to make the best out of this time, not go full doomer.</p>

        <p>Fascism is when the government rules through the cooperation of business. Unless you're a fool, you know that any businesses which do not cooperate with illegal government diktats are fined, have their licenses revoked, and then are physically shut down by the police.</p>

        <p>The fact you would rather have someone die instead of waiting a couple years for things you have the rest of your life for is incredibly narrow minded and selfish. Dates aren’t going anywhere, neither are friends nor live experiences. Learn patience instead of valuing getting this right this moment over someone’s fucking life.</p>

        <p>&rt;waiting a couple years for things you have the rest of your life for</p>
<p>OP mentioned prom being missed, so I assume she's either a Junior or Senior. And Prom is one of those hallmark social events in a high-schooler's life</p>
<p>People could choose, in normal times, to go or skip it, and leave whatever regrets they have to themselves.</p>
<p>But this year and possibly next, Juniors and Seniors had no choice. They couldn't partake in such a social moment, that choice being taken away permanently for the rest of their time in high school.</p>
<p>So regardless whatever you think of Prom (I didn't like my experience personally but I'm still glad I tried and went), this proves your statement is partly wrong as there are things OP will miss forever if this lockdown continues</p>

        <p>Also the whole <em>things you have the rest of your life for</em> line is pure bullshit. Not only are you only a kid once and many of those experiences cannot be had as an adult or are simply not the same when older, but any one of us could die at any time, and there are kids and young people who won't live a couple more years. Who are destined to die in an accident, suicide, be murdered, die of cancer. So many kids and young people who don't live to see a couple more years. All we have is <strong><em>now</em></strong>. This is something I personally learnt very young, I guess this poster still has not.</p>
<p>So no, I will NOT wait. I will not. Not all of us have the rest of our lives for living, some of us will die tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Yeah but people die of sicknesses all the time and even then their lives DO matter. The difference here is that we don’t have a vaccine yet. People will still die with the vaccine but the numbers are less than without it. It is hard to stay indoors all the time but that is what we need to do right now because if we don’t then we will regret it in the future. That’s not an opinion that’s a fact and there are articles all over the internet that will tell you that along with scientific proof.</p>

        <p>No. Lockdowns are not evidence based. The vulernable are not even protected by lockdowns - even they are being harmed and even dying as a result. It's like burning down a house because there was a daddy long legs spider somewhere inside, but the spider snuck out the window regardless.</p>
<p>It is the hysterical and tunnel visioned lockdowns that will be regretted in the future. The harm being done and deaths caused...</p>

        <p>I’m assuming that the spider sneaking out is meant to represent the virus still being able to get into your home which is correct however the chance of you getting it in your home is almost zero. Now let’s say you went outside your house and got the virus. It’s already known that you don’t get symptoms the first 14 days so imagine you now have it and an old woman is outside walking to the supermarket and you walk by with no mask and less than six feet from her. She now has an extremely high chance of getting the virus. Now unlike young people like yourself she has a weaker immune system. So now let’s say you did give her the virus. So now she has a much higher chance of dying and also might spread the virus to someone else. This is why it is so important you wear a mask and stay home. So what if you waste a year of your life at home. It’s much better than being part of the cause of someone’s death.</p>

        <p>No, the spider sneaking out was the virus doing what is was always going to do regardless of the non evidence-based decisions governments made. That is, spread. Now you're showing you don't at all understand the evidence of how this virus is spreading. Clue - it's not in passing at the supermarket. An elderly woman does not have an <em>extremely high</em> chance of getting the virus because you passed by less than 6ft (an entirely made up number just like the 1m, 1.5m, 2m etc rules made up by other countries) from her. </p>
<p>The flu shot has limited efficacy, and differs year by year. You take the fact that there is a vaccine to mean you're all good to live your life and your body is no longer a bioweapon as you believe it is now ready to pass the virus to your family, friends, and colleagues who may then assassinate someone vulnerable. This is not the case. There has always been a chance that you are part of a viral chain  - even the common cold can cause deadly complications in vulernable people  - that leads to someone at risk. Always. The at risk have <strong><em>always</em></strong> been at risk and this is nothing new. Why didn't you do your part and NEVER leave your house? </p>
<p>No, I won't give up a year of my life and haven't done so. Staying isolated in my home would kill me.</p>
<p>My great uncle is dead because he was killed by these polices under the guise of saving his life. He stopped eating and it was torture for him being entirely isolated. He is far from the only elderly person to die or deteriorate rapidly in health by being "saved", and to die a far worse and prolonged death entirely alone. Hint - isolation is incredibly harmful and leads to increased morbidity and mortality. </p>
<p>Lockdowns is killing people, young and old, and are set to cause countless deaths long-term as a consequence. But sure, pretend you're saving lives when the fact is that studies are showing that lockdowns didn't change a thing except to increase the harm to everyone while not protecting the most vulnerable. </p>
<p>Hope you stay inside forever because viruses will always exist and will always kill people.</p>

        <p>The thing about the elderly woman was a thought. It’s a made up scenario where she had a weak immune system and no the lockdown isn’t killing people. I don’t want to sound insensitive but your uncle wasn’t killed because of lockdown he just got the virus. You have no proof that shows he was killed because of lockdown</p>

<p>There's your problem. You are making things up and have no knowledge. </p>
<p>&rt;No the lockdown isn't killing people</p>
<p>Um what planet are you living on? It has killed people and will continue to kill people for years to come as a consequence. This is factual, again a case of you being ignorant. Lack of knowledge and awareness on your part right there.</p>
<p>&rt;your uncle wasn't killed because of lockdown he just got the virus </p>
<p>He didn't get the virus. Surprise - more people are dying from causes that are not this virus, than those dying <em>with</em> and <em>assumed with</em> the virus (we don't know how many deaths were actually as a result of the virus itself, due to how they've been counted around the world). He had Alzheimer's and like many, having no family visit and only seeing a masked nurse for a few moments a few times a day his health rapidly deteriorated physically and mentally. This is a KNOWN consequence of isolation  - you've clearly never studied the health impacts - <strong><em>I have</em></strong> so was well aware and so were governments. His last months where hell, and he pretty much starved to death and did so alone.</p>
<p>This is happening to many who are elderly in care homes. Their health has deteriorated and many have or will die as a result. Lockdowns didn't even protect care homes from the virus and many of your governers there  actually put virus patients in these nursing homes while you say at home pretending you were saving lives.</p>

        <p>Sorry, it sounded like he died from the virus when you said he died from following the guidelines. Also I agree you should have been able to see your uncle whether Alzheimers or COVID. The other thing is what do you mean by lockdown? To me lockdown means staying at home which doesn’t kill you. COVID kills you when you leave home and either you or someone else doesn’t distance themself. Now I don’t think it is ok to go seeing friends and family because it’s fun. That is spreading the virus for no reason other than for your own entertainment. Last thing is the made up scenario still makes sense because that has happened already. Someone spread the virus to someone else and the person they gave it to died because they didn’t stay six feet apart.</p>

        <p>I would advise you to look more into the facts and research a bit more, and not just look at the sources that have sensationalist headlines. </p>
<p>The flu or basically any other disease kills far more children than corona has. </p>
<p>Nobody sacrificed parts of their life for the flu virus, which killed 80,000 people in the US in 2018.. they don't do it for tuberculosis which kills 1.5 million a year, or having people not die from hunger. And they don't care about mitigating a lot of other preventable deaths.
I feel like it's a low blow to call in the emotional aspect, "but people are dying!" People die from many things, and this is pretty far down on the list. If people really cared about the public's health, they would be talking about how important it is to eat healthy and get exercise, and get social contact and connect with other people.</p>
<p>If the world's going to shut down because of a virus, it should be a virus that's worth shutting down from.</p>

        <p>Thank you for having a civil discussion with me and sharing your opinion instead of thinking a downvote will change my mind haha !! the issue I find with this is there are so many different sources saying different things about numbers, what’s effective and what’s not and I think me and a lot of other people have no idea what I should believe. I just see posts like this and one thing we know for sure is people are dying; and  the selfishness of it rubs me the wrong way. I would be totally open to taking measures like this for the flu etc, of course not on such in a fear mongering way, but like, I dunno man. It’s a lot to unpack</p>

        <p>The fact that you expect young people to sacrifice years of their lives is selfish and wicked.  You’re in the wrong sub.  No one here is going to pat you on the back for being a self centered, entitled, narcissist because you virtue signal and pretend to give a shit about anyone other than yourself.</p>

        <p>Years? Dude it’s a few months and by “living their life” they are not only putting old people’s lives at risk but their kids/grandkids. My dad fell into a deep depression when my grandma died. It’s not just old people whose lives will be altered, it’s there families too.</p>

        <p>It was for 2 weeks six months ago.  It’s going to be years unless we just don’t comply with it.  Sorry someone’s 80 year old sick grandmother died.  You can’t just shut down the world because some old people died slightly earlier than they might have.  Me being at a restaurant or at a carnival or wherever has no impact on your elderly grandmother anyway.  The whole this is nonsense and we are done with it.  We’re going on with our lives.</p>

        <p>Ok at this point we are both just repeating the same thing over and over again so after this I’m not going to be responding anymore but I have one last thing to say and that is going to a carnival or restaurant can have an impact and can make you or someone else sick and you caring more about entertainment and fun stuff more than an actual human life is selfish.</p>

        <p>Yep. I’m selfish and I do not care if someone thinks they died because a stranger went to a carnival.  I don’t care at all.  Your argument is defeated, clown.</p>
