    <strong>The Scientific Dictatorship &amp; the Brainwashing of the Masses</strong>
    <p><p>Numerous scientific studies that have been conducted reveal that on a global level, people's IQs and Intelligence have steadily declined in the last 10 years. Public and Private schools, beginning at kindergarten all the way to PHD. Degrees are using deliberate social engineering educational programs designed to lower intelligence, reduce critical thinking skills and diminish creativity. These teaching methodologies are carefully branded to convince parents and students that they are actually producing more intelligent and educated children and adults, when in reality, these new educational programs like Common Core are designed to program the minds of students not to critically think or use Logic &amp; Reason, thus "Dumbing Down" generations of students. The average parent has no idea that Common Core was designed by Sir Julian Huxley, the brother of Sir Aldous Huxley who conceived the SCIENTIFIC DICTATORSHIP. The SCIENTIFIC DICTATORSHIP was an elite class that could effectively enslave the masses through scientific mind control, brainwashing, indoctrination, hypnotic techniques, drugs and propaganda. Aldous Huxley said that "In a truly effective SCIENTIFIC DICTATORSHIP, the elite could brainwash the masses to actually enjoy being the slaves of the elite and they would have absolutely no idea that they were being brainwashed and they could be programed to love their duties as slaves."</p></p>

        <p>See my last post, I was almost flunked years ago out of college for questioning Common Core. Then Outcome based education. I majored in art ed, do you think I loved the bean counters trying to destroy all creativity? Our elite are lost causes. I always felt a disconnection from the wealthier "academics" and other types, when I was younger some gave me the attitude, you are so intelligent but "so radical", and "such a challenging thinker". I knew by the time I was 20, I didn't fit in anywhere for not conforming". People have been dumbed down. I am autistic, with that can come major lacks, but also gifts for some of us. They have been dumbing down the population for a long time. They have indoctrinated that thinking creative thoughts alone, makes you a "threat".</p>

        <p>Of course it was brainwashing, the same simple terms constantly repeated everywhere you went or listened to or looked at, things like calling a genetic treatment "the jab" to bring it into pop culture and minimise it for the simpletons</p>
<p>"Stay safe" constantly repeated as some kind of subliminal message on every poster , news item , shop doorway, fucking hell you would think when you stepped out the front door you were stepping into 1940's Stalingrad with Erwin Konig waiting to pop you off everytime you turned a corner instead of walking out in your own neigbourhood where someone might have a cold</p>

        <p>I noticed a big change mid 1980s.</p>
<p>Doing A levels (1988) we were actively encouraged to read around topics, form an opinion and be able to support it.</p>
<p>However by the time I graduated (1993) education felt much more like "here's your book list. Read them and regurgitate in essay format to get a degree".</p>
<p>And for reference, I did A levels at a 'bog standard' comprehensive school and degree at a very well regarded UK redbrick University.</p>
