<title>As a swede Im legit tired of listening to what a safe haven we are. It's all a bunch of bullshit. Our state and media are just as bad. The only thing that differs us is that society is open and we dont need masks. They pretty much force vax and discredit anyone who opposes. It's evil in another form</title>

        <p>Yeah, you're no better off here. They open society up during the summer for a month or two, before locking parts down again and ruining businesses etc. It's the exact same psychos as everywhere else. The difference is that swede's have this idea that we're free so it's hard for the government to do hard lockdowns etc. What they do instead is do it slowly, then every swede rolls over and accepts whatever they do to us.</p>

        <p>The harshest restrictions we had was pubs and restaurants having to close earlier. We havent had lockdowns, so compared to most of the world we’ve had it real good which is also why we only had like a thousand protestors at most against the pandemic law. </p>
<p>No need to lockdown the Swede though, the typical Swede will bend over to the government and let their asses get fucked. They already did for decades letting in so many immigrants. </p>
<p>Swedes will get vaccinated even without threats of lockdowns unfortunately</p>

        <p>Yeah. I was at the "biggest" one so far. We had the police shut us down at Slussen. We couldn't get past the bridge. Half of the people just turned around and left within 5 minutes. The rest just stood there till a group of us picked a police car up and move it so we could pass.</p>

        <p>I left Canada recently because it's going completely Orwellian... Sweden is not a safe haven but it's much better than the countries actually forcing the vax and mask.
Where I am now, I am no longer harrassed for having common sense or threatened with segregation from society.
Maybe you should go to Canada or UK to experience the real difference.</p>

        <p>For a girl like me, who has lost the will to live due to the harsh winter lockdowns and strict mask mandates we had in "responsible" Western Europe, what you're describing <strong>does</strong> sound like a safe haven. It's sad the world is so dystopian and unfree, you're right, but some places <strong>are</strong> a lot closer to sanity than others. I spent every day this winter feeling lonely, scared, defeated, suffocated, dehumanized. There were so many days I was on the verge of tears for hours at a time. Last spring was bad, but this winter broke me. I would have given anything to have a loving guy to hold and to not be harassed by policemen whenever I wanted to breath fresh air for even one minute.

        <p>You're not weak, you're abused. I know it's hard and scary, it is for all of us who can see what's happening. You have to try to look at all of this with clear eyes. I didn't write all of this because I'm an ungrateful person who got more freedoms than you do and still complain.</p>
<p>I wrote this because we can't let these sadistic people bribe us with pennies, as in swedens case, and our reaction is immediatly to look at it as gold. This isn't freedom.</p>
<p>As I've written before, in some cases it's better that the abuser goes all in right away, this wakes more people up. What sweden's government is doing is the exact same thing as yours, just slower. This way people get a chance to adjust to these minor changes, while still getting trapped deeper and deeper. Once again, I'm really sorry about the state you're forced to live in.</p>

        <p>Dude. Don't exaggerate.
There have been some stupid rules here like restaurant having to close at 8 o'clock but it hasn't come close to the BS that is happening in other countries. </p>
<p>I personally haven't noticed much vaccine shaming but it may still exist, I just haven't seen it. 
There have been no talks at all about demanding vaccine papers at restaurants and other places.</p>
<p>You say it yourself, the society is open and we don't need mask. That is a huge difference from most other countries. But of course, Sweden has a bunch of doomers as well but I think that is a small minority.</p>

        <p>Full of shit? Take it easy. 
I clearly stated that in my experience there wasn't alot of vaccine propaganda but clearly you have noticed it. I try to stay away from garbage newspapers but I follow the regular updates on SVT.se and listen when Anders Tegnell speaks. </p>
<p>This summer I have been able to live my life just like normal. I wasn't even asked for vaccine papers when arriving from abroad. </p>
<p>I hate this damn propaganda just as much as you do but when I read how life has been in countries like UK, France, Spain, Canada, Australia etc then I'm just happy to be living in Sweden where human rights is still a thing.</p>

        <p>Human rights are not a thing here. You know what you are? You're a pet that's been abused and ended up at another abuser that just abuses you less. Now you look at your abuser as your savior because you don't want to go back to where you were at.  </p>
<p>It doesn't change that your still an abused pet. I'm sorry if I came off harsh, I'm just tired of listening to this shit about swedes giving a shit about human rights. Sweden loves to portray as we do, yet we support dictators, export weapons to radicals and actively help governments to surpress freedom.   </p>

        <p>Am I downplaying it? I literally said there were a bunch of stupid rules. 
But comparing Sweden to the other tyrannical countries is just plain exaggeration. </p>
<p>There have been: no masks, no lockdowns, no stay at home orders, no school closured for my children,  no mass testing for people without symptoms,  no talk of vaccine passport for entering restaurants, no forced isolation for travellers etc. </p>

        <p>Practically. At least in the capital and the larger cities. Lots and lots of places that don't take cash. There's even a pretty big group fighting this where they gather a list of all the businesses that do not take cash and boycott them.   </p>
<p>They've closed pretty much all the offices that handle cash in the banks.</p>

I would say that swedens strategy is even more barbaric as it slowly imposes fascism without the people even understanding what is going on.

        <p>Yes I know, I was also refering to other vaccines that are given to toddlers. I have nothing against them so my children have taken all of them. </p>
<p>What I dont want them taking is TBE, Covid, and HPV or whatever its called. At least not for now.</p>
<p>The thing I find hardest right now is being polite when I respond to the same question. ”Have you been vaccinated?” And ”Why not?”. I dont like insulting people but soon I will go 100% honest.</p>

        <p>Honestly all of that is a bunch of crap to distract you from the real problems. I'm not afraid of us becoming an islamic state, at least not as of now. The real problem is the cancer in all our western governments that work to destroy us and our way of living. If you're wasting your time on hating and being afraid of people for being different, you're as duped as those idiots who stick a needle with the vax in their arm.   </p>
<p>If we get rid of these cancerogenic leaders, we can solve the rest too.</p>

        <p>As a hospital worker in Sweden that treats many trauma patients I can confirm(at least in my area) that almost all gun wounds, stab wounds and major abuse is immigrants hurting each other. Unfortunately that is the truth and it maybe sounds rough but I think Sweden maybe let in a little too many refugees a few years ago and don't have the capacity to properly take care of all of them.</p>

        <p>You should try come to Brazil then, here the state thugs will beat you, threat you and close you for good, maybe arrest you if you're not polite enough, someone who is scared will call the cops on you because you're not distancing and the mob will applaud all of this.</p>
<p>Then we have the approved forced vaccination and mask mandate, it was much worse because before the today's law, we were almost forced to use masks in households of more than 5 people, even though, a family of 5 were almost jailed because of "gathering of religious ceremonies" because they were praying together, there was even a politician that wanted to forcefully extract blood from people, but this receives heavy backlashes.</p>

        <p>True, besides that Sweden is one of the most communistic countries and with biggest bureaucracies which means everything takes 100 time slower. So all measures in other countries will come later. Problem with this communist bureaucratic machinery is that when it takes over nothing can stop it with no mercy nor empathy.
Swedes are already mentally occupied and programmed from kindergarten and they will willingly accept all measures.</p>

        <p>&rt;we don't need masks</p>
<p>No one is saying Sweden is heaven. </p>
<p>If you are a purist then sure, anything and anything short of 2019 is unacceptable.</p>
<p>But trust me, I live in a country where we had an outdoor mask mandate for the last 18 months, and I don't think they have any plans to ever remove it. It's enforced with 800 USD fines even if you are alone outdoors in the middle of nowhere and 40 C (120 F) heat.</p>
<p>Sweden seems like heaven in comparison.</p>
<p>You should definitely fight the good fight, but once in a while count your blessings, the rest of the world has it much much much worse than you.</p>
