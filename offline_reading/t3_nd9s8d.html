    <strong>My previously healthy, active, non-overweight, 37 year old coworker got a stroke a week after taking the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>So, a one of my coworkers got the vaccine a while back. I’m not sure which one. After the appointment, he wasn’t feeling well. Called out sick three days. He said his arm was extremely sore. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, he thought he was experiencing arm soreness due to the fact he was in an accident a few years back, and then he wasn’t feeling well. He could not lift any heavy objects. He began to experience drooping of his left side of his face, and weakness of the left side. </p>
<p>Apparently recently, his whole entire left side is weak now, and it’s been concluded he had a mini stroke. He’s out for an unknown amount of time now, and I’m not sure if he’s coming back. </p>
<p>I know anyone can get a stroke, but it seems so conveniently timed. I’m not saying that the vaccine definitely caused it, but if you’re going to attribute random ailments to Covid, this seems a lot more direct than that.</p></p>

        <p>Um yes .. just a "coincidence". One of the reason they are desperate to get as many vaccinated as possible up to 70 % is to hide the side effects. Pfizer CEO already said that if you inject a high amount of peoples, and some of them die or get injured in close proximity of the vaccines, there is absolutely no proof it was vaccine`s fault because things like this happens randomly to everyone during their lifetime.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Eg: Inject 10.000 peoples -&rt; 100 die in close proximity of the shot -&rt; Pfizer CEO says it`s a coincidence and they would`ve died anyway given the high number of peoples injected -&rt; get away with it because it actually makes sense and you have no way to prove otherwise.</p>

        <p>They'll have to do some dancing when 5 year olds start having strokes from the vaccine.  They'll have to come up with some other excuse besides coincidence.</p>
