        <p>No he wouldn’t, you moron.</p>
<p>Go watch his skit on germs on YouTube:</p>
<p><em>Let me tell you a true story about immunization okay?</em></p>
<p><em>When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River and it was filled with raw sewage okay? We swam in raw sewage! You know... to cool off! And at that time, the big fear was polio; thousands of kids died from polio every year but you know something? In my neighbourhood, no one ever got polio! No one! Ever! You know why? Cause we swam in raw sewage! It strengthened our immune systems! The polio never had a prayer; we were tempered in raw shit! So personally, I never take any special precautions against germs. I don’t shy away from people that sneeze and cough, I don’t wipe off the telephone, I don’t cover the toilet seat, and if I drop food on the floor, I pick it up and eat it! Yes I do. Even if I’m at a sidewalk café! In Calcutta! The poor section! On New Year’s morning during a soccer riot! And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behaviour, I never get infections, I don’t get them, I don’t get colds, I don’t get flu, I don’t get headaches, I don’t get upset stomach, you know why? Cause I got a good strong immune system and it gets a lot of practice.</em></p>

<p>If you’re scared stay home is the best answer to all of this. America is so entitled they think they deserve to go to Red Robin on Friday night. But you need to be vaccinated so they can do it safely. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>Carlin was a big leftist and so I seriously doubt he would have been anti-covid vax. In the same rant that quote is from, he talks about your body needing germs to practice on - which is literally what vaccines are intended to essentially do, without having the risk of a fully live infection being introduced to you. The particular rant also is mostly against OCD-levels of cleaning everything into total sterility, which has some truth to it, because it's basically how certain groups of people (uncontacted tribes, most native peoples in history, etc) have no immunity against anything we bring to them when we contact them, unintentionally or otherwise. I also wouldn't recommend anyone try swimming in sewage to strengthen their immune system. Besides, he was a comedian, and so to a certain degree, it goes without saying that not everything he said was intended to be taken 100% seriously or at face value.</p>
<p>That being said and out of the way, go to Dragoncon if you want. The vaccine is free and readily available for walk-ins, no appointment needed, and for free - you can even get the J&amp;J shot, a one-dose vaccine and not need additional shots. Effectively, everyone's had a chance up to now to take it, and anyone who doesn't, well, it's on them to take that risk. The chances of getting severely ill or dying if you're vaccinated are so low, that we can say with near-certainty that basically no one is going to die or get sick at Dragoncon who didn't opt to take that risk. It's fine to encourage general public safety, I guess? But also totally unnecessary, it's not like people aren't aware by now of the virus or the risks, so their PSA isn't really making anyone go, "Oh yeah, haha, forgot about the last 1.5 years! Thanks for the reminder." Just kind of drawing unnecessary political attention to themselves, really.</p>

<p>No, he wasn’t.  He specifically mentions not being involved or caring about politics.  He refers to himself as an observer.  So get your facts straight, buddy.</p>
<p>And even if you say some of his ideals were leftist, a big part of that was being anti censorship.  Which is now a strictly right wing position.</p>

        <p>He was pro pot, anti war, anti religion (or at least organized religion), spoke about corruption, including with big pharma and corporations and not just politicians, made fun of pro life positions... He definitely hated both parties because both parties are corrupt, but... I am not sure how those don't qualify as largely leftist views. I really don't think it's much of a debate. He was pretty obviously liberal.</p>

        <p>Most of these things you can argue go either way, you have libertarian-leaning Republicans, you have pro-gun Democrats like myself, etc. Most people do not fit into A or B, most people are 80% A or B and then 20% of the other. If you word things the way you want, any particular issue can be left or right. Schwarzenegger was big on environment, Romney started the precursor to the ACA, Biden hardened drug laws, Jimmy Carter was pro-life and started the WIC program to encourage women to go through with rearing children, Nixon started the EPA, etc. Name a person and you can probably find a position that appears not to fit.</p>
<p>The point is that what matters is everything on the aggregate, not just one issue and nit-picking them one at a time. Carlin said when he voted, he'd find someone he thinks is stupid, ask who they're voting for, then vote for the opposite - not out of fealty to who he voted for, but because he thought this hypothetical person is so dumb that he didn't want them to have their vote "count". So, with that in mind, who in general do you think Carlin would most often find dumb, and thus who do you think he would have most of the time voted for?</p>
<p>Not liking pharma companies also doesn't entitle me to be anti-covid vaccine. I'm supportive of the vaccine because 1) I just want to not have to deal with restrictions, they exist whether I like it or not, and I don't, and 2) because fewer people seem to die when they take it. I don't think they should be owned by those private companies and we just subsidize it, I think we should waive patents on these vaccines on the very least so we can mass-produce even more generic ones and get them out to as many people as possible. I think we should negotiate drug prices and that Medicare Part D prohibiting that was terrible and one of the primary causes of current inflated US drug prices.</p>
<p>(Oh, by the way, to answer: last president other than Trump to not start a war was Carter, but Carter further liked to brag about the fact that he never ordered a single missile or bullet to be fired while president. Trump didn't start a new war, but he still escalated drone strikes like Obama did before him.)</p>

        <p>I agree with your first paragraph, which is the part of the reason I’m saying that calling Carlin a big leftist is pointless.  The other part being that the left has (d)evolved drastically since then.</p>
<p>Carlin would find most people dumb regardless, including those that believe in the system or are afraid of germs.</p>
<p>As for 1) you’re going to have to deal with restrictions regardless.  They don’t give a fuck about you.  I think Carlin repeated this about 3 times once.  I guess it didn’t take?</p>
<p>2) That’s fine. But a lot more people will die if we continue down this rabbit hole of tyranny and forced vaccinations.</p>

        <p>When it comes to the issue of the restrictions, you and I and most others on the sub probably essentially agree. At first, the rule was, "If you're fully vaccinated, you don't need a mask." I felt like I did "my part" and part of the reason was to just not have to be inconvenienced with the annoying and uncomfortable requirements. Then it changed and now we're all supposed to. No, just stop it, people. Just assume the best of a random politician's motive (put aside temporarily other issues, say for example stock in a particular vaccine or whatever it might be, right?) and so the assumption here is they have only the best intentions.</p>
<p>Dumb and pointless. The vaccine is out, easy to get, free, no appointment, one-dose shot upon walking in to any pharmacy. At a certain point, you have to assume everyone who wanted it got it, and let people take responsibility for whatever happens, whether they get a blood clot from taking the shot or get covid from not. We can't live with permanent dumb rules that literally no one wants. I think we've reached that point. Democrats are polling terribly, probably losing Congress, Newsom is projected to lose in California's recall, etc., and largely the main reason (among plenty) is how unpopular these restrictions are.</p>
<p>I want these to end just as much as any person here. I feel like I did my part and so why should I keep having to play this dumb game. I don't want to force anyone to take the shot, or to wear a mask, especially if the mask-wearing is <em>regardless</em> of getting a shot or not. Absolutely stupid. Just end it all, go back to normal. If R's win and end all the restrictions, I'm not saying I like a lot of the other things they stand for, but my God will I be so relieved they'll likely at least do that much.</p>

        <p>That’s the general consensus of this sub.  Most of us don’t see an end in sight, however.  </p>
<p>Next is the vax passports.  And when that inevitably doesn’t work, what’s next?  Forced vax.  That would be an unmitigated disaster and probably lead to civil war.  We are teetering dangerously close to the edge.</p>

        <p>I think rationally that most countries will just realize having a multi-country database of who is vaccinated or not so they can see who comes in for tourism and whatnot will be too difficult to create, manage, and it'll be too hard to keep track of everyone, even if they really wanted to do all that. It's just impractical. I think eventually, most countries in five or so years will calm down and just expect people to be responsible or accept the risks. I'm just saying this is what I think, and what I hope for. Not saying that's for sure what'll happen, and maybe some countries will be strict about it very long-term.</p>
<p>In the immediate term, I just want all the restrictions to fkn end. What can we do to achieve that?</p>

        <p>There are two different schools of thought on how to achieve that.</p>
<p>One is to comply.</p>
<p>The other is to stop complying (general consensus of this sub)</p>
<p>Personally, I think they’ll enforce exactly what we will put up with and nothing less.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, I'm on a long-term vacation and don't have to worry anymore about enforcing mask mandates on behalf of the state, like I did when I was in retail. If I had to, I'd comply for the sake of having an income and paying rent - some are willing to give that up out of principle, I'm too selfish for that. I guess I'll comply to the bare minimum extent that I need to in order to do the things I want (travel, etc). But I would prefer to actively push to stop the restrictions meanwhile.</p>
<p>I think I'll ask my parents to register to vote later today.</p>

        <p>Besides the fact that you’re a moron for classifying Carlin as a “leftist” (he hated all political parties and would fit better in r/conspiracy than any political party), you desperately need to listen to that rant again… especially his part about vaccines… ya know… this part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a fucking chance... bunch of goddamn pussies! Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for? It’s for killing germs! But it needs practice... it needs germs to practice on. So listen! If you kill all the germs around you, and live a completely sterile life, then when germs do come along, you’re not gonna be prepared. And never mind ordinary germs, what are you gonna do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid shit? I’ll tell you what you’re gonna do... you’re gonna get sick, you’re gonna die, and you’re gonna deserve it cause you’re fucking weak and you got a fucking weak immune system!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me tell you a true story about immunization okay?</p>
<p>When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River and it was filled with raw sewage okay? We swam in raw sewage! You know... to cool off! And at that time, the big fear was polio; thousands of kids died from polio every year but you know something? In my neighbourhood, no one ever got polio! No one! Ever! You know why? Cause we swam in raw sewage! It strengthened our immune systems! The polio never had a prayer; we were tempered in raw shit! So personally, I never take any special precautions against germs. I don’t shy away from people that sneeze and cough, I don’t wipe off the telephone, I don’t cover the toilet seat, and if I drop food on the floor, I pick it up and eat it! Yes I do. Even if I’m at a sidewalk café! In Calcutta! The poor section! On New Year’s morning during a soccer riot! And you know something? In spite of all that so-called risky behaviour, I never get infections, I don’t get them, I don’t get colds, I don’t get flu, I don’t get headaches, I don’t get upset stomach, you know why? Cause I got a good strong immune system and it gets a lot of practice.*</p>
