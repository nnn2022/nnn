    <strong>A thought on vaccines and 'community focus'</strong>
    <p><p>For months and months, we have been observing a near nonstop onslaught on the West--chiefly the USA--that has exposed the 'individualist spirit' as being something vile and loathsome, a... plague so to speak. Asian countries are upheld for prioritizing the 'community' vs the selfish and libertine nature of the dastardly colonies. Early on, places like the Czech republic were praised for their quick and decisive mask mandate that saved them from the onslaught of deaths and cases. Sweden was singled out as a national pariah with its high (now kind of high) death rate used as proof of the folly of herd immunity--do not look now of course since they clearly are way more overrun, and the Czech Republic with its early, swift, and universal masking certainly isn't certainly driving their current numbers over to reach a number 20% higher than Sweden's:</p>

<p>But given these valiant efforts, one must ask 'when is it enough?' And we all have been waiting for the vaccine(s). Now, the thing with these vaccines is that there is no evidence, at all, that they reduce viral load, transmission, or even likelihood to become symptomatic. </p>
<p>https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/verify-moderna-and-pfizer-vaccines-may-prevent-disease-but-not-infection/65-f65cb7ee-24dc-48d0-bc08-8cfb3423a3b6</p>
<p>What they do is lessen symptoms and that's really that. As such, vaccine passes et. al are nonsensical. Instead, the 'community focus' needs to now be on the healthy who have given up a year of their lives to protect the vulnerable. These people--and those managing them--have the duty, as soon as the vaccine is remote widespread, to proliferate it as much as possible while finally allowing us to go back to our lives.</p>
<p>This means no masks, no lockdowns, no closures, no restrictions. The community focus works two ways, and we must ensure the contract we did not agree to is still upheld. </p>
<p>What this means is personal responsibility of the vulnerable to protect <em>us</em>. We are, after all, the bulwark between starvation and destitution and these people. They--and, more chiefly, the elected and unelected government health czars who spoke for them--will have the solemn duty to prioritize the needs and fruition of society at large as soon as the most vulnerable have the chance and choice to inoculate themselves against severe sickness. </p>
<p>Otherwise, if this is not done, it is clear something nefarious is afoot, and rebellion against this nefariousness is the only viable and logic option we able-bodied citizens have, and not just for ourselves, but to ensure we have not squandered this year for less than nothing.</p></p>
