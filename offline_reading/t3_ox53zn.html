        <p>Kathy Griffins strange tweet (https://twitter.com/kathygriffin/status/1422169088793579520?s=20) about lung cancer and randomly propagating the vaccine got me thinking.</p>
<p>Note this is from 2012 for a different Virus (still a SARS Coronavirus) and not the same vaccines they are giving out. But the results are basically the same as our fears, maybe they work for immunity against the barely deadly Covid-19, but it may lead to adverse reactions in other parts of the body (like the autopsy that found the spike proteins in all the organs)</p>

        <p>This is what Doctor (Mrs) Biden was referring to when she said the vaccine technology had been around for years.  She didn’t mention it had failed time and time again killing test subjects including children.  </p>
<p>Would love to know how much she and the rest of her sociopathic family are getting from Big Pharma.</p>

        <p>The covid-19 gene therapy is in breach of all 10 articles in the Nuremberg code. This an unethical so called "vaccine" needs to be stopped.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is my prime reason for saying no to a vaccine since before they had one. Someone yesterday posted this and it sums it up well from a research perspective.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33113270/</p>
<p>Results of the study: COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.</p>
