        <p>My best friends grandma was in a Nursing Home when the virus hit. Instead of protecting the elderly Gretchen Whitmer put more sick people in the nursing home. She died alone 1 week ago, with no contact with her family.</p>

        <p>Hello!!  I, like most others recently, found your subreddit through the screenshot and just wanted to spread some love.  This has been a shit year and I live in a state where lockdown restrictions have been minimal and within driving distance of a state that never locked down.  I cannot relate to the frustrations of those of you that have had to be locked down.  I work in healthcare and treat Covid patients.  I can relate to the fear and frustration that humanity is seemingly giving up our connection to one another in order to preserve life, no matter the quality just for the sake of it.  I too am frustrated in our leadership and just want to encourage people to continue to remain human.</p>
<p>My hospital changed our visitor policy due to pushback from nurses like me.  We didn’t allow visitors at all at one point, and made no exceptions.  No one should die alone.  Families don’t need to be ripped apart. We changed our policy.  We make exceptions now for certain circumstances.  We wear PPE.  We make visitors do the same and we do our best with the knowledge we have to stay safe but remain connected.  From what I have read of your subreddit, this is what you are fighting for... to go back to be able to connect with one another.  I want you to know that there are people out there on the front lines, in places that deal with Covid and make policies on restrictions that are reminding people of this.  In turn, I remind all of you reading this, no matter your beliefs and thoughts on Covid to show some compassion and forgiveness during these stressful and uncertain times.  Don’t forget to wash your hands and if your so inclined to, mask up as well.  Sending love ❤️</p>

        <p>Yeah I have a question, why is this subreddit being nuked by pro maskers today?</p>
<p>I made an original post last night mocking lock downs that had 25 Karma points and rising this morning but I just checked and it's down to 0.</p>
<p>If you are pro-mask or pro-lockdown you should not be participating in this subreddit, end of discussion.</p>

        <p>Because they want us deplatformed. They see our speech as literally dangerous and therefore should be mocked into silence. People deeply believe that covid is killing people and hasn’t just dried up and died because people aren’t wearing masks all the time and haven’t locked down hard enough.</p>

        <p>I'll answer: because the  WHO surveyed a lot of science on non-pharmaceutical measures and the flu. There was no way to stop the flu except for very short periods. No measures of this severity have ever before been attempted, show me where if you can with real science. opinion won't work on me.</p>

        <p>Me either, I’ve done no downvoting, no reporting, no complaining to mods or admins, and certainly no award giving. I have no interest in shutting down this community. The thing I’m interested in is making sure communities that spread harmful information are known and thus easier to keep new people from falling for. </p>

        <p>But yeah no on that science thing. Now you’re being insulting. There’s legitimate scientists who have been speaking out against masks, lockdowns, and the whole way this stupid pandemic has been handled. To think that there is no connection to politics and vanity within the scientific community is foolish. There are some folks on the anti lockdown side who are sketchy but overall there’s been some decent minds who have put their reputations on the line to come out in favor of what they believe to be true even if it’s not popular.</p>

        <p>You can't have a proper discussion about a certain topic if you are entering from different frames. If you want to argue lockdowns and mask wearing there's plenty of other spaces for you. This space is for people who are against that and wish to have discussions from that ground.</p>

        <p>Because the underlying assumptions are disproven by science links I have bookmarked and ready to go.</p>
<p>You are now an expert on how people view certain phrases as "completely uneducated"? Just another unsubstatiated opinion that I can discard.</p>
<p>You ARE uneducated. efficacy of what type? computer models make assumptions. Why don't you substantiate or at least <strong><em>discuss</em></strong> those assumptions?</p>

<p>I would suggest to you to take a step back, form a proper research question, and layout the data that answers it. Your ranting in the past few comments is unintelligible and doesn't pose a proper question. Again, good luck."</p>

        <p>It's called setting boundaries for a specific group so you can discuss the merits of a certain idea in depth. 
It's like if you went to a book club and instead of discussing the book at hand you keep trying to debate with the members how kindles are better than paper books. 
They would tell you to fuck off just as we are now telling you to.</p>

What's happening here is going to a book club and discussing the book. Some people liked it and others didn't. You want to kick out everyone that doesn't like the book.</p>

        <p>Good job letting the government tells you what to do! What a concept to listen to them when they are trying to do something for your safety! Now consider that they are trying to get you to wear a mask to keep your germs to yourself so that everyone is protected. It's not about just you this time though, it's about everyone else. It's like driving in invisible traffic, nobody knows who's sick, whose immune compromised, or who will have a poor reaction. Perfectly healthy strong people have died of this. It's the responsible and empathetic thing to do, to wear a mask to protect other people, especially since it's as easy as wearing a mask in public. The government is telling people to do it, because just like seatbelt and helmet laws, if they don't tell people, they won't do it. It's why taxation exists, people need to be told to do things that are necessary for society to keep functioning.</p>

        <p>Just being clear what you're asking for, and so you know it's not hard to go find your own research. Google scholar is a great resource for finding peer reviewed research and journal articles.</p>
<p>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.04.001
https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083?te=1&amp;nl=running&amp;emc=edit_ru_20200822
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361830/
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300191</p>
<p>How is that?
The reason I ask is because i have not seen any published research that contradicts masks being effective.</p>

        <p>first link is very poor. Assumes mask is effective and then just models rate of adoption vs. other regional factors to give estimates of outcomes.  </p>
<p>Second link very poor. "We have demonstrated a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech." This means only blocking of res. droplets is being measured, nothing about reducing infection rates or mortality.</p>
<p>Third link also poor. just tests for optimal filtration, nothing about reducing infection rates or mortality.</p>
<p>fourth link also poor. they test only if widespread use could reduce the R value. Nothing about how it could reduce infections or mortality. It is already assumed that masks are effective.</p>
<p>So FOUR strikes. Your own posted studys ACTUALLY PUBLISH DATA THAT LISTS MASKS THAT ARE LESS OR NOT EFFECTIVE FOR FILTERING RES. DROPLETS.
ie. the bandana is not filtering out much.
Also, respertory droplets emerge from n95 and other well reviewed masks.</p>
<p>I feel like you deliberately wasted my time. your calling peeps in this sub morons now seems to be just trolling.</p>

        <p>You asked for articles that show the efficacy of masks, not the link between contracting coronavirus and dying. Masks are effective at stopping respiratory droplets that carry coronavirus. Fact. It just doesn't fit your narrative so you dismiss it.</p>
<p>Be clear when defining your research question to find evidence that will directly answer it. All of these papers set out to answer a question, "are masks effective?". They answer that and show data they've collected.</p>
<p>Yes some masks are less effective, therefore people should be wearing proper masks and wearing them properly. I wear a blue surgical mask anytime I'm in public because I know the cloth masks are much less effective. I do that because I don't know if I have covid or not since I could be pre or asymptomatic, like everyone else could be. I care about other people's well-being and do not want to be responsible for anyone getting sick. So I take what the scientific community is telling me, namely masks and social distancing work, and I apply those. I'm fairly certain this sub cannot say the same. You don't seem to care if you infect anyone else, so yes selfish. I hope I've at least taught you a few things about conducting research, or as you put it finding "science links".</p>

        <p>I already provided you with peer reviewed articles that you dismissed due to them not fitting your narrative. I'm not your personal assistant. Do your own research since you seem to have different questions than "are masks effective against covid-19 spreading". Again I have provided you with tools, like google scholar. I see you're getting frustrated and lashing out. Good luck on your scholarly adventure. Mask up. Wearing is caring. Do something positive for the world and don't endanger others.</p>

<p>science links dude. And no, stopping respertory droplets that carry cv does not imply that masks can prevent new infections among regular people.<br>
science. Who informed you of your "fact"? why do you pick a fact that doesn't imply a direct prevention of new infections or reduce mortality? Why don't you have them bookmarked and ready to go?  </p>

        <p>Wow it literally does. If you don't transmit the virus people won't get it. It seems to me what you are looking for is rates of infection of people that have been exposed to the virus. Good luck finding numbers like that. That would be extremely difficult and probably require unethical methods.</p>
<p>Have fun with your "science links". Maybe try some basic logic links first.</p>
<p>What's the big problem with just wearing a mask to take away the risk of transmission? Is that really too much for you to handle?</p>

who said there was to much to handle? Both strawman logical fallacies!!</p>

        <p>Good for you for trying - but those numbers are way off. Oral infections/tooth absesses are much higher. I'm not saying haha they are hundreds of thousands a year - but enough to warrant worry over not being able to get to a dentist of have access to one. </p>
<p>The infections have a tendency to spread to other areas - especially the brain.</p>

        <p>Good on you for trying! That was a brave, courageous move. I'm in a low-compliance area (and lucky to be so), so not sure how I would handle that. If I would leave or fight. If the time ever comes I'll make that decision in the moment.</p>

        <p>Dude. 2 weeks ago tonight I was leaving my studio at night, I was parked right in front...but it is darker now bec of business closures. I left w/ my students and stupidly ran back up to the door bec I realized I had set down a basket while I was locking it. </p>
<p>Got back to my car not 15 seconds later. There were 2 guys hiding in the shadows. Blue surgical masks. One had a knife. I am ok. They wanted money. There was a struggle though. I did the only thing I really could and made a scene, layed on my horn, hit, screamed. </p>
<p>Cops think the 2 guys committed a murder/robbery a few blocks over 20 mins after I got away. I told the cops there is no way I could I.D. Them in a lineup. It was dark, they work masks, and gloves. Ugh.</p>
<p>Edit: Your daily reminder to STAY SAFE...and I don’t mean by staying locked down and quivering. BE AWARE of your surroundings. Consider SELF DEFENSE classes. Try to REMEMBER DETAILS if you witness or are victim to a crime.</p>
<p>I worry about issues like this escalating as people become more desperate</p>

        <p>That is terrifying! I'm glad to hear to hear you're okay.</p>
<p>Masks were already used for crimes, but it used to be abnormal. Now, criminals have another way to blend in.</p>

        <p>Ew right?! It is like reason 4,663 that masks weird me out. I can accept they have a time and a place —for instance if you have allergies and need to enter a crowded building. Then just put it on to avoid getting shot for sneezing in public. (Lololsob) but it is truly scary and dystopian. And although I wasnt hurt during this incident (physically), I am traumatized. Idk the answer. I am definitely going back to Krav Maga (a martial arts) bec I don’t want to risk being caught off guard again. I dont want my students or my kids to be caught off gaurd (I teach pole sport and aerial acrobatics, which is already kinda controversial). It is just a little unsettling. </p>
<p>In fact, I am heading there now. I need to move my classes to earlier hours now that less businesses are around. (We are somewhat a speakeasy of a studio right now. We have over 4,000 sq. Feet and only 6 poles, 2 aerial hoops and a separate room for floor acrobatics.) eek. I feel like I am rambling on reddit instead of leaving to go bec I still feel a bit weird after the incident. </p>
<p>But, I have put new protocols in place (no body alone!) </p>
<p>Lol thank you for listening to my procrastination rambles 🤪</p>

        <p>I’m from the UK and I’ve really struggled since they brought in masks, and since last week life has become a total nightmare. No one believes my exemption and I’m struggling to even exist and get my child to school. Masks are a huge problem for some autistic people, including me because of extreme sensory issues. I have responsibility for a 4yo and I can not afford to have an autistic meltdown when travelling with her - it’s not fair on her, and obviously not great for me either. I tried wearing (a lot of different) masks and i was getting overloaded and having meltdowns - meaning becoming non-verbal and unable to function (I get dizzy, lose motor skills, can’t make decisions or keep track of my daughter, and end up crying and unable to speak). I have to get her to school every day and back again and I have to use the bus to do so because I cannot drive because of my autism.  I get my shopping delivered, and we now only go out to the park other than that - but even then we have to take the bus because we live in a rural area. I cannot wear a mask but I also can’t cope being targeted and judged for not wearing one, because that also causes me extreme anxiety - that’s how we’ve ended up not going into shops anymore.  Our lives have shrunk incredibly including support. It’s just me and her in the house, but we normally manage pretty well outside of this pandemic and the very difficult rule changes and heightened anxiety it has brought. I cannot help but repeatedly make mistakes because my functioning is impaired. Is she meant to be housebound too? If I can’t go on a bus she can’t get to school. I think a lot of these sweeping statements about mask exemptions in the UK being bullshit and people not wearing masks being awful idiots are extremely damaging to people who have serious disabilities and show a lot of ignorance about other people’s lives and responsibilities. Not everyone who doesn’t wear a mask is a selfish imbecile (I actually dont think anyone should be forced to, because if you’re willing to go up against that level of pressure not to wear one it clearly does cause you a lot of distress). Some people are just trying to survive through an incredibly difficult scenario, but there is zero recognition of that. Life has been so much harder, and I’ve been harassed and abused just trying to exist even in a very limited way.  I’ve been refused onto a bus with my 4yo after explaining I am autistic and exempt and showing my sunflower lanyard. I am left wing, and utterly at a loss how people I have called friends have seemingly lost their minds and their morals over this. It’s incredibly distressing.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, that's the point! Since censorship concerning the 'rona is so prevalent here, it would just be naive to think other big-to-medium sized sites are completely immune to pressure from TPTB.</p>

        <p>I am sorry you are going through that and it must be hard when you have a little one to look after too. I am also on the spectrum and I cannot wear a real mask without instantly panicking. I always use a bandana and usually have it somewhat pulled down. I refuse to wear it outside.</p>
<p>But you're the first person I've seen that seems to have similar meltdowns like me. I had to go in the pharmacy like a month ago and when I went to get my meds I forgot my damn name! It was so embarrassing.  I had to go get a physical with my new dr recently, and again couldn't function which was embarrassing and made it worse. </p>
<p>Same as you, I don't usually go in buisnesses without it because I literally can't handle hostile people.</p>
<p>Due to medical reasons, I took time out from work in February, and in April my job went POOF gone forever. I want to go back to working soooooo bad, but I can't because I can't even function in a store for a short period. How the hell am I supposed to work? All my skills are physical stuff so I feel like I'm trapped.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rambling, it's just nice to know we're not alone. It's a tough scary world right now.</p>

        <p>Are you in the UK? If so I’d be upfront about your disability and ask for a mask exemption at the get go.  Normally I wouldn’t tell an employer and just try to stay under the radar but these circumstances make that impossible. Some of the supermarkets have come out saying they are supporting staff with exemptions. </p>
<p>I also lost my job in March. Then couldn’t get another because no childcare. My daughter is now in school but there are no jobs in my sector at all right now. I’m retraining instead. Frankly I’m not sure id even be able to cope working at present with the level of stress this is causing. </p>
<p>The thing I describe about my brain not function has a name, it’s called executive functioning and you can look it up. People who are going through trauma or depression experience a similar thing, like stop being able to make decisions or do simple everyday tasks, coordination. Unfortunately for many autistic people its brought on by being overstimulated by sound, touch, stress etc. It’s a nightmare. I’ve worked so hard to try to make life manageable and avoid meltdowns - and this stuff has just taken me back to square one, like full on crisis. I just can’t understand what’s happening - deaths in the UK aren’t rising and are very low, yet they are bringing in more and more new measures that make life impossible and have changed the goal posts to zero Covid which makes no sense.</p>
<p>Edit to say - for some reason all talk about masks and Covid has been banned on every autistic forum going - that’s also made it really hard!</p>

        <p>I'm in RI USA over here getting an exemption is nearly impossible. That's awesome that some of the places near you are supporting people. No one is here. </p>
<p>I am definitely going to look that up. I also have bi polar which isn't helping either. I get paranoid very easily as it is. And despite being on meds, the state of the world is making my moods go all over the place. And same here, I've worked very hard on my issues and this stuff is making life hard.</p>
<p>A lot of the people I saw last year advocating for mental health are now condemning people and show zero sympathy. I swear these people better not pretend to care again. People with mental illness and or disabilities are being treated so poorly in this it's sickening.</p>
<p>And yes they keep pushing the goalposts back. I swear if we lock down again, I'll be right there on the state house lawn. Even if I'm all alone and get shamed on the news for it. Even if it inspires one person, that would be enough for me.</p>
<p>Edit: I mean peacefully protesting at the state house. Just wanted to clarify because my wording was kind of vague.</p>

        <p>Today at New Normal High School, my mask gave me sensory overload. I'm autistic, and wearing a mask for four hours a day is absolutely hellish. It's only a half day, and I'm aware many people wear masks for longer periods of time, but it was very debilitating. I despise the feeling of fabric covering my face, and I experienced symptoms akin to an anxiety attack. I was rubbing my face constantly and it was super uncomfortable. In addition, the straps hurt my ears and I was about ready to rip the damn thing off. I had to go to the bathroom to take it off for a few minutes so I could catch my breath, as my usual stim toys weren't of much assistance to me.Thankfully nothing bad happened, but I still feel like shit due to having to cover my face pretty much all day long. I couldn't really focus in class because I was on the verge of a shutdown. After school, I pretty much did shut down. I laid in my bed because that's all I had the energy left to do. I'd get an exemption, but I don't want my teachers and peers to label me as a bad person and treat me like a Typhoid Mary. I hope this shit doesn't last all year, even though my doomer of a science teacher keeps screaming about how we'll be wearing masks for two years. Yeah, right. I don't care what anyone says, this will absolutely not be my new normal. I have to put my own well being above someone else's feelings. If that pisses someone off, so be it.</p>

        <p>Fellow autistic person here. While the masks don't give me sensory overload, the straps around my ears are hella uncomfortable. Thank fuck for velcro straps which tie the mask around the back of my head instead of around my ears.</p>
<p>I never thought of how much social interaction kept my introverted ass sane. I barely made it through spring and summer emotionally, and I'm still kinda screwed up right now. I've described this in other skeptic subs as COVID blues.</p>
<p>Also, my science teacher was kinda doomer-ish too. Not like yours saying we need to wear masks forever, but he showed multiple videos at the start of school on the benefits of masks. They were corny as hell. This was also the only class other than a tech class where we had plexiglass on many of the desks, but then again, these were the types of desks where two or three people could sit at them. I feel bad for the people taking French at my school because I peeked inside for a minute and saw that <em>every individual desk had plexiglass on it.</em> Every damn one.</p>
<p>Do you get mask breaks during class at your school? Most of my classes have masks breaks where parts of the room get to take off their masks for five minutes at a time. My English teacher lets us do 15.</p>
<p>I can definitely relate to shutting down. I was hella tired today (it was a remote day) so I basically fell asleep and missed the last hour of the school day, which made me feel like shit.</p>
<p>God I hope we go back full time at some point this year. If I have to deal with this stupid ass hybrid model for the whole year then I might end up doing something awful to myself, and I don't want to do that. Fuck a new normal. I just want to <em>be</em> normal.</p>

        <p>I feel very isolated because of this year and like there’s nothing left to live for. I feel anger at so many of my friends who have bought the lies about the lockdowns and masks and think people like me are evil. I don’t want to go anywhere anymore because I see signs all over the place telling me I’m evil and not welcome. I need support but I can’t find any where I live.</p>

All the doomers stay home. Even if you don't drink, sit down and buy a soda or something. There will be some drunk guy at the bar eager to chat lol</p>

        <p>They opened bars here last week, but they simultaneously gave the state authority to revoke liquor licenses for businesses that don’t make people wear masks. I’m not sure how that is actually playing out though. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>

        <p>Venue for the open mic I go to every week has closed, possibly for good. Really gutted as there aren’t many more in my town that have a piano. I’m not a professional musician and this has given me a great opportunity to pursue a healthy hobby. Fell victim to needless social distancing regulation and was no longer profitable to keep it open despite the regulars bending over backwards to keep the community together and support it. Meanwhile it’s once again the tech giants with the power of small countries who profit. </p>
<p>I can’t believe how easy it’s been to convince people that this level of coercion and surveillance from our deeply untrustworthy government is necessary and for the greater good. I’m just glad I found this community and that there are people out there who agree without veering into David icke-style lunacy. I’m hoping others can wake up and smell the coffee, all it takes is to spend ten minutes thinking about it after all.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people, brigaders especially, are not aware of what this subreddit is about and what message it is trying to spread. They find the most sensationalist, conspiracy-ridden post on this subreddit, show that off to much more popular subreddits as if that post represents all of us, and our community is collectively referred to as a bunch of loony anti-maskers who have never even considered wearing masks and following safe guidelines.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a bit absurd to suggest that we should consider the coronavirus pandemic "old news" or "completely harmless" and just immediately reset things back to the way they were before this pandemic. I agree, and I reckon most people who follow this subreddit agree as well. However, to say that this pandemic and its lockdowns have never been utilized in some way outside of its intents, and to deny that this pandemic has ever been used to promote a political agenda (especially in the United States, where politics immediately engrossed itself in this effectively apolitical pandemic), is to be intentionally naive to the state of the world right now in light of this pandemic.</p>
<p>We on this subreddit are not upset that we need to wear a mask wherever we go. It might be annoying, but it's not a deal-breaker. We on this subreddit are not upset that we need to maintain social distancing. It might be unnecessary and overly-precise for a cirus that can supposedly travel through air, but again, not a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>Where we draw the line on this subreddit is the constant grandstanding that other Redditors, political activists and mainstream media outlets demonstrate whenever someone does not follow the guidelines in explicit, intricate detail. Where we draw the line on this subreddit is the utter lunacy and sensationalism about this virus on social media which has so far done absolutely NOTHING in relieving us of this virus. Where we draw the line on this subreddit is the prevalence of "popular science", which is neither "popular" nor "science", over actual scientific reasoning derived from observation and experimentation, and this unproven science's effects upon our lives. Where we draw the line on this subreddit is the hypocrisy exemplified by social media and mainstream media outlets, which promote and encourage million-person protests and riots, but vehemently condemn five- to ten-person familial gatherings as part of their "social distancing" mandate.</p>
<p>Where I believe we all draw the line most passionately, however, is the end result of all of these things: the adoption of a "new normal" for how the world runs that we're all obligated - no, forced - to adapt to. Just look at the name of this subreddit: r/NoNewNormal. We reject the "new normal" that so many have lamented about, where social gatherings of any kind, no matter how respectful of guidelines they are, are now taboo. Where antisocial, isolationist behavior is praised, and social, interactive behavior fought against. We're perfectly fine with following these guidelines NOW, as the pandemic continues. What we are most certainly NOT fine with is the confidence exemplified by many that the world after this pandemic will be identical to what we live in now during the pandemic, or will otherwise be completely different from what it was before.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate: we at r/NoNewNormal are NOT skeptics of proven science. We are NOT skeptics of guidelines that are proven effective. We are NOT skeptics of keeping others safe and helping out our community, and the complaints we have are NOT complaints against science, or against mask-wearing, or against whatever most of Reddit thinks we're against.</p>
<p>We aren't conspiracy theorists looking to make you sick, who dismiss deaths and tragedy as something that doesn't require lockdowns to prevent. We aren't echo chamber cultists looking to further affirm but never challenge our own beliefs and ideals. Whatever you heard of us on other subreddits was most likely forged as a result of the fact that we aren't 100% in favor with changing the way things were forever.</p>
<p>We only have one simple request. Quit it with the confidence that "things will be different" after this pandemic and strive to make things the same way they were before this pandemic. That is all. </p>
<p>No denial of science needed. No denial of deaths and death statistics. Only one request, which is how this subreddit earned its name in the first place: NO NEW NORMAL.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your views but the new normal stems from more than COVID. Covid is a catalyst if anything. The shift in the economic gravity of the world, rising tensions between super powers threatening the technological standards and rule of law that unite the globe, an increasing concern about our ability to operate/produce food in increasingly extreme weather (regardless of how you think of climate change), the rise of nationalism and populism, digitalisation, etc. are just some of the issues that will change the way we live and work. Even without covid, we were headed for a major change. But with covid, many of these issues accelerated. Suddenly we couldnt trust supply chains to deliver - protectionism of critical resources became acceptable. Everyone suddenly could accept digital ways of transacting and living. Our economies will recover at different rates. Countries will look to new thought leaders instead of the US. Very little we do now locally is going to stop that. If youve lived long enough, it isnt really a new normal. But rather it is normal that the world changes ever so now and then.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that the coronavirus pandemic has served as a catalyst for a lot of issues that would have otherwise emerged more gradually, and I additionally think that it is that, in essence, that motivates us on this subreddit to stand against the "new normal".</p>
<p>At a very basic level, I think everyone on this subreddit is mostly bothered by the fact that the coronavirus pandemic itself has caused a direct change in how society is meant to operate, and how we are to compose ourselves societally from this point forward. More so than that, however, is the confidence many people seem to exemplify that the way we operated before must be different after the pandemic is over with, when that doesn't have to happen. It's less the fact that the coronavirus serves as a catalyst for other issues which bothers me, and more the fact that so many people are encouraging this catalyzing of issues, like they want them to intensify and they want the world to change completely.</p>
<p>I'm also aware that what we do locally is unlikely to affect the emergence of a "new normal" that is supposed to affect the whole world. In fact, I reckon that's why there's a subreddit like this to espouse our ideas about this new normal in the first place. Love it or hate it, Reddit is an alarmingly virulent platform that affects real-world issues surprisingly more than some are willing to accept, so if we can't affect things on a local scale, we'll have our message heard on social media platforms where millions of people gather from all across the world. Even if we're mocked and ridiculed for going against this foreseeable new normal, our stance on this remains clear, and we don't have to participate in the conspiracies that some claim us as participating in in order to hold that stance.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm at least glad that you can appreciate my stance on this instead of ridiculing or mocking it outright; I reciprocate the same appreciation towards your stances.</p>

        <p>Um i am very confused on what you are saying since the mod is really angry and seems to be raging about mask awards so maybe you aren't right about that since it looks to be an anti-masker subreddit when I look at mods removing awards because they have masks. IDK. MPH, MMPH, MMMPH!</p>

        <p>I understand that a lot of people on this subreddit make it look like an anti-mask haven, but I feel like a lot of the anti-mask sentiment on this subreddit, however misguided it may be, stems from the fact that there is a "new normal" being pushed for in light of this pandemic, which is a legitimate concern that one has every right to be against.</p>
<p>The problem isn't the science behind the virus. The problem isn't the lockdowns or the social distancing or the mask-wearing WHILE the pandemic is happening. The problem IS the fact that many are trying to craft a "new normal" from this pandemic that won't stop even after the last case has been isolated. People who aren't scientists and don't think scientifically are telling all of us how the world should be, as if science and politics is interchangeable, or as if science and society are interchangeable either.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that in light of this pandemic, we should fight it off, and by the time it has been completely accounted for, we should change how society functions and how the world operates. We disagree, and affirm that there is a way that we can fight this pandemic without fundamentally changing society and how it operates in the process. This "new normal" is the result of misguided people (who I'd argue are even more misguided than virulent anti-maskers) thinking that change in every aspect of our lives is necessary if we are to defeat this virus once and for all. That is, in fact, not only untrue, but one way, arguably, to make the virus even worse to handle.</p>
<p>Oh, and as for the mask awards, it's rather evident at this point that r/madlads and other subreddits are using it as a way to mock us and give the middle finger towards everything we stand for because they equate every aspect of it to anti-mask sentiment. They don't read posts like this, instead focusing on the craziest posts to make it on this subreddit and portraying us all as believing in that. Personally, I don't care if I get one just because some brigader can't read more than a few sentences off of my posts, but I can see why they're being deleted. They serve, at this point, to tease us and tell us that our opinions don't matter because they're wrong, even though the brigaders who give us those awards don't even know what we stand for and only assume we're against mask-wearing because of one or two crazies on this subreddit.</p>

        <p>Hey everybody 👋</p>
<p>-LONG POST WARNING-</p>
<p>An Autistic person here, and I don't really have much to add besides a few personal experiences since other people have spoken much more eloquently about it and have echoed the sentiments I have with mask wearing.</p>
<p>I'm in the UK, and here we have the sunflower lanyard, which disabled people etc can use to declare themselves exempt from masks. It has been a godsend 95% of the time, but going shopping is now even more of a challenge. I either get glared at, or if there's somebody stood by the entrance of a shop, I get confronted. I now completely avoid those shops, which is a deep shame.</p>
<p>Had a driving test last week and didn't have to mask up (but I had to explain to the DVSA beforehand that masks impair my ability to concentrate). The examiner didn't flinch and the test went ahead as normal. He did have to quarantine the pen I wrote my signature with tho, which was a bit dumb 😅</p>
<p>My workplace has introduced mandatory mask wearing (you can only take it off when you're at your desk). My boss and team leaders were very good in understanding I couldn't wear one, however I've been getting the odd dirty look as I pass people on the corridors and in the canteen. I was challenged once, but it was more out of curiousity than malice.</p>
<p>Twitter and the internet, however, are way less forgiving. I got into a spat with someone because they thought every Autistic person needed to mask up or they shouldn't be allowed outside 😫</p>
<p>Anyway I'm just delighted I found this subreddit full of likeminded people. I'm not a COVID denier at all, but everything has just been blown waaaay out of proportion. Glad to be in good company.</p>

        <p>Didn't exist "like this." It's called reading comprehension. </p>
<p>Yes so extremely effective that my state has had a mask mandate in effect for over 2 months and cases are "at an all time high" 😅 Predictions based off of statistical models are fine and dandy, but there's something called the real world. It can look good on paper and still not work. </p>
<p>People all around me are coming down with the common cold for goodness sakes! 🤦🏻‍♀️ Perfect make use might be effective but people aren't perfect. They're touching their masks all day long, removing/replacing them, readjusting, and then touching surfaces that other people will touch.</p>
<p>Covid is too far spread to control with masks at this point. Unfortunately, we need to reach herd immunity. And unfortunately people die. It fucking sucks. But it's life and how human life has been on this planet since we existed.</p>

        <p>I've come to realize doomers don't want you to have fun even within the rules!</p>
<p>I'm in NJ. For the life in me, I can't remember every restriction, but I do know gatherings are allowed up to a certain amount. Last Saturday, I attended a birthday party with less than twenty people (one guest being a baby, the niece of the guest of the honor). Police have allowed parties before in our town, even without masks or distancing (a few neighbors on my block gathered to watch fireworks on July 4th; cops came by to address <em>real</em> safety concerns: a couple shooting fireworks nearby right off their lawn, and a car double parked that was causing minor a traffic jam). According to one person (online, of course), a birthday party in a state that permits them and is confined to a backyard is a superspreader that's endangering the entire state. Right...</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning I'm not a regular partygoer. I normally hate parties, but went because the guest of honor is a friend of mine I used to work with who I haven't seen since I left the job last year. It's just astounding to me these people are essentially mad some people refuse to be a hermit. I'm a homebody by nature, and I've never begrudged someone their social life. Been a bit lonely at times, sure (who isn't every now and then?), but never hated someone because they were more sociable than me at the time.</p>

        <p>It is a start! </p>
<p>So, Pro-Tip Story: The first time I got my BFF to go to a dine-in restaurant w/ me (she was pretty much a doomer at first) we stupidly decided to go to a trendier local restaurant at night because it had a pretty courtyard with outside seating. </p>
<p>Well, apparently everyone else in town had the same “courtyard seating!” Idea that we did, and she had a panic attack upon arrival because it was so busy.</p>
<p>We decided to go to applebee’s inside, which was so, so much slower. Despite being inside tables only, she was more comfortable and it helped pave the way for her to slowly re-integrate into life again.</p>
<p>Edit: clarity</p>

        <p>Definitely better! A lot better. I know the news and Fauci keep saying “double down!” And “cases are rising!” But I find that the baby steps and smaller field-trips outside of the normal work, Wal-Mart, and Costo really help the people who are worried to start feeling more comfortable. </p>
<p>Imagine if you hadnt left home since March besides for emergency toilet paper at Costco. You’d see the posts of crazy numbers, protesters, etc. on reddit &amp; Facebook and truly think the world has gone to shit. </p>
<p>At least in my area, what I see with my eyes and what I see on the media and online are like night and day. It is no wonder why people are so scared, ya know?</p>

        <p>Oh wow! That is so sad how this crap has affected some people so much! 😓 I agree about the night and day difference between the doomsday media shit and what is actually going on out there. Granted, I do live in a conservative county, but I sometimes forget all about covid when I go out on a Friday night! It helps that all of my friends, family, and even classmates all think this is an overreaction.</p>

<p>This article shows the average deaths for a certain time of year and the amount of deaths this year, you can see obvious spikes where we are having far more deaths then normal at any given time. It isn't as simple as "this is just this years flu" or "life comes with risks like driving". Those extra deaths were fairly easily preventable with much less of a lifestyle change then abolishing motor vehicles.</p>

        <p>If you can, get out to the wilderness. I have become somewhat of a hiker/camper/outdoorsy person since covid—because I had to get out when things were closed down. </p>
<p>I am writing this on my way back from a camping trip, actually. It is cheap and fun, and I have noticed (at least here in my area-Arizona) that people in the outskirts, like the smaller towns up in the mountains or lakes (where people tend to camp) are soooooo much more normal. It renews my soul to see the rangers without a mask smile and wave.</p>

        <p>I saw one dude on a kayak, alone, on an abandoned lake wearing a mask. I was literally the only person there, and I was on the beach. So weird.</p>
<p>I want to normalize masks for </p>
<p>a.) those who are sick/coughing/sneezing/unwell 
b.) those who are truly vulnerable, like cancer patients. 
c.) maybe even for airplanes (?) </p>
<p>I feel like these absurd blanket rules for the entire globe are truly just causing people to be angry and fight with and fear one another. 
Plus it’s silly to feel you need to wear a mask a hundred miles from no where, plus another mile out into the middle of a lake, alone...is just kind of pitiful.</p>

        <p>Edit: I definitely re-read my comment and realized I didn’t want to use the word “normalize”. But I want people to feel like they can choose to wear masks if they so desire, but please for the love of god stop with the infinite mask screeching all day, every day. I accidentally lurked on a pro-mask sub today and it put me in the worst mood.</p>

        <p>just picked up our <a href="https://costcowineblog.com/2020-costco-wine-advent-ure-calendar/">2020 Costco Advent Wine Calendar</a>! (Wine Advent-ure, lol it's so cute!) 🦊🍷🎄🦌</p>
<p>there will also be a <a href="https://costcowineblog.com/costco-wine-advent-calendar-2-for-2020/">second 2020 Wine Advent Calendar</a> in stores this week on October 1st. 🐼🌲🎁❄️</p>
<p>yes, i will be picking that one up, too, lol 🎅🥂</p>
<p>i've also made a Wine Advent-ure spreadsheet so that we can "score" the wines as we go along, and keep track of which ones we loved. i'm not a sommelier by any means, but i am a wine tasting enthusiast, and this will be a fun little holiday activity for me and my husband. we might even do some meal pairings! 📝</p>
<p>this seems like a fun, affordable way to try some new, different wines at an affordable price ($4/half bottle) and it's a nice way to end this year ☃️</p>
<p>p.s. i do not work for Costco, but i do love their warehouse and pizza. and the $1.50 hot dog/soda combo. and the rugelach. and the rotisserie chicken. and the clothes section and the yoga leggings. and their cheap Yeungling, okay maybe i should abandon my current profession and work for price club, lol.</p>

        <p>No, Covid is especially infectious with children that don't understand how to protect themselves against COVID. Every single school that reopened 5-days/week here in Canada  got their cases to multiply and force to shut down. Think about the consequences of kids getting Covid and spreading it</p>

        <p>went to two different restaurants today, no masks no problem. one was way over capacity, no one cared, very few masks. a lot of that is the area i'm in if you go into a city (like raleigh) you still see kind of the opposite in those areas. still nice to know there are a lot of sane people out there just living life</p>

        <p>As someone who's also posted on this subreddit as of recently, I think there's more to this subreddit than that, which I think focuses more on the problems you mentioned that would arise from this lockdown.</p>
<p>The name of this subreddit speaks for itself, really. There's this sudden and morbid emergence of a "new world" view of what a post-pandemic world should look like, which assumes that the world must be different and must change in a substantial way after this pandemic has passed. I'd argue that that doesn't need to happen, that we can maintain what we had before while also beating this pandemic and moving on.</p>
<p>A lot of things can be blamed for this, but I blame sensationalist media sources (primarily social media) for making the pandemic appear as a revolutionary event that has caused catastrophic, near-irreversible damage to our world, when it has and will only ever cause damage within this particular period we're in, in which we are actually dealing with this pandemic actively. It reminds me of the economics joke that the economy will only ever do poorly when the mainstream media says that it's doing poorly, except in this case, the fight against the coronavirus pandemic is only ever going horribly when the mainstream media says that it's going horribly.</p>
<p>This is what I think a lot of brigaders and ill-intentioned Redditors don't understand about us. They think we're a one-note instrument which only ever expresses anti-mask sentiment, which they then interpret as us being completely anti-science and selfish in all of our arguments. All we really want is to maintain the world we had before this pandemic when this pandemic has been fought off. No fundamental societal restructuring. No revolutionary political change. No immense economic fluxuation. All we want is to ensure that the world isn't burdened by this virus decades after it's been wiped out, and that's a sentiment so many people can hold without the anti-mask sentiment Reddit claims we have.</p>

        <p>That's proof that in some cases a lockdown isn't necessary, not that lockdowns don't work. Different things. </p>
<p>It's equivalent to saying seatbelts don't work because you've been in a crash without one and didn't die. </p>
<p>In any case, Sweden isn't doing "super good", they're just doing better than some countries, and worse than others who have harder lockdowns</p>

        <p>"suffering for years and that means more death too" Well that's just... complete bullshit. Sorry, but there's literally not an ounce in truth in any of that. The countries with hard lockdowns are either done with lockdowns, or very soon will be. Those without hard lockdowns are going to be dealing with this shit for 6 months to a year <em>at least</em></p>

        <p>Hahah, mate, a few months of lockdown isn't going to cause a famine in any country which isn't already bordering on it. New Zealand is doing just fine. If anything, countries which don't get this shit under control are going to be hurt worse economically due to the lack of tourism/trade.</p>
<p>If you actually think places like New Zealand are going to have death from hunger, you're so far gone there's no point discussing any further</p>

        <p>&rt;What about cancer? People can't get cancer screenings. People can't get chemo. They are dying. What about heart attacks?</p>
<p>Hospitals are still open and you are free to go to them if you need to, lockdown hasn't stopped people who need treatment, at least where I live, lockdown may actually be partly responsible for this by keeping the curve low.  </p>
<p>&rt; There is absolutely no fucking logical explanation to lock down ever. I am sure you are privileged as FUCK. </p>
<p>There are plenty of logical reasons to do so. And I work at a grocery store so I wouldn't say I am too  privileged, although I suppose I live in Canada so maybe that makes me privileged compared to other nations.  </p>
<p>Here we took the necessary precautions. We locked down, wore masks, social distanced, and as a general rule listened to the scientists. And now as a whole everything is back to normal. We still wear masks and if we want to eat out we eat on the outdoor patio rather then inside but that's about all that is different.</p>

        <p>I’m wondering how you all handle people pressuring you to get tested? Being tested is a HARD NO from me but I repeatedly find myself in situations with friends surrounding travel where they’d like me to. It’s caused riffs in friendships and I’ve been flat out uninvited before. We are leaving on a trip tomorrow and received a last minute call from friends saying they would like us to get tested and they even researched where we should go to do that. Does anybody have any good rebuttals for not being tested? I’m so tired of finding myself in the same poor situation over and over again and I’d often rather not go into conspiracy theory when questioned.</p>
<p>Additionally, after taking new steps to keep my pineal glad decalcified, I’ve decided to turn down the temperature gun as well. Any tips for denying this pressure in the moment?</p>

        <p>I've been having a real hard time with all this recently. I'm separated from my fiancé again because of travel restrictions (that have proven to be ineffectual), employment outlook doesn't look great, I broke my nose last month so being forced to wear a mask actually hurts, and there's no end in sight to any of this crap. </p>
<p>The narrative is already changing to a vaccine won't be enough to return us to normalcy. </p>
<p>I'm 23. I just want to get on with my life instead of being stuck in purgatory for the next however many years. </p>

        <p>What happened in New York in March and April is asymptomatic of New York. Did you ever go to New York? I used to fly in to see my parents who unfortunately had to move there in 2010. Even before the plane lands, you see it. Not one, not two, but hundreds and hundreds of air conditioning units marking off each lived in area of each space inside a building. It is a land of constant cubicles. And if you live with another person, which most poor people must do in that city, the spread of viruses is bound to happen through the tiny spaces. Yes, if this was not an unintentional result of China's bumbling in the virus warehouse, then it was an attack on the US soil that caused extreme panic and fear from the sudden onslaught of hospitalizations and body bags there in the city's morgues. It is time to realize that this can happen again, and we should be prepared. But I don't think that we have come up with an answer that really makes sense like killing Osama Bin Laden did. That was the strategy that worked in that situation, at least somewhat.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if this rant will be respected here but I’m not sure where else it would go. </p>
<p>I am not for or against restrictions/lockdown per se. I lean toward going with what the medical professionals and scientists recommend, as they are the ones who know the science best. I admit the messaging has gotten a bit muddled since this is all new and we’re learning and everything is complicated. I definitely think we need to figure out how to keep kids in in-person classes as safely as possible and we need to get financial relief to the business and individuals who need it. </p>
<p>However, people throwing a fit to get back to our old normal are honestly making me as depressed as the damn restrictions. As someone who has struggled to pay the bills, I know too well that any kind of financial suffering sucks but damn if our economy isn’t based on a house of cards anyway. We do nothing but design/market/manufacture shit to buy and sell around the world that we ultimately throw in a landfill. That’s it, that’s really what people want to get back to. Back to Starbucks and blowing money at Target and eating in mediocre restaurants where the employees can’t even afford to get dental work. Back to shitty movies in movie theaters where people can’t even stay off their damn phones. Back to watch our kids play little league so we can briefly feel better about ourselves but then ignore those same kids in the privacy of our homes. Yeah you’re all doing it.  We were facing a mental health crisis BEFORE and there’s a reason for that. </p>
<p>If you’re suffering financially I feel for you, and I’m angry too because it didn’t have to be this way. If you truly can’t spend time with a friend or family because of travel restrictions or whatever, I feel for you too. But if you just want to get back to numbing yourself with the worst this world has to offer, maybe shore up you your resilience a bit and look inside yourself for what you are truly missing out on.</p>

        <p>I can't say for sure what the governments plan is, I do believe it is to gain even more control over the population for something.  And sure, that comic is an exaggeration.  But my question is this-  Why is the country and most of the world locked down for a virus that has a 99.99% survival rate per the CDC?  The lives of nearly every single person have been changed- most for the worse.  What are the masks protecting us from?   Why is there a rush to get a vaccine out for a virus that has a 99.99% survival rate?  I could understand at first when we didn't know much about the virus, but we have numbers now proving it isn't the killer that media still portrays it to be.  Thanks for being civil.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</a></p>

        <p>Wait, where does it say 99.99%? I looked at the table and I think the figures you're referencing are being mistaken for percentages, but are actually a zero to one rating (hence the lack of percent symbol).</p>

        <p>I took the average of all 4 age groups to get 0.0148 IFR.  Subtracting that from 1 gives you the percentage 0.985, which would be 98.5% survival rate, if my math checks out.  Apologies for the 99.99% claim, that was incorrect math hastily done in my head, something that shouldn't be done with this.</p>

<p>And most of the world isn't really locked down anymore, where I am everything is basically back to normal aside from having to wear a mask in most stores and having to eat outside on patios rather then inside the restaurants.

        <p>Hi, just found this sub and I want to give my 2 cents. Now I read through this thread about people being given major anxiety/grief for not wearing masks, either from staff at various locations, or people in general. I never had considered that situation to happen to so many different people because I know people trying to game the system simply cause they think wearing masks sucks. They don't consider the bigger picture. Now I wear masks whenever I go into a building (because COVID has a very slow half-life for a virus, stays in the air for a while) and whenever I'm interacting very close with other people (like an event of some kind in the street, where people are jumbled up) other than that though, I don't wear it. I don't wear it while boarding, walking outside or anything of that sort. However, I am risking getting COVID by doing that, and I know it. An unlikely risk is still a risk. Stay safe, wear a mask when appropriate, and don't refute scientific studies on the matter, scientists knows what's up</p>

        <p>That's fine. You do you. Thanks for explaining your side. At least you are aware that some people, such as myself, cannot wear one due to sensory/psychological issues. I have tried to wear one, but after a few seconds I had to tear it off. I felt like I was being suffocated. </p>
<p>I'm not denying COVID exists, not at all. I'm just very skeptical about certain things, eg that fact that while cases are rising , deaths aren't. I want to have somewhat of an open mind so I'm up for discussion.</p>

        <p>Most people don’t have any legitimate reason at all to not wear a mask.  I’m <em>sure</em> you do, but most everyone else refusing to wear one is just being an asshole.  I have moderate asthma and take a few medications every day for it, and I have no issue wearing a mask.  You really need to have a significant medical issue to truly prevent you from wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>And that's why the general population should wear masks, to protect people like you. That way, if they were to be symptomatic, they would have an incredibly hard time to infect you. And people should wear masks in high risk areas (inside buildings, during gatherings, while at work). </p>
<p>As for the cases rising, and deaths not rising, this is cause for concern. Ever played Plague Inc? Obviously that game is a game, and the effects will be way less severe in real life, but one of the main ways to kill off the world is to spread the virus to everyone and then mutating and become deadly. This won't happen in real life, but the virus will mutate and possibly create other strains that could have various effects, possibly deadly, possibly not. I'm no microbiologist, but seeing stats rise, whether it be the number of cases or deaths, are not a good thing. It's safer to protect yourself (if reasonable), practice social distancing and limit exposure as much as possible to essentially choke the virus of transmission</p>

<p>If no then why not? don't you think people should wear masks to protect the vulnerable from the flu and potentially other unknown viruses? They also spread when asymptomatic. </p>
<p>If you where a mask and use the justification of protecting other to mandate it then you are a hypocrite if you ever stop.</p>

        <p>Huh, I used your source and found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z3pAmix.jpg">this</a> seems like it advocates for using masks, and the publications you referred to me seems to be misinterpreting what "close contact" means.</p>
<p>According to the CDC guidelines I posted above, "close contact" means less than 6ft. But the laughably named "Blunt Force Truth" article quoted it's entire article published by an organization named "Big Leagues Politics" who's arguments for deceiving the public being :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Scientists thought the virus could be contracted from surfaces and objects. They at first thought it was a concern, and later rescinded and said that the main cause is person to person contact. Nothing wrong or sketchy here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 6% of the deaths are ONLY due to Covid-19. I will say this. If this disease kill people that only have some other manageable condition, it's still a fucking deadly virus. It kills people that would otherwise have lived. And over a hundred thousand of them in the US alone. </p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>Scientists have politicized masks. Beforehand, it was considered totally ridiculous to wear masks, especially non sick people. The CDC, WHO etc all say asymoptomatic spread is not a thing. People don't want to admit that.</p>
<p>Regarding masks if YOU wish to wear one - go ahead, knock yourself out. Mandates however for something that is not scientifically proven are ridiculous. If you ARE actively ill with anything at all, stay home, wash hands, get better. The rest of us can live our lives.</p>
<p>My main concern is to do with lockdowns, the economic, societal destruction they cause and the fact there is no end game, and has not been from day 1. I am of the opinion they are permanent. There is no way out of this once we started, vaccine or not. 'New normal' was a phrase created for a reason. I am a rational, educated person but this is all incredibly disturbing. Even moreso that people want such restrictions on their lives indefinitely, and are okay with living in a police state to achieve it.</p>
<p>99.9%+ of us are not conspiracy theorists, we are normal people very concerned about government over-reach, tyrannical creep, insane rules that make no sense and don't even help people that need it - the truly vulnerable, the elderly etc etera. Included in this number of skeptics, people worried about the way we have handled this (we are not virus skeptics, it's real, it sucks!), are plenty of well-respected, world-renowned scientists.</p>

        <p>I love that you read and accepted the piece of information about the spread of covid from the WHO and CDC that validated your personal beliefs and then ignored every clarifying statement and subsequent findings when it didn’t. That totally sounds like someone being intellectually honest. </p>
<p>And ignoring that this, people constantly <em>misinterpret</em> symptoms or fail to realize they have them. Symptoms don’t have to be significant. Many people even ignore them. People have even intentionally gone out knowing they have the virus. Masks work not only to protect against the spread of covid in ideal settings, it also protects against the irresponsibility and stupidity of a large population of people. And judging by this sub and your comments, that’s extraordinarily sound advice.</p>
