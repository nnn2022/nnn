        <p>Strangely enough, when I was talking about possibilities like a "vaccine passport" eight months ago I never had people tell me that it was a conspiracy theory, but I did have people voice full-throated support of it.</p>
<p>What is wrong with people? Why do they think the government needs to regulate how individuals can participate in commerce based on their medical status? Like what the fuck kind of dystopian hell are you trying to create here?</p>

        <p>&rt;[The Government] wants to set up systems that are not easily hacked or passports that cannot be counterfeited, given that forgeries are already starting to appear.</p>
<p>Just that sentence...they’re talking about concerns of forgeries starting to appear, but why should that even matter?  Wouldn’t the person forging their passport just be hurting themselves being somewhere uNPrOTeCtED from the vaccine?  </p>
<p>My daughter was vaccinated for measles this year. That’s because the measles still exists - it’s a horrible disease and can easily kill small children. Now...do I go around <strong><em>requiring proof</em></strong> of others that they either don’t have measles or they have the vaccine? <strong><em>Nope</em></strong>.  That’s because the vaccine protects my daughter, AND if she didn’t have the vaccine, I would know and understand the risks of being out in the general public. </p>
<p>Why is this different?  Why penalize people for making their own decisions about a vaccine (experimental or not)?  </p>
<p>I read 1984 in June last year as the p(l)andemic was starting to unfold, and I thought Orwell’s take on the people not fighting back against the egregious measures by The Party (listening machines in home, blatantly destroying history, outlawing sex/pleasure, etc.) was a bit of an exaggeration.  But now we’re seeing it firsthand:</p>
<p>We are classifying people, and the government isn’t even denying it...they’re <strong><em>publicly pushing</em></strong> for it.  </p>
<p>We can’t reference (or hardly find) mask studies for the general public prior to 2020 that say that there are too many variables in a public setting for cloth masks to be effective.</p>
<p>We are being denied events, dating, and other recreational activities. </p>
<p>And the best part about all of this? <em>The masses are</em> <strong><em>begging</em></strong> <em>for it</em></p>

        <p>Hmm - I like that one. Also from Camus - </p>
<p>&rt;The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.</p>
