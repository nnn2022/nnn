    <strong>The Power of Thought, Prayer and Consciousness - You Can Be the Change That Saves Our World.</strong>
    <p><p>I love this community with all my heartüíñ. I love other subreddits too that I'm a member of, but NNN is the G.O.A.T., and so I wanted to share something that I think will help us win against this evil force trying to destroy us. </p>
<p>I was very sad last night, to the point of cryingüò¢, but not for myself, but rather for my fellow human beings who are in tremendous pain, suffering, and anguish with what we're seeing happening around us. We're all under immense unbelievable pressure due to direct or indirect problems/complications/fall-out from covid-19 restrictions, and with the seemingly non-stop, continual, 24/7 fear-mongering news, negativity, cancel culture, mean spiritedness and bullying that it feels as if we're drowning in utter despair. </p>
<p>As I sat alone, the following came to my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are Infinite Consciousness ‚ú®üåü</li>
<li>The entire Cosmos is within us üåå</li>
<li>We are Eternal Light üëº</li>
</ul>
<p>If we put our minds to something (i.e. wishing or willing for something to happen) such as wishing for good things to happen to your loved ones, or praying for healing for someone who is currently in pain or misery, or just putting out Good Thoughts out to the World, then that mind-consciousness energy will manifest itself in ways that will help save us and save our world. I truly believe in the power of Thought, Prayer and our magnificent Consciousness. </p>
<p>And if this Good Energy is put out there then it can awaken our neighbors, friends and loved ones who have been asleep for such a long time now. We can literally change this world! We have SO much power at our command, but just need to remind ourselves we‚Äôre the ones in control, not these outside insidious sinister forces. </p>
<p>I know it sounds crazy, but this message said that you can change this world by emanating Strong Powerful Vibrations of Love &amp; Light. Pray and emit good thoughts. Don't give in to the despair. Your Good Energy Thoughts will help cancel out the Negative Dark Evil forces around the Earth.</p>
<p>Thank you.üôè</p></p>
