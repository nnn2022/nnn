    <strong>Vaccine shedding...</strong>
    <p><p>So something interesting happened recently.  About a month ago I was taking a shower and my balls felt a little tight or uncomfortable I guess you'd say when I was taking a shower.  </p>
<p>Now anyone will balls can tell you that these little shape-shifters morph and move at the slightest breeze.  </p>
<p>Anyway, as I was washing I could have sworn that my ball on the left side felt swollen, now I didn't fondle it too much because I know the hypochondriac in me would rear his ugly head and have me obsessing non stop.  So I didn't.  I had the wife look at it and she agreed that the left side of the sack was slightly red and possibly enlarged, though it wasn't obvious enough to be alarming.  </p>
<p>The tightness or uncomfortable feeling lasted about 2-3 days, I ignored it and it went away and I never thought anymore about it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to yesterday, someone over in the covid vaxx sub said her husband got the prick and afterwards had swollen balls.  I looked it up and yup, I saw more accounts of this.</p>
<p>Now vaccine shedding is something that I've been concerned about from day one but it wasn't on my mind when my balls were sore because I didn't know that was a side effect so I know it wasn't on my mind.  </p>
<p>I have had some brief contact with the walking science experiments and I've never worn a mask in the grocery store or Walmart so if shedding is possible it's definitely possible that I've been exposed. </p>
<p>Coincidental?  Maybe.</p></p>

        <p>The shedding is real. My wife got the vaccine and I didn’t but started to get symptoms of the vaccine “side effects” soon after she got it.</p>
<p>I also had testicular pain but it was only after sex and very mild. Definitely something I hadn’t experienced before.</p>
<p>My hope is that whatever causes these issues transferring from the vaccinated to the non vaccinated is temporary.</p>

        <p>Shedding is real for sure but it is highly dependent on spike protein load (similar to viral load). You are unlikely to have any sort of infertility due to some minor shedding exposure, and remember the spike protein bonds to any ace2 receptor not just in the testes so you would be noticing inflammation everywhere. I wouldn’t worry about infertility, just try to minimize your exposure to vaccine shedders especially within 2 weeks of their shot. (Preliminary studies show the spike protein peaks at 5 days post shot)</p>

        <p>Does that apply to women too? I just finished my period and got my hair done. And my hairdresser had gotten the vaccine.  Then I started lightly spotting for almost 2 weeks (it's still happening). Its very light. Basically when I go to the bathroom and wipe the tolietpaper has red or pink spots. I dont wear a tampon or pad it's that light. Will that make me infertile? Or would it take more exposure to vacinated persons over time? I'm totally freaking out.  I've never had any children.  I feel like Bill Gates raped me with his vaccines.</p>

        <p>I don’t think light exposure could make you infertile but those are definitely concerning symptoms. Honestly there isn’t any long term info, so idk. Try to limit exposure to anyone vaccinated, wear an n95 if you have to be in close quarters with shedders.</p>

        <p>She wore a cloth mask but I didnt wear any mask because they make my allergies flare up really bad.  But I guess if I'm under close contact I might have too. I had no idea she got the shot. She didn't research it all. She just felt as hairdresser some Karen would bully her and so she did it. She has a teenager daughter so I really hope the shedding wont make non vax people infertile.  Gates and Fauci need to die for what they have done!</p>

        <p>Wait so how long do they shed? I can't find any objective information, and this morning my friend who I have talked about having kids with and is in a place with no resources for research got the johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine. And I'm so mad about it, I'm in complete disbelief. So in 4 to 9 months will he still be shedding? Do you know where I can find more information?</p>

        <p>No way. Dude!!
 Get this, so my fiance (now ex) she got the vaccine without telling me. And I started getting a massive pain in my testisticles as well. But the would get super tight and hurt like hell. They thought it was a torsion but they ended up just saying there were cysts forming. I never felt any bumps anywhere. It had to have been from the vaccine.  Because everything was just fine before she had gotten it.</p>

        <p>This post is your evidence, the guy who responded with the same scenario is your evidence.  The dozens of girls I've seen here on Reddit in different comment sections talking about unusual or non existent periods after contact with test subjects.  Anecdotal evidence is as good as any study you'll find these days.  </p>
<p>Who do you suppose would fund a large scale double blind placebo test on proving that these vaccines were unsafe?  The pharmaceutical companies, the government?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact there is research because I believe that they mention a form of shedding in the documentation for one of the injections.  It was on page 63 and it mentioned something to the effect that if a pregnant woman comes into close contact with a jab taker that it needed to be documented.</p>

        <p>Well obviously you must be mistaken, as it is impossible for the spike protein to be transmitted through your lungs. There is likely something else that occurred unrelated to the vaccine. Also, say shedding did exist. How would it result in you feeling pain in your balls? The same thing applies to the girls you have seen on Reddit with abnormal periods. There is absolutely no solid evidence that supports that shedding is a real occurrence.</p>

        <p>You expect solid evidence for something that might have existed for a total of 2 months?  </p>
<p>The evidence is that these girls with their periods and me and this other guy with his balls are experiencing known injection side effects without having taken the injection but having had contact with those who have.  The evidence is that the injection manufacturer admits this is a possibility.</p>

What if we didn’t do anything about chicken pox or measles or any other disease that was cured by a vaccine. You can’t save everybody, but you can save a lot with vaccination.</p>

        <p>I never made the bOLd leAp back to covid is real. They were going to die anyway of the underlying illnesses or weaknesses that made them susceptible.</p>
<p>Do you really believe we eradicated the seasonal flu this year?  Do you really believe that?  You know that cases were supposedly down almost 100% country wide correct?  Ask yourself how that's possible.  If your answer is masks and social distancing I don't know what to tell you.  </p>
<p>Let's say you believe that - that masks and social distancing eradicated the flu.  Are you willing to live your life the way that you have for the last year in order to save people from dying of the flu this fall?  Is any amount of death acceptable in a society?  If you aren't willing to live your life like you have for the last year and a half for the rest of your life -then you better start asking yourself the hard questions like "what amount of preventable death is acceptable in a society?"  Because I have news for you, you can't eliminate the seasonal flu with a vaccine; by their own admission the flu vaccine is at MOST 40% effective on a good year.  This means that in order to save all those lives that you think we saved this year, masking and social distancing and distance working and learning will have to be a permanent fixture in your life.  Are you willing to accept that?</p>
<p>I'm not being argumentative at this point but I'd like you to think about that.  I'd like to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <p>“They were going to die anyways” my guy, having heart issues doesn’t mean they are fatal. I could literally have a respiratory problem, have it under control, and live an almost perfectly normal life all the way until old age. You don’t just die as soon as you get a kidney problem or a heart murmur. You clearly are severely uneducated in the field of medics and perhaps Logic as well.</p>

        <p>Dude, you are straw-manning me so hard rn.. I previously said that I am against masks and social distancing, tard. I am criticizing your weak claim that the mRNA vaccine results in “shedding” of the spike protein (which is a bs belief based in no science), a claim that is only supported by your encounters of other people o Reddit. Being skeptical of the vaccine is fine, your body your choice. But living in fear of the vaccine and discouraging others from taking it without any logical reason is regressive. Also, what type of moronic question is “is any amount of death acceptable in society?” Obviously yes, but it should be our priority to minimize these deaths (which can occur with vaccinations). With this mindset, anytime a pandemic occurs, your logic will just be “Ah damn, another virus, I guess we will just do absolutely nothing to counter it!”.</p>

        <p>The phizer study protocol says on page 67 if you are pregnant and come into contact with someone who is part of the trial such as your doctor you need to contact (website) so the duration of your birth can be documented as you can be affected from coming into skin contact or via breath. </p>
<p>So pretty much hope you don't miscarry or have a deformed child but let us know so your loss can become a statistic. 
Also how long are you with docotor for? 20 mins to an hour? That's not very long and they can still affect you. </p>

        <p>I'm confident they can shed, that much is in their own documentation.  Though I don't know if it could be enough shed and then like you say, enough absorbed for problems to arise though I see no reason why not.</p>
<p>No, I don't think I was having any of the other symptoms that people talk about post prick but that could be because I was exposed to such a small amount.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I have seen the articles on vaccines that spread themselves and mosquitos that spread vaccines even. I just don’t trust a soul. What do you think happens then? The person releases a bad thing and we are around to bring it in contact with our body, resulting in our relatively weak immune system not being able to keep up? I feel like if anything, it’s likely something that is only affecting us when we are near it. I doubt it stays in our body while we are away from the jabbed for too long. Those around the jabbed constantly could have it working nonstop. I don’t see how we could get around this without taking big risks. For example, for a business owner, would they say no lemmings allowed? That’s probably the farthest I would go other than staying a little far from everyone. I ran to TN with $500 just to get out of the cult Chicago area and into a homestead area. I’m not even close to getting off grid. I’m actually learning mechanics and know nothing about it. If it were as bad as the vaccines... I’d run to the woods with my hatchet...</p>

        <p>Bruh, Bill Gates was literally going to block out portions of our sunlight by releasing chemicals and metals into the atmosphere. You know how easily we could solve hunger, in America, at the very least? Maybe stop funding random bullshit. You take a few billion of our budget, and don’t just buy meals to give people. You open localized farms with the sole purpose of providing food for their communities. You encourage people to care about what happens locally around them, rather in regions where we can do nothing. Then you start seeing your neighbors who have a little more than the next guy, and oh wow, they might invite them over for dinner. I grew up on a farm where we would give people free housing, utilities, etc for them to come help us keep everything going. And we would still pay them a weekly fee, despite us being broke as fuck. My brother went to school for this very purpose; to encourage households to take feeding themselves back into their own hands. Quit relying on people, install local farms, and allow people to come, work, and then feed themselves.</p>
