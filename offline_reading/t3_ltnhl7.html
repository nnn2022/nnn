    <strong>The Numbers</strong>
    <p><p>Summary: the numbers are nonsense.</p>
<p>As we approach the one year anniversary of two weeks to #flattenthecurve, Im curious if anyone lives in a state that produces useful COVID numbers on their dashboard. Im in Maryland, and we never have.</p>
<p>To explain, daily at 10 AM the state updates its ‘dashboard’ for information from the previous 24 hours. Front and center is “Confirmed cases.” Here, that number is somewhere like 375k and increasing by a few hundred per day. Thing is, thats the cumulative number since last March. MARCH 2020. What purpose does that number serve? Notably missing is “current active cases.” If i did a rough estimate, and used the revised period of 10 days for the virus to run its course, we probably have about 6,000 active cases statewide right now. Those are not hospitalizations, mind you, just cases. Also worth noting is our population - 6.5 million. That means about 0.09% of the population actively has this virus. </p>
<p>That means that when you go about your day in Maryland, masked and socially distanced, the numbers really show that after you come in contact with 1,125 people - 1 of them likely has COVID. Do these precautions make any sense in light of that threat?</p>
<p>Already posted way longer than I planned. But dont get me started on the so-called “positivity rate.” I have never figured out why this number is relevant at all. If you are testing people suspected of having, and exhibiting signs worthy of testing, for COVID...you would expect as close to 100% as possible. I have no idea why there is sustained mass testing knowing that 97%+ of those tested do not have the virus. Thats just plain stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking back to #flattenthecurve, which made sense to me at the time, we had restrictions to lessen the avalanche of patients our hospitals were facing. That avalanche never happened. The numbers do not justify any restrictions at all. Using only cumulative numbers is meant to exacerbate the seriousness of the situation and keep the people scared. </p>
<p>Florida gets it, Maryland does not. Maybe I should just move.</p></p>
