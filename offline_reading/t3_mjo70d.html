        <p>The only suffering I've experienced is the loss of employment, not being able to see my friends and family, not being able to travel or go out to eat, no movies, bowling, dancing, all forbidden by the government. Going out in public surrounded by a masked, fearful populace. 
 As far as the virus itself,  I had it last August, it was like a mild cold.</p>

<p>they're not saying "hey please", they're saying, "DO IT" or we're gonna fine you, arrest you, bankrupt you, beat you.</p>
<p>not being able to talk a walk, have you families over, work, under the threat of the government bankrupting you or beating you up, is extremely dystopian.</p>
<p>also lockdowns and masks are literally proven to do nothing. just look at Sweden or florida. just like all socialist policies, it's bullshit that doesn't work.</p>

        <p>Mrna vaccines are likely to kill more then covid </p>
<p>From previous research on ADE in other coronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it appears that the existence of ADE will elicit more severe body injury, while actually reducing the viral load at the same time. This may affect the results of vaccine therapy. The presence of this phenomenon in these two coronaviruses indicates a potential risk in the vaccine therapy for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as it shares the same viral receptor and similar genome sequence with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar mechanism of viral entry and thus may share similar mechanisms of ADE</p>

        <p>You are absolutely and completely right about that. I've heard this multiple times and have no gripe with what you have said, except for the fact that there has been plenty of evidence to show that in Covid-19 this does not happen, atleast not to the same degree as to make it more deadly than the virus itself. The evidence that I am referencing is the some 160 million vaccine doses currently given out as stated by the cdc. While in some of these doses there has been complications arising due to the presence of covid-19 related antibodies I have yet to hear one report about the phenomenon previously observerd in other coronaviruses and their respective mrna vaccines, appear in covid-19 during or after vaccine doses have been administered.</p>

        <p>Well, in the sars-cov-1 vaccine in 2004 it took multiple exposures of the wild virus to kill the animals in the clinical trial so i would expect it to take some time before we would even know about ADE in the vaccines.</p>
<p>The other thing is I don’t necessarily trust anything the media says because of this report right here. It shows 32 spontaneous abortions after the pfizer vaccine. The fact that no one in the media is mentioned this at all is evidence of a massive conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Yes, you are correct about that and how it it possible that we might not see the impacts of ADE in the vaccine until later, however I don't believe we will see significant effects, although I have no concrete evidence of this. In time we will see who was correct, and I accept the epossibility that I could be completely wrong about this and the MRNA vaccines could prove to be deadly, though I'm hoping it doesn't turn out that way for sale if the safety of those who have taken the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also I appreciate the source, gave it a check through as to find the mentioned spontaneous abortions. I aswell find it strange that these weren't reported on considering that even given the small number of occurrences relative to vaccine doses administered it is a strange set of happenings. However personally I don't find this indicative if a large scale conspiracy. My guess in why it hasn't been reported on is because spontaneous abortions are, while very uncommon, an occurrence that can happen Independent of if they had taken the vaccine or not. Though you are still entitled to your own opinion.</p>

        <p>Decided to do some research on the appearance of ADE in SARS-CoV-2 and so far no occurrences have been noticed. Infact, during the development of the vaccine an approach for successfully neutralizing the virus during immune response WITHOUT causing ADE, was specifically searched for. </p>
<p>Source: https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/02/12/antibody-dependent-enhancement-and-the-coronavirus-vaccines</p>
<p>By PhD Organic Chemist who took part in the development of the covid mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>One approach originally intended for use (targeting the nucleoprotien of covid), would have sizable chance for causing ADE to appear. That chance of ADE is why that approach was abondoned. The current approach used in the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 is to target the S2 subunit of the spike protein, this approach was chosen specifically for it's high efficacy and for its very low probability for ADE occurrence. As of current, during animal trials, human clinical trials, and during the vaccine rollout there have been no occurrences of ADE due to covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>550k people died with the virus but the number who died due to the virus is a small fraction of that. </p>
<p>And a large fraction of those who tested positive only had fragments of its genes, as stupid levels of PCR amplification resulted in false positives. Fauci is on video admitting this.

        <p>Stop ignoring the science cloth masks are worse then no mask</p>
<p>In 2015, the British Medical Journal published a paper entitled, A Cluster Randomised Trial of Cloth Masks Compared with Medical Masks in Healthcare Workers. The paper was written by nine authors from the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam and the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital health care workers. The study, which was extensive, concluded that the results caution against the use of cloth masks. ‘This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety,’ concluded the authors. ‘Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.’ And the authors added: ‘...as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for health care workers, particularly in high risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated’.</p>

You’re the one cherry picking data that only fits your ego. Masks are decreasing your oxygen levels. You know what a possible effect of prolonged decreased oxygen levels is? Dementia. Seems like you wear a mask all the time.</p>
<p>The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-6817</p>
<p>Our study revealed a decrease in the oxygen saturation of arterial pulsations (SpO2) and a slight increase in pulse rates compared to preoperative values in all surgeon groups.</p>

        <p>Your second study doesnt even have a full document available. It noted a minor reduction and similar studies found the same but usually just inside or outside of normal blood oxygen levels. That study also couldn’t account for the stress or factors involved in the process of you know, doing something as stressful and precise as surgery. The first may not have found a 50% reduction, but if i accept that one study as god it seems to say masks are better than nothing even in the abstract. Cant find a good reason to say no to masks from these studies. Seems youve found fringe studies that barely support your position and decided that masks must be deadly, dementia causing, population control devices.</p>

        <p>Feel like youre still stuck in 2016 when everyone always asked, “wheres your study!”. One study has never proved anything. Your science debunks your own arguments lmao. Nice convo.</p>

        <p>Lol you can reject the evidence all you want it doesn’t change the facts. These studies do in fact prove the uselessness of masks. Go worship your pointless cult somewhere else. You deserve what’s coming from the vaccine because you have zero critical thinking ability you just reject what hurts your fefes</p>

        <p>This subreddit is the cult. Scientific consensus is usually the best we have. Least you believe vaccines are safe i guess, not entirely lost. And have you read the methodology?</p>

        <p>You are the cult member you reject science because it hurts your little ego. Scientific consensus has been wrong tons of times. One relevant example is the way “experts” fought against the idea of germ theory directly killing millions of people because they wouldn’t even sterilize their knives before surgery.</p>
<p>My name is satire have you never heard of the failed sars-cov-1 vaccine? I expect far more people to die to antibody dependent enhancement from these vaccines then from covid. Heres a list of side effects in the uk from the pfizer vax including 32 spontaneous abortions.</p>
