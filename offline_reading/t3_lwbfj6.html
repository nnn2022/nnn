    <strong>I don’t care if your photo you posted was from “before covid” or that you were “wearing a mask except for this photo”</strong>
    <p><p>And if anyone does care and finds it in their impudence to call you out on it, why should that stop you or make you delete it? </p>
<p>Go on that hike. Meet your friend for coffee. Take a selfie together and share it. Post that old group photo from 2019 for nostalgia. Who cares. Not everything has to be clarified before anybody asks.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve been shocked to have had NOBODY ask any questions or made snide remarks when I posted mask-less pictures. I have received private messages from friends who suddenly realize we’re on the same page. That’s worth risking the potential drama from Karens.</p>

        <p>yeah i was already really getting tired of that aspect of social media, plus the fomo feelings.  now i feel outnumbered and am resenting “friends” or acquaintances, who by the benefit of the doubt are just following the beat of this fearmongering and gaslighting media (that is said honestly without hyperbole, maybe even understating just how intensely one sided it all is.)</p>
<p>Format wise, I appreciate this place for the anonymity and free speech.  Self-censorship for self-preservation has been a huge brick in the wall of this last (fapfest) year.</p>
