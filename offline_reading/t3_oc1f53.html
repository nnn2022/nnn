    <strong>Shamed for legitimately being unable to wear a mask</strong>
    <p><p>I am autistic, and I’ve tried wearing different masks during the COVID panic. I legitimately can’t do it. The sensory overload that masking caused me legitimately made me sick. I felt as if I’d pass out, vomit, and cry all at the same time. My fight or flight response would be triggered, my anxiety would fly through the roof, and I’d overall feel as if I was suffocating. </p>
<p>Luckily, both my job and my college were accommodating, and they allowed me to wear a face shield instead. They’re less effective than masks, but it was the best I could do. I even started having fun with them and wearing shields that had fun designs on them. </p>
<p>When I saw other people talk about their masking difficulties or say that there is no legitimate reason for someone to not wear a mask, I would tell them my story to either help or try to convince them otherwise. Every single time, I’d get at least one person angry at me. I’d be told that my comfort isn’t worth someone else’s life, how useless my choice of face covering was, that it’s all in my head, that I should just condition myself to masking if I truly care about ending the pandemic, and that I’m the reason COVID is so widespread in America. My personal favorites were the people who exclaimed that they were also autistic, but could wear a mask or even double mask. Some autistic people can mask, others cannot. Who fucking knew?</p>
<p>I’ve also been shamed by customers at my job. I’ve since been promoted to management, but before the mandates were lifted, I was a cashier at a discount store. I got a lot of questions about my shields, which I was happy to answer. However, I would also get people who chose to be rude about it. My personal favorites include someone who got directly in my face because she was a nurse and knows that "those don’t work” and someone who said I shouldn’t be working if I can’t wear a mask. Everyone on my team knows about my disability, and they would step in to help when they saw someone harassing me. </p>
<p>I’ve also been forced to put on a mask for appointments and to enter some stores despite my disability. I’d be lectured by the people guarding the door about their mask policy. Technically, under ADA, my shields should count as a reasonable accommodation. Others don’t agree with me, apparently. I’d usually either give in and make it quick, or decide “fuck it” and go somewhere else, depending on how much I needed to go to that store. One time, I took a mask from the employee at the door and stuck it in my pocket after getting past her. I felt really guilty for that, but I was still wearing a shield. </p>
<p>Here’s the thing that gets me: technically, I gave in to the mask thing. I still wore a face covering, but because it wasn’t specifically a mask, it wasn’t good enough. I wanted to do my part in ending the pandemic, but it wasn’t good enough. I complied with most COVID guidelines, especially at my college, but the fucking mask was the most important part to some of these people. </p>
<p>TL;DR: I can’t wear a mask due to a disability, wore a face shield to work and school instead, and faced online and in-person shaming over it.</p></p>

        <p>yep. I have rape related PTSD and have flashbacks if something is over my mouth. It's actually unsafe for anyone around me too. I've lost memory in big chucks trying to get groceries, which usually means I think I'm somewhere that I'm actually not. Guess how many people care, outside of the NNN protests? Z E R O. They can all take the vax, not my problem</p>
