    <strong>People of rotterdam (and Amsterdam) absolutely hate masks! And rightly so</strong>
    <p><p>So today the mayors of rotterdam and Amsterdam started making people wear masks in certain shopping districts. The national news went to both cities to look how things were going. And 50% of people they interviewed absolutely hated the masks if not more. One glorious dude had a paper party hat on his nose and mouth and was clearly so done with this shit. A lot of people in the market streets pointed out that, while masks were now apparently compulsory on the market itself, on street down they weren't compulsory. And people were like "so what gives?". </p>
<p>Plus the government ( who work together with scientists thank you very much)  have been saying for ages masks dont actually work very well. And even the mayors are admitting they only make people wear masks  for the "shock factor" to jog people's minds and maybe that way they will remember to socially distance. Thereby strengthening my conviction that masks are only good to scare people into obedience. </p>
<p>Some women very cleverly pointed out that making masks compulsory would be against articles 10 and 11 of our constitution, despite mayor Abouthaleb of Rotterdam attempting to wriggle out of that.</p>
<p>The interviewers from the national news clearly hadnt expected soo many people to resist the masks. Half of the people they interviewed werent wearing any, some were wearing the mask under their chin or nose in defiance. And you can bet they cherrypicked to get even a few people who were mask-positive.</p>
<p>Pleased to see not all people in my country are stupid. Now if only those anti-mask protesters weren't such a pitiful group. We need bigger protest groups like in germany.</p></p>
