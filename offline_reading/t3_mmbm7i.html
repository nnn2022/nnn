    <strong>The people who support lockdowns NEVER WENT OUTSIDE IN THE FIRST PLACE</strong>
    <p><p>All of these people who support lockdowns never fucking did anything besides sit at home anyways. They get to feel all good about "doing their part" and "staying home saves lives" because nothing is changing about their life. It was exactly what they did before -- nothing. </p>
<p>I have a life. I have things I want to do. I have places I want to be. I have people I love and want to be with. If you don't go outside in the first place, fine, continue to stay inside like you've always done. But don't force me to stay inside all day. </p>
<p>Yeah you've saved a few lives, but you've also put people out of their jobs, ruined their mental health, made people gain weight, stop people from getting fresh air and sunlight, made people homeless, ruined lives, put families into poverty, but yes, we saved a few lives. Congratulations. Quit forcing everyone in your depressing lifestyle.</p>
<p>Honestly, go fuck yourself if you support lockdowns. You're horrible</p></p>

        <p>Lowlifes love lockdowns </p>
<p>Miserable people love and support these restrictions because it removes accountability. Pre-lockdown they had no one but themselves to blame for being asocial shut ins with nothing to look forward to. Now they’re happy because they can lean back and pretend their lives were shitty all along because they had no control over it. The truth is, they always had control. Now they’re happy they can blame a “pandemic” </p>
<p>They love the fact everyone is locked up because in their minds it normalises and validates their pre lockdown lives</p>

        <p>This is what I have been saying since the start. Instead of facing the truth, they have used the lockdowns as a scapegoat for their personal shortcomings. It's like crabs in a bucket now that the end is looming, and they finally need to take some agency over their lives.</p>
<p>The whole pandemic response has been characteristic of those who actively avoid risk every day of their lives. Socially shut in due to risk of rejection, physically out of shape due to risk of injury, and middling intellect due to risk of being seen as stupid.</p>
<p>Just stay shut in until the risk goes away? Comes naturally.</p>

<p>It's also (and this might be the biggest one) risk of taking on "permanent" responsibility, eg marrying or having children, and not being stable enough to keep it from spiraling.</p>
<p>Most single women will be so glad to have another official excuse for delaying child bearing. They are deep down afraid they will not have the strength to see it through and be a good mother, to make the difficult decisions necessary etc (do I really want that "career"? am I prepared to give up these "friends" who will shame me for becoming a mother? am I prepared to give up the feeling of being "young" or "on the market" without becoming bitter? am I willing to take the risk of choosing the wrong man? am I willing to give up some aspirations, am I willing to have my body permanently changed by child bearing, and not become bitter about it? etc).</p>
<p>It's a huge decision and it comes with risk of exacting bitterness on their own children. And the risk is immediate.</p>
<p>The same goes for guys who don't want to take responsibility but in my opinion we are bottlenecked on women right now. Meaning, there are men who would commit if women would take motherhood seriously. I mean, I think men should take the lead and not wait for this, but there's a game-theoretic block unfortunately. Really fighting to bring back traditional values in wider society risks messing up one's career prospects enough that it may be difficult to have kids of your own. This is the deep problem of cancel culture-- good men with traditional values face two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Really be fight for traditional values everywhere in their society, and risk being targeted, being poor, having to try to make income on youtube or something, risk being single forever etc</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
<li>Lay low, hope to represent traditional values in one's own family or small little community, and just "keep quiet" when in the office, when in the city, when in social settings where crazed feminists would freak out if they said anything, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) is maybe a losing strategy when you look 5-10 generations in the future. But it comes with short term benefits (a wife, a stable job, food on the table).</p>
<p>I tend to think that both avenues will gradually work; that women are coming around, and that men with traditional values are gradually finding their voice, networking, building up social and economic alternatives which will be enough to challenge the establishment, to eventually appeal to young demographics and thus turn things around.</p>
<p>The sad part is there is sort of a lost generation of good men and women who missed their best chances. The scamdemic lockdowns are condemning more to this fate (ie- how many were actually ready to start families when lockdowns came, and they could therefore no longer effectively search for a partner, or had their careers messed up, or in whatever way were severely setback in their plans towards starting a family).</p>
<p>I know some Gen-X'ers who are this way. They missed their ideal chances but didn't become bitter, and actively put energy into trying to help younger people not make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>I think there will be far greater numbers of Millenial and Gen-Z who miss many opportunities. But if they don't become bitter over it, and work to improve things for the next generations (not just their own kids), I think things can turn around.</p>

        <p>It was a Republican administration that ordered the states to lockdown in the first place. All those Republican governors took away freedoms they had no authority to revoke. Don't fool yourself, this is the proverbial good cop bad cop routine. Left/right politics is a sham.</p>

        <p>Incorrect. The Republican administration (presumably you're talking about DJT) said it was a states rights issue and left it up to the individual states to decide. States like North Dakota never locked down (Republican governor). States like California never opened (Democrat governor).</p>

        <p>They should have informed locking down and enforcing mandates of any kind was unconstitutional and should have advised the public to take whatever precautions they felt were necessary to protect themselves but any action by authorities to force people to comply would be subject to prosecution. </p>
<p>If you want to go further back it was the George W. Bush administration that left the constitution in hanging by the threads with the Patriot Act, also Republican. Then Obama came and introduced the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) that obliterated it. Looking at all these globalist milestones in sequence, it's no wonder the Trump Administration said it was "Up to the states" when it actually violated the constitution the states are to abide by (Supreme Law of the land) and ANY law REPUGNANT to the constitution is NULL and VOID.</p>

        <p>Nah. Vote for whoever you agree with. Right now, regarding lockdowns, that happens to be mostly Republicans but these people aren’t your friends and aren’t going to fight for you. Politicians are gonna use whatever situation is going on to gain power. Don’t trust any of them, and definitely don’t vote for someone just because they have an R or D next to their name.</p>

        <p>I have a strong feeling that the extreme pro lockdown people on Twitter and reddit were already not going out and doing anything. They were recluses to begin with. They have no friends, no family that they care about, and no life outside of the Internet. Now, everyone is as miserable as them and they want to keep it that way because they enjoy it. Plus these people get to feel good about themselves for "doing their part" when in reality they're just doing what they were already doing.</p>

        <p>I feel it is mostly the people aged 45-65. Those that own a home with a garden and hold cozy job positions where they earn a good dime without having to do anything special, jobs that require no vision and no responsibility. People that are useless and are dependent on the system. They choose to be brainwashed by the media, they like the programming. These people are even too selfish to consider what kind of world their children are about to inherit. These people are already dead.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns literally never bothered me because I would've spent my summer in almost exactly the same way. The only caveat was that I had to wear a mask at work and there were certain places I didn't go.</p>
<p>That being said, I recognized that there were people that the lockdown absolutely did not help. My roommate thrives on social interaction and when you live 40+ mins away from your friends, having to quarantine for months on end can really get at you.</p>

        <p>I might be an exception, because im also someone who almost never went outside before this whole BS, for the last few years. But i still i support NNN.</p>
<p>I am in the ASD spectrum, but i lived a nontypical autist life for most years, had a normal childhood, wild teenage years with alot of going out (raves), traveled all over the world, lived in SEA for 6 years in my 20s. As i grow older my autism starts becoming more severe, so im basically a antisocial couch potato right now, and dont see anyone besides my family and GF.</p>
<p>I always had problems with authoritarians, and strict laws and rules in my life. And i have empathy for  teenagers right now who are missing out on their 'what should be'; best time of their life. Because i can remember how i enjoyed being a teen, hanging out, drinking, dancing.</p>
<p>Being a huge liberal that i am, and anti-authoritarian, i simply cannot be pro lockdown, or pro corona measures. I want people to let others live, and live their own life. No restrictions, no nothing</p>

        <p>same here. I'm a programmer, love sitting at home, code and watch animes and stuff. However, I hate the lockdown. The point is, you should be free to decide if you go out or not. I also love traveling and with a lockdown, it's not possible. </p>
<p>So I'm with you guys 👍</p>

        <p>want to blame the real culprit? blame big tech who are amplifying these minority opinions in order to make them appear like majority opinions, so they can keep enriching themselves from lockdowns, and eventually run the social credit score system.</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more.  I've been working at home for a while now and it sucks.  I used to work in a very fun, challenging workplace.  I think everyone pushing for more lockdowns would love to sit home alone on a computer forever.  Fuck that.</p>

        <p>In my experience they’re usually withdrawn,fearful hermits and many I’ve met also have deep underlying mental problems as well. They sit and watch CNN all day long. They are the ones who believe and spread conspiracy theories. They are EXACTLY what they accuse the rest of us for being...and worse. This didn’t affect the way they live their lives at all.</p>
