        <p>before covid nobody said masks stopped viruses.  It is only within the last 6 months they started saying that.  And now they are saying wear two or three masks because wearing single masks didn't reduce infection rates.</p>

        <p>it's worse than that. Before COVID, we had an abundance of mask research from SARS. The prevailing view was that masks had virtually no effect in preventing virus transmissibility, but that they actually increased the risk of infection for the person wearing the mask, due to the absorbency of the mask. I spent a lot of time reading about this in the mid 2000s, because I started seeing a lot of pictures appear on the internet of Asians wearing masks and I was curious what the deal was. It was really quite alarming to have been aware of these things prior to the appearance of COVID, being in a position to watch the mask science magically reverse direction in real-time, and practically overnight.</p>

        <p>literally true though. droplets are much larger than the virus particles, and can easily be stopped by a cloth mask. as much as I would like for cloth masks to be useless, the jury is out. they work.</p>

        <p>Unless you do any actual research. Then you'll find that cloth masks have the potential to break up droplets into many more smaller droplets and expel them. Stop being a conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly. I was responding to the comment that was acting like all of a sudden masks are a think. They were enforced during the spanish flu a hundred years ago, too. </p>
<p>People have known for a very long time that covering your mouth and nose reduced viral transmission. When sick.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly this. Some of the most "convincing" studies I've seen on masks run their observational experiments on <em>coughing</em>.</p>
<p>If this was the standard we held everyone to, where if you legitimately have symptoms you need to wear a mask, I would be fine with it. Because if you're coughing I can see how a mask <em>might</em> have a decent chance of catching some of what your body is trying to expel. But masking symptomless people who are just walking around breathing? Load of bullshit with little evidence of efficacy.</p>

        <p>Filters don't work like a sieve where only objects smaller than the "holes"  pass through. Filters are better described as a network with sticky surface, and certain objects can stick to this surface based on a multitude of chemical and physical processes and not just size alone. I mean, atmospheric gas molecules are like several orders of magnitude smaller than viral paricles and you can verify that they get held back by blowing on your hand through the mask.</p>

        <p>It doesn't block all of it, just some of it such that you can't get enough to breathe. Voice of experience here. You need <em>all</em> of the available oxygen close by to breathe. Especially if you have a lung problem.</p>
<p>It only takes one little virion to infect you, just one. That's why these masks are pointless. Unless they're 100% perfect you can still get infected if you wear them sround a sick person.</p>
<p>The actual equipment and respirators that are used to prevent contamination in the lab are expensive ass spacesuits with their own air filtration and separate air supplies and stuff. Those things cost like thousands. They'll never spend that much to save commoners so we are lied to and told, oh, any old piece of shit will do, just to appease our feelings.</p>
<p>That's why masks are problematic, if anything.</p>

        <p>You clearly don't understand why we use masks. No one has said that as soon as we wore masks they pandemic would end. The masks help to stop your aerosols from spreading farther than no mask. The masks are used as an extra precaution while keeping your distance. It's not that difficult to understand.</p>

        <p>Not according to the CDC or the WHO or health journals. Masks only help to quell anxiety. If you can read an actual quote from them on this that recommend the public don’t wear masks, and still continue to insist thinking that you need to wear one, I can’t help you, because your reasoning is based on fear not science.</p>

“We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face- to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, <strong>the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>.”</p>

        <p>It’s a just Univerisity of Austin study which speaks volumes. Then it grasps at whatever straws they can find to prove mask efficacy, while ignoring dozens of studies that have shown masks don’t work (which I can provide if you like). Still finding none it concludes:</p>
<p>“Overall, direct evidence of the efficacy of mask use is supportive, but inconclusive. Since there are no RCTs, only one observational trial, and unclear evidence from other respiratory illnesses, we will need to look at a wider body of evidence.</p>
<p>The lack of direct causal identifiability requires a more integrative systems view of efficacy.”</p>
<p>So then it pivots to the precautionary principle for analyzing whether mask mandate policy is justifiable.</p>
<p>“The goal of such an analysis is to assess the potential benefits and risks, in order to inform policy and behavior.”</p>
<p>Yet it cherry picks risk-benefit information in order to support its hypothesis, that masks are effective while ignoring all the harm that masks do, and having giving up on the idea that there is evidence that masks reduce spread. </p>
<p>Here is a report about risks-benefits-harm of wearing masks.</p>

        <p>Funny you can’t say what content you disagree with or why, or even address that the study you cited can’t find any conclusive proof that masks are effective. you can only go Reeeeee. Typical.
Here’s more. </p>
<p>To date, there is no Manufacturer Independent study the proves that wearing masks reduces infections, and certainly not cloth face coverings:</p>
<p>Ritter et al in 1975, found that “the wearing of a surgical face mask had no effect upon the overall operating room environmental contamination. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1157412/</p>
<p>-&rt; Ha’eri and Wiley in 1980, applied human albumin microspheres to the interior of surgical masks in 20 operations. At the end of each operation, wound washings were examined under the microscope. “Particle contamination of the wound was demonstrated in all experiments.” https://europepmc.org/article/med/7379387</p>
<p>-&rt; Laslett and Sabin, in 1989, found that caps and masks were not necessary during cardiac catheterization. “No infections were found in any patient, regardless of whether a cap or mask was used https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ccd.1810170306</p>
<p>-&rt; In Tunevall’s 1991 study, a general surgical team wore no masks in half of their surgeries for two years. After 1,537 operations performed with masks, the wound infection rate was 4.7%, while after 1,551 operations performed without masks, the wound infection rate was only 3.5% https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736</p>
<p>-&rt; A review by Skinner and Sutton in 2001 concluded that “The evidence for discontinuing the use of surgical face masks would appear to be stronger than the evidence available to support their continued use https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0310057X0102900402</p>
<p>-&rt; Lahme et al.,in 2001, wrote that “surgical face masks worn by patients during regional anaesthesia, did not reduce the concentration of airborne bacteria over the operation field in our study. Thus they are dispensable https://europepmc.org/article/med/11760479</p>
<p>-&rt; Figueiredo et al. in 2001, reported that in five years of doing peritoneal dialysis without masks, rates of peritonitis in their unit were no different than rates in hospitals where masks were worn http://www.advancesinpd.com/adv01/21Figueiredo.htm</p>
<p>-&rt; Bahli did a systematic literature review in 2009 and found that “no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative wound infection was observed between masks groups and groups operated with no masks" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20524498/</p>
<p>-&rt; Bahli in Sweden, recognizing the lack of evidence supporting the use of masks, ceased requiring them in 2010 for anesthesiologists and other non-scrubbed personnel in the operating room. “Our decision to no longer require routine surgical masks for personnel not scrubbed for surgery is a departure from common practice. But the evidence to support this practice does not exist,” wrote Dr. Eva Sellden. https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article/113/6/1447/9572/Is-Routine-Use-of-a-Face-Mask-Necessary-in-the</p>
<p>-&rt;Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) "Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial" N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</p>
<p>-&rt; Cowling, B. et al. (2010) "Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review", Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H).

<p>-&rt; Surgeons at the Karolinska Institutein 2010, reported on obstetric, gynecological, general, orthopaedic, breast and urological surgeries performed on 827 patients. All non-scrubbed staff wore masks in half the surgeries, and none of the non-scrubbed staff wore masks in half the surgeries. Surgical site infections occurred in 11.5% of the Mask group, and in only 9.0% of the No Mask group. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1445-2197.2009.05200.x</p>

(2012) "The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence", Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257-267. "There were 17 eligible studies. [...] None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask ⁄ respirator use and protection against inﬂuenza infection." https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>-&rt; Lopp &amp; Edwards reviewed the surgical literature in 2014 and found “no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the masked and unmasked group in any of the trials. https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002929.pub2/full</p>
<p>In a 2014 review based on four studies and 6,006 patients, wrote that “none of the four studies found a difference in the number of post-operative infections whether you used a surgical mask or not. https://europepmc.org/article/med/25294675</p>
<p>-&rt; Salassa and Swiontkowski, in 2014, investigated the necessity of scrubs, masks and head coverings in the operating room and concluded that “there is no evidence that these measures reduce the prevalence of surgical site infection https://journals.lww.com/jbjsjournal/Abstract/2014/09030/Surgical_Attire_and_the_Operating_Room__Role_in.11.aspx</p>
<p>-&rt; Da Zhou et al., reviewing the literature in 2015, concluded that “there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0141076815583167</p>
<p>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>

The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza." https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12381</p>
<p>-&rt; A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>

<p>-&rt; An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</p>
<p>-&rt; An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</p>
<p>-&rt; The Canadian Medical Association Journal published a Meta-analysis that identified 6 clinical trials and 23 surrogate studies that looked at the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: They "found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection". https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567</p>

        <p>I can see from the second link, that you are seeing what you want to see. They specifically say that the droplets are from the sides of the masks. They also test in a situation where they are right above the wound. The reason for masks is to limit aerosols out in the open, which they explain the masks stop directly out of the mouth. I also think that masks have improved since 1975. I reckon that the rest of the links are similar.</p>

        <p>Because wearing a mask assumes - rather incorrectly - that if one is aware enough to wear a mask, one is also keeping <em>relentlessly clean</em>.  Almost unproductively so.  As in: I can do nothing else all day long if it keeps me from being 100% clean and bacteria free.  </p>
<p>And guess what?  <em>That doesn't happen.</em>  <strong><em>That never happens.</em></strong></p>
<p>You would literally have to police the thoughts of every citizen on a fraction-of-a-second basis to keep them from going places or touching things that they shouldn't.  </p>
<p>Masks don't and never have made people cleaner.  People are just told to wear masks and that's it.  They are not shamed into other cleanliness rigors that are required to do what is laughably referred to as "stopping the spread".  </p>
<p>And you know something?  You know that.  </p>
<p>You know that "just wear a mask" is too simplistic a solution for it to work unless there is 100% compliance.</p>
<p>You know that you can never have 100% compliance on a behavior so small that everyone has to adhere to it, even small children who don't appreciate why and don't have the capacity to understand it; or people who are in some way impaired and simply can't.  </p>
<p>And yet, it's so much more complicated that you can blame people for not adhering 100% (even though it probably won't work if there WAS 100% compliance) because it isn't "just" doing that one thing, <strong><em>and you still blame them when the result you want, that has never been proven WILL happen doesn't happen anyway</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>Because you don't care about virus spread.  You never have.  What YOU care about is being able to boss people around while wrapping your power trip in disingenuous "empathy".  You know that.  We know that.  No need to pretend anymore.  Just let it out.  At least we'd respect you for having integrity about your position.</p>

        <p>Dude what the fuck are you on about?</p>
<p>I wear a mask cause I don’t wanna kill someone or die from this virus.</p>
<p>Your logic is stupid.</p>
<p>This sub constantly shits on the “two weeks of masking is all we need” not working. while also saying the mask is bullshit and doesn’t work so they won’t wear it.</p>
<p>How the fuck were we EVER going to have 2 weeks of wearing a mask, if people like YOU, aka this sub, don’t wear masks and act like it’s useless.</p>
<p>You’re acting like because 100% compliance is almost impossible to get, we just shouldn’t wear masks at all. As if 60% of mask wearing wouldn’t reduce the virus spread at all.</p>
<p>And before you say “but masks don’t work!” Please explain how other countries who followed mask guidelines and quarantines are able to have concerts and no masks, with 0 deaths?</p>

        <p>I don't know where you live but in the Netherlands we have been required to wear masks in public transport, supermarkets, actually everywhere public indoor. Shops have been closed and we have been in lockdown for the past couple of months. </p>
<p>So please fuck off with that rethoric that you can control this virus if everyone wore a mask because that is simply not the case. Look everywhere in Europe still covid going on and there are countries which are much much more restrictive then either the US or even the Netherlands.</p>

        <p>New Zealand, Taiwan, Iceland, singapore, Vietnam, there ARE countries that have squashed Covid. Yes, these countries tend to be bordered by water and so are easier to ban travel. But this doesn’t change that it worked. If some other countries took it seriously, and the people gave a shit, we could drastically reduce the deaths.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have to wear a mask at work all day, which I do. I wear masks in all businesses that require them, and I wear it correctly - I'm sure I've slipped up, but I never flaunted the rules intentionally. I don't want to deal with the hassle.</p>
<p>Every day, I see people who are 'wearing' masks under their chin or nose - they're 'compliant' as far as their online opinions go, but they are potentially spreading the virus just as much as someone who isn't wearing one to own libs or w/e (things like coughing in people's faces or not wearing one when you know you're sick are obviously a different story).</p>
<p>I think the mask mandate is fairly insignificant on its own - if that's all the government did, I think there would have been way less pushback. My main problem is the forced shutdown of 'non-essential' businesses that happened quite outside any legislative processes we have in place.</p>
<p>I also see videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko6qCib1_YM">this</a> which make me question that there's universal scientific consensus on the efficacy of public mask mandates, but I'm not a doctor.</p>

        <p>I was with you until your final 2 paragraphs.</p>
<p>Every actual doctor of stature, that I’ve seen, has stated masks are useful and should be worn, and work.</p>
<p>You post a video, of some random guy dressed as a doctor, who says stuff. Doesn’t offer actual evidence, or even state who he is in the clip.</p>
<p>These are not the same. You grabbed one edited clip of a guy saying something that supports you, and ignore the THOUSANDS, or research and doctors who DO support masks and know they work.</p>

        <p>I really don’t feel like going and fact checking every single link on that shitty post.</p>
<p>So I’ll leave you with this. Read that first link, the one about the Wuhan study finding a symptomatic people don’t spread it.</p>
<p>Then read this link, that discusses that EXACT STUDY, and explains that the people conducting the study, stated their finding DID NOT show that the virus can’t be passed on by asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>The point is those posts aren’t truthful. I fact checked the FIRST one and found it’s complete bullshit. They ignored the findings of the study and used the data to support their own belief.</p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695</p>
<p>That’s literally how these crazy conspiracy theories work. They give you 100 links and say “see these all support my view” but when you actually look into each one. They tend to me out of context, ignore later studies that had larger pools, or completely misrepresent the facts.</p>

        <p>Those studies don’t exist though. As I showed you, I clicked 5 links and none of them supported what the post was saying.</p>
<p>The point you’re making is that anti maskers use studies INCORRECTLY, to support their claims. The studies themselves don’t do that. These are not the same things.</p>

        <p>You didn't show me that, you said one was a dead link and the other had an incorrect conclusion. Regardless, I could give you 1000 links and you'd find one reason or another that they're not valid. If you think that a single peer-reviewed study doesn't exist that concluded that mask mandates didn't have any noticeable effect, then you're just burying your head in the sand.</p>
<p>But again, <em>none of this matters</em>. It doesn't matter what you or I think. What matters is the legislative process, where experts on both sides of the issue present their arguments, and laws are decided upon. If the issue is truly as one-sided as you say, it should be a quick court case, right? So why were businesses closed via executive order?</p>

        <p>See this is the part where you’re wrong, and to prevent from acknowledging that, you change what I said, and then change the argument so I won’t defend it anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve looked through your comment history, this is common for you.</p>
<p>I did not say one link had an incorrect conclusion. That’s blatantly false.</p>
<p>The article YOU linked to as evidence, is blatantly misrepresenting data, and outright lying about the results of the study.</p>
<p>The study they misrepresented, I directly linked to, and it fully supports what I’m saying.</p>
<p>If you can link 1000 articles, and I can always find something wrong about the articles, maybe it’s because the logic you’re supporting is WRONG. I linked you to the study, that proves me right.</p>
<p>If your point is so true, please tell me what’s wrong with that study? Why does it support what I said and not you?</p>
<p>I never said it was one sided. I believe science has clearly shown masks work and are useful. The reason politicians don’t push it is because we have republicans who believe in Jewish space lasers.</p>
<p>It absolutely does matter what you and I think. Because you’re arguing against masks being used to prevent the spread of Covid. And that’s fucking killing people.</p>

        <p>What you’re failing to understand here. Is despite the fact that black people have been mistreated so badly by institutions, and have every reason to distrust the government. They are STILL, more likely to be wearing a mask than white people.</p>
<p>You assume that black people don’t wear masks because you assume they won’t comply, rather than they have a reason to not comply, but still do.</p>

        <p>Okay, please tell me why you believed black people wore masks less, when every study online finds they wear them more than white people.</p>
<p>What caused you to think that?</p>
<p>Was it because they’re black? And black people don’t comply with rules? Is that your argument? Cause if so, that’s racist, meaning you’re racist for using that thinking.</p>
<p>I didn’t make up shit. You made up black people not wearing masks more, to fit your narrative. I called you out on it.</p>

        <p>Not necessarily. Think about this, we lived our gross lives before Covid. Touching stuff everyone else does, no one cared about how gross things were. And the flu was an issue, but not deadly. We started proper cleaning measures, wearing masks, washing hands, covering your mouth when you sneeze more, etc. and it cause the flu to not be nearly as infectious.</p>
<p>Covid is just so much more infectious, that we have to do MORE, before it starts dropping as well. Vaccines would allow the spread to lower as well.</p>

        <p>That was the early take which is now deprecated. The virus spreads through aerosolized particles not just large respiratory droplets. Cloth coverings especially do nothing. N95s might work, but that is not what people are wearing, nor what the CDC is recommending. </p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372
“We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face- to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, <strong>the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>.”</p>
