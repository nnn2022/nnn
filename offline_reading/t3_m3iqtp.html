    <strong>Honest survey/question, no drama please: Would you, as a member of NNN, consider yourself "conservative" or "liberal?"</strong>
    <p><p>This sub has a reputation as we all know, and in general that reputation seems to be tied to conservatism.</p>
<p>I am as NoNewNormal as you can get (actually wrote a long piece about it an entire year ago at the start of the lockdowns if you're interested: https://redd.it/frff2q)</p>
<p>I am college educated, raised Catholic and am now Atheist, have never considered myself a conservative, actually very traditionally liberal, and I absolutely don't believe in Trump, Q, or a lot of other stuff that I get accused of just for participating in this sub.  Honestly I'm more socialist or libertarian than anything (the classic "I just want gay married couples to be able to protect their marijuana farms with guns")</p>
<p>I'm simply curious to know if there's anyone else here that feels they've been forced into a pigeonhole they absolutely don't belong in simply because they dare to question the official narrative surrounding the "pandemic."</p>
<p>Please please don't let this devolve into political infighting. I just want to try to illustrate that the people in this sub come from a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives, and aren't as simple- or single-minded as the rest of the world makes us out to be.</p></p>

        <p>I used to consider myself as being on the left. Not sure where I stand now after 2020 happened and I watched 99.9% of "the left" wholeheartedly support lockdowns, apparently not caring about their second order effects at all.</p>

        <p>Same here. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary last year. Now I just don’t trust anyone in the government.</p>
<p>On the political compass I’m slightly to the left on the x axis, all the way at the bottom of the y axis.</p>

        <p>Could you imagine if Bernie Sanders actually became the president like the majority of the people in the United States wanted? Of course, you had to know that it was never going to happen, but I got out and voted for him every time I got a chance.</p>

        <p>I would say things would be better, but I think he’s pro-all this bullshit. He preaches about wearing a mask and virtue signals about the coof on Twitter. I was really disappointed to find that out, but unfortunately not that surprised.</p>

        <p>Constitutional conservative here. I believe in leaving everyone the hell alone to live out their life as long as you're not infringing on anyone's rights or their life, liberty or pursuit of happiness. </p>

        <p>My friend moved to Maine from CA to get away from it all, and is a young, healthy, paranoid, doomer.  His eyes bled from how mad he got arguing with me about masks and vaccines.  You'd think with the solitude and his goats, he would have been more chill.</p>

        <p>As was I, and I still feel like I pretty much am? I mean let's take another one of the current hot button issues, transgender rights. I don't give a shit, sure you can have whatever rights you want. I don't even understand why this is an issue.</p>

        <p>Yes, the problem is we’re forced to have certain beliefs snd they are enforced by an angry mob of ideological warriors. </p>
<p>I am for equality and equity. But not at the cost of others lives. Propping up BLM and continuing to trample on indigenous lives. These movements are all a trend. There is no authenticity to it. When it comes to transgender, I want them to have the sane issues as a binary person. But I also don’t believe young children should be able to choose their gender. A young person can not make an informed decision on genital mutilation. And having nutty extremist teachers feeding children their political ideas is not at all ok with me.</p>

        <p>I used to consider myself conservative but from the fact that I couldn't give two shits less about who sleeps with who (excepting pedophilia which I think we all agree deserves the harshest punishment imaginable) I'd say I'm more libertarian than anything else.  I prefer just to live my life and choose my friends.  If they're cool, hard working, and pleasant to be around, I'll like them.  If they're an asshole, lazy and lives on handouts, and not pleasant to be around I won't like them.  Want an abortion?  Go get one. No fuss on me.  Want to smoke and grow weed?  I'm all in favor of that.  Want to whack your mind out on coke?  By all means do so.  Just don't adversely effect me with your poor decisions.  Want to wear a mask?  Okay I see your point but I don't agree with it.  Want to FORCE me to wear one?  Here's a nice cup of gofuckyourself.... I suggest a lot of sugar because it's a bit bitter.</p>

        <p>I agree but what's the solution?  The left is going further left with every step and the right is in lockstep in the opposite direction.  Nobody wants to compromise.  Those that call themselves Libertarians can't even get together on an agenda.  Sure the tenants of their party is there but there is so much infighting in their subs it's obvious they're going nowhere fast.  </p>
<p>What's the answer?  The system is obviously broken and it's not going to get fixed unless somebody drives a 777 into the house during a session with the house and senate (see Executive Orders by Tom Clancy) and we have a president of good ethics that is more concerned with what's best for the people instead of being re elected.  We don't have that now and the 'vote them out' crowd aren't making any progress.  They've got us all so busy fighting with each other that as a group we can't address the issues that really concern us and they're happy about it.  They get to suck off the public dole and campaign contributions for a 'favor' here and there while we battle in the streets.</p>

        <p>Getting rid of first past the post and moving to a ranked voting system would solve many of these problems on its own. In today's political climate, with lobbyists and a rigged two-party system, every smaller fractured party simply takes votes away from anything good that any of the bigger parties might try to do. If we had ranked choice voting, parties could come and go, parties could adapt, etc.</p>
<p>It's also been suggested by many people much smarter than me that all political positions should have term limits, and they should be a lot shorter than they are now.</p>
<p>Political parties as they stand are nothing more than a way for the powers that be to use tribalism to manipulate the citizenry into thinking that they hate each other.</p>

        <p>When I learned the political spectrum in school, I learned that reactionary meant so far right that you are actually off the spectrum. Is that what you mean using that word, or if not what does it mean in your country? What country is that if you don't mind me asking?</p>

        <p>I’ve always kind of been in the middle. Some issues I am “conservative.” Some I am more “liberal.” Ive never really understood how some people seem to perfectly fit in these categories. “Libertarian” better describes how I feel these days.</p>

        <p>Speaking only for myself, I can enrage both sides of the aisle equally with my views. I describe myself as a conservative libertarian, but the labels have shifted &amp; drifted so much lately, I’m not sure if that even means anything anymore.  Here’s a list of some of my views for a hypothetical political map:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported Trump in the 3-ring Republican primary circus before anyone else</li>
<li>recovering Catholic; hates organized religion of all stripes</li>
<li>pro-abortion for any reason</li>
<li>pro shaming anti-vaxxers for child abuse</li>
<li>all taxation is theft</li>
<li>you try to take my guns, you’ll see why I have them</li>
<li>politicians need more limitations, not fewer</li>
<li>political dynasties are <em>bad</em>.  No kings, no tyrants!</li>
<li>Big Pharma needs to chill on hiking up drug prices for my life-preserving meds</li>
<li>capital punishment is a great deterrent.  So is public execution. </li>
<li>all lives are equally worthless to everyone but the individual themselves</li>
<li>GMOs are life-saving</li>
<li>Luddites should not be allowed to dictate science or social narratives </li>
<li>less people, less problems, higher QoL</li>
<li>I literally do not care what you think of me, &amp; I assume the same of you. </li>
<li>progress should be rewarded, not stymied</li>
<li>Societal leeches should not be encouraged, especially by government programs using my money</li>
</ul>
<p>There are obviously more, but this gives a snapshot of who I am &amp; why people generally think I am a threat to the norm.  I question things first, do research, &amp; then form an opinion.  Sometimes those opinions don’t line up with party lines.</p>

        <p>Political labels are completely meaningless now. All it is is picking a side, no political party actually adheres to any sort of ideology or principles. It's just another identity with which to divide us. If I'm forced to pick a political identity I would go with humanist and just accepting that if you strip away all the politically manufactured talking points 99.9% of humanity really have the same motivations in taking care of themselves, their families and their communities. Once we realize that, the people not the corrupt govts can actually start working on how to achieve those goals.</p>

        <p>I don't even know what those terms are anymore, since they've been so mangled. </p>
<p>I guess I vote conservative? But like I'm in Canada and our cons have always basically been center at best. Right now they're absolutely center left. So I don't think I'll be voting for them anymore.</p>
<p>I guess I believe in the free market, small government, fiscal conservativism, and the individual being the highest good. No clue what that makes me but feel free to let me know.</p>

        <p>I am not American. </p>
<p>I am fiscally conservative when it comes to all Government spending. I do not support any kind of spending that passes the buck to another Generation. Financial slavery is an abomination and seems to be ok with both the left and the right.</p>
<p>Socially I am Liberal and believe everyone should live as they see fit, and the Government has no business in my personnel life. </p>
<p>I believe all Politicians are corrupt and all Governments should be voted out every term to prevent dynasties and nepotism.</p>
<p>There is that old maxim that says something like:</p>
<p>"If you are not a socialist when you are young, you have no heart; If you are not a Conservative when you are old than you have no brain."</p>
<p>This is way too simplistic. </p>
<p>I believe in long-term fiscally conservative social projects that help people but do not borrow money from children not alive. I believe in equal rights but I do not believe in compelled speech or equity laws that hurt people instead of helping everyone. Equal must be treated equal.</p>
<p>Again I am not American. I find the way Americans treat people of different political beliefs as repugnant and evil. I cannot fathom how any ethical person can align themselves with a Politician.</p>

        <p>My Grandfather told me that that quote used to mean the Left spends too much and Right doesn't spend enough, but that no longer applies because both sides now spend too much and offer no value. </p>
<p>The Left in America aligns themselves with corrupt Politicians as much as the Right does. The Left used to be antiwar and wanted to unite people, now it loves the war machine as much as the Right. The Left use to be the ones protecting free speech and equality but now I cannot see any difference. </p>
<p>The Tribalism is coming from the Educated as much as those left behind. </p>
<p>I find both sides of American Politics to be dangerous and myopic.</p>

        <p>I'm conservative. I lean pretty far to that side although I don't agree with absolutely everything conservative 100 percent. Like in the very beginning for a few weeks, I'm pretty sure the liberals were the ones saying no, we're gonna live our lives, and the conservatives were calling them selfish snowflakes, and I was like hey, calm down and let them live their lives! But now it's pretty much switched and I understand why.</p>

        <p>Well, in like the first few weeks when everything was closed, teenagers and college kids were just living their lives, and the conservatives were all like "People went to war and died and they can't stay home and sit on the couch!?" And I was like, hey, chill, it's their lives, but then soon it changed. I get it because I knew that the left falls for lots of things when it comes to fear and that if anything ever happened the left didn't like, they'd completely lose it. I'm not saying you can't be liberal and oppose this stuff, but it is just typically like that that many liberals are all for this and the opposite for conservatives. Also, the left likes to go against everything Trump does, and he wasn't pushing any fear, so it was only natural for them to be the fear-pushing side. I have a feeling that if Trump was all for muzzles and lockdowns (which I would still be against) they would be on our side.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting point. How much of it is just contrarianism for contrarianism's purpose?</p>

        <p>Well, lets look at the policies here in America. From an American point of view, the definition of communism is still unchanged, the centralization of power through governmental means, where the power resides in the government, and not the people. Let us take for example the Democratic party where their policies, and actions are based on socialism, governmental intervention, which leads to communism; it always has. Look at what they say and do, that is your first hint.</p>
<p>But to your question, is the word communism hijacked? The issue here is that, in today's generation, they are conflating both communism, and socialism with previously defined ideology, liberalism. Liberalism, in the Jeffersonian and Age of Enlightenment definition, meant personal freedom, equality and liberty. The hijacking of the word "liberal" or "liberalism" by the socialists and communists here in America now has now pushed those who believe in classical liberalism to be labeled as a "conservative." Communists and socialists are good at one thing, changing the words to serve their purpose.</p>
<p>These people that doing this need not celebrating, the Feinsteins, the BLMs, the Antifas, Pelosi's, the Bezos, Obama's, Gates, Wojciski, or the Newsoms. They don't need celebrating, they need calling out for what they're doing. Which is destroying the foundation of this republic by introducing fascism, and socialism through covert means under the guise of "liberalism." This is how they did it in Soviet Russia, Cambodia, this is how they did in Communist China, this is how they did in Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
<p>Me? Personally? I, as mentioned previously, identify as a liberal. And when I define the term to today's "liberals" their mouths drop (<a href="https://i.redd.it/xmulu1f6urt11.jpg">think Pikachu face</a>) because my definition differs completely from theirs. When you tell them that their definition is completely incorrect, that their definition resembles, if not, is identical to socialism, which leads to communism, they go into denial mode.</p>

        <p>&rt;  (the classic "I just want gay married couples to be able to protect their marijuana farms with guns")</p>
<p>Describes me to a T.   So why do you phrase the question in conservative/liberal language when you know that's a false dichotomy?   I'm simultaneously a member of the state GOP and the national Libertarian party.  I'm a classic liberal who sometimes can see the point AnCaps make.   You would have to chop me into a bunch of pieces to pigeonhole me. </p>
<p>To me, the political situation regarding NNN is basically one of authoritarians vs liberty/individual rights people.  Whether the actions governments are taking are simply wrong-headed or part of grand Plan(demic) is immaterial. It is wrong.</p>
