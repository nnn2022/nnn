        <p>I live in the US. In March 2019 we had flu outbreak so bad that schools had to close for a few weeks.  Didn't lockdown the whole country!</p>

        <p>You completely misinterpreted the article and you clearly didn’t read it. It says right in the article only 271 deaths were officially due to the flu, but was likely higher as that was only deaths in the hospital. The figures you are claiming are from the flu are just the total number of deaths, not from the flu. </p>
<p>The 42% increase comes out to ~19,000 deaths, and for comparison, covid killed around 25-30k for January 2021 in GB. And the 19,000 again is just the increase in total deaths, may or may not be all connected to the flu.</p>

        <p>Your point being? Look, even if what you say is true, your typical flu kills an average of 45K people a year in UK.  In 2018, there was a 42%  spike to 64K for one fucking month (January 2018).</p>
<p>If covid killed 30K ppl in 2021 January, guess what? It's still less than half of the ppl killed in January 2018.  Also, don't forget that +12 months (since Feb. 2020), covid killed 120K ppl in UK.  By comparison, half of 120K ppl were killed in one month, in January 2018.</p>
<p>As much as you want to spin this, it still looks bad for covid.  UK had deadlier flu viruses in the past, which did not evoke the response from governments as they did with the covid bullshit.</p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

        <p>They did not have deadlier flus in the past, I’m unsure of where you are getting that. I did some math from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111804/weekly-deaths-in-england-and-wales/">Statista</a> and there were ~71k deaths in the UK in Jan 2021. </p>
<p>Now I’m seeing your point since there were 64k deaths in Jan 2018, and now with COVID, 71k deaths in 2021, a 7k death increase which apparently warranted ridiculous protocols. </p>
<p>Using the same source, 52k died in Jan 2020, which means there was an increase of 19k deaths from Jan 2020 to Jan 2021, that sounds familiar...</p>
<p>So twice, there have been increases of 19k deaths in the last 4 years. Obviously the more recent due to Covid, but what caused the increase in 2018?</p>
