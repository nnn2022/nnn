        <p>Oh, nevermind, we're not on the same side apparently.</p>
<p>Go ahead and continue favoring fundamental changes to our society because of a virus with a well under 1% fatality rate though. Concentrated in the elderly, most of whom were dying anuway.</p>
<p>Just ignore the children starving do to the economic destruction from the lockdowns. And the countless other casualties from what we in this sub call "the new normal."</p>
<p>Here's some readings on the destructive effects of the policies you probably favor if you'd like to expose yourself to alternative viewpoints. Concentrate on the millions being forced into extreme poverty, 8 million in America alone, and the millions facing literal starvation. That's ok though right? You probably don't care about young people and children starving in third world countries. 78 year olds in nursing homes are more important right?</p>

<p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the upsurge in violence, coupled with COVID-19, has sent the number of people in crisis level of food insecurity sky-rocketing from 15.2 million people to nearly 22 million.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, COVID-19 is also forcing more people into food insecurity, with 80 percent of families experiencing reduced incomes as a result of measures imposed to contain the virus. In the northeast of the country, 4.3 million people are food insecure, up by 600,000 largely due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to these countries, Beasley also shone a light on the situation in Burkina Faso, where the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger has tripled to 3.3 million, driven by an upsurge in violence — with the attending displacement, security and access problems — as well as the effects of COVID-19. “For 11,000 people living in Burkina Faso’s northern provinces, famine is knocking on the door as we speak,” he warned.</p>

<p>8 million fall into poverty in America alone:</p>
<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/8-million-americans-slipped-poverty-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-new-study-n1243762</p>
<p>Every one of them will suffer reduced quality of life, and many will lose years from their life due to the stress, lack of exercise, poor diet/mal-nourishment that go along with poverty. One year on average? Two? Who knows? More for some probably. So reasonable to say at least 8 million life-years lost right there.</p>

        <p>You may not have noticed, but we're on the same side, so there's no need for the sarcasm. I just thought it was a dumb ad and responded for fun. First thing I saw when I woke up this morning. No ones claiming to be a hero here.</p>
<p>Also it takes 0 bravery to mock someone sarcastically over the internet.</p>
<p>Do you express your opinions on the subject out in the real world with real humans? Because I do, and I just get this sense your probably more the type to confront doomers/pro-new normal sorts over the internet but not in person.</p>
