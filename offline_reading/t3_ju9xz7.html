    <strong>The problem in America isn't a virus, it's really serious underlying flaws in American health care and health culture...</strong>
    <p><p>I think anyone can agree that those who are at most risk of being hospitalized or killed by c0vid are those with serious underlying chronic health conditions. Things like obesity, diabetes, heart/pulmonary disease, etc. are unfortunately very common in the U.S. Decades of corporations telling us that processed sugar, tobacco, artificial fats, plastics, asbestos, and any infinite number of harmful substances are perfectly OK has left us in a sad state.</p>
<p>Here's one example - look at breakfast cereal ads. They push this "part of a complete breakfast" message, implying that cereal is a food group. But what is this "complete breakfast" they're talking about, that they show pictures of? It's a bowl of cereal, a stack of pancakes, a big glass of orange juice, toast with fruit jam... Sugar on sugar on sugar on sugar. Then, when you crash from your 100% carbohydrate breakfast by 11:00am, they sell you an energy drink with another 60 grams of processed sugar that <em>just</em> gets you to the couch to crash again by 7:00pm. Of course, after eating your fast food or frozen dinner with enough sodium to make a salt lick for a horse stable.</p>
<p>I think c0vid has been the perfect excuse for big food and chemical companies to absolve themselves of the damage they cause to our health. By marking these deaths as c0vid deaths, they get to skirt around the elephants in the room, which are the chronic health issues many Americans have been dealing with the last few decades. Smoking, junk food, alcohol and soda, sketchy building materials, etc. are the real killers, and it looks like they're going to keep getting away with it.</p>
<p>Edit: What I do want to add is that everyone should take some personal responsibility for their own health. That being said, with how busy modern life is, it's a fact that not everyone has the time or capability to understand how this stuff effects them. The marketing of junk food, alcohol, and tobacco definitely avoids mentioning negative health effects, and if  you're not predisposed to asking questions you might not ever think about it. This also goes back to our failure in good health education and nutrition habits in young kids.</p></p>

<p>Yes endorsed by the gov. Like smoking, like vaping, like opioids, historically proven, time after time. That's the life essentials they teach the public. All of these methods including sugar are narcotics to the brain. They make you sick. Your memory sucks, your physical performance sucks you have no will. And that's what they want. They don't want progress, they want control over you.</p>

        <p>It's sad how many people won't recognize this and think food manufacturers actually give a shit about people's health. The amount of illness that could be prevented with a healthy lifestyle is insane. But somehow, there this mental image of "healthy lifestyle" has been demonized- "im not the crunchy granola, barefoot hippy in the woods type, ew" as if it is cool to live on drive-thru meals and sit on the couch all day.</p>

        <p>I think this is very well said . Itâ€™s clear that this has predominantly affected the most vulnerable and unhealthy people in our society. Instead of trying to mitigate those issues , society as a whole is being punished for this . 
To your point about diet , precious little is said about eating healthy as a way to boost your immune system . Instead , we are told to wear masks and wait for the magical vaccine which will solve our problems. Further reinforcing an already decades -old message in this country : Big Pharma and science and technology will save us . Meanwhile , the underlying issues remain the same. The government allows it , even allowing these very companies to help write the legislation. The media cannot and will not spend too much time examining these issues either as they make too much money in advertising revenue .</p>
