        <p>The only argument (imo) to say that Covid is an actual pandemic would be to look ay excess deaths since all the coding requires literally zero burden of proof to determine a case or death.</p>
<p>However nobody can ever give a good source and just parrots what the media tells them, well here are some sources explaining excess deaths and why it's BS <em>(the complete foundation some NNN hate subs are founded on)</em></p>
<p>ü§î</p>
<p>I agree many people didn't go to the hospital for conditions, or were turned away, and thus died. At the very least the quality of life and life expectancy of many will be lowered:</p>

<p><em>A record number of healthcare workers were laid off during the pandemic:</em> </p>
<p>https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/record-number-of-healthcare-workers-laid-off-furloughed-during-pandemic.html</p>
<p>The media didn't help with the fear mongering propoganda portrayed, <em>especially once the pandemic became political,</em> which exacerbated the fear.</p>
<p>JHU 8 year study suggests medical errors are the 3^rd leading cause of death yearly </p>
<p>https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/</p>
<p><strong>We'd be dishonest to say those excess deaths are a majority Covid related, other than people avoiding care for fear of catching Covid19.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Degrading the illusion that healthcare workers are always morally superior</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctors take bribes and kickbacks to prescibe medications, even if it's known to be deadly like Fentanyl, so why would Convid be any different:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/another-doctor-charged-taking-bribes-kickbacks-to-prescribe-fentanyl-alleged-insys-scheme</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-prescribe-more-of-a-drug-if-they-receive-money-from-a-pharma-company-tied-to-it</p>
<p><strong>convid</strong> https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/20/coronavirus-covid-medicare-payments-hospitals/</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄúThe idea that hospitals and doctors are falsely inflating COVID numbers and even putting patients on ventilators to drive up their payments is not just ridiculous, but it‚Äôs insulting to the doctors who are putting their own lives at risk,‚Äù said Joe Hanel, spokesperson for the Colorado Health Institute.</p>
<p><strong>interesting, because nationally, the next link shows how MAYBE 21% would be under the age of 65 and not on Medicare, everyone else was a senior citizen:</strong> <em>(38,000 out of 180,000)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>94% of Covid deaths involves 2.6 comorbities, is this akin to medical errors and they just report the statistics however they want?</em>
