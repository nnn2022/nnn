    <strong>What the vaccine is actually for</strong>
    <p><p>It may seem unnecessary to get a vaccine when you are at low risk of dying to COVID, but what about the people around you that can’t get vaccinated?
If everyone thinks that’s the vaccine is harmful, and doesn’t take it, infants, cancer patients, and the elderly will be at at serious risk from coming into contact with anyone. That’s the idea of herd immunity. If nobody has the disease because of the vaccine, then the people who can’t take it will be okay. The problem with purposely not getting the vaccine, even if you can, is that it makes people feel like exceptions rather than a group. If not enough people get vaccinated, then herd immunity will be lost. It is your right to not be vaccinated, but that does not make you morally obligated to put people at risk because of your own fears or ideas.</p></p>

        <p>Yes because acquiring natural immunity stopped being a thing after definitions were rewritten in 2020. Experimental gene therapy that explodes your heart or turns you into a paraplegic is the only way.</p>
