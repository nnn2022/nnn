    <strong>Review of Patrick Kings court "VICTORY"</strong>
    <p><p>Patrick King did not win or prove anything in court. He is either ignorant or intentionally deceiving.</p>
<p>Please do not feel demoralized by this, there are real activists successfully fighting these tickets and restrictions.</p>
<p>Professional review of Patricks case:</p>
<p>“The Justice Centre has also reviewed some of the associated legal documents regarding Court File Number 12110 00751 Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, arising out of a ticket given to Patrick James King, a resident of Penhold, Alberta, issued to Mr. King for allegedly contravening an Order under S.73(1) of the Public Health Act, Provincial Court action number A87988036R. Excerpts can be found below.</p>
<p>The video appears to contain several inaccuracies. It is unclear whether Mr. King fully understands the legal process he is involved in. It appears that Mr. King was unsuccessful in his attempt to subpoena Alberta’s Chief Medical Health Officer. In the government’s filed Originating Application, July 16, 2021, the government notes Mr. King obtained a subpoena for the CMOH Dr. Deena Hinshaw to give evidence in the Provincial Court proceeding (the ticket case). The subpoena was issued by a Justice of the Peace under the Criminal Code, requesting the CMOH bring “all white papers describing the isolation of the COIVD-19 aka SARS-CoV-2 virus in human beings, directly from a sample taken from a diseased patient”, because “these white papers would have been integral in the crafting of the statutes made under the “Public Health Act” here in Alberta.”</p>
<p>The Government argued the subpoena was technically deficient and the Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction to issue it. The Government further stated, Mr. King has “no evidence” showing that “the evidence sought from the CMOH is likely to be material” [legal term for meaning relevant and related] to the provincial court ticket received. “It is clear that Mr. King seeks evidence relating to the rationale for orders issued by the CMOH under the Act: he seeks evidence about the ‘Crafting of the statutes’,” stated the Government’s Affidavit. There do not appear to be any critical admissions by Dr. Hinshaw about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and this document has been prepared by the government’s legal team, not Dr. Hinshaw.</p>
<p>“The Provincial Court proceeding is about the December 5, 2020 enforcement of the law (when Mr. King was issued the ticket), not the rational for the law. The CMOH does not have, and Mr. King does not seek from the CMOH, any evidence about the ticket issued to Mr. King,” states the Government Affidavit. The Judge hearing the case informed the Accused, Mr. Patrick King, that he had not properly filed a Charter challenge against the law as required to fight the law itself, and thus could only address the ticket issued to him.”</p>

        <p>Please, stop using the word misinformation in your speech like it was always your choice. Before the mass brainwashing campaign to redefine words and introduce new ones, We all used words like innacurate, false, &amp; lie {which, fyi is real opposite of truth, not the m word). Deprogram yourself.</p>

        <p>I disagree, the word misinformation is a synonym for false or inaccurate information.<br>
Just because MSM uses the word for their propaganda, doesn't mean they have control or a spell over ppl who use it. Definitely not a weaponized term like "conspiracy theorist", created to ridicule anyone questioning orchestrated events.</p>

        <p>Look I dont know your age, though I imagine if I look at your profile i can determine you are gen Z at best, but misinformation was never a part of anyones vocabulary before 2016. Prove it was commonplace prior, or stop being argumentative. Those are your choices.</p>

        <p>“the government argued the subpoena was technically deficient and the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction to issue it.”</p>
<p>This is what I find interesting because King says this is how they “duped” him and it got “thrown out”. He said when he went to start his procedure against the ticket that was the advice he was given. To get the Justice of the Peace to subpoena instead of a Judge.</p>
<p>I am not doubting this is likely not as big as it is being hyped. BUT having worked in government, setting em up for failure (deception), is a commonly used tactic. It’s not much different anything else really, like tow truck drivers.</p>
<p>Also, it’s somewhat odd how as this King shit came out so too did Alberta’s ending of all covid restrictions (no mask, isolation, quarantine, etc). Is it connected? I dunno. The timing could be pure coincidence and totally unrelated.</p>
<p>BUT
King did say the “A team” lawyers were there to represent the “crown”. Which maybe is the standard? But the optics of it all. “Ottawa lawyer” was flown to Alberta for a case about a 1200 ticket? Why risk your life like that during covid? Specially if the case was junk with the whole Justice of the Peace thing?</p>
<p>Maybe King was making that up? </p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But there was a “dr” on David Icke saying a similar thing (covid can’t be isolated) in NZ and now another one in Ireland.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced just yet. I’m a legit skeptic and just a curious george.</p>

        <p>Alberta restrictions were already being taken down because of the magic covid cases being low, most of the other provinces were doing the same this summer.. way before his failed court attempt, where he showed to be unprepared and very ignorant of the process and how to defend himself. Ottawa representatives probably were there to answer about the subpoena, even if just to dismiss it. The lawyers from jccf (justice center), who are on our side, do a great job in explaining the case and why it failed.
The inexistence of covid isolation has been proven a year ago, through FOIA requests done in various places, in different countries. Pat King is clearly exagerating his story and seems to be looking for fame, with no real effort in building a good defense against government.
I can tell you there was plenty of resources and people willing to help, he knows this. Almost looks like he failed on purpose. I recommend reading the court transcript to get a better view of this.</p>

        <p>interesting.</p>
<p>so the FOIA stuff prior, in other countries, showing it can’t be isolated.<br>
It’s funny because there was BC “document” going around saying the same “can’t isolate covid” stuff. </p>
<p>Is anything gonna come out of that “revelation”?
or is it bs because no virus can be isolated like that?</p>
<p>You seem to be waaaay deeper into the covid research. Genuinely curious.</p>

        <p>Covid is a scam, the only health issue are the vaccines.
That's why they choose to use the PCR test to detect fairy dust. They have done this before with the Aids scam that killed millions with their false diagnosis and aids medication. The topic of viruses is interesting, not sure if viruses can be isolated, or if they exist in the way described. I recommend researching the Terrain theory.. it makes more sense than this western pharma medical industry.</p>
