    <strong>Low Von Willebrand &amp; Nervous about COVID Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone else have blood conditions that worry them about taking the COVID vaccine?  I‚Äôve found TONS of peer-reviewed research articles that all say COVID is directly related to Von Willebrand factor (&amp; other blood stuff) and adverse effects are usually blood related.</p>
<p>The reasons I don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine are not only due to the low VWF ‚Ä¶ I have other health issues and I simply want to wait until more research is out there.  </p>
<p>Does anyone know people with Von Willebrand issues that received the COVID vaccine and had adverse effects?  Any thoughts??</p></p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt have any advice regarding your specific questions but I will tell you what I believe, which is that they will be coming out with non-mRNA vaccines soon that will blow your suspicions out of the water...supposedly.  That‚Äôs why, from the get-go, I would take an anti-vax stance if you are in the position of NEVER wanting to take a forced vaccine (even if you don‚Äôt  want to admit it now).  They will get you sooner or later, unless you are a HARD NO from the beginning.  Do not underestimate the power of persuasion in this 2021 world.  Something is afoot, and it‚Äôs NOT GOOD!  </p>
<p>I know how the wicked ones work, and I am convinced that it‚Äôs a game to them.  ‚ÄúI am Legend‚Äù - they are making it a reality.  It‚Äôs not so far fetched, if you have researched what the CIA is capable of...</p>

        <p>No need to take your time.  You know it‚Äôs not right.  Make up your mind now.  No more time.  I really do care so I want to tell it like it is. Stand fast and hold on- others will be with you.  Few that there be.</p>

        <p>No recommendations, sorry.  I prefer to hardline it on behalf of people like you, who want to prove to them it is unhealthy to take this vax due to other medical conditions.  </p>
<p>They don‚Äôt listen to reason, so why try to reason with them?  I would consider changing your stance from ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take the vax due to underlying health conditions and I‚Äôm going to try to show you proof‚Äù into ‚Äúsomething is wrong with you trying to force ANYONE to take the vax, especially people like me, with underlying health conditions. Therefore, I am fully against this coercion‚Äù.</p>

        <p>I would hesitate too, if I were in your shoes.  You need to do a lot of research.  And take medical exemption for anybody who tries to force you before you are ready.  I doubt there is any good data on VWD, so don't believe anybody who tells you flippantly "you shouldn't be fine".  With that said, VWD theoretically should actually protect you from clotting problems induced by the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Thank you!  I feel like doctors are being forced to comply and it‚Äôs no longer about individual needs‚Ä¶if doctors don‚Äôt comply with what‚Äôs required of them then they risk losing their livelihood.  I get it but it makes it hard to trust even the doctors that you were able to trust in the past.  Thus it‚Äôs the politics that prevent us from getting the individual care &amp; diagnoses that we used to enjoy and it‚Äôs muddled by what is being mandated both to the patient &amp; to the practitioner.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm leaning against it because I know that aspect is definitely prevalent these days. ü•∫</p>
