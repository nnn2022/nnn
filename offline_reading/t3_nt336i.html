        <p>Reading the article, it seems that the drug just works to suppress hunger pangs. Nothing too profound or novel - you don't see many meth-heads or patients undergoing treatment for cancer/AIDS that are sporting a Grade 5 panniculus. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, the only way to lose weight is to be in a calorie deficit. This drug is no different than bariatric surgery; they simply remove the element of choice from the equation. Someone's weak will is no longer a factor if they literally can't eat garbage food anymore.</p>
<p>You cannot stay the same weight after that operation, as you physically cannot overeat anymore. You have no choice but to consume fewer calories.</p>
<p>This drug likely works in a similar manner. You'll feel satiated after eating much less, and therefore you won't consume enough calories to stay fat.</p>
<p>This drug, just like bariatric surgery, is almost always a crutch that will not work in the long term unless someone changes their attitudes towards diet and exercise. If you come off the drug/surgery and start eating like a hog again, you will gain everything back (if not some more, too.) </p>
<p>This announcement strikes me as yet another way that Big Pharma has found to monetize treatment of the symptoms of a chronic condition that is caused by a dysfunctional lifestyle and never actually cure the underlying problem, leaving a person on a subscription plan for health so long as they are willing (or able) to pay.</p>
<p>They need to stop funding research into crap like this, and focus on teaching proper nutrition and exercise strategies. </p>
<p>For the extreme outliers who use food as a drug in a manner similar to an addict, they need counseling that is proven to work for treatment of addiction. No treatment will work until they stop seeing food/drink as a way of dealing with uncomfortable emotions.</p>
<p>The obesity epidemic in this country is a result of ignorance/lack of information, greed, and a dereliction of duty with regard to taking care of one's body. It doesn't require a miracle drug to fix - only access to quality education and an ounce of willpower.</p>

        <p>That isn't how this drug works at all. It's an increased dosage of the diabetes medication Ozempic. It mimics a hormone in your gut that controls insulin response.</p>

        <p>That sounds dangerous. </p>
<p>Another way to lose weight is to eat less.</p>

All of this effort just to avoid admitting that you need to stop eating sugar to lose weight.</p>
