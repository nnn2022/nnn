    <strong>Arkansas Employer Mandates</strong>
    <p><p>So I wanted to share some stuff that has been happening in the State of Arkansas. I was born here and have lived here most of my life. My son was also born here. I work as a financial analyst for a utility company.</p>
<p>Both Tyson and Walmart (both huge in Arkansas, especially Walmart) have mandated vaccination for their employees, as have many hospitals, which I am vehemently against. I don't believe that is an employer's business, and believe that is coercion and removes medical informed consent from an individual. There has been push back, and I found that a State senator filed a bill on 8-5 that would make it illegal for employers to ask vaccination status or discriminate based on vaccination status.</p>
<p>The AR Senate was supposed to take it up a few days ago, and did not. It seemed like it was dead for at least 2 months. However, yesterday, a joint House and Senate hearing of the judiciary committee heard testimony from employer reps, employees, doctors, legal experts, and those who have been harmed by vaccines in the past. </p>
<p>It was voted to move forward in committee and they are trying to get reps to sign on to bringing the legislature back in session to debate it. I'm keeping a close eye on this, and I felt there were many reps that were on board. You can tell that they have been getting lots of calls. One rep told the Tyson rep, "a lot of your employees have been calling me, worried they are going to lose their jobs."</p>
<p>I personally feel that the case was better made for passing the law to ban employer mandates than the employers made the case for why they are doing it. </p>
<p>A doctor who testified stated that every drug, vaccine or procedure offered needs to allow for informed consent, and that the patient needs to hear the pros and cons before partaking in that treatment, and that isn't happening here. He was not opposed to the covid vaccine, but didn't see why healthy teens would need it.</p>
<p>It gives me hope though that this madness will be stopped in my state at least. Hopefully. Our governor is terrible, has been pushing vaccines like crazy, and even regrets lifting his own mask mandate (the legislature basically forced him to), so I can see him vetoing it if it passes, but then again, if it has enough support from the people, he'll sign it, or they'll override his veto. They did that recently with a trans kids law that got lots of attention, including on Tucker Carlson's show.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but I think these employer's mandates are terrible for employees, especially low skilled and poorer individuals and amount to coercion. I can post a link to the entire committee meeting if anyone wants to watch it. It was really fascinating, and gave me hope for some sanity in my state.</p></p>

        <p>I wonder if there is some kind of financial incentive from the government to these employers to force the vaccine. There is for hospitals, their medicare reimbursement rates are tied to employee vaccination rates, but I hadn't hear of anything for other businesses.</p>

        <p>I haven't heard of that either, but I wondered the same thing last night. During testimony, the employers leaned a lot on the fact that Arkansas is an at will employer state, and even tried to equate asking employees to show up on time to asking them to get the shot. Clearly, those aren't even remotely the same thing, and I'm glad our reps called them on that. Seeing as how they couldn't really say why forcing vaccination was good for their business considering that the vaccine doesn't help reduce transmission and only helps mitigate symptoms. They just kept saying, "The CDC says we should all be vaccinated and we're trying to protect our employees and our capital." and stuff like that. Pretty flimsy reasoning in my mind, apparently they just want to play mom and dad to their employees. So after hearing that, I began to wonder if there is some unseen reason that these big companies are pushing it so hard. Heck, we now know that the government is paying social media influencers to push it, so nothing would shock me at this point.</p>

        <p>Yes it does sound flimsy. Hospitals get away with saying it's to protect patient and make anyone who knows flu shots don't work look like selfish assholes, just like they are doing with the covid vax. But we all know it's about money for hospitals. That's why they are counting people as covid patients even if they aren't there for covid, but have a positive test. They get paid more.</p>

        <p>What doesn’t make sense is once you hear the pros and cons of informed consent they’re still going to make people take it for their job. So if death is part of informed consent that still wouldn’t take it off the table. They told you so now here is your jab!</p>

        <p>Moving to Fayetteville? It's super nice up there, I used to travel up there a lot for work, and to go to baseball games. And I actually have a brother that lives in Georgia. I have not considered leaving Arkansas during all this pandemic garbage.</p>

        <p>I met some truly inspiring people here last night. Pretty much everyone I've run into seems pretty cool. Honestly a bit too liberal for me (I'm escaping LA for a reason), but it's southern liberalism, so they're not quite as nutty. </p>
<p>It's beautiful here, it's so incredibly affordable. I had never even heard of this town before I got here. I came to see my favorite band play and they were only a few hundred miles out of the way. </p>
<p>I gotta tell you, I kinda instantly fell in love with it. After seeing the legislation that Arkansas is trying to pass regarding vaccine discriminations...it's almost like the decision is being made for me. </p>
<p>I think I wanna become an Arkansan.</p>
