    <strong>If it Saves One Person, it's Worth Potentially Getting Banned</strong>
    <p><p>Preface: I am not a bot. I had to delete my posting/comment history because several disgruntled users were threatening to doxx me for the comments I left on this sub. </p>
<p>I'm writing this post for people who are on the fence, visiting here, wondering who to believe or what to do, specifically regarding vaccination. Ultimately, no one can tell you what to do, but I would like to share what's happened to my family to help others think long and hard before getting vaccinated. I know it's difficult to resist, and right now there are a lot of consequences, but without health, we truly have nothing. </p>
<p>My husband was vaccinated in late December as a frontline health care employee. Has had uncontrolled hypertension ever since, and chronic headaches. His blood pressure is so high, even with medication, I worry about him stroking out every single day. </p>
<p>My grandparents were vaccinated in early March as they are elderly. My grandmother's well-controlled type 1 diabetes is now totally out of control, she had a heart attack, and is showing signs of dementia. The change in her blood sugar readings and the heart attack happened within days, dementia within the next two months. My grandfather now is also showing signs of dementia not present before. They both went from frail-ish, to being unable to be alone, and needing a live-in caregiver. </p>
<p>My step-dad is showing signs of dementia. Within hours of receiving the vaccine reported feeling confused and foggy and agitated. Just recently, he fell off of a ladder he forgot to secure and broke his ankle and both legs. This is someone who was in good health and has worked on construction sites all of his life.</p>
<p>My mom now has intermittent fevers, debilitating joint pain, and vertigo. Was one of the healthiest people I knew prior to getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>My sister was fine, but pregnant. She's now in her final trimester and is experiencing serious complications. As in, the baby may not make it, which has been beyond devastating for our family. She was threatened with losing her job, as was her husband, and they have another child to support so caved in to the pressure. </p>
<p>My other sister is also fine, except for the whole unending period while she's on birth control thing.</p>
<p>The only people who have not received the vaccine are my brother and myself. We are both experiencing possible shedding effects. I lost my period in January, and we have both had intermittent fevers, chills, and body aches since their vaccinations. Both of us have been to the doctor and tested negative for covid/antibodies and a myriad of other things that could cause those symptoms. </p>
<p>I am skeptical by nature. I initially tried to go the "correlation does not equal causation route." However, then two of my mom's friends dropped dead within a week of their second dose. One from acute liver failure and one from a massive heart attack. Then my husband's aunt was hospitalized with congestive heart failure after her first dose. </p>
<p>It is well known that vaccines are not without risk. My initial reason for not getting one was a history of anaphylaxis and then GBS from the flu-shot when I was 18, and then a bout of serum sickness from the TDAP at 26. I wanted to wait and see what happened before I subjected myself to a vaccine that I objectively don't need. Now, though, all I see is the people around me getting incredibly sick, where they once were healthy, or at least stable with chronic conditions. </p>
<p>I would never take this shot and my new mission in life is making sure other people are aware of the position they are being put in, so they can make an informed decision.</p>
<p>By the way, we all managed to avoid COVID, which makes this all the more infuriating.</p>
<p>For those considering caving because the government and businesses are being discriminatory and punitive, and society is shaming and mocking us for our concerns. Please, please please take care of yourselves and your loved ones.  Life without health is not much of a life at all, and from what I have seen, this is criminal negligence by big pharma, et. al on a mass scale. </p>
<p>TLDR: Vaccine risky as hell. My family is experiencing insane regret, after a year and a half of being good citizens and doing our part.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sure a lot of the people who are now virtue signaling about getting the vaccine will end up regretting it later, because for most healthy people it poses a greater risk than the virus itself. I'm curious how the vaccine will end up affecting them long term, because for now we've only seen the short term side effects. I can't say that I'm not worried for my family members that have decided to take it.</p>

        <p>Agreed... I am really frightened for everyone, inside and outside my family, who have taken these non-vaccines because they have a history of antibody dependent enhancement and other issues that I can find absolutely no information that they fixed those problems.</p>

<p>OP my condolences to you and your family and hope yall come out the backside of this okay.  </p>
<p>That said my folks got the jab.  My formerly even keel, low key, 77 year old mother has gone from that to a mood swinging psycho.  Both parents have been in the hospital for a few days due to 'unrelated issues' (ya right) since.  </p>

        <p>A young guy I know had seizures immediately after the shot. My mother's friend has tinnitus to this day after taking the shot, also have confirmed with family that works in the field that tinnitus is a common side effect. My mother in law has been suffering depression ever since the shot. My father was sicker than he's been in his whole life for over a week after taking the shot. </p>
<p>Now I know that I know many people that are just fine after taking it, but this is just crazy to think I would take this after seeing first hand what it does. Healthcare workers in Texas have given up their careers to avoid taking the shot. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW! All anecdotal evidence for sure, but when the only source of information we have comes from liars and theives, anecdotes are all we have people! Trust your gut!</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for your losses and frustrations. A history with either anaphylaxis or GBS from the flu-shot is a good reason to avoid the vaccines without consulting a doctor. As for anaphylaxis, that is the reason that vaccine recipients are monitored for 20 minutes after their dose.  For Pfizer, the rate of such a reaction is 1 in 11 million.</p>
<p>As of April, more than 50 million doses of the vaccine had been administered and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.21253433v1.full#T3">about 8000 people reported SAEs</a> (severe adverse effects), with very very few of these being more than a headache, fever, or muscle pain. That's 1 in 6250 people experience an annoyance. Deaths reported, which are not necessarily due the vaccine, are 1 in 118000 across all vaccines. That's a 0.00085% chance.  </p>
<p>So the data suggest that the other events happening around you are likely coincidental or due to other factors such as age and pre-existing conditions. I know that sounds cold, but in times like these, its the aggregate data which must outweigh personal experiences. If you don't believe that, well, you can always try prayer with lit candles. </p>
<p>Your husband's continuous high BP is certainly anomalous for a vaccine, but not anomalous for someone who is a frontline health worker in this environment, and especially with everything going on with his parents. If medication and exercise don't help, he really should take some kind of medical leave or at least a vacation.    </p>
<p>There's no evidence or reason to think a vaccine would <em>cause</em> liver disease, but an existing liver condition could be worsened by any kind of drug. People with severe cirrhosis should probably wait until more safety data has been acquired.  </p>
<p>A massive heart attack can be caused by thrombosis, which is a known very very rare condition of a few of the non-mRNA vaccines, but still considered very very rare.  Only a detailed autopsy could determine the true cause. Since you didn't specify the age of your mom's friend, I'll assume she's her mom's age and thus over 55. In the US, women over the age of 55 have nearly a 40% of dying from heart failure over their next 15 years. </p>
<p>"We are experiencing possible shedding effects". I don't think you know what that means.</p>
<p>"Life without health is not much of a life at all" which is why I encourage as many people as possible to get a covid-19 vaccine. Even if one doesn't die (0.5%) from Covid-19, there's a 7% chance of hospitalization for a few weeks and about an 0.5% of becoming a 'long hauler' with sustained fatigue and shedding for months.  The sooner more people are vaccinated and follow reasonable guidelines such as using masks indoors, avoiding eating indoors, avoiding crowds, the better we can minimize the body count and the sooner we actually can return to normal.</p>
