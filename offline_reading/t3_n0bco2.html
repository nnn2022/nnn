        <p>This is it. They'll now ramp down their narrative based on what's happening, and pretend they're holding the reigns and this entire thing was a planned slow drop back to normalcy, so they can conveniently use the threat of closing life down for a year in the future for the next bullshit psy-op.</p>

        <p>No. People do whatever they can get away with until called out or punished. No enforcer = no following the rule. Enforcer = following the rule. That's how it works where I live.</p>

        <p>People can get away with not wearing masks outside or in their car, yet I see idiots doing it lmfao. This isn't simply an enforcement issue, we also have a moron issue. In addition, the most profound morons want this to last forever and try to shame people for going out for a run without a mask.</p>

        <p>Seriously, DUH. </p>
<p>Although, my mother just told her children (who do not want this vaccine), “The CDC says that vaccinated people can be together indoors!” like she suddenly stopped thinking for herself.</p>
<p>BY THE WAY, our mother is what some might call a “health hippie”. She’s a hippie, not a drug hippie, but the kind that sees good food and exercise and exposure to the outdoors as the best way to live life. </p>
<p>She: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is adamantly against GMO foods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn’t think you should take Tylenol for a fever because the fever is doing the work of fighting whatever is in your body that needs to be fought against. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>AND 3. Chose to NOT VACCINATE either of her children (me and my sister) in the 80’s because of her and my dad’s position that a kid’s immune system is enough and will be stronger and more resilient without vaccinations. </p>
<p>Now, after years of me independently doing research about vaccines so that I can defend myself when people ask why I’m not vaccinated for anything, she has turned around and essentially said she will not see my sister and I until we are vaccinated for Covid. This is a TRUE STORY, people. I DO NOT know what happened to her, except that she started watching lots of news this year and was manipulated into being scared for her life every day. </p>
<p>I barely recognize her as the beautiful, spiritual, nature-loving woman who raised me, it breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>Exact same thing here, my mom never got us vaccinated, and now she's the only one in the family considering it, because she's scared to death. After a life time of avoiding traditional medication and questioning doctors, she is moving to take an experimental gene therapy, wtf...</p>

        <p>Yeah let me know if you can think of a good argument. I'll ask my dad to talk to her :/.</p>
<p>It's mostly not seeing her grandkids that's getting to her I think. I told her it won't actually guarantee protection, but she doesn't care. And if I'm wrong, she might get Covid, it's messed up.</p>

        <p>If you ask her about the total 180 in her beliefs, what does she say?  That's very strange.  I know most people aren't very self aware but it seems like it would be obvious to her that this is the opposite of how she used to be.</p>

        <p>When inundated with social media and news every minute of your life, it's difficult for some people to form their own opinions from how much is thrown at them. What's scary is how gen-z and millennials  are barely pushing back and forming a "comply or be banished" mentality. At this point I have no issue not going to concerts, hockey games or parties with friends if the vax is a requirement/issue. I'd rather not see those people if they demand me getting the shot, even though they go their and are supposed to be protected. What's their worry at that point?</p>

        <p>Question: What's your background that warents the efficiency of this independent research? I really hope it's a degree in biochemisty or genetics or something similar because there are nuances to scientific studies that are usually directed to that field of study.</p>

        <p>Around here, there were a lot of people wearing masks outdoors when they weren't anywhere near anybody long before it was mandated. I don't think the mandate had much impact on that actually.</p>

        <p>I saw another article claiming that this guidance is "too cautious" and isn't gonna incentivize people to get the vaccine, but I think the reason they were so cautious is because giving too much leeway would cause the whole mask charade to fall apart. That's why even the fully vaccinated still have to wear them indoors, because indoors is where most people are actually conscientious of the rules. All it takes is several unvaccinated people thinking they're "just one person" ignoring the rules when they leave their mask home. No one will notice! This habit would increasingly take hold in every single person as more people do it. That's why they were so tight with the new "guidance".</p>

        <p>Yeah that announcement got a big eyeroll from me. I've thought that masks are useless in most environments and situations but from the beginning but I couldn't imagine EVER wearing one outside, let alone if I wasn't in crowd. Vaccine or not! It's almost like a joke of an announcement. The CDC should come back when they have something meaningful to say.</p>

        <p>By Carla K. Johnson and Josh Funk and Mike Stobbe | APApril 27, 2021 at 9:19 p.m. PDT</p>
<p>In the small Nebraska town of Oxford, the school district dropped its mask mandate last month in what was a fairly straight-forward decision: Cases were down dramatically, and it didn’t bother local officials that their move flouted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.</p>
<p>Those federal mask guidelines just didn’t seem to fit local conditions well in the town of about 800 people where hardly anyone wears a mask.</p>
<p>“We haven’t paid a whole lot of attention to what is going on at the federal level — mainly what is coming out through the state,” Southern Valley Superintendent Bryce Jorgensen said. “You just can’t compare Chicago to Oxford, Nebraska. Things are just different.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its guidelines on the wearing of masks outdoors, saying fully vaccinated Americans don’t need to cover their faces anymore unless they are in a big crowd of strangers. And those who are unvaccinated can go outside without masks in some situations, too.</p>
<p>For most of the past year, the CDC had been advising Americans to wear masks outdoors if they are within 6 feet of one another.</p>
<p>The decision marked the U.S. government’s latest step toward normalcy, but came as much of the country already had moved on from mask rules. The CDC essentially endorsed what many Americans have already been doing.</p>
<p>On the same day the CDC updated its guidance, Louisiana’s governor partially lifted the state’s mask mandate, the first Democratic governor to make such a move during Joe Biden’s presidency. Elsewhere, local government leaders have been doing away with mask rules, and in many states, face coverings are an infrequent sight indoors, let alone outside.</p>
<p>In Montgomery, Alabama, 73-year-old Judy Adams said she hasn’t worn a mask outside since the early days of the pandemic a year ago and only puts them on inside when stores mandate them. Alabama had a statewide mask mandate until earlier this month, when the governor let it expire.</p>
<p>“I think it’s ridiculous, because it’s not helping,” she said of mask rules. “This is about control and fear. It ain’t about nothing but control and fear.”</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, the federal government has struggled to accomplish consistency in public health measures from state to state. The CDC has issued guidelines on masks, social distancing, travel and other activities but it’s up to governors on whether to adhere to the measures. Some states never had mask mandates, while others still have them on the books.</p>
<p>“Today, I hope, is a day when we can take another step back to the normalcy of before,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. “Over the past year, we have spent a lot of time telling Americans what you can’t do. Today, I am going to tell you some of the things you can do, if you are fully vaccinated.”</p>
<p>The CDC says that, whether they are fully vaccinated or not, people do not have to wear masks outdoors when they walk, bike or run alone or with members of their household. An unvaccinated person can also go maskless to a small outdoor gathering with fully vaccinated people.</p>
<p>But unvaccinated people — defined as those who have yet to receive both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson formula — should wear masks at small outdoor gatherings that include other unvaccinated people, the CDC says. They also should keep their faces covered when dining at outdoor restaurants with friends from multiple households.</p>
<p>And everyone, fully vaccinated or not, should keep wearing masks at crowded outdoor events such as concerts or sporting events, the CDC says.</p>
<p>The agency continues to recommend masks at indoor public places, such as hair salons, restaurants, shopping centers, gyms, museums and movie theaters, saying that is still the safer course even for vaccinated people.</p>
<p>The change comes as more than half of U.S. adults — or about 140 million people — have received at least one dose of vaccine, and more than a third have been fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Walensky said the decision was driven by rising vaccination numbers; declines in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths; and research showing that less than 10% of documented instances of transmission of the virus happened outdoors.</p>
<p>The new guidance represents another carefully calibrated step on the road back to normal from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28">coronavirus</a> outbreak that has killed over 570,000 people in U.S.</p>
<p>In Plano, Texas, Rob Webster, a 49-year-old church employee, said the new guidelines sound “reasonable” but he has some reservations.</p>
<p>“My only concern is that there are so many people who want to buck the system anyway,” said Webster, communications director at Custer Road United Methodist Church, which requires masks on church property, including for outdoor youth group meetings.</p>
<p>“So I don’t know if I was around a group of people who weren’t wearing masks, are they really vaccinated? ... It makes me maybe a little more fearful and less trusting of the people around me.”</p>
<p>In the Nebraska school district, Superintendent Jorgensen said the district decided to eliminate its mask rule based on conditions in the area and in the state, which never had a statewide mask mandate.</p>
<p>The district did see an elevated risk of the virus last fall when cases statewide were peaking, but there hasn’t been a single case in the district since January and fewer than a dozen cases had been reported in the two counties around the district when they made the decision.</p>
<p>Jorgensen said the district is still being careful and will require students to quarantine for 10 days if they test positive for the virus, but the mask mandate didn’t seem necessary anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we’ve totally thrown everything out the window. We still are closely watching it and monitoring every situation we can. But it just seems that those seem a little bit extreme,” Jorgensen said of the federal mask recommendations. “I think we have people here who can make some good local decisions, so that’s why we did it the way we did it.”</p>

<p>Interesting to think about the wording.  I suppose our response is supposed to be relief and gratitude.  The me the reaction is on par with taking back property that was illegitimately seized then held for an entirely unreasonable length of time related to a prosecutorial hoax.</p>
<p>We got to a point of living a life defined by restrictions enacted outside of legislative means.  It excluded legislative processes which are presumed to be a representation of voters who elected the members.  The process of getting here was sold on the premise of being about a virus, but the measures targeted behaviors of individuals and took precision pot-shots at local economies.</p>
<p>The "experts" who enjoyed the rapt attention of populations purposefully permeated with terror, chided us that surface sanitation, which would greatly reduce the need for business-killing and mind damaging restrictions, were ineffective against this virus.  Generations of wisdom related to house cleaning and labeling on surface treatment products like Lysol are suddenly irrelevant.  Perhaps they knew that outdoor transmission was next to impossible last summer when the BLM and ANTIFA demonstrations were being supported and approved by the same people who were ensuring that everyone else remained locked down.</p>
<p>How very nice of the Washington Post to deliver the glimmering light of carefully rationed sunshine from behind a paywall to a population whose numbers include an increase of people without a permanent income.  Such thoughtfulness and compassion.</p>

        <p>That quote kinda gives me the chills when you put it that way.
All of a sudden it's normal to have big brother micro managing everywhere we go and who we can see on these very specific scenarios you need a diagram to explain (vaccinated person outside with non-vaccinated etc).
This is so insane and it's even stranger how quickly people got used to it.</p>

        <p>Most people are conditioned to gloss over word choice and not give any thought to how something is said.</p>
<p>Of course this happens concurrent with the generally accepted narrative that rights and freedoms are selfish.  The lack of general blowback against that bullshit should strike fear into people- but apparently the majority as been effectively primed for a dictatorship.</p>

        <p>Does this announcement make everyone here so angry because this it is an indication that the “new normal” was never actually a thing? Face masks and social distancing aren’t, and never were, going to last forever. They are temporary measures to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed. It’s so strange to see people get so triggered by encountering people wearing masks. </p>
<p>I agree that many governments have overreacted. I believe that the only reason that the CDC didn’t give this guidance earlier is because it is hard to quantify what “crowded” and “unsafe” mean outdoors. Brooklyn is a different ballgame than a hiking trail. Unfortunately some governors clearly haven’t been able to pick up on the nuances and made ridiculous mandates. </p>
<p>I have been gauging when to wear a mask outside this entire pandemic. At the beach? Nope. At a meeting at work? Yup, we are all sitting there for an hour and we are usually sitting under cover that may hinder airflow. </p>
<p>Change is scary, I get it. But I am looking forward to getting back to normal, and vaccines are helping us get there faster.</p>

<p>You are deflecting from the reality that this was an overreaction/miscalculation due to fear among other things.</p>
<p>I totally support people's right to take the vaccine and for the government to encourage it even assuming they think it's safe.  Forcing compliance is where the line is crossed however.  </p>
<p>But we were talking about masks on healthy asymptomatic people outdoors which have been absurd as a recommendation from the start and I remember hearing about this  back in summer (BBC World service) not to mention, it seemed pretty ridiculous to me based on my own experiences getting sick in the past.  This has been based on bogus science pretty much the whole time but we are still kind of going along with it since they still say unvaccinated people still have to mask outside.</p>
<p>Forget outdoor masking for a second though.</p>
<p>You are pretty much resigned to cover your face in meetings for the rest of your life or just when this is "over"?  Everyone I asked said it would be over once we got the vaccine  but I figured that just like the flu, it would have to be an annual reformulation based on a constantly mutating virus therefore there will be no end if we go down this route.</p>

        <p>You are misunderstanding me. This is not the new normal. We aren’t going to be wearing face masks long term. It might be more common now, like in Asian countries. But soon face masks will be a thing of the past. Obviously it is now endemic, but now concerned parties are able to protect themselves. This is speaking for America at least. </p>
<p>Of course there is the (hopefully) outside chance that the virus will mutate and either affect younger populations before they can get vaccinated, or become resistant to the vaccines. That is why such strict precautions are still being recommended. It would suck to have to go back to square one. Treatments have already improved vastly- my brother in law caught Covid a couple months ago and started to go down a bad path- drs sent him immediately to the hospital for a treatment and he is fine now, even for his taste and smell back. If he had not been taking precautions at the start of the pandemic he may have died. As it was, he caught Covid less than a week after his family loosened up because they were worried about the mental health of their children. </p>
<p>Scientists will continue to refine vaccines and treatments. It might take a few years before we feel completely back to normal, unfortunately. Outdoor events might become a little more common. And yeah, WFH might stick around, unless you are like me and have a job outdoors. </p>
<p>I don’t like wearing a mask. I am required to wear one at work and it gets hot as shit and my glasses fog up and my coworkers can’t hear me so I have to repeat myself a lot and I end up wearing one for about 9 hours a day sometimes. It sucks. But it is temporary. A notice was sent out today that higher ups were evaluating the new guidelines and they would let us know what changes they would make. In the meantime I am practicing my patience and also just grateful that so far not too many of my coworkers have gotten Covid- although when it has happened, even with us wearing masks and working outside, it spreads within the team a little bit. I have a lot of coworkers that fall into the high risk category, as I imagine most of us do. American has an obesity problem, and you would think that this would be a wake up call but so far I don’t see that happening. Just a lot of crying about wearing masks.</p>
