    <strong>What exactly do you guys believe?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm seeing 2 links in the sidebar which aren't really giving me any helpful information. Do you think that masks don't work? That the danger of the virus is overinflated? That lockdown is social control? I would love to see a link to a wiki explaining everything in the sidebar.</p></p>

        <p>Regarding masks, there's plenty of evidence that masks do nothing or very little to stop/reduce respiratory viruses, hence prior to March of 2020, both the CDC and WHO had comprehensive studies about why they were ineffective against cold and flu viruses, and I think the fact that covid just kept spreading after months of mask mandates should be glaring proof enough that masks either do nothing, or actually just make it worse.</p>
<p>Masks have also created a disgusting, sanctimonious, and toxic culture where those that support masks are seen as morally and intellectually superior, and those that oppose them are ridiculed, bullied, harassed, shamed, and silenced into submission. And a few other huge reasons...masks are demoralizing, dehumanizing, horrible for animal life/the environment, and most are manufactured in cramped, dirty sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh.  </p>
<p>The danger of this virus is absolutely massively overblown. It's literally 0.2% IFR (infection fatality rate) while the average age of a covid death is 80+, and around the age of life expectancy in the West. </p>
<p>If this virus was actually as deadly (as the media and governments claim it is) than it would have a much higher IFR and a sizeable proportion of the deaths would be young people.</p>
<p>And by now it should be obvious that lockdowns don't work for low IFR viruses. They are simply to easily transmissible and mild, with an extremely high number of asymptomatics. This is why we never had such a stupid response to any other respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and the rest of the dystopian crap only wreak havoc and do irreparable damage to society, while being completely useless in stopping such a virus. The harm done is immense. Lockdowns also caused one of the biggest wealth transfers in history.</p>
<p>There was nothing remotely rational, logical or scientific about the response to this virus. Everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity. What has happened this March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this before?</p>

        <p>Could you and u/WhereDidTheStarsGo link the studies that suggest masks/lockdowns don't work? Just the first 3 results off DuckDuckGo I got:</p>
<p>&rt;The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for facemasks to  protect against disease transmission. In response to shortages, many  public health authorities have recommended homemade masks as acceptable  alternatives to surgical masks and N95 respirators. Although mask  wearing is intended, in part, to protect others from exhaled,  virus-containing particles, few studies have examined particle emission  by mask-wearers into the surrounding air. Here, we measured outward  emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing  various expiratory activities while wearing different types of  medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95  respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle  emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing,  respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their  effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly  decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who  for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more  expiratory particles via coughing than average. In contrast, shedding of  non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers  in homemade cotton-fabric masks confounded explicit determination of  their efficacy at reducing expiratory particle emission. Audio analysis  of the speech and coughing intensity confirmed that people speak more  loudly, but do not cough more loudly, when wearing a mask. Further work  is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking  expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to  assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized  fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of  medical-grade masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of  homemade masks.</p>

<p>&rt;Cloth masks have been used in healthcare and community settings to  protect the wearer from respiratory infections. The use of cloth masks  during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is under debate. The  filtration effectiveness of cloth masks is generally lower than that of  medical masks and respirators; however, cloth masks may provide some  protection if well designed and used correctly. Multilayer cloth masks,  designed to fit around the face and made of water-resistant fabric with a  high number of threads and finer weave, may provide reasonable  protection. Until a cloth mask design is proven to be equally effective  as a medical or N95 mask, wearing cloth masks should not be mandated for  healthcare workers. In community settings, however, cloth masks may be  used to prevent community spread of infections by sick or  asymptomatically infected persons, and the public should be educated  about their correct use.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this  study - 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as  source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used  different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks  appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both  together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health  care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a  shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were  not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick  patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well  contacts.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32512240/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32512240/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I certainly agree it's not as black and white as everyone says it is, but it's not as if there is a lack of evidence for masks working.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Just noticed you said prior to March 2020, can you suggest why it was changed? I assume it would be because they found that the older studies were inaccurate and replaced them.</p>

        <p>I believe that would be because they don't want to confuse the public with conflicting information (but to be clear, I absolutely don't agree with the censorship of information and that shouldn't have happened).</p>
<p>But how they updated their studies is largely irrelevant, as far as I can see the most up-to-date studies show that masks do provide some level of protection.</p>

        <p>All the ‚Äústudies‚Äù you mention are low quality studies. All data is not created equally. Observational studies are crap. RCT is gold standard, RCT studies over the past 40 have demonstrated quite clearly that mask do not work to prevent viral transmission. Have you read the procedure and data from the ‚Äústudies‚Äù you mentioned? Why would you assume the newest sconce is correct? That the opposite of the way things usually go.

        <p>I haven't read the procedure or data for the same reason I wouldn't self-represent in court, I have no specialization in the field. It's very easy to miss something or make a false assumption, which is why I just go on general logic, 40 year old studies have a higher chance to be out of date, and a random selection of studies while newer gives a better view of the whole picture.</p>

        <p>I never said masks "don't work". It's that they are not significantly effective at reducing transmission of covid (or other respiratory viruses), otherwise cases wouldn't be surging for months. All the observational data from around the world has shown this.</p>
<p>You also have to factor in that this is an extremely low Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) respiratory virus that didn't warrant masks (outside of hospitals) in the first place.</p>
<p>Everyone wearing masks, on the premise that they all perpetually have covid and don't even know it is some of the most stupid medieval quackery in modern times. It was common sense prior to March of 2020 that asymptomatic spread is virtually non-existent and the premise that operates on everyone having covid all the time just never knowing when is absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>Regarding lockdowns they only cause <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kn2xe4/all_the_detrimental_effects_of_lockdowns_divided/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">enormous destruction</a> to every facet of society. </p>
<p>Lockdowns have only been somewhat effective on island nations (yet some are still is regularly locking down entire cities and abusing its citizens over a single case). If you think otherwise, name just 5 land countries that eliminated covid. I'll wait.</p>

        <p>Eliminating covid is never going to be possible, it's like the cold. The goal is to reduce cases to a more manageable number. Which with masks and lockdowns being somewhat effective, plus the exponential nature of virus growth, is rather achievable. </p>
<p>Of course, we can never know what the true difference is. but with your 0.2% fatality rate stat, the ceiling would be somewhere around 15 million deaths if we did nothing (assuming no re-infections). It's also worth nothing that even if you don't die covid causes permanent damage to the lungs.</p>

        <p>So you are just gonna ignore the extra deaths &amp; damage to every facet of society that lockdowns have caused?</p>
<p>&rt;somewhere around 15 million deaths if we did nothing </p>
<p>This is false. No virus can ever infect 100% of the population...herd immunity kicks in long before that.</p>
<p>&rt;It's also worth nothing that even if you don't die covid causes permanent damage to the lungs.</p>
<p>In rare instances...just like any viral disease ever (including the flu, common cold, gastroenteritis etc.).</p>
<p>The vast majority of people who get infected by covid either have mild symptoms or none at all. Only the most frail who don't have much longer to live get severe cases (those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions), barring the very few outliers where there's an infinitesimal chance that a healthy young person might develop a cytokine storm and die. That's exactly how the common flu works every year, in fact the flu has a higher chance of killing healthy young people and children than covid.</p>

        <p>??? I said it's common, you disagreed, I'm asking you to link studies, of course you don't have to but it's hard to have a productive discussion when you refuse to provide a source for your information.</p>
<p>And yeah that's why I said supposedly, I have no idea if you believe that happens or not but I assumed you did because you are yet to link any specific studies.</p>

        <p>What's with the "I don't have to do anything?", I just said you don't. But if you're going to be stubborn then don't participate in the discussion at all. Regardless, the scientific consensus is that covid causes permanent damage to the lungs, which is why I'm asking you to provide a source for your claim that it doesn't.</p>

        <p>Can you find any data on how common long term effects are? All I ever see is "it CAN happen" but never anything related to X% of cases result in permanent effect, or even just raw numbers like "50,000 reported cases of long term damage"</p>

        <p>&rt;It's also worth nothing that even if you don't die covid causes permanent damage to the lungs.</p>
<p>This has never been proven. Every study that showed actual damage, and not "I still felt a little under the weather two weeks after infection, IT MUST BE PERMANENT DAMAGE!" had small sample sizes and were only about patients hospitalized for COVID - often early in the first 2020 outbreak, with horrible treatment protocols. Severe, life-threatening pneumonia in a vulnerable patient and inappropriate use of ventilators will often cause lung problems, yes.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that long-term outcomes are significantly different than with flu, which occasionally causes mild lingering symptoms for weeks and a few unlucky people take a very long time to fully recover.</p>

        <p>Well, I did use a search engine that doesn't filter results, and you saw the results above. As I said, they aren't 100% conclusive like most people believe but the replies I'm getting say flat out "according to science masks don't work" which doesn't seem to be true.</p>
<p>The censorship thing does seem like an issue, and there doesn't seem to be much you can do about that. Things like this are why I advocate for decentralized solutions (or really anything away from mainstream media) where censorship isn't possible</p>

        <p>Good idea. Me personally I know that lockdowns don't stop the spread of the virus (because that's what the science shows),I believe that lockdowns do FAR more harm than good, and I know that masks do not work as well as the media tell you they do (again, science supports this, papers even showing that cloth masks are worse for you than no mask.)</p>

        <p>Masks are meant to be worn by sick people so they don't infect people who aren't sick. The global narrative about what masks are for has changed and it has somehow been drilled in to peoples brains that you should wear a mask to protect yourself. It's absolutely insane. That's not what masks are for. They are meant to protect <strong><em>OTHERS FROM YOU,</em></strong> not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Studies show asymptomatic people don't spread the virus. So if you have it, but you don't feel sick, don't have any symptoms, you aren't a threat to anybody. It is spread by aerosolized particulates. So if you have it and are running around the the grocery store coughing and sneezing all over the place, you are a threat to others and should be wearing a mask. But really, if you're coughing and sneezing constantly, keep your ass at home and get what you need delivered.</p>
