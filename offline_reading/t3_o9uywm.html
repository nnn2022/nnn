    <strong>BC / Alberta "Heat Wave" Being Used As "Climate Change" Propaganda now of course</strong>
    <p><p>Of course, they gotta take a random heatwave and start using it as a 'See?!!? See!? It's climate change doing this!!"</p>
<p>Insert multiple sources "BC Heat Wave" here: I don't need to link them you can find them.</p>
<p>Notice they don't say global warming or cooling, because scientists can't agree this is even happening, and sometime around 2010 they went with climate CHANGE .</p>
<p>Also I had a strange thought occur to me, as THIS summer I've noticed how BLUE the sky has been , which hasn't been the case in previous years, where you see that the sky is blue, but always NOT perfect and with a haze that kind of ruins it?</p>
<p>What if the lockdowns and restrictions cut the pollution down that THIS is really what is supposed to be, the ACTUAL heat, since there are LESS particulates in the atmosphere in general BLOCKING the sun heat?</p>
<p>That 'haze' from previous years certainly made it feel like not true sunlight getting through. I  LIKE this sun coming on a blue sky. I PREFER it., though this heatwave is certainly uncomfortable lol.</p>
<p>The reason I say this is because there ARE theories out there that stated that more CO2 in the atmosphere actually aided growth, that in the time of dinosaurs and giant jungles that there was MORE C02 in our atmosphere not LESS and that things grew SUPER big from plants to animals as a result, AND blocked harmful UV rays more as well.</p>
<p>I kind of poisoned the well a bit I now with that last crazy theory, but how about you?<br>
Has the sky been more blue than you remember from previous years, and is this 'heat wave' a good hill to fight some 'climate change' battle on?</p></p>

        <p>So, they broke records from decades ago. I guess "climate change" was just as bad back then since it took decades to break the record.</p>

        <p>Well my point is that they say 'less pollution'  in the atmosphere and area due to the lockdowns and restrictions, but now because there is no haze, and it's actually very beautiful blue skies for the first time in years (I work outside, I know) then they blame climate change..  but haze blocks sunlight.. lol</p>
<p>I mean it's  hot today, but the sunlight feels pure for once.</p>

        <p>This is not a natural climate of western Canada and last I heard it was what they were calling a heat bubble that came up from the Southern United States. I saw this on the weather Network not too long ago. It's just a regular freak occurrence of weather that happens all the time. We've had heat waves throughout history in Canada and will continue to do so because it's something that the climate does every once in awhile. It sucks and it's incredibly uncomfortable but it's not unnatural and it's just an inconvenience.</p>
<p>I assume you're living in Alberta or BC? One thing I've noticed this summer is that there's no smoke. Not yet anyways. Many Summers of the past few years there's been a lot of smoke by this time from forest fires and I think that the forests have burned down enough of the old dead wood that we won't be seeing that for a while.</p>
