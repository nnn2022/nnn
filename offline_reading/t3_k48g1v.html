    <strong>Never ending lockdowns and restrictions are ruining me</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone. Sorry in advance if posts like these aren‚Äôt allowed but I‚Äôm not sure where else I can get this off my chest </p>
<p>This year, I started going to therapy and got diagnosed with PTSD. The kicker is part of it stems from a medical incident I experienced as a kid so of course this year has been hell for me. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take every single person around me being so swallowed up with fear from this. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of hearing it every single day, in every conversation or post or news story or whatever. In all honesty it‚Äôs even been triggering for me. The fucking cherry on top is my therapists office isn‚Äôt taking in person appointments so I was stuck doing half ass video appointments, until my insurance told me they‚Äôre not going to cover it (but would cover the in person stuff). I stopped being able to afford it after a while so now I‚Äôm shit out of luck. I‚Äôm spiraling all over again. Resorting to unhealthy escapism or methods of self destruction is all that‚Äôs been holding me over. All of my PTSD symptoms have fully returned.</p>
<p>And for weeks, my mom and sister (one who‚Äôs unemployed and one who has the ability to work from home) keep going on and on about why we should go full lock down, fucking again; ‚ÄúOur states cases are exploding, they‚Äôre not gonna have hospital capacity, blah blah blah‚Äù. They‚Äôve been saying those things since THE BEGINNING. Don‚Äôt you think by now we would‚Äôve seen actual changes here? Where‚Äôs all the bodies in the streets or the overflowing hospitals or whatever the fuck else. </p>
<p>The only kind of social interaction I‚Äôm getting is from my job and if I lose it because of another useless fucking lockdown, I feel like it‚Äôs going to be the end for me. I can‚Äôt start going to school because it‚Äôs all online (going to trade school and need actual in person hours to graduate). I don‚Äôt qualify for unemployment and I‚Äôd stop being able to afford rent. I‚Äôm 19 and I feel like my life is already going to be over. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of all of these people who have the privilege to work from home never take a second to think about how these stupid fucking lockdowns are effecting people who don‚Äôt have that choice. Not even just that, but how it‚Äôs destroying so many people mentally.</p></p>

        <p>You‚Äôre not alone in your feelings. I‚Äôm 16 and this is the worst year of my life. I‚Äôve deteriorated mentally and started talking to myself and laughing at my own jokes. </p>
<p>Regardless of what any doomer says, these lockdowns are unnecessary, cruel and dystopian. They‚Äôd take a mental toll on anyone that isn‚Äôt an antisocial misanthropic recluse. You don‚Äôt deserve to deal with any of the shit that these people have put you through. </p>
<p>I never felt so angry, frustrated, sad, lonely and hopeless until this year. We‚Äôve already lost so much, and they still expect us to be afraid of the 99.9% survival rate and the eternally surging cases. If these lockdowns worked, it would‚Äôve been over with in two weeks like they said 10 months ago.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a reason why you‚Äôre here with us, I hope you keep faith in your heart and pull through this. There isn‚Äôt much we can do at the moment but hope for the future.</p>

        <p>Its hearing from the younger generation that gives me the fire to fight back. I'm in my 30s and I will stand with you all. You don't deserve the bullshit. None of us do but especially kids. Anyone under 18 is a kid to me btw, no offense.  This is America üá∫üá∏.  Land of the free and home of the brave. At least it used to be. Who's going to stand with me and fight for our freedom once more?</p>

        <p>I agree with you totally. My parents, who were fully supporting me because I am mentally ill, died recently.</p>
<p>If it was not for their estate (enough for me to live on for a few years) I would be out on the street right now.</p>
<p>I'm angry that they are shutting down small businesses like this even though there is no evidence that doing that slows down CoVid-19 at all.</p>
<p>The "No indoor dining!" thing has actually also been having shade put on it for stopping CoVid-19 as they find out that most cases of CoVid-19 spread has been not in restaurants but in clubs and bars where people mingle a lot closer than they do in any restaurant.</p>
<p>Don't give up: That is exactly what they want you to do. Simply apply for social assistance programs, the Social Worker here in my hometown has already told me I would be qualified for them even if I was not mentally ill.</p>

<p>What social assistance programs you're talking about?</p>
<p>To my knowledge, for the most part you need to be a woman with children to even get cash welfare.</p>

        <p>I can't speak for Lerianis, but in my area, both men and women, even without children, can get Social Security disability benefits. If someone doesn't have enough work credits for SSDI, they can still get SSI, which is considered a welfare program here. My area also has a program called ABD that gives people a bit of money while they wait to get approved for disability. I live in an apartment complex for mentally ill and/or developmentally disabled people (I'm both, and I'm a woman but have no children) and there are men here too, without children, who are on disability and other welfare programs. </p>
<p>I'm not saying this to disagree with you, maybe your area is less generous and that would suck if that's the case. I just hope there's something around the corner you haven't come across yet there.</p>
<p>You're welcome to message me, whether for help, venting or to just chit chat through the lockdown boredom.</p>

        <p>Stop complying with this then. It will give you purpose to fight back against it. Don‚Äôt wait for someone else to solve your problems for you. </p>

        <p>I'm able to work from home, and this year has been devastating to my mental health. I relapsed in my severe depression. I'm drinking a lot, and I'm a workout/health addict, so I didn't drink much before. I hadn't thought this much about suicide in years, and I just got married 5 months ago. This should be the best year of my life.
But I want to die.
And not even mental health professionals have been able to help much.
I'm supporting every non-compliant business I can, but there's not a lot of them here.</p>

        <p>Maybe start meeting up with anti-lockdown groups? I got hooked up with one in my city on fb and it's great meeting up with and talking to other people who aren't living in fear. That's the key I think. Luckily a handfull of my friends don't buy into any of this either, although I have lost some longtime ones permanently as well. I find the more I hang out with normal ppl, the better I feel. I know it doesn't solve your life situation, but it might help. And who knows? You might meet someone who can hook you up with another job or help you out in some way.</p>

        <p>How did you find an anti-lockdown group in person? I feel that in my state, they likely have to be underground  (and saying that makes me question what the fuck has happened to this world).</p>

        <p>As censored as it is, I first found them on Facebook, not sure if they‚Äôre still there as I haven‚Äôt been on fb for 3 weeks. The Reopen California group and through that found Reopen San Diego. I went to an anti-lockdown protest and they had a tent there, so I highly recommend going to any rally or protest you hear about if you can. I ended up having to go by myself, but it was worth it to meet all those ppl. Don‚Äôt have any experience with it, but Parler would prob be a good resource as well as I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs mostly for conservatives.</p>

        <p>I was living a comfortable life with plans and a future and then lockdowns came and stole my future from me, separated me from my family, destroyed my finances, and my anxiety which had been in remission came roaring back worse than ever. Every day I hate my life and I feel like I'm powerless under these moronic, tourture laws except for complaining about it on reddit.</p>
