    <p><p>My opinion of myself isn't so low as to believe some faceless, socially crippled labcoat should have complete control over my own body and what I fucking do with it. My opinion of myself isn't so high that I demand those around me don't get vaccinated, don't wear a mask or don't socially distance. By all fucking means, stay at home for the rest of your life, take as many booster shots as you want, and wear as many masks as you like, just don't force that shit on me and don't expect me to cater to your mental illness by changing my entire life to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you sneer back that my not being vaccinated means you have to change your entire life to suit MY needs: nope, sorry, life comes with risk and you didn't give a fuck about my vaccination status prior to 2020. Climb out of the fucking hole you've dug for yourself and start living again. The virus has a 99.9% (or there abouts) survival rate and the prospect of LoNg CoViD shouldn't matter to you, seeing as you willingly took an experimental vaccine with possible unknown long term side effects. </p>
<p>I choose not to put faith in people who have moved the goalposts endlessly, made our lives living Hell for the past year and a half, swept people who have suffered from these "vaccines" under the rug, censored and deplatformed other medical experts who have spoken out against this shit, broken all the rules themselves, denied loved ones the right to see each other even on their death beds, covered up the origin of this virus because it would reflect badly on them for FUNDING the fucking thing in the first place, have a history of experimenting on people (did we forget about MK Ultra?) and in the case of the pharma companies massive financial settlements for faulty products, and who are actively mapping out a way to make life extremely difficult for people like myself who refuse to bow to their medical tyranny and authoritarianism. </p>
<p>But you do you, I guess. Believe that every scientist and medical professional is morally pure, incorruptible and infallible... except the ones who are disagreeing with the narrative of course. Believe that asymptomatic spread is a thing and choose to ignore that all the jab ostensibly does is reduce symptoms and so does nothing to prevent the asymptomatic spread that required us all to stay inside and mask up for over a year. Believe that vaccine passports and segregation are a path back to "normal", even though this would mean things would forever be changed and it's an admission that Covid is here to stay. Believe that you're a good person and that you aren't supporting fascism and that this somehow isn't at all like "1984" or any other dystopian novel.</p></p>

        <p>That was decades ago. Corruption happens. They aren't even close to what they used to be. They have the same problem as the UN or any international governing body. They eventually become beholden to the political interests of the member nations and cease to serve the purpose that they were founded for.</p>

        <p>Why does everything fall back to politics with you people? You realize that to work with politicians to change health policy (you know, where the word politician comes from [actually, I'm positive your weak mind had no clue]) it's best to work in the way politicians work. I understand some uneducated people don't get how to even work together with others but sometimes health experts and scientists don't have the right skills for that work so they find people that do. Jesus fuck you guys are hopeless.</p>

        <p>There's a big difference between working with politicians and taking bribes. Look at the UN human rights Council if you want to see a real joke. It might as well be the human rights abuses hall of fame. There is no reason to work with any organization that has a demonstrated history of not acting in good faith and making health policy decisions that get people killed based on political pressure from countries committing genocide.</p>
<p>Edit: and no, politics does not come from the word policy. It comes from the Greek word politikos. They both stem from the Greek word for city, polis, but that's where the similarities end.</p>

        <p>Honestly, all you have to say is “Fauci is allegedly a scientist and he’s flip flopped more than a mom at an all-inclusive resort. He has so much faith in the vaccine he’s openly admitted to wearing a mask anyway. Hes a fucking idiot. Why would I just follow that blindly?”</p>

        <p>The most interesting problem here is the complete separation between the experts and The People who are impacted by the choices the experts made on our behalf.</p>
<p>If known plenty of “experts” in my life.  Befriended some!  Most are incredibly smart but myopically focused on one variable.  When we are able to talk directly, (and they aren’t shielded and walled off by government bureaucrats) they are often quick to accept other theories or to acknowledge their ideas may impact other variables in ways they have not considered.</p>
<p>Most experts are careful to put limits on their opinions and not try to create a one size fits all cookie cutter world.  This is the doing of power hungry bureaucrats (including people like Fauci who is not an accomplished scientist but who has derived all his power by playing the government game well.)</p>

        <p>Even if they are smarter than me, that still doesn't mean they are right.</p>
<p>One of the problems of course is there are all sorts of conflicts of interest going on in these insitutions. When politics, money, or power is at stake, the truth often takes a back seat.</p>
<p>Smart people can be subject to a shitty system that forces them to lie. Sometimes smart people can even fall for and believe the lies. Sometimes they lie on purpose.</p>
<p>Personally, though, I am a person who is significantly above average in intelligence. So it's not actually a guarantee that the people in or running these institutions are smarter than me.</p>
<p>But then, I am also not really a fan of the argument of "I am smarter than you, therefore you should listen to me". I prefer "show, don't tell".  As in, actually using one's intelligence to say and do intelligent things, and letting the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who are on paper very intelligent, but who do not make good use of it.</p>

        <p>100%. Most of us aren't scientists or doctors, but all you have to do is a quick search of the past history of Fauci, FDA, NIH, Big Pharma and all these corrupt bureaucrats to realize that they deserve none of our trust. Scandal after scandal until they became "THE TRUTH" all of a sudden when covid hit. What? Trust the science? Sure. I trust the true practitioners of the scientific method, but I don't trust the people at the top telling us what the science is. They lie, like all the fucking time.</p>

        <p>Thank you for saying this. Exactly. I am not smarter than “the scientists”. Science isn’t my background. I am aware of history. The institutions offering the vaccine are not trustworthy or credible. They have shown themselves willing to lie, poison, and harm. See OxyContin, Tuskegee syphilis, exposing US military service members to nuclear, chemical and bio weapons. I can recommend some books.</p>

        <p>No problem at all and thank you for replying in the first case I appreciate it.</p>
<p>My questions are - </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are there ever any doubts that you might be on the wrong side of the argument and if so have you ever indulged the thought you might be wrong? (I say that because I've been strongly opinionated before and had to call myself out for being wrong in the past, which is admittedly painful)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know the government of many countries have pulled some mega shady shit over the years. That being said, if they genuinely are trying to take a shady angle on Covid or the vaccine how on Earth could the average person be able to disprove the vast majority of scientists and doctors etc that agree with each others findings?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As I said before dude, massively appreciate you indulging me on this, I've had opposing views on many things throughout life but the one thing I hate about all this is in particular is there are very few cases of nice and understanding interactions between pro vaxers and anti vaxers which really sucks.</p>
<p>I feel we'd all get further if we just too the time to properly hear each other out. All the best and thanks again.</p>

        <p>I’m just wondering. </p>
<p>You’ve never associated the 600 000 thousand deaths to a glaring reality that in the US, and for that matter, all of western culture, we have a massive obesity problem… so much so, that it kills more than starvation right now… what’s even more insidious… is that it is promoted and normalized in a corportocracy led existence… lol it’s nice to think Russians or North Koreans are brainwashed by the state but theres no way a westerner can’t be… lol… a “western altruist” should be an oxymoron at this point… </p>
<p>You don’t think that the most enlightened pharmeceutical scientists or the pinnacle of intellectualism in the realm of genetics cant sometimes overlook things or worse get something wrong?… is it too concerning to admit that the <em>slightest</em> variable or nuance could’ve been overlooked even with the best intentions… or we just piously believe in their abilities… like there’s no way we as a species tend to collectively have our heads so far up our asses to think we can control nature or an <em>endemic</em> virus at this point with a manmade medical technology… you don’t think that fringe scientists or the minority that challenges the majority has been a keystone in revealing revelations missed by the established doctrine through outside the history of science and medical sciences… it’s like people think we’ve reached the pinnacle and no further enlightenment is needed… especially when esoteric fields such as immunology and genetics are still a Pandora’s box of undiscovered intricacies. </p>
<p>Do we collectively want to scoff off the very real potential for antibody dependant enhancement and the implications thereof… that’s cool too… </p>
<p>Has fauci’s recent statements suggesting the viral load in vaxxed and unvaxxed recipients who catch covid is exactly the same… it’s only that the vaxxed have less severe symptoms… so even if you segregated all the vaxxed from unvaxxed… ya know “medical apartheid” something you brown shirts really want right now, the virus will continue to mutate in the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike… since it’s endemic now… </p>
<p>Should we not consider the law of declining virulence… you don’t want to consider that dwindling hospitalizations attributed to vaccine success which we can admit they are… could also be attributed to natural immunity and or a combination of the two… </p>
<p>You don’t want to think that doctors and specialists that have raised “concern” and “speculate” that some downsides to mass vaccination could have some potential adverse and unforeseen consequences… even when they admit to there “concerns” and admit it’s “speculation” they’re still labelled quacks, censored or silenced… even though this very notion of contrarian thought in debate and discussion is a <em>pillar</em> of the scientific method!! </p>
<p>If you don’t think it’s strange that the vaccine campaign and resources attributed to all its marketing and advertising could’ve “equally” been met with just as much of an emphasis on empowering people with healthy lifestyles EI eating 10 servings of fruit and veggies a day… daily exercise… balanced diets… and an aversion to processed foods and too much meats and the profound impacts a healthy lifestyle has on increasing youre chances from avoiding hospitalization from covid… and basically every other known disease and sickness associated with poor lifestyle and nutrition… maybe people would be more trusting of big pharma and govt… but no it seemed that way of thinking is a little bit to opposing to corporate ideals… </p>
<p>Even as new data surfaces daily… all I ask… is to explore other narratives or information maybe it’s a mix of truth from everything… broaden your horizons… I read the exact same mainstream narrative… the established doctrines put out by doctors and scientists on msm, r/coronavirus, CNN, that you do… more so I try to be conscious that’s it’s all propaganda FOX is, the NNN is, every goddamn media platform is… but which ones are completely non partisan? Independant? I don’t know…. Maybe a transparent debate would help? Otherwise… I know I could be wrong… led astray… cognitive dissonant… dunning Kruger afflicted hypocrit… do you ever question yourself? Or the experts? You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to do so… which leads us to the other problem that we tend to look down on uneducated people.. demean them… to a point where the narrative right now suggests that they don’t even deserve a voice… it’s just a little messed up in that regard don’t you think?</p>

        <p>I know I'm not the one you asked but I'll throw in my thoughts anyway. Thanks for being super respectable, btw!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I can only speak for myself but I'd be more than willing to admit I was wrong. In fact, and with this I think all of us would agree, I hope we're wrong. If the vaccine was the genuine article and was undoubtedly safe that would be fantastic. But it obviously isn't and based on the unknown long term effects it may be even more deadly than what Covid ever was. Regardless of the safety of the vaccine, look at the damage it's already doing to society on its very existence alone, with plans of segregation, discrimination, infighting, black-mailing, and loss of personal freedom. No one can say they're certain of something 100%, but I believe what is most reasonable based on the evidence and based on what is morally/ethically right and I am seeing none of that in the vaccine's existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the vaccine, they simply don't know. If they did, we'd know what it would do five, ten years down the road, but at this point it's still experimental. In regards to Covid, there are scientists and doctors on both sides of the argument (my mother was even encouraged by one of our doctors NOT to get the vaccine). The "science is settled" is untrue, as with something as new as Covid what you have is data and an interpretation of that data which leads to theories/discoveries that will be changing and growing for possibly years (delta, lambda, etc.) And this is evidenced by how back and forth they've been. I've learnt in my life not to make hasty decisions and Covid is absolutely no exception.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is that constant shifting of conclusions evidence of something shady or simply the result of hasty thinking due to fear and panic? I err on the side of panic. They're trying to genuinely get as much information out there but 1. It's so rushed that it's unreliable or 2. The gov'nt is censoring or twisting what they don't want you to hear. At the end of the day, I think most doctors are genuine and do want to help. I don't believe that about the government for one second.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

        <p>Sorry for the delay but I'm back now!</p>
<p>&rt;Are there ever any doubts that you might be on the wrong side of the <br>
argument and if so have you ever indulged the thought you might be <br>
wrong? (I say that because I've been strongly opinionated before and had<br>
 to call myself out for being wrong in the past, which is admittedly <br>
painful)</p>
<p>One side fights for freedom (of speech and otherwise), bodily autonomy and the truth. The other side is all about taking away those things or muddying them. The things I have seen over the past year and a half (jab injuries/deaths being censored, police brutality against peaceful protesters and random people just enjoying themselves on the beach without a mask on, people snitching on their friends and family for "breaking the rules", a son being forcefully seperated from his own grieving mother at her own husband's funeral to maintain social distancing, and so on...) lead me to believe that if I am wrong then it's not worth being "right".</p>
<p>Humanity and society as a whole is being deformed and perverted beyond belief out of fear of something most people don't even die from, let alone know they even have. </p>
<p>&rt; know the government of many countries have pulled some mega shady shit <br>
over the years. That being said, if they genuinely are trying to take a <br>
shady angle on Covid or the vaccine how on Earth could the average <br>
person be able to disprove the vast majority of scientists and doctors <br>
etc that agree with each others findings?</p>
<p>By following the money, archiving every little piece of contradictory information shat out by the press on behalf of these scientists in an effort to fulfill a news quota, and NOT by censoring stuff or deplatforming others because it might be deemed "misinformation". Also one person can't achieve much but a whole bunch of us together working in unison CAN.</p>
