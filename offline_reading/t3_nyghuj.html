    <strong>Online school made me depressed</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 15, and a rising junior in high school. My family has a history of depression, and I do have occasional bouts of depression. When I would go to school every day, it was easy to beat - I was having a good time hanging out with my friends, talking to girls, playing sports, etc.</p>
<p>That all changed this year. My school went mandatory virtual, for a whole year. I would still occasionally hang out with friends, on the weekend and such, but my god online school just drained me.</p>
<p>It is just so depressing to spend all day looking at a screen, keeping up with school, and even worse, no peers to help you through it. My grades dropped, I almost failed two important classes. Had I failed these, I would either have to attend virtual summer school, or retake my sophmore year. My mental health reached a new low. I felt depressed every second of every minute of every day. I no longer found enjoyment in any of the things I loved. It had an extreme physical effect on me too, I never felt hungry, and my "sex drive" completely disappeared. I lost 10 pounds, which is a lot at 15, and I couldn't stop thinking about suicide.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe I would have killed myself if the soccer season was cancelled. Luckily, I finally got to see my friends on weekdays. The comradery, grind, and fun that soccer brought saved me. I started feeling things other than depression again, and I began putting on weight again.</p>
<p>Soccer eventually ended, but I rode that high for a while. School is out for summer now, and I can feel myself dropping into a dark pit again. I try to stay occupied by filling almost every second of my day with work, and excercise, but when I quit pushing I can feel the depression creeping in. Cross country conditioning starts soon, so I am hopeful for that.</p>
<p>Online school is wrong. Kids younger than myself are losing important social growth time. People with mental problems, even slight ones, like my own, can feel devistating effects. This year was the worst one I have ever experienced, and when I see politicians pushing for another year of online school, I feel scared.</p>
<p>Please guys. Do everything you can to get us back in school. I can't take another year.</p></p>

        <p>As a music teacher who was so fucking miserable being online all year, I hear you and you are not alone. I have to filter myself around my students so I don’t get fired for expressing WrongThink but I refuse to teach online ever again.</p>
<p>I will also never support teachers’ unions that lobbied to keep schools closed.</p>

        <p>I saw this with my own son. He's 13 (12 when in-person school ended) and it hasn't been good for his mental health. 
As an adult, I'm sorry we (the collective we, not myself) did this to you. It's really, really messed up. It hurts my heart the way the reaction to this has hurt so many youth. You had a part of your life stolen from you, and it's not fair. </p>
<p>I don't know where you live, but where I live all mandates are lifted and school will resume in the fall with no mask requirements allowed, according to a bill signed by our state governor. I hope your leaders will make such a sensical move on your behalf. </p>
<p>Hang in there. I know it feels grim, but don't lose hope for things to turn around. Your positive attitude is the one thing they can't take from you if you don't allow it. Don't let them win.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you are going through this. You are not alone. This has impacted so many young people’s lives and you are absolutely right as online school caused so much isolation that young people prone to depression are really feeling the effects of the past year. Continue to stay busy both physically and mentally but most important Take it one day at a time. Don’t let the depressive thoughts creep up and overwhelm you. If you feel like you are in a really bad place please reach out to any of us here. Things will get better. It may take a little more time but it will. I know everyone in this group including myself are going to keep fighting for what’s right.</p>

        <p>I hear you. My work went 100% remote during covid, and to top it all off my wife divorced me. I was also contemplating suicide because I just felt so isolated.</p>
<p>Luckily, I reached out and joined some local hobby groups and made some new friends, but for a long time I was ready to just end it all. If school is still virtual I'd recommend co tinuing to look for extracurricular activities and groups outside of school that you can hang out with people IRL in.</p>

        <p>Two best things you can do to cure depression induced by loneliness:
1. Stop jerking off. This will make you overall more positive by regenerating testosterone to nominal levels and can help cure loneliness by instinctually motivating you to find a girlfriend.
2. Find an intellectual pursuit that doesn't require others and will help improve/satisfy your social, personal, and financial goals. Something like coding for example.</p>
