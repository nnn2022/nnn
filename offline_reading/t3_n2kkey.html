        <p>People being out of work isolated at home is what allowed everyone be force fed propaganda through their devices. Getting people out of their homes away from the devices is what will bring everyone back to their senses. Its the only way to unplug sleepers from the propaganda machine.</p>

        <p>You are spot on, and it, too, was part of the plan.</p>
<p>They shut off everything in life that I used to care about and love, and left me instead with a nasty Reddit addiction. And the hostile division between the oppressed and the oppressors has resulted in broken relationships between friends, family members... And the lockdowns made everyone less healthy.</p>
<p>It really is so incredibly sinister, and the degree to which most people are hypnotized is incredibly depressing.</p>
<p>Luckily we can turn off the screens and it all goes away... Except the plan which has been put into motion keeps accelerating, and there's no escaping that.</p>
<p>By the time people wake up and lose faith in the system - the powers that be will have a new system ready to usher in. Before you can replace an existing system, people must lose faith in the existing one... And that is what we are going through now.</p>
<p>I believe it's being set up, now, as a "Democratic thing" -- very loudly -- but in 4-8 years it will swing far in the other direction, which is unimaginable now... The problem is, the other side will continue to advance this agenda in their own way. I'm old enough now to have watched these fake opposition parties trade power back and forth my entire life, but we're always moving in the same direction overall.</p>

        <p>It's a good question. The future is always hard to imagine.</p>
<p>In 2001 or whenever it was... When we were hit with obvious lies about "Weapons of Mass Destruction" to justify an unnecessary war, and daily yellow, orange, red terror alerts that were obviously there to keep people in fear... And the PATRIOT Act, etc...</p>
<p>During that era --- which was driven by Republicans --- if you had told me:</p>
<p>"Yeah, in 20 years Democrats will take control. A fake 'insurrection' will be encouraged to happen and they'll use it to justify censorship on the internet. And they'll say there's a virus and that everyone's dying, but they'll just use the fact that there was a massive population boom 80 years ago and the life expectancy is \~79 so... They'll force masks on everyone, and it will be nonstop coverage daily about how businesses have to be forced closed and they'll shut down playgrounds and schools, and everyone will be forced indoors with lockdowns. And they'll come out with a scary new rushed vaccine and coercive policies to push it, with weird tracking and passport apps on our phones... And they'll just print trillions upon trillions of dollars and the situation they create will be so bad but they'll just send people thousands of dollars to buy them off so they'll go along with it" etc.</p>
<p>That would have been unimaginable. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>I am NOT predicting this, but in 4-8 years it could be widely known that we were held captive for a year for no reason, and DeSantis could be the next president. But then it would turn out of course that he's just part of the same scam that we've fallen for all our lives and they're onto the next big thing: AUSTERITY MEASURES to pay for the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Who knows! Only one thing is certain:</p>
<p>There will be some kind of "change" in the air except that it won't turn out to be change any of us want, and then that side will get kicked out of power so the other side goes in to also bring change we don't want.</p>
<p>The same cycle, decade after decade, as their class just gets wealthier and wealthier and we suffer more and more... As technology turns against us bit by bit.</p>
<p>And the "dollar?" Remember that ! LOL </p>
<p>We used to have these green paper things and everyone traded them for stuff! And some of them had bigger numbers on them so people would give you more for those!</p>

        <p>How is this powerful at all? You're saying a mask is akin to a cage. You act like masks prevent you from doing absolutely everything lol. I don't get that with you and your lot.

        <p>I try not to blame people for their inability to see what is going on. I understand that our schools teach compliance and conformity at the expense of critical thinking skills...</p>
<p>So I'll spell out what masks are really about.</p>
<p>If you notice, few people blame politicians and transnational corporations that benefit in terms of wealth or power from the lockdowns.</p>
<p>No, they blame people who don't wear masks. It's why the whole issue was politicized to begin with -- the anger people have over Trump was transferred into their feelings about Covid-19.</p>
<p>The combination of fear and hate absolutely short circuits most people's critical thinking skills, so they can't see the scapegoat propaganda for what it is.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a minority.</li>
<li>Do something terrible.</li>
<li>Blame the minority for the terrible thing you did.</li>
</ul>
<p>Governments and rising political leaders have done this throughout all history, and there's at least one example that you should already be thinking of.</p>
<p>That's what the masks are about. Instead of realizing the absurdity of lockdowns and mask policies, people get distracted with politicized "my team versus your team" arguments while we are effectively looted our freedoms and future wealth.</p>
<p>I mean, you can make rude little comments to people who know more about what's happening than you do -- or you can actually pay attention and learn something. Remember, you will be affected, too. Probably moreso than I will. The worse off you are economically the more painful your future will be.</p>
<p>Think in terms of lifelong debt, dead end jobs, and no ability to have the nice life many of us elders have been able to enjoy. And if I'm wrong about assuming you're a kid based on your language and inability to express yourself coherently --- then it's your children and future children who will suffer from what has been put into motion now. If you're lucky to have a successful family at all.</p>
<p>Turning it into a joke and ridiculing those who try to warn you doesn't make it go away. Again, odds are you will suffer most.</p>

        <p>I’m confused at the parallels being drawn here. Mask mandates are as debilitating as a cage is to a bird?  </p>
<p>Is life so easy that the hill you choose to die on is the mask one? Or even lockdowns? Yes , both are shitty and the messaging around both has been super inconsistent . But I don’t understand the intensity with which you guys cling to your stance . </p>
<p>Is it because you fear the slippery slope? First masks and lockdowns , then more and more? I’m genuinely curious.</p>
<p>The religious vigor people have about this is the exact same as those on the opposing side. I feel like people have lost meaning in their lives so they now fill that void with this type of stuff.</p>

        <p>It is all infringing on the rights of all of us. The longer you take to push back on these infringements that harder it is to reverse. They have already taken the right to peaceably assemble away (see churches still not allowed to gather at full capacity).</p>

        <p>No because those things wont be reversed until we push to have them reversed. Until we pressure our elected officials to end this scharade this will continue. It started as two week and its been over a year. They make up new excuses to expand their power at every turn. </p>

        <p>So my question to you is how is the government benefiting from people wearing masks? You lot claim this is 'tyranny' but what I struggle to understand is how being forced to wear a mask in public is 'tyranny' or overstepping on 'rights?' In your mind, what is the government getting out of this?</p>

        <p>The masks are the bare minimum of this. The real dangers are the restrictions of your freedoms to assemble and to run your businesses and live your life. All that has been stripped from us in the last year. Our elders have been forced to die alone in nursing homes without seeing their families in order to “protect” them. They still got covid and still died anyway. The mask is just the daily visual reminder you see of all of this security theatre. It does nothing to help you. Wash your hands and keep your distance if you want to actually be effective in protecting yourself.</p>

        <p>Right, masks are just some psychological reminder that you're not in control. Thanks for explaining your delusions to me! I understand where you all are coming from now.</p>
<p>Also, several Republican states, such as Florida, have just ratified legislation which says you will not be criminally charged if you run over peaceful protestors for any cause. It could either be it BLM or Pro-Trump. How's that for rescinding the right to assemble?</p>

<p>I can sort-of understand that position, but only to a point . It just seems like such a small issue to be so passionate about. It’s similar to those on the left that take the smallest phrase or sound bite from a talking head and then act like that person is the most abhorrent, vile human alive . </p>

        <p>Be a leftist</p>
<p>You kneel and beg black people for forgiveness for a past you had nothing to do with and support and cheer them on while they riot and loot for an entire year. You say trans people are biologically the opposite sex they were born as. You damn conservatives for having old fashioned ideals like morals and values systems. You denounce police officers while holding up criminals as saints. You happily give up your freedom and rabidly obey Daddy Government for a flu with a 99.7% survival rate. You turn on your fellow citizens, friends, and family for disagreeing with you in the slightest. Murdering unborn children is an iron right that can never be questioned but not wanting to wear a mask that does nothing immediately makes you a heartless murderer.</p>
<p>Doublespeak, doublethink, and feelings over facts or logic. This is your modern leftist.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns were the very first measure implemented like 5 months before anyone was even ever told to wear a mask. Back when Fauci was telling people to not wear masks. You absolute fucking potato.</p>

        <p>All you have to do is go through this guys post history to see that he his brain does not process information like ours. His feeds him nothing but fear and anger. He’s not capable of listening to any rationale, his brain is broken. There’s nothing we can do about these types of people, you just have to allow them scream their anti-mask bs into the abyss. It’s the only way to keep your sanity. These people are lost, and they will insist to you, insult you and demean you in order to convince you that they aren’t. It’s not worth it.</p>

        <p>Because it’s better than getting the virus, you people think “oh it’s just the flu it’s not gonna do shit to me” coronavirus literally punches holes in your lungs like they’re in a shooting range, even if you survive, it’s not gonna be a nice life afterwards. I understand not taking it YET because it’s potentially unsafe but that doesn’t mean it won’t ever be effective or that the virus doesn’t do shit</p>

        <p>Are you braindead or something? Have you followed the news, at all? Of course people have died from the vaccine. Here is a report, scroll down and search for ''Todesfälle" which means Death cases in German, (I'm from Germany), you can translate that bit yourself since you're so skeptical. <a href="https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-bis-02-04-21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-bis-02-04-21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4</a></p>

<p>Page 11/20 "Todesfälle" / Death cases</p>
<p>(translated quote)</p>
<p>The Paul Ehrlich Institute was notified of 407 deaths in vaccinated persons aged 24 to 102 years. The median age was 85 years, and the mean age was 82 years. The temporal association between vaccination and the fatal event varied from less than one hour to 40 days after vaccination. 321 deaths involved persons who had been vaccinated with Comirnaty. In 60 reported deaths, it was not clear which COVID-19 vaccine had been used. In seven cases, persons died after vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine Moderna, and in 19 cases, persons died after vaccination with Vaxzevria.</p>

        <p>I don't care if you speak spanish, vaccine-death denier. Here's evidence and now you're trying to seriously the debate 'the importante of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute'? I wonder how many times you'll change the main topic when it was all about proving whether vaccines have killed people before or not. In case you don't know, vaccines have been the cause of death of many people even before the Covid one, but go ahead and deny facts. Just do it.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it is your choice, but how would you feel if the people around you got sick and died or left the hospital with debilitating, life long, permanent lung damage all because you’re too much of a pompous asshole to get a shot in your arm.

        <p>Around 50 million or more people die yearly. I don't think you whined, bitched and moaned about that prior to Covid. So, in a natural process, I really don't give a fuck, I'm not responsible for anyone but myself. </p>

        <p>3 million deaths, that’s 6% of global deaths, now I know that doesn’t sound like a lot since you’re missing 90% of your brain matter but 6% of 50 million is a huge number, from an easily preventable disease with a now easily accessible cure. How fucking inconsiderate of you, especially when you say “I’m only responsible for myself” so you don’t give a shit if your family got COVID from you and nearly died or did die? Also I don’t fucking care if you’re a woman, stupid people are stupid people, man, woman, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, fuckin Martian. I don’t care, stupid is stupid, echo chambers are echo chambers</p>

We're 7,7 BILLION people on earth. 3 million is roughly 0.04% of the WORLD POPULATION. You absolute fucking moron, I'm actually laughing rn holy shit ahaha. </p>
<p>Go to your own echo chambers, you idiot. Get your vaccine and face the side effects, do whatever you want, I genuinely don't care, die or whatever 😂😂</p>

        <p>This only makes you more inconsiderate. 0.04 percent of 7.7 billion is 3 million deaths. 3 million men, women, and children. Stop fucking comparing this to 8 billion and just think about 3 million people. PEOPLE, HUMAN BEINGS, PEOPLE JUST LIKE US, how many families were broken apart, how many parents lost children, how many children lost parents, how many sons lost fathers, how many daughters lost mothers, get your head out of your ass and think about that number not just as a statistic, but as real people that once lived and now died partly because of you and people like you. Have some humility why don’t you? Go to those funerals and tell those people that their loss didn’t matter because “durrr 3 million of 7.7 billion isn’t a lot durrr”. How would you feel if your closest relatives died because because of a disease you don’t think matters in the long run.</p>

        <p>No you fuck off, your not caring of anyone besides you really says a lot about your enlarged ego “I’m such a hero because I refuse to wear a mask and I refuse to confront the consequences”. You don’t feel for them because you’re a cold, uncaring person who doesn’t give a fuck if they killed someone by being a pompous asshole. You refuse to look at the consequences of your actions and you just swat them away with excuses “You’re a fascist” “these people are sheep” “I’m the one who’s right” “these deaths don’t affect me” </p>

<p>You are pretty judgemental yourself, you fucking piece of shit. I can't go to a funeral of a person who died of COVID because.. guess.. what... I DON'T FUCKING KNOW ANYONE, NOR DO MY FRIENDS KNOW ANYONE, NOR DO THEIR FRIENDS KNOW ANYONE WHO DIED OF IT.</p>
<p>For a virus that has 99% survival rate, you're sure being quite a bitch about it. I hope you actually catch it and die, and not just recover from it. I'm so tired of people like you. You literally don't know who I am and where I'm from, whether I wear a mask or not. LOL We are FORCED to wear masks, welcome to the totalitarian world state, it's not a fucking choice. </p>
<p>Get your vaccine, and gladly fuck off :)</p>
