    <strong>Witnessed New Stupidity This Weekend</strong>
    <p><p>I had a wedding this weekend in Houston, texas and for the most part - it seemed actually pretty normal. Most people were not wearing masks at the ceremony and reception. I, a Groomsman did not wear a mask all weekend. </p>
<p>That encouragement quickly ended at the reception. I witnessed SEVERAL people wearing their mask at the reception. They’d move the mask down to take a sip of their drink or bite of their food and bring the mask back up shortly after. </p>
<p>One female in particular was on the dance floor where it’s hot, sweaty and filled with people. She had her mask on, move it down to drink and then put it back up. What’s the point of doing this besides advertising to the world you have a low iq?</p>
<p>This stupidity will never end with morons like this.</p></p>

        <p>As far as im concerned that person wearing a mask has every right to do so even if its completely stupid to do so and makes her look stupid. When they ask us to follow them and also look stupid thats where i have a problem.</p>

        <p>I also had my wedding at the weekend. Our guests were specifically instructed not to wear masks. Barely anybody wore one. It was the first time I have seen somebody's face, other than my wife's, in person for more than a year. Seeing faces again after so long felt incredible. </p>
<p>It was also interesting to see how differently this 'pandemic' is perceived outside of Manila. </p>
<p>In Manila, it seems as though 99% of the people I encounter completely believe that this is the deadliest virus in history and their masks are the only thing preventing them from dropping dead in the streets. People recoil in horror if they see someone lower their mask to drink, make huge swerves to maintain 'social distancing' when walking past someone, yell at people if their mask is below their nose, etc.</p>
<p>In the provinces, nobody gives a crap and the streets are full of people not wearing masks. </p>
<p>Most of the people I saw wearing masks out there were either cyclists or motorcyclists, none of which were wearing helmets...</p>

        <p>Houston, Texas too. I’m still bitter about my wedding pictures back in December 2020 having a masked bridesmaid. Planning on having the reception in Nov 2021 and I sure as hell am not gonna be accommodating to ANYONE who wants us to follow covid protocols.</p>

        <p>Haha hope you like Indian food then. The venue lady said the same thing you did about people being anal for masks BUT DANCING WAS NO PROBLEM ....SWEAT AND ALL... since covid doesn’t transfer. Makes no bloody sense. They had many weddings so far this year and everybody wanted social distanced tables, masks and yet removed them at the bar and for dancing. WTH LOL</p>

        <p>Had my wedding last weekend, and no one wore masks or anything like that. We had some in case folks wanted them. My wife’s uncle wore one in to the reception, and then realized no one else was so he tossed it. However, this is Midwest Missouri and we really haven’t done a lot of lockdown stuff or any mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Ultimately it is virtue signaling. People can make others think that they are a good person by wearing their masks and showing off getting the vaccine. But in reality they are doing absolutely nothing and just trying to bolster their own ego and make themselves look good. It’s one of the highest forms of narcissism that there is.</p>

        <p>One way to reverse the play media is using against us, isn’t it those who aren’t vaccinated and wearing masks prolonging herd immunity? If masks do prevent transmission and they haven’t vaccinated. They are.</p>
