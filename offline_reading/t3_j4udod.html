        <p>I think a lot of people on Reddit should probably be more worried about underlying mental health issues rather than a virus with a 99.7 percent survival rate.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For the record, I'm not discounting all those stories, but there are more than a few that come across as nothing more than attention seeking.</p>

        <p>Anybody who is grieving gets to the blame stage, and unfortunately the governments have made it easy and encouraged us to blame it on the general public and masks. </p>
<p>These people are reacting emotionally (as expected), and so are not able to see that people will get the virus whether there's a mask involved or not. </p>
<p>When its cold and flu season, I dont ever recall anybody stating the time and place they caught it. Its always been just one of those things where its doing its rounds and if youre lucky you won't catch it. Theres never been a blame game. 
If covid is more contagious than the cold and flu - then there should be even less of a chance of blame on a particular person. </p>
<p>Also, am I wrong in thinking that at the start of all of this hand washing was promoted as the most important thing. Due to the fact that the virus enters your body from your hands when you touch your face? 
If that is the case, arent the people who catch it the ones who gave it to themselves? Unless of course somebody deliberately coughs directly into their face.</p>

        <p>I think people should be asking about people‚Äôs long term side effects of the lockdowns and masks. I know lots of people suffering from those. I firmly believe a lot of people make up horror stories about covid for virtue points. It‚Äôs trendy at this point. That‚Äôs why people get awards and upvotes for making it sound like a certain death sentence and you know people do that for meaningless karma. </p>
<p>Of course you know on Reddit everyone would say they have enjoyed all this nonsense and it should last forever and everyone they know loves it too. </p>
<p>One of my friends on Facebook has an uncle that committed suicide over all this, but she‚Äôs a pro mask and lockdown fanatic. She‚Äôs refusing to admit they had any part in his suicide. She‚Äôs been posting suicide prevention fundraisers right alongside stay at home and don‚Äôt interact with anyone bullshit. It makes me so mad. People like her are the ones who killed him and they‚Äôre refusing to take any responsibility and still see themselves as ‚Äúheroes‚Äù. I can‚Äôt ever speak to her again. It‚Äôs unforgivable. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm personally seeing way more suicides than any virus deaths or long term consequences. It‚Äôs making me hate so many people.</p>
