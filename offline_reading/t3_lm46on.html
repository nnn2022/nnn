    <strong>This is simply for discussion and not meant to offend anyone.</strong>
    <p><p>Guys look, we all know this lock down sucks and I miss doing certain things really badly, but why so much hate on the masks and people who wear them. I wear one and it’s not a big deal. I forget it’s on when I’ve been wearing it. I just recently had covid and it really really sucked. I’m still very very tired and don’t have taste or smell back yet and I’m considered young and healthy. I don’t smoke, rarely drink, and have a pretty basic diet. Covid knocked me out for a whole week and its hard to eat and I have to force myself to because food is off putting to me when it tastes like nothing. When I drink Diet Coke it is like seltzer. My government literally payed me to stay home for 2 weeks and I didn’t have to use sick pay or vacation, that was nice of them, so I’ll continue to wear a mask and still won’t think they have bad intentions with the mask rules and regulations.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah but it effects other people with the choices you make. If it was completely harmless then I’d say go for it, but it does effect other people and makes them uncomfortable when you don’t wear one when you’re in a close vicinity.</p>

        <p>This narrative is exactly why it turns into "hate" as you put it my friend.</p>
<p>There are a shed load of studies showing that masks do very little to protect from or prevent transmission. In surgery they are used to stop fluid transfer basically (i.e. sneezing).</p>
<p>This whole thing, of having ones freedoms curtailed "for the greater good" is the marching song of tryanny.</p>
<p>If one is at risk, wear a respirator and NBC suit. Take responsibility, and/or be supported in that by the government.</p>
<p>Most people are not at risk from this virus in any meaningful way. So we get dragged into compliance "for the good of others" which the science doesn't even back up.</p>
<p>Here in the UK we've been wearing facemasks for months. On the rare occasions I get out to a store. I'm overwhelming the only one not wearing a mask. Wearing a mask or taking part in our third national lockdown has done little to prevent the so called spread (which in reality is due to sexed up death numbers - ons exaggerating figure by as much as 50% AND PCR tests on 40+ cycles which are notoriously inaccurate).</p>
<p>For the greater good, to do it to care for others is bullshit. It's a narrative that makes it easy to feel virtuous for following guidelines that make no difference. And are simply part of the vehicle being used to strip us of our freedoms and liberties that make worth living... Permanently.</p>
<p>The hate comes when we have no choice. I can respect people wanting to wear a mask, or take the vaccine for their own reasons. But don't push that BS that I don't have that same choice because what about all the grandmas I'm killing.</p>
<p>Respect our right to say no, and we'll respect your right to say yes.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

        <p>Most people who advocate for wearing masks think that their perfectly fine experience is the only experience that could possible exist for anyone. Truth is, those with mental health conditions have been absolutely forgotten about the past year. There’s no more awareness and advocacy because it’s not trendy right now — masks are. People with PTSD, like myself, may not be able to wear one for various reasons. Psychological health isn’t inferior to physical health.</p>
<p>The emotional manipulation tactics perpetuated by the media and then regurgitated by mask advocates doesn’t help either.</p>

        <p>I was hoping someone would mention mental health on this post.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with panic disorder when I was 15. It's severe enough that I can't drive or work a lot of jobs. Feeling confined triggers panic attacks. Wearing "just a cloth" for more than a few minutes makes me feel nauseous and smothered. </p>
<p>I'm allowed to wear a plastic shield at work and have my face out like normal when the store is empty. If people are opposed to that, I don't care. They don't have to buy from this gift shop. It's a non-essential business. If people are traveling and shopping for knicknacks, I assume they've accepted the risk.</p>

        <p>I don't care about or have any disdain towards people who wear masks. It really doesn't bother me. If you want to do so, feel free.</p>
<p>My issue is with people who wear masks, and flip shit on those who don't, who demand that every person and business be as terrified and paranoid as they are. My issue is with those who think governments need to mandate mask-wearing in public, no matter the circumstance. My issue is with the people who wear masks who think that those who don't wear a dirty old piece of cloth over their mouth (that could very well be more harmful than no mask) are lesser beings who deserve no respect and fully deserve any harm brought upon them.</p>
<p>Live your life, and I'll live mine. Take your precautions, I'll take mine. Win-win.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that you're here for a civil discussion. I understand everything you're saying and I will defend to the death your right to wear a mask whenever and wherever you want to, you can even wear 2 or 3!</p>
<p>My problem comes into play when the government tells me I have to wear something on my face by law or risk a fine, getting throw out of a store... etc. Even if it's something I believe is beneficial like wearing a winter hat when it's freezing outside or washing your hand before eating, the government has no authority to force me to wear something. </p>
<p>Incidentally I don't think they're as effective as people think they are, reverend Fauci said so himself, then later also reiterated that asymptomatic spread is not at all something that's common (which is the whole idea for masking perfectly healthy people), and also the data comparing places where it's mandated vs those where it isn't shows zero differences, in most of the cases the unmasked people actually do better.</p>

        <p>do not say things like " we all know " , it's as  useless as "experts say" and "studies show".</p>
<p>we don't "hate" anyone exercising their free choice to wear a rag over their face as if it does anything.</p>

        <p>I‘ll do my best to explain and be nice, first off.. You didn’t have Covid, Covid is not real. You either had a bad common cold or the flu. They are using the PCR test to justify people have Covid when they don’t. The PCR test was not designed to determine if someone has a virus. If they use a high cycle, it will always come out positive. They know this and recently have come out stating they were using to high of a cycle. <br>
It‘s something many of us have been saying for the past year but were called stupid conspiracy theorist. They closed down the economies, made us all stay home and told us a deadly virus is infecting everyone and killing so many. <br>
It was all BS</p>
<p>Those with the common cold or flu were lied to and told it‘s Covid, and people believe it because they made the symptoms the same. Plus, you take the PCR test and it comes out positive you automatically trust what they tell you... Yet fruit, coke and animals have tested positive so the PCR is crap.</p>
<p>As for mask, I myself feel knowing all I do above that mask are not necessary and pointless. They want everyone in mask because if they keep you in them long enough it lowers your immune system. You are breathing back in your own CO2 plus bacteria that builds up inside the mask and slowly making yourself weak and sick.</p>
<p>The media and governments will tell you otherwise and people use the excuse “but surgeons wear mask for long periods of time” yes.. But they are in sterile rooms and not reaching up to adjust or touch their mask all the time. Normal people constantly touch their face, adjust the mask and put it off and on. This causes it to get dirty and bacteria to grow. Not to mention people sweat and that gets all over it. Just imagine what your breathing in?!</p>
<p>It‘s also like a Satanic ritual, where they want all faces covered so you can see no ones expression and feel depressed. Everyone walks around looking the same afraid to be near others. They have created a population of paranoid people not wanting to socialize normally anymore. Now they even want people to wear 2 or more mask!</p>
<p>If people keep complying, they’ll just continue to make more restrictions and before you know it.. They’ll be telling us to wear goggles and rubber gloves and 4 mask.</p>
<p>I have not worn a mask since March 2020 and go out in public daily around 1,000’s of people. I have seen no one sick, no one collapsing or dying. I myself have not been sick and I’m in Japan.. A country where you couldn’t social distance even if you wanted to.   </p>
<p>Hope that answers your questions.</p>

        <p>My issue is that I don't care what one wants to do if they choose to wear a mask or not, at the end of the day if they are convinced it works for them and keeps them safe, more power to them... the issue starts when I'm forced to wear one against my own will and if I don't I am not allowed to participate in society and I'm shamed for it, that's where my problem with it lays, I don't give a fuck what someone else wants to do with their own life... give others the right to choose for themselves.</p>

        <p>but you didn't die did you?  I've been sick for two weeks and didn't die.  So when I got well I got up and went out and lived my life trying to find as much fun and joy in it as I could understanding the fact that at any time and at any moment something that could happen through no fault of my own or more likely fault of my own could kill me.  I'd rather live my life and grab as much joy, fun, and happiness, and spread just as much, than die while I'm standing up, capable of breathing, and and capable of moving around under my own power.</p>
