    <strong>Cuomo murdered one of my grandfathers. Then the vaccine murdered the other.</strong>
    <p><p>My father's father was living in Brooklyn and was healthy as a horse in February, 2020. At 93 he would walk to the corner store to get his own groceries, would go to church daily, and would go play cards every Wednesday in Queens. He loved to get out of the house. He died on April 7 of a heart attack, about 3 weeks after the lock down began. We noticed something had been off for a few weeks. The worry killed him.</p>
<p>My mother's father was living in a nursing home here in Florida about 15 miles from where I am right now. He was healthy at 89 - wheelchair bound yes, but vitals good. He received the Covid vaccine during the 3rd week of December. He died of a stroke in his sleep on January 6. There was no evidence of foul play, head trauma, etc.</p>
<p>I have some severe health problems myself, and I'll take a bullet before I take the vaccine. And quite frankly it's appalling that anyone I know has even asked me. Imagine if I started badgering men who have too much sex to get a vasectomy because they are contributing to STD's that might come and get me. This idea permeates everywhere, I've been in poor health lately and been told "ask your doctor before stopping this medication", leaving open the possibility that your doctor will tell you to keep taking a poison. Nah, I'll just stop and tell him when I get around to it, thanks.</p></p>

        <p>My condolences for your losses brother. My best friend's father passed back in July due to isolation induced depression in Brooklyn. Very young, very sad. We are social beings, it's not optional.</p>

<p>My Mom’s stroke was caused by being bed bound in the icu, she developed a blood clot that dislodged and traveled upon movement. Being wheelchair bound can lead to formation of a blood clot and once you have a blood clot or a DVT, then it’s a ticking time bomb without any medical intervention. </p>
<p>To be fair, my aunt has also had a blood clot in her leg for over 10 years without having a stroke or pulmonary embolism so it’s not always a quick killer.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for you loss, my friend. </p>
<p>But making those statements we fall for the same bad “logic” the brainwashed ones when they call everything a covid death. </p>
<p>I agree your suspecting btw, but we can’t forget they are suspecting. They were old and we need to be prepared always. </p>
<p>The sad part is your family didn’t saying the last goodbye and I fear they even lived their last days alone (hope not).</p>
