        <p>I love how every nations that has a group of people who love their country are far right. If you fly a flag I bet most Americans think you voted Trump and not that you love America.</p>

        <p>Every article I've clicked on today has had some paraphrased version of "despite rising cases". How much longer can they keep rising for?</p>

        <p>Well Hungary has 524k cases and 9.7M population, highest per day was 9444 cases. If we assume for every reported case there is 1 unreported and daily infections stay this high, Hungary will run out of people to infect in.... 458 days, which is more than a year </p>

<p>(9.7million-524 thousand)/(20 thousand)</p>

<p>It's sad how they started their lockdown on 1st Sept (banning travel), but that wasn't nearly as close to "worst" situation, basically proves measures are useless and corona spreads whether there is lockdown or not <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DZrFmc9.png">https://i.imgur.com/DZrFmc9.png</a></p>

        <p>Wow, that graph is very revealing. And your logic with the stats are spot on. Are you from Hungary? I'm curious how the locals there feel about this. I grew up speaking Hungarian here in Canada, but barely uttered a word of the language in decades. Travelling around the country has been on my bucketlist and I wish I'd done it before this transformation. Even once/if it ends, the local establishments will be devastated and closed.</p>

        <p>I'm from Croatia (country next to it), but I've been doing weekend trips to Budapest whole summer last year. I haven't been in Budapest since September due to borders closing but last time I asked locals no one really cared about corona, I asked them if they're scared most of them said no or didn't really have opinion about it. Friends I talk to online are annoyed but no one is annoyed as me it seems.</p>
<p>I just want borders to open because I have lots of friends that I want to visit in Serbia and cousins&amp;family in Bosnia and I don't see how closing borders helps anything since we all have same covid strain. It's really funny how one of my close friends was not giving a fuck about strict lockdowns in Serbia (they're pretty lax now tho) but now when he wants to leave country to meet girl he met online he's furious that he can't leave country or get vaccinated for passport..</p>

        <p>Since September? Incredible. I don't know what they're trying to accomplish at that point; it had already been circulating for several months so who are they kidding with closing it in the first place? It's like putting on a condom months after she's pregnant. </p>
<p>Hope you get to visit those people soon.</p>
