    <p><p>“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”</p>
<p>That's all I ask of you before downvoting me into oblivion or calling me names. Entertain these possibilities as if they were true and evaluate with an open mind. If you parse through all this material and still believe vaccines saved humanity, then I respect your opinion and support your right to have it and express it freely. With that said, I find it very difficult to have any sort of positive affirmations towards vaccines after learning of their unedited history (big pharma has contrived our perceptions and history books HEAVILY), how horrible the evidence is that supports their safety and efficacy and how many other better explanations we had for sickness (Polio and DDT is one of many examples), and the abhorrent scientists, corporations, and institutions that developed them, many being open eugenicists with a penchant for racism and the extermination of minorities.</p>
<p>I was originally in a similar camp before the start of 2020. I thought some vaccines were necessary and saved lives, but all the new vaccines added to the list after pharma was granted legal immunity were the problem. I rationalized that it was just the volume of injections increasing the toxin exposure via adjuvants, and the adverse reactions were rare in select individuals, like those with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or stunted detoxification systems due to variable factors. After deeper investigation into the long list of adjuvants used in vaccines and the terrifying research behind their toxicity and mechanisms of action and reactivity, the only conclusion that I could come to was that they are extremely nefarious and willfully malicious, and specifically designed to transport lipid suspended nano-particle heavy metals like aluminum past the blood brain barrier and into your brain, among many other detrimental immunological responses. The evidence supporting that claim is so clear and undeniable, that I cannot see how there isn't a worldwide revolt against all vaccinations and riots for how they sickened, maimed, and killed millions, if not billions of people in their historical use in entirety. Vaccines have generated tremendous profit for the medical system, and perhaps that was the intent all along. If you read the flexner report, which is what birthed our modern westernized medical system, they outright tell you that. They didn't want to cure people for good and focus on lifestyle or diet, but instead they wanted to perpetually treat people with toxic medications that generate more side effects and symptoms, which keeps you coming back and forking over hard earned dollars into a system that does not care about your health. Perpetual profit off of human suffering is their business model. Goes without saying that not everyone is "in on it". Most doctors have good intentions and are just doing what they're taught and told, while sometimes being forcefully silenced and threatened with losing livelihood and career if they speak their truth. We've seen many examples of this since the plandemic started</p>
<p>Has anyone else looked at current disease statistics and their trajectory and growth? The scale of sickness and suffering that humanity as a whole is enduring right now is deeply unsettling and hard to truly comprehend. Cancer, heart disease, autism, autoimmune conditions, pain problems, neurological issues, mental health, etc. So many people are sick and now allergic to various foods, knowingly or unknowingly, and those same foods and components of them are coincidentally in many vaccines - those being egg proteins, animal cells from pigs/cows/chickens/etc, lactose, gelatin, and countless others.</p>
<p>The logic and scientific evidence is very simple to understand. If you take a dead/inactivated/modified virus, add aluminum, antibacterials, preservatives, egg proteins, and other toxic adjuvants, and then inject it into someone's bloodstream (where they should NEVER be), their body will generate immune memory to those compounds and proteins, and respond accordingly when exposed to or consumed. Foods that we've been eating for all of our evolutionary history are now generating complex autoimmune responses that most people would never associate with something they ate. Conditions like chronic fatigue, brainfog, digestive upset, migraines, and everything in between. We're so used to all this issues now that we don't think it's unusual anymore. It's become the norm and nearly everyone is dealing some sort of symptoms on a regularly basis, and we never associate it with the possibility that it was the flu shot you got a year ago that gave you such reactions to food.</p>
<p>The CDC and government have all this data available and could put this argument to bed in a day if they gave unbiased researchers access to said data and let them run models to detail health outcomes with the vaccinated vs unvaccinated, but they refuse to provide it, even after dozens of lawsuits have tried through discovery - Childrens health defense fund and ICAN have been battling for over a decade to get this info. The best we have is comparisons between the amish and the general public, and that shows the amish are multiple orders of magnitude more healthy than us without vaccinations.</p>
<p>What's even more insane is that there is no vaccine study in history where they compare the vaccine to an inert saline placebo. They always compare with another vaccine, generally the MMR. They've also never completed studies on the accumulative dose of aluminum in all vaccines together if following the complete schedule.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but I don't want to make this post too long with walls of text. I hope you approach this information with an open mind and heart, and try to see the scale of lies, inversion, subterfuge, corruption, and genuine evil that underlines much of our modern world and especially our modern medical system. Medical errors are now the 3rd leading cause of death, and you can argue that with how we treat heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, the medical system is responsible for those deaths in part as well. Humanity is going extinct at the current rates of disease and infertility, so if you do end up on the same page and see the bigger picture, spread the word as far as you can so we can survive and move into a happier and healthier world without living under the thumb of fascist eugenicist technocrats. It's survival of the wisest now. &lt;3</p>

        <p>Hey OP, I have been a 100% anti-vaxxer for more than a decade and must say that I am bitterly disappointed that people haven't questioned what other SettledScienceTM is really pseudoscience. Do people really think that .gov, Big Pharma and neo-Malthusian eugenicists did not exist prior to 2020 and that this is the first time they are pulling this heist on a global scale?</p>
<p>If you dare ask questions, you'll hear the banal, "WhAt AbOuT PoLiO, MeAsLeS, WhOoPiNg CoUGh, DiPtHeRiA, TuBeRcUlOsIs?" and "Do YoU tAkE aSpRiN fOr PaIn ToO?" rebuttals.</p>
<p>I get tired of hearing my own voice on this sub when it comes to my anti-vaxx stance, and am delighted to hear someone else state the obvious.</p>
<p>That said, anti-vaxx CoNsPiRaCiEs should be put aside for the sake of the current threat to the human population: C19 experivaxxes.</p>

<p>I was pro-BigPharma, RX drugs and vaxxes until I was a teen who discovered the horrors of Pfizer in Nigeria with its Trovan trials. I asked a simple question as a kid, "What else have they been hiding?" Anyone who has critical thinking skills should ask the very same thing.</p>

        <p>Exactly this. When corporations like pfizer have a consistent track record of creating fake evidence, manipulating via marketing, willfully killing for profit (proven in court, paid massive billion $ fine), and being generally corrupt to the core, I cannot understand at any level how people still have trust in future products and what they say tomorrow. Literal definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. The result is always the same. They lie, sicken/maim/kill, make profit, pay off regulators, pay small fine in comparison to profit, and then do it again and again. "Things are better now" - Things are far worse than most can imagine.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's blaringly obvious if you take the time to investigate with an open mind. </p>
<p>For putting aside talking about all vaccinations, I completely disagree and I must have a different approach and mentality that some of the others in this comment section. You guys think that talking about all vaccines is some sort of detraction, when I consider it undeniable supporting evidence of past transgressions that show how many times they've done this to us. It was much harder to know and see the corruption pre-internet, but now all the information is easily available to anyone see. Elucidating how vaccines have been a disaster since the beginning is way more powerful than just saying the COVID vaxx is bad. They shouldn't been separated and instead combined along with other undeniable facts in regards to our medical system being corrupt and not in the best interest of human health, only profit. </p>
<p>If we fail to understand the real history, then we are doomed to repeat it.</p>

        <p>Why be concerned with optics when innumerable amounts of people are suffering as a result of vaccines? If this info changes just 1 persons mind not to get their kid vaccinated, then that is a win in my book and worth whatever backlash it entails. The COVID vaccine has brought massive attention to the topic of vaccine safety, and is all the more reason to illuminate further on what previous vaccines have done to people and how horrible it's been for all our health. </p>
<p>If you wanna censor yourself and keep certain opinions or facts silent just because you think condemning all vaccines is an "unwise diversion", then that's on you. This is exactly the mentality they want to box us into, and I'm not having it. I'm gunna speak my truths freely and happily with no fear of how people will perceive or respond to it. You give them power thinking like that. </p>

        <p>How does that make me a shill.... :\ really? It was a good comparison about how people look past evil because its socially/societally inconvenient and uncomfortable. </p>
<p>I know people can't un-do vaccines, but I dunno why that's relevant. They can still become better educated on the topic and never get another, or convince a friends/family member not to. It matters. What starts as a ripple effect where only 10% of the population is against all vaccines, can turn into a tsunami where the majority is against them. Then things can change for the better.</p>
<p>That's a good goal to have and definitely important in the current moment, but we should still take advantage of the attention towards vaccine safety and look towards the past to see the same inversions, lies, marketing, and willful negligence towards our health and well being. </p>
<p>If we equivocate and ignore past transgressions, then we're set to repeat them in the future. We went through this with the polio vaccine, swine flu vaccine, and many others, but people end up forgetting and get tied up in the same nonsense in the present moment and don't hold them accountable to factual history and evidence.</p>

        <p>You prevail against this tyranny by showing people how many times they've lied, willfully killed for profit, contrived research, and put us through this exact playbook, which gives us important historical context and precedent that better educate futures decisions. </p>
<p>You lose against tyranny by self censoring out of fear of social ostracization and "bad optics", which those committing the tyranny orchestrated and structured in the first place. </p>
<p>We can fix this world with only 2 actions. What you spend your money on and what you give your attention to. </p>
<p>If you think stopping just the COVID vaccine is gunna make us prevail against this tyranny, then you're naive. It goes far beyond vaccination and is a spider web of corruption and inversion in many many things.</p>

<p>We have many immediate crisis'. Cancer is a big one, and they put Sv-40 a millions of vaccines several decades ago that caused cancer.

<p>The entire topic of vaccination matters, and the COVID vaxx is included in that.

        <p>In America alone over 600,000 people have died from covid in a little over a year and a half. polio at its height in the 1940s was killing or paralysing a half million people worldwide per year. In 1957 polio vaccines brought the annual number of polio cases from 58000 down to 5600 cases. By 1961 America was down to 161 cases per year. The last paralysis in America due to polio was in 1979. Basically this shit is killing almost as much in just America as polio was doing worldwide at its prime. And that is in a supposed first world country with a modern healthcare system. </p>
<p>Stop thinking of this as a flu when is is more serious than polio was at its prime. Realise this shit won't go away by doing nothing. If this virus isn't wiped out completely it will continue to kill hundreds of thousands a year.</p>
<p>People are having their lives runined well guess what many times more people are actually dying due to this . So what of there's a small portion with allergies who can't take it. If everyone else takes it then they have nothing to worry about that should be enough to stop the virus. Bit there are so many selfish unpatriotic people who don't care about anyone else and aren't getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Patriotism is doing what's best for your country. You are letting something continue to kill hundreds of thousands of people in your country while not doing anything to help stop it. If another country killed 600,000 Americans you would go to war against them why should this virus be any different but instead you aren't even doing the most basic thing to support the fight against it. And If you are idiotic enough to say they don't have the right to tell you to get it. let me remind you America has a draft. If this was a country killing Americans you would be forced to fight. Instead you are simply being told to get a vacation and you aren't even willing to do that to help</p>

        <p>So much to unpack here. There is a lot of koolaid you need to spit out first though. </p>
<p>First, that 600k death number is contrived and inaccurate. RT-PCR cycle threshold was too high for 99% of the pandemic, not to mention the guy who invented the RT-PCR said explicitly it should not be used to diagnose people with any illness. So on this alone, we can't put any value into those numbers. What we can look towards though is total mortality statistics, and they are exactly the same as they were in the previous 5 years. If this was a true pandemic, the number of deaths across the board would be much higher. We also had 0 flu cases in 2020 because they just stopped testing for it. If you think it was masks and hand sanitizers that lowered the flu numbers, I have a bridge to sell you on the moon and a helmet for your protection. </p>
<p>Second, Polio is not caused by a virus and was instead caused by the spraying of DDT everywhere and on everyone. They were literally spraying it on babies, from planes, on the streets, on cattle feed, genuinely everything because the science was settled that it was "safe" at the time. The symptoms for DDT poisoning are EXACTLY the same as polio. Go to duckduckgo, search polio and ddt in images, and look at the graphs correlating the amount of DDT used and the incidence rate of what they called polio. Polio was already at an all time low when the vaccine was released because DDT was banned, but yet pharma and Jonas Salk lied and said it was the vaccine that saved us. Basic investigation into the numbers debunks the polio vaccine being the reason numbers dropped, not to mention all the evidence and testimonies from doctors at the time that were saying the polio vaccine was destroying people and giving them polio symptoms as well. http://whale.to/v/polio2.htm</p>
<p>Third, people are having their lives ruined in a myriad of other ways that has absolute nothing to do with a virus. We have an extremely toxic environment full of pesticides, PCBs, pollution, heavy metals, EMF, plastics, and the like, and yet these get 0 attention by the medical system and any sort of illness is immediately thought to be a virus which is then diagnosed with bullshit testing protocols. Virology and pandemics have always been a gaslight to cover up some sort of new environmental toxin or technological upgrade influencing physiology negatively. We had a pandemic at the installation of powerlines everywhere, and then another when we began using radar across the world, and then another when we got wireless cellphones, and so on. It's not a coincidence that the installation of 5G happened the same time the pandemic did.... </p>
<p>Lastly, I'm sending you the mega link so you can read how much of a racket vaccination, virology, and pandemics have been since the early 1900s. Everything that the public commonly believes on this topic is a provable lie, given to you by the same organizations and corporations that directly profit from you believing it and pursuing their treatments.</p>

<p>I feel like the reliance on modern medicine is going to have severe negative effects on human evolution.</p>
<p>Humans have been evolving for millions of years, through countless perils and obstacles. We are the apex species of earth <em>because we so efficiently evolve and adapt</em>, but now it’s necessary for humans to get vaccinated and take medicine every time we cough? </p>
<p>Doesn’t make sense any way you look at it. Not trashing modern medicine. A lot of amazing things are possible because of our advances, but I strongly believe the average healthy person should avoid taking medicine unless necessary.</p>

        <p>Yep, and very easily debunked if you look at the polio incident rate and the inception of the vaccine. Polio was already dropping when the vaccine came out because they stopped spraying DDT literally everywhere, but pharma marketing spun it as the vaccine being the reason we were saved. </p>
<p>It's not a coincidence either that we started spraying DDT everywhere after we brought over thousands of nazi eugenicist scientists to the US. We've been taken over by actual eugenicists. They spread into universities, virology, space exploration, military, healthcare, everything.</p>

        <p>Seems like an awful position to advocate today. Right now with the COVID vaccine we have winning arguments, (It doesn't work, it's experimental gene-therapy, it hasn't been tested over a long period of time). Much harder to attack traditional vaccines that have been proven effective and tested, and have decades of public trust.</p>
