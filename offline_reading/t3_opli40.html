    <strong>Doomers and their weird mindsets - just a short story</strong>
    <p><p>Just a weird little story I keep thinking about because I really still can't understand it. <br>
I got married last September during the "summer surge" in California. It wasn't technically "legal" for us to have the wedding but our venue allowed us to do it anyway. It was outdoors in the woods, and it was fine. No one got sick. We had people to get tested before attending and we even did the little green/red bracelets that are pretty universally ridiculed nowadays just for peace of mind and to avoid people yelling at us even more than they already had for having our "selfish, superspreader event" that they still wanted to come to.</p>
<p>A few people who decided to attend our wedding, whom were not forced to attend, politely requested a table "far away" from the main tables "for safety" and we agreed. They all decided to wear the red bracelets as well, which mean six feet away from anyone and no hugs. Sure. We set up the table far away from everyone else and said it was the distanced table for people who didn't feel comfortable.<br>
Except then all these doomers from different households all sat together in a huge circle at the "socially distanced, being careful, wearing red bracelets so don't get close" table where they ate, drank, and talked with no masks on the entire night. Some of them even got up and danced together when it was time for dancing, but they stayed by the table.</p>
<p>I really wanted to ask them what they thought they were accomplishing in terms of safety, but I didn't want to cause a scene at my own wedding.</p></p>

        <p>You bent over backwards for these lunatics on your wedding day. Why didn't you just ask them not to attend if they weren't comfortable?</p>

        <p>I did tell people to not attend if they weren't comfortable. But then they showed up anyway! That's why we had the extra table for the stragglers.</p>
