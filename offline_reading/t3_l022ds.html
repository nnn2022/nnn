        <p>Yep and many people over there at r/Ontario and r/Toronto will still insist that both of them (him and Roman Baber, the MPP that got sacked for the original open letter opposing lockdowns) are lying and that anyone arguing against lockdowns should have their heads bashed in, like almost happened a couple days ago at the peaceful protest in Nathan Philips square that was broken up by police.  They're in a very interesting position now, because many of them are left leaning (fuck it, lefties) and have been shitting on Doug Ford (conservative premier) since before this started and just scrutinizing his actions to the point where he can do nothing right.</p>
