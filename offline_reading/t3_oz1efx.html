        <p>So I watched Patrick King's interview with Stew Peters a couple nights ago. He claims that he won his court case because Deena Hinshaw, the Chief Medical Officer of Health in Alberta (Canada), could not produce the material evidence that he was asking for. Basically he was asking for all documents related to the isolation of the virus. Ergo, he claims that he won the court case because they couldn't provide the evidence needed to justify the Health Act that he was charged under, and that's also why Alberta is lifting all its restrictions, even including the need to legally quarantine if tested positive.</p>
<p>That's all fine and dandy...but I don't think it's true at all, unfortunately. I think he's just confused. Now, I definitely could be wrong, but that's why we're here to talk about it.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, he's resting his claim of victory solely on the heading "The CMOH Has No Material Evidence" and the point 8. directly under it. But all they're saying is that the evidence he requested is not material to the case, as explained in number 9 . and 10. </p>
<p>Patrick King is interpreting it as "they're admitting that they don't have the material evidence that I requested, so I win" whereas the proper interpretation is "the evidence you requested is not material to the case, therefore the CMOH has no material evidence".</p>
<p>He also claims that he confirmed a few times with the judge that "they do not have the material evidence" that he requested, but that was most likely a matter of the judge interpreting the question the correct way and Patrick interpreting it in his way.</p>
<p>I read the court transcript and the issue of the constitutional challenge is a separate thing, he wanted to raise one but didn't know that you had to file for it beforehand so he can no longer do so. He also didn't know that he would have to subpoena Dr. Hinshaw  beforehand so they had to adjourn and do a follow up trial. I wouldn't say he sounded dumb or anything, but he didn't seem particularly well prepared in some ways for the trial.</p>
<p>As for the restrictions lifting, I don't think it has anything to do with his case. Restrictions are lifting across Canada, and Alberta is like the Texas of Canada (so, way less Texas-y, but relative to the rest of Canada anyway). They have gone the furthest in lifting restrictions, even further than most people expected, but it's not that shocking in the end considering the province. The Premier, Jason Kenney, is probably the most disliked by the Canadian mainstream media for his relatively level headed and conservative approach to things.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> All in all, as far as I can tell, I think Patrick King is misinterpreting the court document/the judge's responses and he did not win his court case, I don't think the restrictions lifting had anything to do with his court case, and Alberta is looking like the best place to live in Canada right about now.</p>

        <p>This is very interesting and really well thought out. I really appreciate you breaking this down. Because even though I think we all wish he is right and he has won, this highlights the critical thinking skills that I believe a lot of us here are prone to using. </p>
<p>Being able to look at situations critically means sometimes you’ll prove yourself right, and sometimes you accept that you are wrong. But the important thing in any of this is to pause and really consider what you’re looking at.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your comment. I think many of us here definitely use our critical thinking skills, but we're also definitely prone to varying degrees to confirmation bias and jumping to conclusions like everyone else. Don't fully commit to something until you understand it and have checked it out for yourself beyond a top reddit post and a few comments. We have to be really careful about that and some of that comes with experience. It also comes from a sincere desire for the truth, not just to be proven right.</p>
<p>I just posted about something a few weeks ago which I thought was bombshell evidence (the supposedly super high &lt;12 week spontaneous abortion rate from the vaccine), but after having someone explain their side to me with some back and forths (initially I thought they were totally wrong), I conceded that they were mostly correct although I still had legitimate remaining concerns. It was a humbling moment, and not the first :) a good reminder to be careful...and to reflect on my motives and methods when researching and analyzing the endless information that's available to us.</p>

        <p>He’s not confused. They don’t have it; and no one does. To date no one has claimed the $1 million reward for it. The court just helped the Defendants hide the fact that they do not have the sequence by saying it wasn’t relevant to the case. It was relevant. He would not have been cited if c-mess was not in the equation.</p>

        <p>Maybe you're right, maybe no one has it, I honestly haven't looked into it for myself and I know there's some fierce debate about it, even within the conspiracy ranks.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, he's claiming that he won the court case and that these restrictions are lifting because of him, and I don't think that's true. As point 10 says, he was there to defend himself against the charge, not to question the rationale behind the law.</p>
<p>Maybe if he issued a constitutional/charter challenge he could question the law? But even then, what he's claiming now isn't true...if he goes to court again and files a constitutional challenge, then makes his case for why the law is bogus, and subpoenas the same evidence again, and they admit they don't have it, and they strike the law off the books as a result, then he's golden.</p>

        <p>"There can be no constitutional challenge to the act" is an entirely false and unlawful statement. Constitutional law supercedes all government legislation. </p>
<p>Simply put:</p>
<p>Constitutional law = highest law of the land, supports the people.</p>
<p>Everything else = not the highest law of the land, doesn't support the people. </p>
<p>Whenever "lawmakers" recite this drivel, their only goal is to deceive. </p>
<p>Regardless, the case was thrown out. He won.</p>

        <p>If you just read on...you'll see that they're saying "in the absence of proper notice". Basically, in Alberta or maybe all of Canada, not sure, you have to tell everyone beforehand that you're proceeding with a constitutional/charter challenge. He didn't give the proper notice, so he can't proceed with that in this case.</p>
