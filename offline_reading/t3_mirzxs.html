    <strong>Will probably lose my job if I don't get vaxxed!</strong>
    <p><p>You folks I'm so fucking scared. I'm an "essential worker" (not really) and work in hospitals. They recently passed a law here in Italy that explicitly says that whoever works in hospitals or medical centers HAS to be vaxxed. If you choose to refuse this experimental gene therapy, they can pretty much lay you off. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I sure as hell don't want to get the "vaccine" and I will do anything I can to avoid it. But at the same time I'm really panicking. I can't believe they're actually making this mandatory, it's insanely dystopic. What's next?</p></p>

        <p>They aren't stupid, they are forcing an untested gene therapy with 6 prior clinical trials (2002 - 2018) showing all animals died within 3-6 months of injection, onto the masses for reasons outlined in the Georgia Guidestones.</p>
<p>Choosing between death or another job shouldn't be that hard.</p>

        <p><a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158">The 2019 study</a></p>
<p>The investigation was undertaken to study the effect vaccine-induced, spike-protein antibodies have on preventing SARS-CoV infections and to examine the possible effect the spike-protein antibodies have on the immune system.</p>
<p>Sixteen macaque monkeys were given two injections; half of the animals received a modified vaccinia virus with an inserted spike protein (ADS-MVA) or a control vaccine made with a modified vaccinia virus without the spike protein antigen (ADC-MVA). Three healthy, non-vaccinated monkeys were included as additional controls.</p>
<p><strong>The animals died between weeks 9 and 21, after receiving the second injection</strong>; the vaccine containing the spike protein induced very high antibody responses to the spike protein (anti-S-IgG). Although the antibodies had reduced the viral load in the upper respiratory tract, they caused a serious, antibody-enhanced injury in the lungs. In fact, there was a direct and positive correlation between the level of antibody in serum and the degree of lung injury. </p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421">The 2002 study</a></p>
<p>These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. <strong>Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated</strong></p>
<p>I also suggest looking at Dr Sherri's <a href="https://vaxxter.com/covid-vaccines-part-2/">website</a>, she's been doing alot of work on this.</p>
<p>Personally, I've noticed people ignore these studies when I share it with them. The truth of the matter is that the mask nazis and lockdown doomers' mind shuts down when reading anything scientific, but they have no problem subscribing to "I fucking love science" and the mainstream media.</p>

        <p>You don't honestly believe all these people taking the mRNA vaccines are going to die do you. Or even a significant segment of them? That would make billions of people not trust vaccines ever again, which defeats the TPTB's purpose. They are certainly using all of this to centralize more data, have more control over us, demand more money and taxes so governments can better "plan" for the next pandemic... And big Pharma certainly is getting a lot of money from these warpspeed vaccines. And I bet more covid vaccines will come out for future variants, and they may hope it becomes a seasonal one - huge, recurring revenues. But to kill off masses of people, and have the world distrust vaccines for a very long time - not to mention that it's the compliant sheep they kill and the resistors who survive. That doesn't help them either.  </p>
<p>You really are spewing ridiculous exaggerations by saying you choosing life or death in getting the vaccine. Let's be rational here. What's your prediction for death rate of those who get the 2nd booster of the mRNA vaccines? Let's get it recorded so we can see how ridiculous your prediction is in 1 year.</p>

        <p>mRNA never reached human trials in the past 20 years because all animals died in the studies. Now, they are forcing this same injection onto the masses.</p>
<p>If the two studies I included didn't convince you, here's UK's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975808/COVID-19_mRNA_Pfizer-BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print.pdf">pfizer-biontech severe injury report</a>. It is estimated less than 10% of the reactions are reported, but assuming 100% of the reactions are included in this report (also note missing injuries for the other injections; astrazeneca, moderna, etc), 120k injured out of <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/COVID-19-weekly-announced-vaccinations-25-March-2021-revised.xlsx">1.6 million second dose recipients</a> puts vaccine injury at 7.5%, yet the 6-month period isn't over, and we know how deaths were miss-reported as covid-19 deaths. We can be confident the vaccine deaths will be mostly reported as the new variant virus deaths.</p>

        <p>People are retards &amp; won't see connection to vaccines - they'll just think it's another deadlier strain created by unvaccinated. Add politicians &amp; MSM running with this narrative... You gonna have generations of people thinking it's all fault of people not wearing masks. You giving too much credit to human intelligence after you've been proven wrong about people's ability in reasoning and deductive skills, over and over, and over... again, for 13 months! Seems, you could be one of them. I mean for 52k people it's too obvious what is going on. Resistors are in extremely low number in comparison to willing to get poked +  we don't get to participate in society, so it's almost like we don't exist. I don't think we gonna ruin their agenda, but we have yet to see if they realize the concentration camp thing.</p>

        <p>In the US we have protection for people who claim that their religion prohibits them from getting any vaccine. They may not be happy about it, but you can get exemption. It’s an infringement on freedom of religion if you force people to do something that contradicts their faith. Does something like that exist in Italy? To wit, several Catholic authorities have stated publicly that it’s morally unacceptable because all of the vaccines have used cell lines from aborted fetal tissue in their development or formation.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know several priests mentioned that, so maybe I can try? Not sure if it'll work or how 'valid' it is though. I'm also vegan, so it is already morally unacceptable for me, but I guess this doesn't legally count as much.</p>

        <p>It should also be illegal for them to make you “prove” that is a “sincere” belief (Not sure if it is). Also, how do you prove something like that? And who decides what is the standard for proof?</p>

        <p>You're right, they have no way of knowing how sincere/religious I am, so that's definitely an option I could test. Unfortunately though in cases like these (and especially in these dystopian times) I think it's always their illegitimate/unconstitutional law that prevails.</p>

        <p>If you cant blag it, then you need to follow your heart. If not getting the jab means so much to you, is there anything else you can do? There is a whole world of possibilities and paths out there. I know this is a shit answer for a shit situation, but perhaps if it's going to be like that you don't belong there anyways, and should try something new?  Best of luck whatever you decide, this is a very unfair situation for you.</p>

        <p>Governments have been sued before, and governments will be sued again. Don't believe that just because your government has made a new mandate that your rights are being respected.</p>
<p>Speak to HR. Get a copy of your contract. Ask for reference as to which policies cover mandatory vaccination. It's important to get them to say which specific section/subsection it is. Get as much documentation as you can before you are terminated. Once you're fired, it's a lot harder to communicate with HR. See if there any employment lawyers in your area that can offer free consultation. Class action may be possible, since I doubt you're alone. Are you part of a union? Contact your union rep, if you are. Do NOT quit, unless you're claiming constructive dismissal (talking to the lawyer first will help you a lot in figuring this out). <strong><em>Do not tell HR you are or will be speaking to a lawyer.</em></strong> If it ever becomes relevant, the lawyer that you hire will be the one to tell them.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not a lawyer, and I don't live in Italy. This is not legal advice, whatsoever. I'm only speaking from my own personal experience in dealing with a long-term disability claim and wrongful dismissal lawsuit.</p>
