    <strong>Unpopular: We should be wearing masks, while violently fighting mask mandates.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, I'm glad I found this subreddit. Sometimes I think the world is going mad.   </p>
<p>It baffles me that so many people, Americans especially since I live here, will bend over backwards to have their constitutional rights stripped from them and celebrate it. It's disheartening to be honest.   </p>
<p>But, a lot of the people on this subreddit are disheartening as well. We're a reactionary movement against a corrupt cultural and governmental movement, the rise of authoritarianism. That's not about the pandemic, the pandemic is a vehicle through which people are exerting their power and taking control.   </p>
<p>If we care about liberty, then we need to address that directly. The pandemic is real, we need to wear masks because they work. Anti-Fascism shouldn't be Anti-Science.   </p>
<p>We do need to protest vigorously, we need to risk our jobs to say what is right, risk our standing is society. We need to go onto the streets in the thousands, with our masks on, to demand that our government let us choose whether or not to wear a mask.   </p>
<p>Even among those who believe we are slipping into tyranny, as I do, I see no action. I only see the denial of facts and pessimism. If we want to preserve liberty then we need to be rational, we need to have arguments based on facts, and we need to prioritize personal liberty. Are we going to tell our children that all we did during this time was complain that we wore a mask? Or will we tell them that, even though we may have failed, we were in the streets?</p></p>

        <p>That is your right! That's my point.   </p>
<p>My problem here is that a lot of people are refusing to wear a mask because they are refusing to understand facts, not as a protest against authoritarianism.   </p>
<p>If you don't wear a mask, great for you. If your reasoning is based on ignorance, however, then you're only making it easier for Tyrannical people to justify themselves.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence masks work to slow transmission. There is evidence that they don't. Not wearing masks IS following the science.</p>
<p>Edit: also negative effects of mask wearing in the general populace have not been studied. So the benefit is known to be insignificant and the dangers are unknown.</p>

        <p>Why don't we wear masks during any other cold/flu season? Covid is the same. I will NOT wear a mask, I WILL cover my coughs and sneezes like a decent human being. And I will stay home if I'm legitimately sick.</p>

        <p>Well, my personal belief, is that we should have always been wearing masks. Somewhere around 50,000 American lives are lost every year to the flu. That's a war.</p>
<p>My problem is not with the masks, it's with the mandates. The government does not have the right to tell me that I have to wear something.</p>

        <p>Well, I agree with you. Try not to misunderstand me.   </p>
<p>My point is that these two statements are not mutually exclusive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government shouldn't be taking the steps that they are. Mask mandates should not be legal, they are abhorent. </li>
<li>Masks work, and they save lives. We should <strong>choose</strong> to wear them.</li>

        <p>Masks are not proven to work. There are studies saying they work, and studies saying they don't work. </p>
<p>In my opinion, they do very little to stall the spread of a virus. Viruses are very small, and a mask isn't going to prevent viral infection. However, masks do help prevent the spread of bacteria, because bacteria is much larger and saliva has lots of bacteria. Even so, nobody should be forced to wear a mask in their daily lives. Cases are still high in areas where mask wearing is predominant, and no, it's not because one person chose to not wear a mask. </p>
<p>I also don't think we should ever be forced to wear a mask to prevent potential sickness in other humans. We should also not be accused of killing people, because we chose not to wear a mask, especially for something with such a low death rate and when most people have zero symptoms/may not even have it. </p>
<p>Masks also have some detrimental effects. Many people who are prone to skin conditions are having trouble managing them, due to wearing a moist cloth over their face the whole day. It's a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. As much as a mask might prevent bacterial infections from spreading, it can also cause bacterial infections to the mask wearer after prolonged use. </p>
<p>Lockdowns work far better than masks, but they're unsustainable and unconstitutional. As soon as a lockdown ends, cases will once again increase.</p>

        <p>&rt;There are studies saying they work, and studies saying they don't work.</p>
<p>That's literally how science works, that's such a misunderstanding. The whole point of the scientific endeavor is to debate and present alternative viewpoints until a consensus of truth is reached. If that is the truth, then alternative arguments will become weaker and weaker overtime, or someone will overturn the whole system.</p>
<p>&rt;In my opinion, they do very little to stall the spread of a virus.</p>
<p>Yea, but your opinions on that matter are not very relevant, to be frank.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree and would add that I still would not support forced mask-wearing even. if the death rate was high.</p>

        <p>I applaud you for trying to engage in a reasonable discussion regarding the efficacy of masks in source control, but I don't think you'll find a reasonable discussion regarding that in this sub. There is a strong overlap between medical misinformation and generalized conspiracy theories, unfortunately. I agree that we should always strive to hold our governments accountable and prevent overreach, but that doesn't mean that all of the medical experts in the world are out to get us.</p>

        <p>Yes, our government is using medical professionals for their own agenda. It's very unfortunate for people to turn against the medical community.  </p>
<p>Doctors do not make policy, they only advise on what the risks are. When a Virologist says that 200K will die if we don't do X, that's not a statement of policy or what we ought to do. It's only a statement of facts (under current understanding).  </p>
<p>It is our politicians that turn facts into the oughts without weighing other costs, and in this instance, purposefully dismissing other costs for the gain of power.   </p>
<p>I realized I wouldn't get too many reasonable responses haha, but not talking only lets the more reactionary wing of this movement take over more completely.</p>

        <p>Yeah, all of our politicians are crooked, really. Left, right, doesn't matter. Doesn't take a genius to see that they don't have our best interests at heart. I think a lot of us disagree on what the problems are and where they come from, but at least we can all agree - government sucks.</p>

        <p>No.  You're right in that we need to take more concrete action, yes.  But it is <em>because</em> you are right about this disease being real that you're wrong about wearing masks.  </p>
<p>People are dying: often with Covid, sometimes from it.  While the panic is manufactured, the disease is not- which means there will be some justification- however flimsy- for imposing restrictions until such time as we reach herd immunity.  <em>We will never get there without exposure</em>.  If masks work, they lengthen the lockdowns.  If they don't, they cripple our immune systems.</p>

        <p>Using government to mandate a response to almost anything is like hitting a screw with a sledgehammer. </p>
<p>People need to be responsible, well informed, and provide for themselves and each other, or else we will have to watch as the government spends all our money failing to inform us, failing to provide for us, as it always does. </p>
<p>Government is the worst, most inefficient charity in history. And it's far more dangerous when reacting to fear.</p>

        <p>Yes! Freedom is just degeneration and sloth without responsibility.   </p>
<p>You cannot ask for Freedom without taking on the tremendous burden of being informed and becoming a good person.   </p>
<p>That's what I see in this pandemic. On one side are people who want the government tyranny to feel safe, and on the other side are people wanting freedom without responsibility. Both of those sides will lead to authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>Agreed. And the worst part is those in the <em>relatively small</em> Irresponsible-Freedom-Right just lump everyone who questions them into the <em>relatively small</em> Government-Tyranny-Left, and vice versa. </p>
<p>So you have two extremes, refusing to hear anyone in the middle, because they assume anyone who doesn't 100% agree with them is on the opposite extreme. </p>
<p>And that pretty much sums up American politics too. The moderate center exists. It just never gets air time.</p>

        <p>This sub is just as much an echo chamber as anything else. They criticize groupthink but often engage in many similar activities. Truth be told, like you said, the solution lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
