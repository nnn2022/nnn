    <strong>People act like you have the morality of a 9/11 terrorist if you take off your mask even once</strong>
    <p><p>Like seriously. </p>
<p>I know I'm just stating the obvious, but it's pretty disgusting behavior. Especially when you consider that some people probably don't even care about the whole "saving lives" thing, they just want someone to take their anger out on. They want to be morally superior with their whole "look at me I'm wearing my mask and you not wearing it above your nose is why we're in this mess in the first place" nonsense.</p>
<p>It's crazy how people overreact if you're in a store and you take off your mask even once. They act like you'd blow up the World Trade Center. I recently heard a story about someone who was in a store and there was no one around within 6 feet of them. The customer pulled down their mask to take a drink and an employee came out of nowhere and told them they'd have to leave for having their mask down.</p>
<p>It's so pathetic.</p></p>

        <p>Yes it is. No different than forcing women to wear a hijab in public, and shaming them to death if they refuse. These people are so brainwashed, I've started considering anyone pro-mask my enemy. Which is quite a bit of people. We who don't want to wear a mask everywhere need to be more vocal. I hate confrontation but you've got to start somewhere. We need to start a trend of flash mobs of bare faces .</p>

        <p>These peoples are living in fear thanks to MSM and social medias spreading doom and gloom.  If someone get in my face about wearing a mask then they'd better put them fists up because I ain't putting up with this sh*t anymore.</p>

        <p>This... yeah, CoVid-19 is fatal to a small number of people including my parents (more due to medical negligence than CoVid-19 itself) but the majority of people do not have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Just mainline C, D and Zinc and you are exceptionally unlikely to die from CoVid-19, even if you are overweight.</p>

        <p>You're right and it's because they have been so brainwashed into thinking that the plague is out and about and if anyone doesn't wear a mask, they themselves will not only drop dead but will cause everyone around them to also. I don't wear a mask because it's my personal choice not to and they are ineffective and I'd love for someone to approach me and tell me that I need to wear one</p>

        <p>Actually the reason is that masks, at least in the only setting I don't wear one (low-density outdoor settings where 99% of the time I'm just walking briskly past someone â€” themselves wearing a mask â€” to get to where I need to be), are a pointless performative gesture to allow people to feel safe and as if they are doing something helpful, important, impactful, and relevant, whose symbolic function in our social landscapes leaves a lot to be explored with a lot that can be said. I still wear masks indoors, because, like I said, that's a setting where it's important, or at least, makes a modicum of statistical difference. The reason is not contrarian for me â€” I can't speak for other people here â€” but actually itself a commentary gesture because I found it absolutely absurd and hysterical that people thought it acceptable to treat me (and presumably others) like that, for simple, reasonable human activities. I mean, you would not imagine the horrible things people have said to me for simply pulling my mask down to drink water or coffee for a moment. (Yeah, I'm serious and not exaggerating.) I am not anti-science; I have read quite a bit more science (actual research, not journalism) than the average person on COVID, and yeah, wearing masks in indoor spaces, assuming the people wearing the masks wash them after every use and use surgical masks when necessary, is honestly important to slow spread and is actually statistically impactful. Now, despite having read a lot of COVID science (plus, it's important to point out all of this research is novel, but striking inferences can be gleaned from reading science on past pan/epi-demics), I don't pretend to be an expert, but I just have a gut feeling the TV news isn't either (lol).</p>
