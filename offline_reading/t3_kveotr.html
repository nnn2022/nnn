    <strong>Confession. I don't want to be "cured". Society needs to be cured.</strong>
    <p><p>I've ASD, is considered disabled by society because of I can't adapt to changes and I don't want to be cured. It seems like society think I should be cured, if a cure existed. Although none have said it directly to me, I get the feeling of it and actions speaks louder than words. They think it would be much easier for me to adapt to all the social distancing, mask wearing etc. without getting overwhelmed and sensory overload. They think if everyone were like their idea of an average person, it wouldn't be difficult to follow the rules or be a burden to society. There wouldn't be any "mask exempt in shops" card being shown or "waste of tax money" giving me accommodation in college. I plan to see if I can get an interpreter (writing interpreter) in class room, because of I can't understand what people are saying with their muffled voices and facial covering. I think if something isn't broken, there's no need to fix it. It's society that's broken. Why?</p>
<p>Because of it's society (which politicians, "experts" and pro-lockdown affects) that make people feel lonely, deal with mental health issues, economy and their life quality. I may have my own opinion, my own interests, stand out from the crowd, not like wearing a mask and have some of the ASD characteristics. I don't see myself as asocial, the awkward one or who should become "normal" here. It's society that need to learn to overcome the fear, learn that it's not a death sentence to meet family/friends again, go to school/work or show your face. It's not a death sentence to smile and live like you did pre-2020. If society sees me as the social awkward one because of I likes to show my face, smile, talk, gesture and go outside, then it's society that need to rethink their standards.</p>
<p>If I was offered a magical pill to get "cured", I would decline it. I don't need it. I'm not broken for not being able to accept changes. The virus has 99,9% or more survival chance.</p>
<p>(I'm fully aware of many neurotypical people are against lockdown and restrictions too, and visa versa. It's still common for none neurotypical to have more difficulty accepting changes and wouldn't be affected by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeping_normality">gradualism</a> as easily, because of the sensitivity to changes. Sorry for messy post. It's a rant and I'm mad!)</p></p>

        <p>If you are talking about Asperger’s then I say it should be the choice of the person. Never been diagnosed with it but I suspect I have it. I personally want a cure for it and my other disability that affects my muscle strength and balance but that’s my life. I can see how someone might not want it because they maybe see a benefit or feel like it wouldn’t be them anymore without it. </p>
<p>But leave it to the disabled people to find out what’s best. Though more severe autism I doubt is a barrel of laughs.</p>

        <p>I also think it should be a choice. :)</p>
<p>I would like to get rid of the oversensitivity to smell, so I don't need to smell people's sour socks 5 meters away. But other than that, I don't need a cure because of I don't see myself as a problem. I see society as one.</p>
<p>Before COVID19, I was almost symptom free and it was hardly noticeable because of I lived in a good and free society, and the climate isn't too warm. The COVID19 restrictions and lockdown stress me out.</p>
<p>I plan getting checked for APD and hope a doctor is willingly to send me to a specialist. I don't mind being a little bit "hoh" in normal circumstances. Prefering face to face conversations instead of phone calls is valid and I don't see any reason why I should change, when I function fine. Most conversations happen on texting or in person anyway. After the restrictions like masks came, my comprehension of speech went from almost average to almost nothing. I function fine when society was normal. The only reason I don't understand most speech nowadays are because of the restrictions and less visual cues. Why should I change when society won't change back?</p>
<p>I see society as a disability, not myself or ASD. To me, it's like a woman seeing the society as disabling instead if her womanhood because of laws, that exists in a few middle eastern countries. People have different experiences and that's okay. To some society affects them a lot.</p>

        <p>Nice post. If that wasn't obvious already - the "politicians and experts" don't actually care about your health or any other issue you have. They're ready to throw anyone under the bus to advance their plans.</p>
