    <strong>Lockdown Rant</strong>
    <p><p>I've seriously fucking had it and losing hope.  I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but here it goes.  </p>
<p>I am thankful that I'm still employed through all of this, but I am so damned sick of working from home.  I feel like my soul is being drained more and more by the day.  I have no motivation to do any of my work because I don't talk to anyone the entire day aside from a few meetings here and there.  My brain is so tired and under stimulated from being alone and staring at a fucking computer all day, it doesn't matter what the work is, nothing would interest me.  The isolation is killing me from the inside out.  I don't even consider myself an extrovert, but this is just human nature - people need other people and socialization.  This entire thing is a sick and twisted social experiment as far as I'm concerned.  </p>
<p>As much as I hate all of the politicians imposing these lockdowns, I hate the people that are buying into it/preaching it even more, and the hypocrisy of it all makes me want to rip my hair out.  The past few days, I'm seeing all of these headlines about how some random party or bar opening was linked to 140 cases or whatever fucking made up number.  First off, how do you trace it all back to that and blame it on that bar, when these individuals could have been any number of places?  It's near impossible, especially considering how shitty they have been with testing and counting positive antibody tests as "cases" etc.  When there were protests and/or riots a month ago with hundreds or thousands of people depending on the location, all the "medical officials" said was they weren't a risk for spreading the virus.  Are you fucking kidding me?  And now they're going to circulate this garbage about some random fucking bar was linked to 200 cases?  Are people so dumb that they actually believe this bullshit and don't see that they're being manipulated and lied to?  But no, not the protests, that didn't cause the uptick in "cases".  When the riots started, I thought the government would have learned their lesson, that by locking down people for \~3 months, that's when they'll start to lose it and start rioting.  But now it seems that the entire US is heading towards cracking down even harder.  Doomers continue to shame and hate on everyone who wants to go about their normal life.  These idiotic and fake "sympathetic" and "tolerant" people don't give a shit about how miserable anyone else is, as long as they can continue to virtue signal to compensate for their worthless and vapid character.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the lockdown when they were spouting "2 weeks to slow the spread," I still had some creative energy and motivation in me.  I actually wanted to do stuff, including creative things , like painting.  Now I don't want to do any of my hobbies, or work, or anything.  I'm dead inside.  I thought the hysteria would be over by now.  Boy was I wrong.  If things don't get back to normal by the election (the next possible date for this to blow over), I'm not sure what I will do.  I can't adapt to being socially isolated and shut inside my house and supposed to be working all day.  It has got to be one of the most cruel forms of torture forcing people into isolation.  Yes, I still see people, but it's not enough to make me feel human.  I just feel numb.  It just seems so suspicious to me that the government is so hell bent on forcing people not to interact with one another.   We no longer have a free will.  Depending on how long this continues, I may not have a will to live for much longer.  Not trying to be overly dramatic or get sympathy, I am just fucking fed up and I hate everyone that is just sitting on their fucking facebook or whatever, spouting their virtue signals and siding with the government oppressing all its people and taking away our last hope of having any freedom left.</p></p>

        <p>I’m with you on the WFH stuff and I thought I was the only one feeling like that. You’re right, it’s fucking awful. I’m not motivated to do anything and it’s soul sucking having to stare at the same four walls every day. There is no boundary between work and home anymore, whatsoever. </p>
<p>As an aside and kind of to your other point, I actually lost a friend who became a hardcore doomer and basically accused me of selfishness and not caring about their parents and “people like them” for making the argument that we need to move on at this point or risk losing a lot more, to imply that somehow a global pandemic was a personal issue to them so that I should completely modify all my behavior to suit their sense of safety and security. Fine, be a ten year old and stop talking to me over something stupid. That’s on you. </p>

        <p>Thanks.  Yeah, work from home sucks.  I never liked it before when I did it a couple times a week, and now it's just pure misery.  </p>
<p>Yep... so many of those people, it's so ridiculous.  And they're so self-righteous and condescending, when they're the ones that are just sheep with no ability to think for themselves, independently investigate the covid #s, or critically analyze the situation.  They're basically programmed robots, and malicious ones at that.  I have a similar thing with an old group of friends too - I'm basically the only one that's not a doomer, and if they really knew how I felt, I can guarantee they would not want to be friends with me.  They have openly wished death on anti-lockdowners.  I can't stand listening to them and not being able to say anything (not worth it).  It's a tricky situation, because I want to completely stop talking to them without any drama/hard feelings.  But they really don't add any value to my life.  I've heard several other people on r/LockdownSkepticism mention how they have lost friends over this situation too.</p>

        <p>I decided at the start of this that if I can't speak honestly with people about how I feel about the lockdown/politics, they are not my friends anyway, so why waste time policing what you say to keep them around?</p>
<p>If you want to try one last time I'd share one of the articles about a person who is now dying because they couldnt be screened for cancer, or the dangers of leaving people with dental abcesses (they can die). If they react badly, I think they are too far gone.</p>
<p>This is obviously entirely up to you, but i feel much better and comfortable with myself now I don't have to censor myself around 'friends' (it makes you feel guilty I think).</p>

        <p>I'm trying to think of silly mask ideas. </p>
<p>I'm also contemplating doing weird stuff like wearing party dresses and heels to go food shopping, accessorizing with a dollface mask (from 'the strangers'), just get absurd with it if they're going to push this crap (masks are becoming mandatory in the UK from next week). I might just be losing it</p>

        <p>Yep I was thinking the same thing after hearing masks are mandatory in the UK from next week. I'm considering making one from that thin netting type material that you get on under skirts / costume fabric. See through and useless, like the rules being put in place.</p>

        <p>I also WFH and I can barely drag myself to the computer. It’s just a horrible slog every time, and my work is definitely starting to suffer. Before lockdown I liked my work and I did feel like it gave me a sense of purpose, but now I don’t have any sense of purpose at all. Just constant anxiety symptoms and sadness. </p>
<p>Honestly I don’t know if I will make it either. I’ve thought about suicide more in the last few months than I ever have in my life. Each day I feel like I’m dragging myself through till bedtime, which can be as late as 4am because I’m too anxious to sleep. </p>
<p>I try to get out but it’s a mixed bag. The weather where I live isn’t great for outdoor dining, but on milder days I try to get out of the house and be friendly with strangers. It’s interesting. About half the time people are paranoid and rude, and the other half they’re overly friendly. No one seems to have a neutral setting anymore. </p>
<p>One place in my town where I always felt at peace was the local coffeehouse. They had a beautiful space, great coffee and music. I sat there for hours reading and writing feeling comfortable and safe, surrounded by students from the local uni, families, seniors, etc. It was a Family-owned business and beloved by the community. And thanks to COVID they have closed their doors permanently. That’s just one example of countless places I can’t go back to. And it’s heartberaking. </p>
<p>Also to the troll who might downvote or tell me I’m stupid for writing this: do your worst. I’ve got bigger problems than morons on reddit, that’s for sure.  To everyone else suffering, I offer &lt;hugs&rt; and &lt;peace&rt;</p>

        <p>Im with you. I’ve never been suicidal and since this started, I’ve thought at least once a day about how to do it. But I don’t want to do that to my parents. As long as they’re on this earth, I won’t do that to them but goddamn I may need to start taking meds soon and that’s something that was unconscionable to me prior to March 12th.</p>

        <p>As somebody from a country with a "successful lock-down", I've been also struggling with finding motivation, and my work's quality is suffering. Every day is literally the same, and the worst thing is that there's no end in sight. I just despise going through the exact same stuff every day and not being able to properly socialize.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The number of cases is stable, but they know that raising the measures will cause an outbreak, so we're in a deadlock situation where we're just waiting for who knows what. That's the worst part for me, is that there's no deadline or anything, it can just keep going and going and going.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm sure that it's going to break down eventually - people are just going to get tired of the measures, savings are going to run out, some country is going to push forward and reach herd immunity, or maybe the blessed vaccine or cure is going to come out. But I fear that "The market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent"</p>

        <p>Man your story of that coffee shop takes me back to my college days. I had one similar to that in a secluded area and had a neat little used bookshop right next door. Was such an idyllic little spot and I had some wonderful peaceful memories getting lost in some random old books, thinking about life and then buying a couple books and coffee to support the local business.</p>
<p>I know there are greater and more tangible travesties that are happening as a result of lockdown (suicides, unemployment, closed businesses, missed medical diagnoses, etc.), but little things like your coffee shop experience that bring a little peace and joy to your life are the little things that make life what it is. Yet we are being robbed of it all and treated as vile, selfish people for missing it.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite local coffee shops has decided to only sell snacks and leave them outside when you call to place an order. I miss their drinks and they're not opening anytime soon. I miss driving there.</p>

        <p>Same. The only things helping are acting as if everything is normal and spending some time in the office with clients again. I am not buying into this because MY life depends on it. No one who advocates for lockdowns cares about me, so I don't care about them anymore. The pandemic is over for me. I avoid places with people because I choose to forget that it exists. But I'm done worrying about it and not doing things I love or socializing like I already enjoy (1-1 or small groups with friends).</p>

        <p>Hear hear. You hit the nail on the head: no one who advocates for lockdowns actually gives a damn about anyone. They don’t care about people. They care about themselves and the control they have when smiting people who aren’t ready to throw their lives away. So no, I absolutely don’t care about them anymore. If this virus is soooo dangerous and is going to kill us all then I’m going out with a bang and not secluding myself away.</p>

        <p>I’m having a pretty down day myself. I’ve been house sitting so being alone away from roommates who are somewhat doom-y (not as badly as previously thankfully) has given me time to really stew in my thoughts.</p>
<p>I worked remotely before this all started for about a year and a half. Working from home was fucking great when the world was still spinning correctly on its axis. There were concerts, weekend road trips, vacations to other states and other countries and the knowledge that life was still going on around me.</p>
<p>Now working from home feels like all I have left and it is a level of misery that’s making me not even want to work. And work is all I have that reminds me of everything before this. How sad is that?! </p>
<p>I wished one of my best friends a happy birthday today. He lives the next state over and has a crazy amazing party last year. It was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. I remember thinking during that party how much I loved life, how much I loved being with people, how happy I was. I feel like a shell of that person. I feel like I will never again be that happy. And that thought makes me want to cease to exist. I almost want to die so that the government and media has one less person to control. I have never hated anyone or anything to the depths that I hate the media and the tyrannical governments doing this in the name of safety. If being “safe” means having nothing to live for, I would much rather just not be alive.</p>

        <p>I feel you so much. I’ll be working from home for the rest of the year, and maybe into 2021. Or maybe forever as long as I stay at this job. But the remote through the end of 2020 arrangement is definite. I’ve accepted it, but I sorely miss the interaction with my coworkers and the company-wide activities that were so fun, like our summer picnic and Halloween celebration, Christmas party...all of that gone. I also had a part time job with a minor league baseball team lined up for the second summer in a row. Gone. Canceled. Not being able to have my fan interaction, be outside in the park and work for my awesome boss has also been depressing. </p>
<p>I tolerate the mask wearing but I will stop the day the mandate expires. Unfortunately ours is “until further notice.” Not sure where you live, but I am in PA with a Democrat governor running wild, so I feel your pain with worse and worse restrictions. Even my ice skating club now requires masks while skating and is doing temperature checks. I guess that’s what happens when some uppity skating mom gets just one smidgen of power. As you know, people can have COVID and not have a fever so it’s all “look at me I’m keeping you SAFE AND HEALTHY” security theater. </p>
<p>It feels like I’m less motivated by the day. I too have days where I can barely focus on work. I have gotten out for some things since my county reopened, but restaurants can only be at half capacity, “large gatherings” can only be up to 250, and some retail stores have lines to get in. It’s almost a hassle to do anything leisurely. Even though I’m “allowed” to shop and get a haircut and eat out. my life still doesn’t feel as active and fulfilling as it did this time last year. And yes, I have gotten outside. I have tried indoor hobbies. I still see some family members. It’s just not the same. I don’t feel satisfied at all. I have a few good days and then go back to being in the dumps. </p>
<p>I used to like watching hockey and baseball, but what is the fucking point of sports if fans won’t be allowed? Minor League Baseball had to cancel partly because they can’t survive with no fans in the stands. That’s their whole profit. I wish sports would just wait to return until fans could go watch. </p>
<p>And like you I’m amazed how few people seem to care. They’re happy kids can’t play sports because “it’s the right thing” to “keep everyone safe.” They don’t want fairs to go on and they don’t want people to go to amusement parks. Four months into this and my governor and his equally drunk on power health secretary still gets to decide my risk assessment. (But I can’t disagree with the health secretary because she’s transgender, and I don’t care if she dresses as T Rex to address the media, but anyone who takes issue with what she says is labeled a transphobic.) I hate how the hysterical social media mob is getting 100% of what they want while those of us who want normalcy are ignored, called selfish and blamed for the “surge” because we went out to eat. So many of my friends have gone from intelligent and kind or funny to cowards who want to hide in their houses and judge everyone else. Most of them are unbearable because I don’t recognize them anymore. </p>
<p>And now we have to play this game until a vaccine arrives. That was NEVER the original plan! It’s such crap at this point.</p>

        <p>I tried that response and everyone just said “Well it’s not like sports are the only way for kids to be active! They can play outside!”</p>
<p>Yes, they can. But it doesn’t replace team sports. How is riding your bike down the street, even though that’s still exercise, even the same thing?</p>

        <p>Just ignore it. Seriously. I'm in the bay area, and as of today we have a bunch of new restrictions. Businesses that were finally allowed to open on monday, after four months of lockdown, were closed today. All that planning, restocked inventory, rehired employees, all for nothing. I felt the same way you did, but now I've started just ignoring it all. No mask until an employee reminds me, attending social gatherings, going into work, and if theres another shelter in place I will not follow any restrictions at all. Go outside and live your life normally is my advice. Try working outside in the sun, and invite some friends over after you're done. I wouldn't say government is being oppressive right now, mainly because I realized that they have no means of enforcing lockdowns. They're wannabe oppressive for sure, but police departments don't have the stomach to enforce anything these days. Facebook and most of reddit are cesspools anyways, ignoring people on those platforms is something you should be doing anyways. Hell most of my facebook feed is unironic communists from college: I get a good laugh out of it.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same. I am grateful to have my job (I'm now WFH) but it feels like the world has been on fire for the last 4 months and I've just been tinkering away on a laptop, feels like I haven't had any time to process this.</p>
<p>Tbh I've felt worse than usual this week (we have taken 1 step forward, 2 steps back in the UK - masks will become mandatory here next week) and I've really found it hard to focus on my work. I just don't care! Which is not like me at all. </p>
<p>I know people talk about hopelessness and suicide quite often on here, but I genuinely think about it every day. I feel bad saying that because I don't want people to perceive anti lockdowners as all emotionally unstable. I've always struggled but I worked hard (sense of purpose), and stayed busy and that kept me afloat.</p>
<p>I am becoming a godmother soon and on one hand that gives me reason to carry on and try help her through life, but on the other I feel desperately sad and worried about her life. I'm worried governments will never give us freedom back, and vaccines will be mandatory and quality of life in the west will deteriorate to match the third world.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, I've probably made people feel worse reading this. </p>
<p>The only things that help me are thinking of my nephews, goddaughter and my dad. I have a boyfriend too, but when I'm depressed I find it hard to believe he would mind that much.</p>
<p>I don't listen to music regularly but today I have been blasting 'win in the end' from teen wolf, 'hate to say I told you so' the hives and muse 'uprising', all those songs seem apt right now.</p>

        <p>Honestly listen to the lyrics! I can't even pick 1 line, it's all accurate! </p>
<p>I enjoy the hives line 'Do what I please, gonna spread the disease, because I wanna!' not that I actually WANT to spread anything obviously, it's just funny to be so irreverent. Also I've always been skeptical and looked into "conspiracy theories" and a lot of things are being accepted by the mainstream now so I feel a bit vindicated ('hate to say i told you soooo...'). I wish I was wrong tbh about a lot of it.</p>

        <p>I empathize with your rant so much that I feel like I could have written it myself.</p>
<p>You are not alone. Sure, online you will be bullied for your skepticism outside of here - but in real life there is a quiet majority of people who feel the same as you. Please don't forget that.</p>
<p>Anyone who speaks out gets attacked, whether it's a normal person on social media or a medical doctor like state senator Scott Jensen who is under investigation by the medical board for speaking out. (His medical license is at stake.)</p>
<p>My point here is -- as people who speak out are attacked, more and more people quietly disagree. Again, you are not alone.</p>

        <p>Every day, I walk for at least two hours, usually around 8 miles. Before house arrest, it was my joy: I would walk between various supermarkets to buy things for home cooked meals for me and my husband. Now, walking is the only thing I am allowed to do (Los Angeles restrictions are insane), and it's my burden. I keep imagining walking until I hit the Pacific Ocean, and going until my head is under water, or the tide carries me out. My husband is the only reason I haven't. I have severe depression, and I was once hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. This existence is worse than a nervous breakdown.</p>

        <p>You're the resistence if you've manged to keep your head so far during this to recognise that something isn't right.
I know it's frustrating. I feel the same. It's hard.</p>
<p>I'm sorry your motivation has been taken from you. I feel the same. Before all this I had a life. It wasn't always good but it was mine and I had choices. It really does feel as though evil has taken them away. It is sad when loved ones are blind to he light.</p>
<p>I don't know what to suggest or how to get through this better than how it is now, but I promise I'll come back here and share it with you if I do manage to think of something.</p>

        <p>I’ve done online classes and have the exact same reaction . I had no motivation and grades fell. When I was allowed back into college it felt great. Every day feels the exact same and it’s maddening.  All I ever really want to do is just get through the day or get drunk. Anything to give me some form of relief. I’ve been working a lot but its very hard when I can’t go see a movie or do anything I enjoy   I feel I have nothing to actually look forward to</p>

        <p>I really think medical professionals lost all credibility on their response to the protests. Don’t get me wrong, i was glad to see people taking on these issues but that doesn’t matter to a virus. We basically had 2 weeks of music festivals happening everyday while kids were not allowed to have graduation ceremonies and families couldn’t hold funerals of more than 10 people. That’s peak hypocrisy sorry it is.</p>

        <p>I feel all of this.</p>
<p>I have to get tested tomorrow despite being asymptomatic (got food poisoning at the worst possible time), and more than anything I'm terrified to get a positive result. I'm not sick, I don't worry about death. What I'm worried about is that scarlet letter. </p>
<p>My friends are reasonable but understand that the virus is real and won't want to see me in person with a positive result. It's possible that I exposed some of my family/we got exposed together and they'll blame me, and I will probably be banned from big holiday events through 2020 at least. I haven't seen my grandma since March, and now probably not through the end of the year now (even though she's seeing everyone else). </p>
<p>Dating will be an absolute no besides playing around online endlessly, because I know online doesn't really work and I couldn't get anyone to see me with a positive result. It's really going to be time to accept that the toxic relationship I ended back in November to try to be happier really was my only chance.</p>

        <p>You are right, I guess I'm selectively social. I totally have empathy for everyone going through a bad time right now but I'm not a doomer, I'm outside doing my thang everyday and I won't miss the Thursday wing special!
But I'm super happy that relatives are no longer hugging me. I always thought it was weird that people would just assume it's ok to get in your personal space bc they are "family" and it's a "holiday".
