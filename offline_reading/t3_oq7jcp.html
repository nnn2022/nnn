        <p>Statistics professor here, just to clear up the numbers to give an unbiased picture... hopefully the folks in this sub will not downvote actual information that doesn't fully support their conspiracy theories!</p>
<p>First of all calling it 0% is misleading, there are not zero cases, the number is rounded down. The data show 45 deaths in 205,549 cases which is a death rate of approximately 0.02%. This is very low and while it does seem to be much lower than for the original version of Covid, the most vulnerable populations most at risk of death are already vaccinated and are much less likely to be infected. Even still the death rate seems lower than the first waves among healthy individuals.</p>
<p>Secondly, the claim that there's a higher death rate among the fully vaccinated is deliberately misleading. There are far fewer confirmed cases among fully vaccinated individuals despite them making up the majority of the population from which the data is taken. As the vaccine is shown to improve resistance and does result in a smaller number of confirmed cases we can conclude that those who are infected despite being vaccinated are at higher risk and from vulnerable populations; likewise it is a reasonable assumption that those choosing to forego vaccination have less risk factors and are thus more likely to survive.</p>
<p>In other words while those who get covid and are vaccinated do represent a higher risk population than the unvaccinated taken as a whole, the effect of vaccination is still to reduce the chances of death.</p>
<p>The results summarized by Dr Malone lower on the page are particularly interesting, it is only 16% less likely for a 12-17 yo make to die of the vaccine than of Covid, and for females in that age group it's 72% more likely. And the risk of hospitalization from vaccination is substantially higher.</p>
<p>These last results don't generalize to adults who have extremely low risk (~0.0005%) of myocarditis from the vaccine. Personally I'd definitely avoid vaccinating my children if I had any.</p>
<p>Make your own decisions, don't be misled by information supporting what you choose to believe, I'm not gonna tell you what to do though.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. Itâ€™s always important to keep a level head and not buy into whatever headline is shared. If we do that, we are no better than the folk who consume mainstream media with no second thought to it.</p>

        <p>Yes, and according to this data the delta variant has a 99.98% survival rate, so a 10x lower death rate, this is counting people over 50, but people who have other health problems are more likely to be vaccinated so not sure to what extent the two cancel out, it certainly appears to be less deadly though.</p>

<p>Can you try to find any critic or error in this? Because if that is anywhere near to true i will share this with local newspapers. I will research into it myself, but as a claimed statistics prof please try your best to debunk this.</p>

        <p>&rt;conspiracy theories!</p>
<p>I prefer the term "spoilers".</p>
<p>Otherwise a cogent analysis. It's all too easy for statistical data to be interpreted poorly and I think you've done a fair and unbiased take on these numbers including calling out the relevant biases evident in the data.</p>
<p>&rt;for females in that age group it's 72% more likely</p>
<p>This is tragic and avoidable. The young are simply not at risk to this disease and the idea that 12-year-olds are capable of consenting to involvement in the experimental trial of this drug but not capable of deciding basically anything else about their lives is utterly batty.</p>

        <p>What comes to the forefront when I read this report is that the delta variant is 1/3rd as deadly as the alpha variant.  This is the same time frame and in the same population, with a pretty large sample size.   Delta spreads 2.5x as fast. Which means that it will absolutely overrun the alpha variant within a few months.  This is actually great news for humanity.  Also, if you are under 50, this predicts your survival at 99.98% (even if you attribute all deaths to the unvaccinated part of that sample, it's still 99.96% survival with the delta variant.  </p>
<p>What this also tells me is that the hype around this delta wave will be confusing for the media (as if we don't already know that).  They will see hospitalization strain like before, but they will see a drop in overall death rate and this will make them go bonkers.  I'm calling it now, we are 4-6 months and 150-220k recorded deaths away from the statistical end of the pandemic.</p>
