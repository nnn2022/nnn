    <strong>How I think this hysteria started</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys, I wanted to share with you a thought that has stuck with me for a couple weeks now, and, for me, explaines how this bs started.</p>
<p>So, we all know covid has been around for probably more than a year now, but people didn't give a shit about another virus found in those horrific wet market in China till March 2020, when they found the "first" case of infection in the western world, specifically Italy (that's where I'm from).
The problem here has been that the guy they found positive to Covid was like 30 years old and super healthy before he got this pneumonia, running 2 marathons a week and so on. He was one of those very rare cases of young and healthy people that come down with a really bad pneumonia from Covid (super rare but it happens, just like any other virus or bacteria tho). He was really sick from covid and was held as the perfect example of what happens to you if you get this deadly scary virus. 
People lost their mind over this, seeing this young man severely affected by the illness (even though he was probably not even in the first 1 million of people getting covid).
I hope I have explained it in a way that's understandable, let me know what you think of this</p></p>

        <p>I live in Ohio and we have a lot of foreign exchange students. I don’t care about that. But we’ve had the virus longer than March. We had a substantial amount of people sick in October/November of 2019. 2-4 week long stints of hearty coughs and related symptoms.<br>
The virus was brought over with the students and foreign travelers. 
It’s just an observation I’ve made. I make no claims to be a “professional ”</p>

        <p>That was part of it but it was also the 5% mortality rate in those over 60 years of age. That is what really scared people like my mother and father (who by the way died from CoVid-19).</p>
<p>I was like "Mom... Dad... you are healthy in the real world! Even though Dad is a transplant patient! You shouldn't have to worry about this virus!"</p>
<p>Well... turned out I was totally bass-ackwards wrong about that. Rehab center sent Dad home to Mom and I with CoVid-19. Dad got it and died May 5th due to it attacking his coronary bypass. Mom got it and died May 29th of multi-organ failure. I had it and 'luckily' survived.</p>
<p>Honestly I would rather it had done a clean sweep of Mom, Dad and I all together in the real world.</p>
<p>Why? Because I'm mentally ill and unable to hold a job... when Mom and Dad's estate runs out in a few years (4 max) I'm going to be in heap big trouble.</p>

        <p>That is one hell of a story, I'm sorry you're having a rough time but glad that you survived it. Good luck for the future :(</p>
<p>Unsolicited advice, feel free to ignore: Can you talk to a financial planner or wealth management company? Get the cash you have now to last as long as possible to give yourself more time to prepare for the future. In the meantime, while living frugally you could retrain yourself getting qualifications in another field that may be easier for you, seek help from your doctors, or at least get an early start on the paperwork/admin side of things for unemployment pay.</p>

        <p>Running 2 marathons a week isn’t healthy. A marathon is 26 miles. That really takes a toll on the body, especially in the winter.</p>
