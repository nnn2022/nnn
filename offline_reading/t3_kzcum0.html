    <strong>"Karl-Anthony Towns says he's lost seven family members to COVID-19"</strong>
    <p><p>If you follow the NBA, you may have heard that early this year, Minnesota Timberwolves Center Karl-Anthony Towns tragically lost his mother in April due to covid. This was devastating news, especially as a Timberwolves fan. </p>
<p>However, a more recent headline gave me pause. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/karl-anthony-towns-says-hes-lost-seven-family-members-to-covid-19/ar-BB1bDAD4">Karl-Anthony Towns says he's lost seven family members to COVID-19</a></p>
<p>My first reaction to this headline was also sorrow, but then I began to wonder what the odds are of <em>knowing</em> 7 people that have died due to covid, let alone knowing 7 <em>family members</em> that have died due to covid. </p>
<p>Nowhere in the article does it directly quote Towns saying he's lost 7 family members. I went searching for the direct quote, but the closest I got was an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30451080/timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-says-season-difficult-amid-court-tragedies">interview where he says he recently lost his uncle.</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of this story. I don't think Karl would lie about something so horrible, especially since he's actually lost two people close to him. However, if this was a wild media headline, then I feel as though he would make a correction. I have seen many headlines and TV commentators talking about Karl losing 7 family members, however I cannot find him actually confirming it. </p>
<p>What are everyones thoughts on this? Can anyone find Karl actually saying that he's lost 7 family members?</p></p>

        <p>It's bullshit.</p>
<p>He's hamming it up for the sympathy, publicity, and social media clicks. Aided and abetted by a weaponized news media.</p>

        <p>Sorry to say to you, but many celebrities and the like are basically playing up Covid. Tom Hanks, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, a few others have made claims of how dangerous the virus is, and how they "fought for their lives". I highly doubt this, and I believe they are playing it up. Either for sympathy, publicity, and social media clicks as /u/DrTamsPlasticSurgeon says, or because other interested parties up them up to it.</p>

        <p>I remember an article where someone was saying.
Karl lost his uncle. He was a father, a friend, a teacher, a mentor, a cousin, a grandpa to him.</p>
<p>Somehow to the media this accounts to 7 people in his close circle.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to find that article lol</p>
