        <p>"Machiavellianism is a personality trait thatÂ denotes cunningness, the ability to be manipulative, and a drive to use whatever means necessary to gain power. Machiavellianism is one of the traits that forms the Dark Triad, along with narcissism and psychopathy."</p>
<p>Again, I repeat...If someone didn't know what it felt like to be in a relationship with a narcissist...well, everyone knows now. </p>
<p>This was a tribute to those who have been in a relationship with a TRUE NARCISSIST. </p>
<p>The version of "narcissism" everyone uses these days applies to most of us and isn't even used correctly. </p>
<p>But a TRUE NARCISSIST..</p>
<p>That is Fauci in a nutshell. He is absolutely the dark triad. </p>
<p>I had to get my degree in psychology to fully understand that my mother is a narcissist. Oddly enough, I didn't know she was already diagnosed with "narcissistic behavior". </p>
<p>I also was in a 2 year relationship with one and I don't think I will ever fully recover. </p>
<p>I recognized this behavior when I first saw him speak and it frightened me. I tried to tell people that I was seeing some serious narcissism in him. </p>
<p>It wasn't until <a href="https://youtu.be/Pnb2Yxri6eY">THIS</a> that people started to really see it. People that I know. </p>
<p>The gaslighting in that video is Haunting. Unfortunately, unless you've seen it, personally, a lot of people won't even recognize it.</p>

        <p>Story of my life. Fauci is a scam artist, but he comes off as a pawn and wimp to me. The real Narcissists are those backing him behind the scenes.</p>
