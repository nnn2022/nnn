        <p>They lost me here: "we all want people to be free from coercion" Bullshit. There is a huge portion that cheered on Biden's federal employees mandate. There would be a solid percentage who would be happy to see the National guard deployed to inject people at gunpoint. There are many people demanding vaccine passports and second class citizenship for the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>These people don't want a society free from coercion. They want the state to impose their will on those that disagree.</p>

        <p>&rt;Does it make sense that someone would want to avoid putting unknown chemicals in their body? Is it reasonable not to fully trust the pharmaceutical industry? It doesn't take a lot of Googling to find lawsuits and settlements of billions of dollars involving harms, false claims and withheld information by drug companies. Isn't it true that we have only short-term data on the effects and side effects of the vaccines, if only because the trials began less than two years ago?</p>
<p>It sounds like they are making some pretty damn good arguments for not getting vaccinated.</p>
