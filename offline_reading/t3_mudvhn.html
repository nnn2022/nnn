    <strong>"Defund the Police", CCPvirus, and Police in Revolt...</strong>
    <p><p>It's been interesting watching the situation in Ontario with numerous police forces saying they won't enforce Fuhrer Ford's new CCPvirus prison rules on the population of Ontario. The same resistance is beginning in places like Italy, The Netherlands, Germany, etc. I expect it will grow.</p>
<p>I get that it isn't all of them yet, but if you look at past societal upheavals like France in 1789, the Bolshevik Revolution etc it only takes about 10 to 20 percent of the forces of "public order" to openly refuse to carry the regime's water and it's all over. The disaffection and rebellion will spread. Even those who refuse to participate, will simply sit it out.</p>
<p><em>This has been giving Corona-woke governments drunk on their newfound powers nightmares for quite a while. How do you ensure the loyalty of your attack dogs and keep the serfs quiet?</em></p>
<p>You can try purging them, as Sleepy Joe and Justin Trudeau have been doing. This fails as a long term strategy - you eventually are left with the venal, the incompetent, and the stupid. Once the forces of rebellion contain the motivated, the intelligent, and most importantly, the disaffected, it's time to think about what safe place that private jet on standby is going to take you.</p>
<p>Propaganda may work for a while, but when Officer Dilbert's wife is out of a job, his children are Zoom-school basket cases, and he chafes under lockdowns and misses his sunny week in Jamaica just like the plebs he is expected to ticket, truncheon, and tear gas, the shine will wear off really quick. Not to mention, he has to face the wrath of his friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>Money? Read any history book. Mercenaries are never a good bet during periods of civil upheaval. When things go bad, they tend to offer up their former paymasters up to the mob a la Dogs of War.</p>
<p><em>So what is a would-be "Health Dictatorship" to do? Why, defund the police of course!</em></p>
<p>I know. You're thinking "This guy has lost his mind." Hear me out before you decide.</p>
<p>The common "solution" offered up by the Left (and fake conservatives like Johnson, Ford, etc) to replace the police is an "army of social workers". <em>Yes, but to that, add an army of bylaw officers.</em></p>
<p>Given the political leanings and general attitudes present in our present cohort of social workers and bylaw officers, can you see how we might have a problem here?</p>
<p>Say what you like, at least police forces have <em>some</em> accountability to those they serve. Have you ever tried to take on, or hold accountable, the actions of a social worker or bylaw officer? Ask anyone who has dealt with CPS, with family court "Mediators", or had disputes with a bylaw officer over property use, environmental stuff, taxes, etc what <em>they</em> think. <em>Now picture these same people enforcing lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, masks, etc.</em></p>
<p>Most police attempt, with generally law-abiding citizens, to exercise at least a facade of common sense. Social workers and bylaw officers are like Siths - they see the world in absolutes. <em>Out at 8:01 PM because your car is on the side of the road with a smoking ruin where your engine used to be? You're getting a ticket. And it will be far more difficult than involvement with police - because it's a civil matter. You will have no legal protections whatsoever.</em></p>
<p>No more police? Well, chances are that the bylaw officer or social worker you deal with is going to be a woman. Have fun. Women - like social workers, bylaw officers, and Siths - see the world in absolutes. Safetyism, conformity, and "zero-tolerance" rule enforcement will trump reason or liberty - every time. And you better hope she didn't have a fight with her rebellious tween daughter this morning - or you're getting it twice as hard. <em>Don't believe me? How did your last traffic stop with a female cop go? Who usually bitches because you aren't wearing a mask?</em></p>
<p>If you are yelling both "End the Lockdowns!!!" and "Defund the Police, I strongly recommend you re-think this strategy.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for. The "cure" may be worse than the "disease".</p></p>

        <p>"I know. You're thinking "This guy has lost his mind." Hear me out before you decide."</p>
<p>You're correct, it sounds like you lost your mind. But reading further actually made it get worse.</p>
<p>"If you are yelling both "End the Lockdowns!!!" and "Defund the Police, I strongly recommend you re-think this strategy."</p>
<p>No one is crying both of those things. People who are calling for the police to be defunded are Marxists and anarchists and lefties, by a staggering majority. People who are calling for the end of the lockdowns are mostly right wingers and libertarians. So it's two groups of people who are already deeply culturally opposed.</p>
<p>The irony is that "end the lockdowns" and "defund the police" are both calls for less authoritarian government, but the people who are calling for the lockdowns to end as a rule are perfectly happy with authoritarianism when it comes to being a bootlicker for cops.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I got the distinct impression readers aren't getting what I was trying to say - maybe a fault with my delivery.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>- "Defund the police" has motives that are less than honest or altruistic. In fact they are downright malevolent.</p>
<p>- Left wing governments (and spineless cucks like Ford) that agree (either openly or secretly) with this agenda are not doing so for the good of John Q. Public. They are doing it to keep the votes of their pet "Gibsmedats" - hence the mention of anarcho-tyranny.</p>
<p>- Governments are running scared that their enforcers will suddenly decide not to play ball, and I am sure would like to find a more "politically reliable" alternative to a bunch of conservative white guys that wear police or military uniforms.</p>
<p>- Going from police forces as we know them, to "woke" social workers and "Block Warden" style bylaw officers actually <em>decreases</em> accountability and legal protections for the average, law-abiding citizen.</p>
<p>- This would be a double win for our present would-be dictators. They get to suck up to their sans-culotte voter base, and they get a law enforcement mechanism whose primary focus is toeing the correct political line, punishing their political and philosophical enemies, and pleasing their masters at all costs.</p>
<p>I hope this is clearer than my original post.</p>
