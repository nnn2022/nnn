    <strong>Belgian manhunt for heavily-armed far right soldier [that threatened virologist Marc Van Ranst]</strong>
    <p><p>Marc Van Ranst, the Belgian virologist known for his talk on how to sell a pandemic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjxHoUyiAM8), has supposedly gone into hiding under the threat of an armed "far right" soldier gone rogue.</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57168576
&rt; Special Belgian police units are searching for a heavily armed soldier who disappeared after reportedly making violent threats.</p>
<p>&rt; The suspect has been named as Jurgen Conings, a military shooting instructor who took weapons from a barracks.</p>
<p>&rt; He is said to have made threats in the past against virologist Marc Van Ranst, who led Belgium's public health response to coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt; Mr Van Ranst and his family have been taken to a safe place.</p>
<p>&rt; Police appealed to the public not to approach the suspect but to get in touch if he was spotted.</p>
<p>&rt; They searched a forest near Dilsen-Stokkem in the Limburg province of northern Belgium, after a car said to belong to the soldier was spotted containing heavy weapons.</p>
<p>&rt; Police are said to have found four rocket-launchers but the suspect is still thought to have several other firearms with him as well as a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>&rt; Reports described him a "potentially highly violent extremist" with far-right views. He is said to have left letters indicating he was prepared for a deadly battle with police and "could no longer live in a society where politicians and virologists have taken everything away from us".</p>
<p>Pretty nuts. All terrible in all seriousness, I wish Marc best of luck, then again the nice fellow is now threatening all the people opposing the lockdowns: 'wappies' (derogatory term in Dutch for 'NoNewNormallers' used to quell the opposition from day one) are complicit of threats (https://www.nu.nl/coronavirus/6134313/ondergedoken-vlaamse-topviroloog-wappies-medeschuldig-aan-bedreiging.html).</p>
<p>So what does this tell you? Either people are really starting to lose their minds, which I seriously doubt (why now), or we are getting framed again like usual.</p>
<p>Rocket launchers? C'mon man!</p>
<p>I have a feeling the whole thing is about to come crashing down on those that orchestrated this hoax, but they still think they can save face by demonising those that oppose the scamdemic and sacrificing some of the public perpetrators. Bill Gates taken out. Fauci taken down. We are entering a new phase where the perps are slowly all getting cornered.
Whatever it is that is really going on, things are also starting to heat up here in Europe.</p>
<p>Reject the new normal, reject violence, reject any form of tyranny, peace and love!</p></p>

        <p>My guess is that this is fake. A hoax to make people believe the NoNewNormallers are a real danger and threat. To create wider division between people and to be able to arrest the anti's later on and put them in the camps.</p>
<p>Everything is being done to make anti-vaxxers a big problem. A menace to society. They want to get rid of us. Force us into indoctrination camps to reeducate us and maybe even force the jab.</p>

        <p>Obvious hoax, but this one I wish were true. These scumbag virologists are holding the sheeple hostage with their virus bullshit.</p>

        <p>Well, "fake" as in a threat created by the authorities, or "fake" as in fake news. It is definitely not the latter. This is "real" news coming from the MSM, but it is way too crazy to not be fake too at the same time. So yes, it sounds like a constructed crisis to support the official narrative. Then again, stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, they are abusing it the very same day, which tells you all you need to know about it.</p>
<p>I think most of the normies will naturally buy it. Us NoNewNormallers (NoNewNormies?) not so much.</p>
