    <strong>Sad realization for CovidVaccinated posters</strong>
    <p><p>That feel when you unquestionably believe in the vaccine 100%, defending it constantly and are part of the pro-vaccine crowd, but then end up being damaged by the vaccine and then crying for help on the CovidVaccinated subreddit, only to get victim blaming and then having your post removed by the mods as if you don't matter.... so your own group has now shunned you because of vaccine injury, since they can't afford letting the vaccine reputation go to the gutter.</p>
<p>Wow.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, sucks for them tbh. At least this sub (although hated constantly), doesn't just outright ban people who are opposed to our views (except for when they are here just to cause trouble/trolling).</p>
<p>But still, sickening to see all the deleted posts (and with some of them still rationalizing "i'd still get the vaccine 10/10, i'm not antivaxxer". Jesus christ, abused victims)</p>

        <p>I dun know, I am pretty petty. </p>
<p>If I was a mod, I would likely ban everyone from the subs that banned posters here. Or just ban people when they write derogatory/hateful comments and say it was because they were posters in said forums. </p>
<p>I give props to the mods for having more self control than I would. This is why I have not wanted to be a mod in decades.</p>

        <p>I've seen the same happen with people I know in person who got seriously hurt by the vaccines. I've been open about my opposition to the lockdowns and covid restrictions, which made me a pariah, but in the past few weeks a few people have reached out to me to say they think they were wrong about it all.</p>

        <p>Hopefully it'll happen soon. I think it's worth noting though that a few of the people were not people I talked to regularly before; I'm decently well known in my community and have been very vocal about my opposition to the current hysteria, so I think a lot of people are reaching out because they don't know who else to talk to.</p>

<p>some of my favorite comments - </p>
<p>"get a therapist or something sounds like a mental block of some kind i wish you best of luck"</p>
<p>"I mentioned it in one of your past posts but it may be worth it to mention again, has anyone (you, your doctor, ect) brought up the possibility of a mental/nervous breakdown? From what you describe sounds scarily similar to one, which could have likely been caused by an overwhelming anxiety about the vaccine side effects, just going by your previous posts."</p>
<p>"Acknowledging that you're a 1 in 10 million case, I'm wondering what you hope to accomplish posting here multiple times over and over, often begging people not to get the vaccine. I'm sorry you had among the roughest of rides. But you're alive and I hope you'll get better. On the other hand, we have forums full of many more people than you with worse conditions from Covid itself -- or silent because they're incapacitated in the ICU, sometimes for months, or worse, among the 600K dead. Should we have no vaccines and just more mountains of dead people? What's the way out of the pandemic that doesn't involve 600K more dead per year + many more with worse effects than you? We're not getting the vaccines for fun, they're still the best option we have."</p>

        <p>It sure did, the measles and those Jewish communities that didn't want to vaccinate were demonized.  Then the outbreak in Disneyland or wherever it was.  I was following closely along but at the time I just thought it was your typical conservative bashing, religious bashing bullshit and not prep work.</p>

        <p>Also, I noticed... a lot of the times when the posters say they went to their doctors, the doctors themselves had no idea on what to do and usually only gave a half-assed "solution" that barely makes things better or doesn't make things better at all (I've seen people there say the vaccine side effects lasted MONTHS without getting better)</p>

        <p>Beat me to it, that’s why it made sooooo much more sense to wait till later to get this bullshit. In a year or two, doctors would have had enough time to thoroughly look for any adverse affects be they short term or long terms and figure out ways to combat the issues that showed, either that or simply figure out which vaccines available were the safest on average vs the ones that were nothing but trouble from jump, then get ride of them.</p>
<p>To eagerly take something that no one has really had the time to study and figure out the various bugs and issues with is playing Russian roulette with your health. Any intelligent person would understand that instead of just blindly trusting bullshit</p>

Even when directly faced with the results of their ideology they couldn't accept what was happening, they thought it was all just a mistake that would be soon fixed.

        <p>I just don't understand how they still promote it so hard their after reading and knowing all the damage it does. Explain to me how it's any better than getting covid? </p>
<p>Covid is something you are not guaranteed to get at all, the vax is a guarantee. </p>
<p>And we know for a fact after a year and a half of observation who is at greatest risk of having a severe reaction to covid, whereas with the vax it seems to be so random, so hit or miss, and demographically so much younger. </p>
<p>How are they <em>that</em> afraid of covid, but not afraid of reading these vax reactions which seem so much worse for their age category?</p>
<p>How does anyone explain that? It seems completely irrational to me.</p>

<p>People appear more stupid then they did in the past. I'm pritty sure an olde English Victorian pauper would point out "Yeah mate, but that's just one chap out of how many, guvnor?"</p>
<p>I blame pollution, and schools not teaching kids HOW to think things through....</p>

        <p>This has always been the sad reality of vaccines. Most antivaxxers are ex-vaxxers who have a vaccine damaged child. They trusted the system, had their lives turned upside down and then were completely shut out and ridiculed if they spoke up. I think the sheer volume of damage the covid vaccines are going to do might just bring being an antivaxxer into the mainstream.  By then it's too late of course.</p>

        <p>No vaccine is absolutely 100% safe, so you shouldn't be trusting a vaccine 100%, even if you were to assume the Covid vaccine is like the rest, especially when vaccine makers are exempt from any liability.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry for the people who assume the Covid vaccine is like the others, and have no idea about the potential dangers of them.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Flu shots are a joke. I’ve gotten it once in my entire life, and that was only when I was seeing my doctor for something else unrelated. She asked me if I wanted the flu shot, and it would be free. I said, ok I’m here already, why not. Only time in my life I’ve ever had the flu. My arm was sore as fuck for a couple days too</p>

Last time I had the flu it was a day of laying on couch half awake dreaming about Tom Hanks conspiring with Claus von Stauffenberg and Davy Jones to assassinate the Pope with an antimatter bomb for the excommunication of Wilson for its Volleyballist heresy.  </p>

        <p>Lmao, I shouldnt laugh but I swear to god its like my work accident prepared me for this. </p>
<p>Its legit a mirror of what happened when I experienced increased sensitivity to adrenaline/anxiety due to the effects of refrigerant poisoning on the myocardium that works through unknown reasons. I wouldnt be shocked to find out that its not just heart inflammation but some kind of hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon that causes this effect in the shot. During exercise or anxiety, etc. you will start to experience irregular heartbeat (was pvc's, bradycardia, tachycardia for me) which supports my case that it was refrigerant poisoning since they are known to cause ventricular arrhythmias.</p>
<p>&rt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dichlorodifluoromethane#section=Antidote-and-Emergency-Treatment<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin and countershock may be effective.</p>
<p>I was being told that I did not have irregular heart beat. I was to young and healthy they said and besides freon cant do that. They fed me blood pressure medication for 9 months. As my BP continued to build they kept trying to tell me that it was all in my head and that "i should start taking my medicine". I told the idiot I was taking it, he just couldnt see past his nose to see that he might be wrong and not just assume i was looking for a work injury payout, what a douchebag ugh. </p>
<p>I have never had heart issues before and suddenly I have full blown irregular heartbeat? Yeah, thats not a coincidence. Even if breathing refrigerant on the floor of a poorly ventilated shop wasnt the cause, it certainly had a effect. </p>
<p>Nova Scotia has a "at cause" injury claim. You dont nescarily have to prove the injury caused your condition, but that it contributed. </p>
<p>Thats why they had to just resort to out lying to deny my claim. Telling me that what I was experiencing was not irregular heartbeat and that freon cant cause palpitations according to their "Chief medical advisor." </p>
<p>I cant decide if these people are legit idiots, or they just really think I am this dumb. Ugh.</p>

        <p>I learned the hard way the limits of the medical establishment. I almost died in my 20s and 30 from an undiagnosed and untreated problem that was extreme and stuff of nightmares. They also misdiagnosed other major problems that were neglected. I even got heart damage from an endocrine disease not being dealt with. Yes I got the "it's all in your head" crap too. That's going to be the reality of many of the vaxxed with side effects, "it's all in your head", "you are depressed and anxious--see a psychiatrist", "your fatigue, skin sores, etc mean nothing". Yeah in your case you got the "malingering" accusations. I think anyone who gets sick now among the sociopaths is considered a "malingerer" unless you got so much stuff that shows, and then you get the pity and ostracization from society--crazy skin rashes and have my forehead rot off from near lupus doesn't bring social benefits. My house is full of medical books I need them. Some doctors are good don't get me wrong, but taking 25 years to get diagnosed with some things makes me cynical. I think now even with the vaxx most of the doctors are doing their usual thing, ignoring right what is in front of their face.</p>

        <p>These people really are thrown out like garbage. I notice more people are telling their stories on alternative vaccine side effect subs, which aren't cheerleaders for the vax. Those subs are more gentle than the covidvaccinated mob, but still can't help them. The advice is usually not to get the 2nd dose if they haven't already. The commenters probably want to say "you fucked up", but are more empathetic than that. But once you've been injured, the medical system may try to quietly treat your "symptoms", but they aren't fixing the underlying problem. They really don't want much to do with you. A vaccine injured person is more shunned and vulnerable than an anti-vaxxer in many ways.</p>
