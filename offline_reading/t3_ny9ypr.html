    <strong>I am scared and too upset to be around the vaxxed and don't know what to do.</strong>
    <p><p>I think we should treat all with compassion. Want to leave that there. </p>
<p>Let me make a list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes I am afraid of the spike proteins. Hate to admit it but I am noticing the discussions increasing about it in various places. I am trying to find out if this is just more lies but don't know. Some may say just go for it. However why ignore the people talking about what's happening to them, like others ignore those having side effects from the vax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They all want to eat food, aka would be around people eating, touching food, cooking it etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are all in groups unmasked and vaxxed. Oddly they keep wanting to be outside and refuse to meet with each other inside which is kind of creeping me out. These groups are all vaxxed people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't want to be blamed if they get sick and start dying of the vaxx but are told its Covid 21 later, and the unvaxxed spread it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There may be anger if they find out I am not vaxxed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can't be "me" around them. I already have lost friends for the few warnings I gave--people aren't talking to me and I have been fully ghosted recently by 1 or 2, I could get thrown out of three community groups I am now in, if I was open with my views or if not thrown out, severely OSTRACIZED. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history I have....I am on the autistic spectrum. I used to be a hard core fundamentalist Christian, I had a bible prophecy/conspiracy blog, and a conspiracy theorist. I deconverted, but faced extreme spiritual abuse and non-acceptance in the Christian world. I could not renounce the conspiracy beliefs because once you know something how can you forget it.  It's not like I can turn to fellow deconverts about this stuff, some still believe in Jesus Christ but renounced evangelicalism/fundamentalism, and I have alternative views about Jesus and religion. They are all pro-vaxx too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel weird and depressed around people. Have seen a few dropping off items. It's hard to explain. Maybe the isolation has messed me up, but I am picking up stuff about the vaxxed, that inwardly bothers me. If you keep seeing people as "grey" or having feelings they are "washed out" and their inner light has been snuffed out, well would you want to be around them? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets take all religion and spiritual feelings out it, when I think these people are going to give this experimental vaxx to their children/grandchildren, I want to throw up, and don't want to be closer to them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All my circles are liberal ones, think BLM, etc etc. I constantly feel frustrated the world is on fire and that's all they care about. They don't care about if POC suffer under the vaxx  While I am a leftist or a disaffected one, I find myself finding all the corporate causes to be empty. I don't care. Our ghettos here look BAD and the homeless numbers are out of control. This week they were talking about painting BLM on the sidewalk among all the falling down houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am in a world where there is no one to talk to on any real level. It is hard to explain how I got this isolated but I did. I think why am I bothering? The few times I have tried even mildly to approach things, people have gotten angry and shut me down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I go to stores and don't care if someone unmasked is around me, I figure that contact is fleeting and I am wearing masks being high risk, but I don't want to hang around the vaxxed. I would visit local unvaxxed people at this point in time but don't know any. Yeah that's some horrific loneliness. Ive looked for groups. The majority of this town is vaxxed. I noticed even conservatives from my high school town who spouted off against lock downs even lined up for the vaxx.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am blowing off 3-4 groups right now, harder and harder to, since they moved off Zoom and into real life meetings outdoors. All vaxxed. I am going to lose the few social connections I had. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am supposed to take some small day trips soon, I hope that will help.</p></p>

        <p>Good advice. Yeah I am going to do what I want to do. I don't want to care what they think anymore either, I mean why waste the time. There's no talking to them, I figured that out pretty fast.</p>

        <p>I agree. I showed evidence, none of them cared. It is brainwash city. I think now if I have ended up a hermit, [with husband] then I should just be stoic about it. If I can't be myself I am wasting my time too. To have people you thought were friends turn on you too is not an easy experience.</p>

        <p>If you're a Christian...  Our job is to keep the commands and let God worry about the things we cannot control.  End of story.   I will not get the "vax" because it violates God's commands in multiple ways, nevermind all the actual real science that says its deadly that the gov totally ignores..</p>
<p>TLDR - "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God"   And how do we know we love Him....  "If ye love me, keep my commandments"</p>

        <p>I don't know if I would fit the criteria of Christian or not to most people. I did deconvert but was fed up with Christiandom and a lot seemed wrong. I was honestly "born again" before and was sincere about it. I think religion is controlled by the elites. Jesus was killed for going against the "order" and a lot of things were changed by them for control and dominance. Read Ishmael by David Quinn too, to get gist of my beliefs this world became about domination and control</p>
<p>I can't believe in cruel Gods who want to hurt me anymore, but do believe there is a God or Source and Jesus came to preach love. Whoever that God is it's telling me not to become a GMO human and I know the elites are evil. Christians used to preach Romans 8 to me but there is a point where suffering in life is too much and I didn't have the nice white picket fence Christian life with huge families and money like the majority of evangelicals. I still wonder about the people I prayed for who died and had horrible things happen. So much made no sense. Even all this? I wonder if this planet is a prison of some sort or hell itself.  I'll try and do the best I can but like most humans know I can't get it perfect. If there is a loving God I pray everyday for it to rescue me and husband. I don't know why so many humans are allowed to suffer so horribly. I've given up trying to get answers for those questions because there was no answer, and I am not talking about what I went through but other people.</p>

        <p>It's impossible to avoid them, and until there's strong evidence of a threat don't be scared. We'll learn as we go, but just act informed by facts rather than fear. That's what we've been saying to the covid zealots, isn't it? Basically, you seem scared of what others think. Don't be. If someone's stupid enough to judge you as a bad person because of a medical decision, religion, non-extreme political affiliation (what I mean here is that you're not politically aligned with something that makes you committed to doing bad things because of your extreme view), or anything like that rather than your personality, their opinion really isn't worth your stress. Perhaps that sounds a little obnoxious but don't fret about acceptance in circles that behave like that, like you say you'll never be comfortable being yourself so you'll be unhappy and unable to form strong connections with them anyway.</p>
<p>Getting out of isolation is difficult, and perhaps I'm not the best person to advise you on this but I'll try. Like I said earlier, do not fear what people think. The groups you're blowing off, try going back to them if they aren't ridden with restrictions that suck out the fun for you. If you go and the talk about vaccines makes you uncomfortable, just don't go back. At least you tried. If you're asked about whether you had it, don't be scared to say no. I know it's intimidating, but through their reaction you learn if they're people you want to continue spending time with - if they're rude and judgy about it, then they don't value you for your personality, just how much you go along with trends. Remember, that's what this is, a trend. And not all vaxxed people are gullible idiots. Some chose to get it because they looked at the info and decided the risks and benefits worked for them. You might not agree, but at least they thought about the decision rather than just took it because everyone else is. Maybe they were backed into a corner by their job, in which case they might still be wary of it anyway. For me, it's not about whether they've had it, it's about whether they look down on others or even feel entitled to treat them like second class citizens because they've not had the vaccine. Those people are the people you avoid, in general people who've had the vaccine but keep it to themselves and don't judge are people you can get along with anyway. But just look for new groups and find people, some will hate you for your view, but just be prepared for it, and don't take it to heart. Put yourself out there is what I'm saying.</p>

        <p>that's there too, thinking they are going to die soon anyway. I have lost a lot of friends who are deceased already before Covid. I knew about the Deagel numbers way before Covid. I think they are going to make it mandatory too. I can see them making it illegal to speak out against the vaccine, he's right and criminalizing "vaccine resistance". The way they are hiding severe effects now and the censorship is very frightening.  I am scared of it being forced on people too.</p>
