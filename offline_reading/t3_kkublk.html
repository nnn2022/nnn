        <p>Tell that to my healthy mother who died from this virus. This virus is uncommonly lethal to those 50 and older compared to other colds and flus in the past.</p>
<p>It also lands people on ventilators a hell of a lot more often than colds and flus of the past did, though part of that could be that doctors are too ready to ventilate people with this disease.</p>

        <p>Actually yes, they do hold a 'valid and informative value' of how many suspected cases of CoVid-19 are in our society.</p>
<p>The problem is that they are using inaccurate PCR tests for a purpose that they were never meant to be used for to get those new case statistics.</p>
<p>They should darn well have an antibody test by this point for CoVid-19 but for some unfathomable reason they do not.</p>

        <p>Their argument is now that Florida is “hiding” their numbers. Then they start going on about the “whistleblower” story when that girl got arrested. Source: have heard many Doomers talking shit about Florida the last few days. In reality, they are jealous and angry that lockdowns don’t make that much difference in terms of outcomes.</p>

        <p>True that. While I believe that whistleblower (she is actually that) is being harassed by Florida the fact is that my relatives down in Florida, of which 2 of them are nurses, have not seen hospitals being overwhelmed and the data they are seeing says Florida is doing pretty good all things considered.</p>
<p>Which includes taking into account we are now in WINTER and therefore cold/flu cases landing people in hospitals always goes up.</p>

        <p>I live in Tampa Bay and can count on one hand how many people I know personally that have gotten covid since last March. People do wear masks when required, but we were just out downtown yesterday and it was absolutely packed with people, hardly anyone wearing masks outside. Felt wonderful and normal. I will also add that I have several clients that are nurses, and whenever I’ve asked them about how things are going at the hospital or their personal level of concern regarding covid, they have all reported that the hospitals are not overflowing and they aren’t particularly concerned. I own a dog training business and never stopped working or required my clients to wear masks.</p>

        <p>For the year the difference in "covid deaths" per 100,000 people is 97 in Florida vs. 60 in California. I don't know if that qualifies as "so much higher" but it's likely attributable to the fact that the median age of Florida residents is 5.6 years older than the median age of California residents.</p>

        <p>maybe because a ton of old people live in Florida and unless you're some genetic freak, you're not gonna get much further than 85. </p>
<p>When you're that old you got a real good chance of dying of the flu. I'm willing to bet a major percentage of covid deaths in Florida are presumed to be covid, but actually came from the flu. Or another nasty coronavirus. Or bacterial pneumonia. Or literally anything else because even the most harmless diseases can kill people when they're right up at life expectancy.</p>

        <p>If they get proper treatment they <em>might</em> live to 90 or more. If they get proper treatment they could still keel over because they were too far gone. And if they survive they might be permanently weakened to the point where they can't even walk unassisted. Better than dead? Maybe. If I get that old and I can't walk anymore I think I'd rather be dead. </p>
<p>All that to live 5 more years. And we have 20 year olds that could have easily lived 65 more years killing themselves due to lockdown despair.</p>

        <p>Look at what’s happening in CA right now. All lockdowns do is delay the inevitable. The difference between FL and CA is simply that FL got over their huge spike earlier, and now it’s CA’s turn. Come back in a few months and I guarantee you the death rates will be the same, if not worse for CA. Meanwhile FL has retained their economy while CA is royally fucked for years to come.</p>
