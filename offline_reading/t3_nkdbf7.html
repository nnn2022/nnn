        <p>10/10 meme. Bluebeam is already admitted!</p>
<p>Tangent: My parents got into <a href="https://youtu.be/s1gnvQL-ZNc">some weird</a> newly emerging sect of Christianity. Essentially, its Ancient Aliens + Reptilian Agenda + Jesus... Here's the scoop: God and the Devil are tangible, DNA based organisms, somehwere in the universe. Original sin was the corruption of godly genetics. Centaurs/mermaids/satyrs were (real, tangible) abominations bred by early man and fallen angels. Flood, abominations wiped out, but the flaw exists in man's genetics... Flash forward... Aliens are demons perfecting people suits. They abudct people to better emulate us. Satan is the lord of the sky, and until rapture we live in a fallen world.</p>
<p>Its pretty weird, but it's kind of cool. Felt you guys might get a kek out of it. Its a nice expansion of the vanilla cononical material.</p>

        <p>Well, yeah. But its easy for curious minds to want to get a more mechanistic idea of the implications of text. <strong>Why</strong> should I love my neighbor?! <strong>How</strong> is it bad to take the Lord's name in vain?! And so on. </p>
<p>And, perhaps its a trap! Hubristic knowledge of good and evil. I never would have read the Satanic Bibile if I never read the OG Bible, lol. Its, like, how occultic literature works.</p>
<p>Although this particular weird stuff is virtually inactionable. Theres no added diet or rules. Just information. If there is an added action, it is this; Dont trust the ET. Which I can get behind from a pure game-theory perspective. Its hard to trust a sneaky sentience.</p>

        <p>I definitely have a curious mind, so I totally get that. You're right, it's a huge trap.we go  from "love your neighbor" to "God doesn't love that person because xyz," etc. But yeah, I wouldn't trust the ET either, lol.</p>

        <p>It might be too emergent to even have a broad namesake. Or, they're too uninitiated to know themselves, lol. Most of the sci-fi bend is outlined in 'extra-cononical' books. That is, apochrphal texts referenced in the vanilla Bible. Jesus himself refferences Jasher and Enoch, which deal heavily with the Nephlem (abominations). The rest seems to be heavy re-interpretation. Im relatively impressed.</p>

        <p>Christianity is undergoing a major transformation with the whole Qanon ARG and all the Christian UFO researchers who think aliens are really demons. The gospels still seem relatively intact, at least until there’s some integration with astrotheology. I knew when I was going to church as a child that this know nothing approach to the cosmos would have to change at some point.</p>

        <p>I've never heard of ARG's before, very interesting. I personally think Qanon is a psy-op/hopium honeypot. Sort of reminds me of like how <a href="https://www.autismforums.com/threads/police-targeting-autistic-teens.25163/">the cops entrap</a> autistic children. <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/13/whitmer-kidnapping-plot-may-have-been-an-fbi-entrapment-of-a-bunch-of-crackpots/">Tomato, tomäto</a>. Hmm, that phrase doesnt really work in text, lmao.</p>
<p>Someone else in thread suggests 'Just listen to Jesus ' And fair enough, but these soecific beliefs are inactionable. There is no change other than suspicion of aliens. And I think its reasonable considering that sneaky sentiences are sneaky.</p>

        <p>If you can create a subculture, you can steer it into having meaning in the wider culture, January 6th for instance. The great part about ARG’s is that you can command it through syntax and a few agents on the ground. Cass Sunstein wrote a book about conspiracy theories where he said the establishment needs to direct conspiracy narratives.</p>

        <p>Oh man, I really need to check out that book, sounds excellent. </p>
<p>It reminds me of a <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2254010/">counter-conspiracy doc</a> I saw some time ago. Basically, an ex-FBI agent tells you that alien abductions/ cattle mutilations were government projects. He also tells that he was paid to lie to people-- so why trust him now?! Its a fascinating level of double-agenting... Playing both sides simultaneously.</p>
<p>Its funny though. He makes a compelling case for how/why the gov't would mutilate cattle (testing for radioactivity after <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gasbuggy">project gasbuggy</a>). So, in 2013, ex-FBI are saying aliens don't exist. Less than a decade later, ex-Servicemen now assure us they do exist. </p>
<p>As your meme shows, aliens are a great ploy for a NWO. But what was the purpose of surpressing the aliens-exist narrative for so long? Just to avoid looking like flip-floppers? Surpressing technology? Aliens don't really exist (tangibly, or here in our solar system)? General thoughts?</p>

        <p>You can get his paper <a href="https://ia800304.us.archive.org/22/items/CassSunstein/cass_sunstein_infiltration.pdf">here</a>. I think the main reason to suppress is twofold: 1 testing in secret, 2 building a massive cult to help direct. </p>
<p>I’m not convinced it’s all just government testing, but you gotta admit, if you’re a being from another planet and you want to observe in  relative secrecy, they’re doing a terrible job. You gotta turn the lights off on your craft at the very least.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the link, and memetics, and awesome discourse! :]</p>
<p>What bothers me about aliens is mostly the game-theory/optics (assuming they're amongst us). Like, these advanced races have felt content talking to egg-heads in underground bunkers for 70 years?! They [allegedly] cry about our governance, while o ly talking to our government. They [allegedly] cry about nukes, as if it isn't an element of understanding the universe. They [allegedly] cry for peace, while hording technologies that could end scarcity (via space flight at the least)... Fishy. Very fishy.</p>

        <p>Well there’s the rub right. If there has been contact, all it would take is rudimentary technology to put a few embryos into a few missing persons to raise a group of humans to infiltrate positions of power within the establishment. Within 2-3 generations, they would have complete control. They have the ability to steal a society out from under a population without anyone being the wiser. Maybe that’s a distant third reason for the UFO suppression, but that would explain the constant cries for peace while harvesting organs and DNA.</p>

        <p>King James Version Bible? </p>
<p>I love the flat-earth debate! Not that its actionable to my life, but just the absurdity. I think its the appropriate response to internet-athiests. </p>
<p>Like, the internet 'destroyed God,' by asking for burdens of proof. And, fair enough. Now, the same internet-athiests are required to proove their burden (the Earth is a 3D sphereoid), but are largely incapable without appealing to authority (a fallacy). Its hillarious. Not to mention that flat-earthers can use known maths to re-tell the size/distances of celestial objects. Ah, its great :] Not that I believe in it, or really care.</p>

        <p>Yeah it can be interesting. Sometimes they'll make a point I can't refute. Like the existence of a vacuum next to a non vacuum for example. </p>
<p>I'm not an anything-ist. I take everything into consideration as I learn about it, at the very least. And having never read any religious scripture of any kind, I'm definitely finding the Bible to be a great read.</p>

        <p>The media’s dispensing with the tin foil hat stigma against UFOs and disproportionately covering this as a means of diverting attention away from aggressive upcoming legislation to further encroach on the freedoms afforded to modern western society, as well as to distract from pivot after pivot on the position on vaccination, top-off shots and the growing number of adverse reactions they can no longer sufficiently hide.</p>

And a fake alien invasion would make a great screen for another power grab as the parasite class realizes the covid1984 scam has not achieved what they thought it would. Also an excellent distraction from the demise of all fiat currencies. Nice work!</p>
