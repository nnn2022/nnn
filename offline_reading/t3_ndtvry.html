    <strong>Doomers answer me this</strong>
    <p><h1>1 why has no one caught covid in Walmart, Lowe‚Äôs, and other big box stores?</h1>
<h1>2 when a husband and wife, son or daughter in the same house, one catches covid, the others don‚Äôt. How is this since it‚Äôs so contagious?</h1>
<h1>3 why bother to take off the mask when in a restaurant to eat? Can covid not enter you while having dinner?</h1>
<h1>4 why is the cdc wrong in lifting mask mandates?</h1>
<h1>5 what is the point in getting vaccinated for someone that probably won‚Äôt kill you, and you can still catch and spread it?</h1>
<h1>6 How does it feel to have this subreddit in your mind rent free forever?</h1>
<p>Please answer kthx</p></p>

        <p>Definitely not a doomer but lemme give you my best shot at answering all doomer-like </p>
<p>1) because if those big stores were as dangerous as restaurants then the gov would have shut them down too because they know best. </p>
<p>2) because they are properly distancing and behaving responsibly in their homes </p>
<p>3) again, because if it was dangerous then the government would mandate wearing the masks to eat as well, because they know best and care about us.  </p>
<p>4) the CDC is wrong because masks are the only reason that not everyone is dead and if you‚Äôre not wearing a mask then you should get thrown in jail for murder.  Masks need to become a staple forever.  </p>
<p>5) isn‚Äôt it better to risk a small rare chance at a side effect than get really sick from Covid and kill grandma? We know nothing about the long term effects from the virus! We also know no long term effects from the vaccines, but they must be safe because governments would never let out products that are harmful to the population, again, because they know best and they care about us.  Trust the science.  </p>
<p>6) you‚Äôre all a bunch of bigots! Racists! Murderers! Nazis! None of you care about grandma! The dangerous misinformation here will kill millions! </p>
<p>Hahaaaaaaaaaa how did I do? I feel like that‚Äôs their mentality pretty much.  </p>
<p>The real answer to every single one of these questions is that Covid-19 is a complete and total hoax and there is no logic behind any of these things.  2+2=5!</p>

        <p>Not a doomer at all. However, that first point is far too general and assumptive. I'm sure some people <em>did</em> get sick after doing so. </p>
<p>Point being, with these anti logical people your best bet is to be as concise as possible.</p>
<p>Edit: rest of the questions are top tier. Regarding the first one, I suggest posing it something like this: given the amount of people who refuse to mask in big box stores, how is it that they're mostly still around to continue not wearing masks in those stores?</p>
<p>Just a thought</p>

        <p>Because they're coming from a place of manipulated cognitive dissonance. They are <em>incapable</em> of seeing the reality, as it would absolutely shatter their worldview. It's a self preservation instinct which has been used against them, and us.</p>

        <p>Typically, I am pretty sure that if a person is known to have contracted the virus at work, said workplace needs to test ALL of their employees, and if there are further positive tests, the place is supposed to shut down for two weeks or whatever.  </p>
<p>Can't rightly say that I've heard of that happening with any major big box outlet. Heard and seen it happen with plenty of small and local businesses, though.  </p>
<p>There's also the whole "contract tracing" thing, but that's always been half-assed at best. Some businesses around here have sign-in sheets, but they're voluntary at most places. Except for one place that was insistent. It was a Popeyes restaurant. I really wanted that chicken, so I just wrote down an alias and a fake phone number.</p>

        <p>Yeah, speaking as a Walmart associate, we‚Äôve had a couple of positive tests and especially in the beginning, and we were told to monitor symptoms and do our screening as honestly as possible. The identity of the people who had positive tests were kept anonymous by managers for privacy, but my team (can‚Äôt speak for other departments) was assured if it was someone we were unlikely to have contact with. Never had to shut down once.</p>
