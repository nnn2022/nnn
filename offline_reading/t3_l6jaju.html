    <strong>What's going on with the vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been firm on my decision to not take any COVID-19 vaccine, but remain confused as to some things. I thought the vaccine won't give immunity, but according to the CDC, it will? Can we trust the CDC? I keep hearing about all these horrible side effects that people are getting, but I guess I'm just doubting everything now. The CDC's page on the vaccines seems pretty legit when it comes to explaining what the vaccine will do in our bodies. It doesn't seem dangerous, but isn't it? </p>
<p>I hate how unknown everything is. I haven't seen any real proof that the virus will cause sterility, for example, but I do believe it's likely. IS there any proof? </p>
<p>I won't be taking it, and it absolutely shouldn't be mandatory (even though it will be), but if there's any proof out there that it's not a good idea to take it, please, I'd like to see it. I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed with all the information out there.</p></p>

        <p>And to add to your question about sterility... They announced early on in the trials that women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant shouldn't take it. Now they're saying it's fine. Just one of the many many contradictions in this whole strange saga.</p>

        <p>There is no "proof" yet because it's untested. However, in all of the previous animal trials with this type of RNA "vaccine", the animals died and that is why it has never made it to market before. This time, they skipped the animal trials. Whatever is on the CDC website is just theory at this point</p>

        <p>Fact check: True. This is exactly why Moderna was on the verge of insolvency prior to this. I hope this is not what happens but if people start dropping like flies in a few months or years it’s going to be the biggest scandal in world history. Fauci will (and should) have a seat in Nuremberg.</p>

        <p>Tying in with your segue: at Nuremberg it was decided that chemicals wouldn’t be given to people without first having been tested on animals. This vaccine has not been tested on animals. It has not received fda approval, nor has it finished its trials—which I think are set to wrap up in 2023. </p>
<p>As far as evidence, people have died as a result of getting the vaccine. 23 people in Norway died in a short period of time, causing them to impose a law that anyone 80 or older is prohibited from being vaccinated. </p>
<p>They’re not saying that it works. They are saying that there are constantly worse variants of covid coming out. People die from the vaccine, and they’re calling it a vaccine and acknowledging that it doesn’t work like one, because it won’t actually prevent you from getting sick.</p>

        <p>Too much conflicting information out there to make an informed decision IMHO - even in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Like you said... It will create herd immunity - not won't - yes it will. It might kill a few old people - no it won't - old people shouldn't take it.</p>
<p>I don't know man. But I'll tell you this... I don't think I am in a high enough risk group to justify taking it. And I'm certainly not going to add to my risk factor by taking it.. that's my decision that I should be free to make. Everyone else should be free to make their own. Cheers.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's my stance too. I'm in the lowest risk group there is. Something like a 0.0003% chance of dying from it. There's definitely too much conflicting information, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I don't want to take it, and that I don't trust it.</p>

        <p>I think that’s just it, the unknown is the reason to question it. There isn’t any proof so to speak because there is no long term data. 6-9 months is not long enough to determine potential long term side effects. It could be that an mRNA vaccine is safe and effective, it could be that it doesn’t come with long term side effects, but we don’t know, because there is no long term data. It could also be that it causes side effects to fertility, we just don’t know. It’s the unknown and under developed information that is the cause to question it.  </p>
<p>They like to make people that question anything about this vaccine out to be stupid or uneducated, that’s just a physiological game they want to play to get you to cooperate. Don’t let it get to you.</p>
