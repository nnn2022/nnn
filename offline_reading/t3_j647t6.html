    <strong>Speculating about the prognosis or severity of a condition of another doctor’s patient you have not examined, based on incomplete media reports, is unethical</strong>
    <p><p>There have been several popular physicians and several “I’m a doctor” posts/comments on reddit that have speculated about Trump’s condition based on various factors. First it was hospitalization, then low SO2, then it was dexamethasone. All supposedly signs he was inches from death’s door. I don’t need to reiterate how frail these claims were.</p>
<p>Now that he was discharged on Monday (something his team of physicians already said was likely when he was admitted), it’s clear they’re rolling out more and more potential strings to pull about what alternative reality we live in. It’s the same bullshit from these feel-sicians who don’t actually care about practicing medicine as much as promoting their own political positions. </p>
<p>I know these are the “doctors” who have cashed in their ethics in compartmentalized instances where they stand to profit or, pathetically, get upvotes, but it still surprises me every time. It’s supposed to be the most respected profession in the world, and what these charlatans do with that respect is baffling.</p>
<p>Obligatory “I’m not a Trump supporter.” I’m aso not seething at the mouth about him, either.</p></p>

        <p>LiStEn tO tHe DoCkTuRz!... except Dr. Atlas, or any of the physicians caring for Trump (whose names I couldn't even find, by the way, because when I searched on Google and DDG all I got was bombarded with "orange man bad" articles). Or any other licensed medical professional that sees what a security/ hygiene theater circus this is.</p>

        <p>You only need to listen to the right doctors. Chances are, if they're on Twitter, don't listen to a damn word they say. Hell, you can't even be sure they're actually doctors and if they are it's usually a doctorate in something besides medicine.</p>

        <p>Oh, well the doctors and experts in my area, suddenly came out w/ a study saying “lack of pain and symptoms” is the newest symptom to watch out for. </p>
<p>We are clearly all going to die.</p>
