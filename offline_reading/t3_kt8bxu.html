        <p>Reading this, my first thought was, "Do I want to continue living in a world like this?" It's getting harder and harder to say "yes" in recent times. It just feels like the world is going to hell in a hand basket. A lot of people seem to enjoy this life, too, probably because they are the same as those who oppress us.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm a student about to be forced into 'online school' and I just keep thinking "do I care if I fail all my courses?" I've been screwed over so many times this year that my grades are going to be pulled from thin air anyway and I'm sick of people telling me "oh this is the most important year of your school life". I no longer care about getting good grades because they're preparing for the future, and with the way the future's looking I don't want to be a part of it. Either dead or somehow self sufficient and away from wider society works for me.</p>
