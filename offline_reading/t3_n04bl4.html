    <strong>Just another reminder that this ends when WE end it</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, that's obvious, but really. </p>
<p>Believe me, I hate confrontation. I wish I could be living my life like normal, freely, without everyone telling me how horrible, selfish, and wrong I am for being one of the few people that stayed sane. But that's not this reality. This reality is dystopia and we can't just sit around waiting for it to end because it won't until we stop it. If you fight this with everything you have, good. Keep it up and don't let them get you down or make you doubt yourself. </p>
<p>If you don't agree with this crap but still go along with it, you need to stop. And I know what it's like to be stared at and harassed in a store for just having a bare face and doing what you've always done. I know what it's like to lose friends because they turn on you, and have them refuse to meet with you because you could be "dangerous." I know what it's like to have people try to tell you you're not welcome here unless you wear a muzzle. I know everything that you're going through because I've been through it. </p>
<p>I know what it's like to break down crying at the state of the world and I know what it's like to beat a punching bag until it breaks and I know what it's like to be more full of rage than you've ever been before. I know you feel like you're at your breaking point. So am I, every day. </p>
<p>But it <em>is</em> possible to live without ever wearing a muzzle or going along with any of these other insane things, especially if you live in America, because we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights and that doesn't just stop because people choose to forget it exists or discount it because it's "just an old document." A business, private or not, is still a public accommodation and their right to make rules stops when it infringes on your rights as a condition of entry. It doesn't matter how much they believe they have the right to discriminate against you, or that this "isn't discrimination", they don't, and you might think that they do, and that's a conversation for another time, one that I would be willing to address, but right now, I need to talk about this. </p>
<p>I know how you feel but compliance is not how we win this. It might make things easier for you, it might keep you from being hassled, but the alternative is allowing this kind of society to thrive until we put a stop to it. If you don't care about yourself, do it for your kids, and if you don't have kids, do it for your future kids, and if you don't want kids, there must be at least someone that you care about. Do it for them. Further, we can't let this just go away quietly, then society will think that this is okay to do every time an illness or anything else comes along. We can't allow that precedent to be set. This needs to end, not because our leaders are so gracious as to give us our freedom back, but because we TAKE it back. </p>
<p>I know many of you feel like you have nothing anymore. Then in that case, you have nothing to lose. So fight. Don't be scared, and if you are, don't forget that as of today, there are at least 62.7 thousand people and no doubt thousands more that have your back. I always will. I feel beyond tired, hopeless, and enraged. But I am not going to stop. And neither should you. Ever. Make the choice right now that you will stop complying. If we don't stop this, if we don't make it clear how wrong everything about this situation is, we're doomed. There are lots of compliant people. Decide now that that's not going to be you.</p></p>

        <p>I am 100 percent right there with you. I am sick and tired of the compliance. We will lose what freedoms we have if we do not come together and stop the madness as a country. Thank you for the pep talk, I know we are not alone in this but it sometimes feels that way. FREEEEEEEEDOM!</p>

        <p>In Texas and Louisiana, the only place that gave me crap was Walmart, and my job. And that was only at the height of the hysteria.</p>
<p>It's crazy how many people are still complaining about the maskless, given that so many states have done away with the practice. Have they not gotten the memo?</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for this, it is exactly what I needed to hear. I am feeling so alone in school since all of my friends think I'm crazy for not wanting to get the vaccine. Somedays this world just makes me want to run off and live in the woods. The only reason I don't want kids is because I hate how society is right now. I don't want to bring kids into this world to suffer.  Thank you for taking your time and writing this, and giving me a little more confidence. I don't really go out much places anymore besides school and work but I do want to stop wearing my mask. The thing I am most scared about is being physically attacked since I am a 17 year old female and I don't know much about self defense lol. I'm not intimidating at all, so especially older people won't be afraid to confront me. I feel like older people think they're so much smarter than me and they can boss me around. But if I was with friends or family, I'd feel a lot safer. I hate the fact of me letting myself wear one just because I want to be left alone. Being left alone isn't possible if you don't fit in, especially in this case. I really want to join some sort of group that we can support each other and make a difference in my state, I just don't know where to look. my family  agrees with my point of view, which is nice. I want to make a difference, and I know that the first step is that i need to stop wearing a mask.</p>

It’s amazing how quick they were able to get the masses to comply and we are head into 2 years of this.. and so many are totally fine with medical tyranny and complete destruction of our economic system.

        <p>Where I'm at, every major store still requires masks, while most individually owned places aren't enforcing it. It's so hard to deal with this when everywhere you go, you're turned away at the door unless you have one on. My Walmart has greeters posted that will chase you down if you come in without one, but the regular workers inside don't bother if you take it off. I usually wear one walking into stores but take it off once I'm inside, but I know even that is a degree of compliance that we can't give if we want this to end.</p>
