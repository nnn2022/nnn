    <strong>NoNewNormal is destined to fail</strong>
    <p><p>The governments and whatever bodies are responsible for this shit know that if they engage us military action, it would mean that most of us would have nothing left to lose. What does that open? Revolution, civil war, etc, and we will probably win because of our huge number. They don't want that, their aim is to enslave and demoralize us as calmly as possible. That's why there's probably no microchip in the vaccine or sterilization agents. It would make people angry and possibly willing to take practical action. Those 2 will come when another crisis is manufactured to convince people to get microchipped or sterilized. I believe they will simply choose to go with a chain of manufactured "pandemics" to demoralize the average man into accepting all their vaccines, internet ID, sterilization, climate lockdown, microchips, giving up property,etc.
All this time, from what I see, we will only be advocating for change and exposing the lies. From what I know, no one seems to be organized for practical action (except Jurgen Conings who took a bunch of weapons and expressed his will to kill the virologist responsible for the decision-making about the pandemic in Belgium, and some protesters in Canada who blocked a truck to stop it from delivering experimental injections) and pretty much everyone is only advocating for our cause. This potentially revolutionary movement is destined to fail if we don't change, here why:</p>
<p>1) In order to change a society in a specified way, a movement should select a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective the achievement of which will produce the desired change.
But what are our goals? Bring back to old normal? Very vague, and the current historical trend of globalism, end of privacy, centralization and government control doesn't help it, so it is doomed to fail.
Prosecute war criminals? Fighting the enemy by going through their own system? Good luck with that.</p>
<p>2) If a movement aims to transform a society, then the objective selected by the movement must be of such a nature that, once the objective has been achieved, its consequences will be irreversible.
Let's look at the people who did act in some way cited above. 
Jurgen Conings: His goal was very clear (stopping virologists from deciding the fate of his country) but it wasn't irreversible. Even if he succeeds to kill the virologists in power, other ones could just be put in place easily and granted private security. 
The Canadian road blockers: their goals was very clear and not ambiguous, the problem is that even if they miraculously manage to stop every truck out there, helicopters will be rolled out. Their objective's consequences are easily reversible and won't even acheive much.</p>
<p>3) Once an objective has been selected, it is necessary to persuade some small minority to commit itself to the achievement of the objective by means more potent than mere preaching or advocacy of ideas. In other words, the minority will have to organize itself for practical action.
The advocacy of ideas alone cannot change society, at least in the modern today, so some group will have to be organized for the purpose of applying methods more potent than mere advocacy of ideas. This group will ordinarily include only a very small minority because only a very small minority can be persuaded to act.</p>
<p>4) In order to keep itself faithful to its objective, a revolutionary movement should devise means of excluding from its ranks all unsuitable persons who may seek to join it
This can be important because the admission of unsuitable persons will promote the blurring or perversion of the movement's objective.</p>
<p>List of unsuitable people that might blur our movement: Qtards 
Actual antivaxxers 
Troll bots 
Paid doomer brigades 
Politician worshippers 
Etc</p>
<p>Tldr:</p>
<p>Preaching and advocating for a cause rarely changes people's behaviour</p>
<p>In any conflict situation in which victory is uncertain, it is always essential to concentrate one's efforts on the achievement of the single most critical objective.</p>
<p>The objective must be of such a nature that once achrived, its consequrnces will be hard if not impossible to cancel.</p>
<p>If we want our movement to be successful, some of us will have to be dedicated to it and actually act instead of preach</p>
<p>We must exclude anyone who is susceptible of blurring our goals, at least in the group that will organize itself for practical action.</p>
<p>If you think I'm wrong, want to criticize my post or want to suggest anything, I'd love to hear it, please comment.</p></p>

        <p>What has been done very successfully is to prevent anyone emerging as a clear leader of the "unvaxxed".</p>
<p>I think they know they're are lots of people who be figured out the narrative doesn't add up, but that they also know we are pretty harmless without having a central 'voice', or any access to the media channels they own.</p>
