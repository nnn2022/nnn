    <strong>Yes, it's just a mild flu.</strong>
    <p><p>Here are some stats and links to share with those who shoot you down for calling COVID a mild flu, and speaking the truth</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus.</strong> The number of deaths was estimated to be at least <strong>50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.</strong> Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. </p>

<p><strong><em>This translates to a mortality rate of 10%</em></strong></p>
<p>By contrast, the official death total worldwide as of today, June 6, 2021 is  <strong>172,630,637</strong> <strong>confirmed cases</strong> of COVID-19, including <strong>3,718,683</strong> <strong>deaths</strong>,  or just over 2% mortality <br>

        <p>Average age of death is up near average lifespan. Hardly any deaths under 5. And a LOT of inflation. The population back then, 1.5 billion. The population today? 7.8 billion.</p>
<p>This stop qualifying as a pandemic last year before they scrubbed the quantitative definition of pandemic.</p>
<p>It was hyped to get rid of the president.</p>

        <p>What you cite as</p>
<p>&rt;confirmed cases of COVID-19</p>
<p>Is far less meaningful than almost everybody thinks it is.</p>
<p>That number is actually a tally of PCR+ results, and nothing more.</p>
<p>We have no way to know howany of those are false positives.  We DO know that:</p>
<p>1) this microbiology technique was never designed or intended to be used for this purpose, and the Nobel laureate inventor of it specifically said that it should not be used for this type of purpose</p>
<p>2) the volume of performing this laboratory procedure was ramped up souch, so fast that un/der-qualified people were hired practically off the street to perform the intrict work</p>
<p>3) even when misusing this test, the appropriate number of cycles to do so would be 25, yet labs were running it up to even <strong>58</strong> cycles!</p>
<p>4) hospitals which are in business to maximize their stakeholders value were fiscally motivated to find patients COVID+, regardless of the truth.</p>
<p>5) estimates for false-positive rates have ranged from bare minimums of 1% under all the best circumstances, but minimum of 3% under realistic sensible circumstances, up to <strong>90%</strong> false-positive rate under actual circumstances.</p>
<p>6) we have no way of ever knowing how many reported PCR+ results were duplicate results, or retests of the same person with unchanged circumstances</p>
<p>7) through 2020, estimates for actual infections, regardless of symptoms, ranged from 5x to 100x the PCR+ results, with the majority of them being around 22x to about 55x, and somewhere around 30x-32x as a happy medium</p>
<p>8) in Nov 2020, the WHO estimated that about 750,000,000 people worldwide had had an infection of SARS-CoV-2.  That IS the number that org estimated.  That said, some of us though it was a low-ball, and the actual value was probably higher, such as even about 1,500,000,000 by Nov 2020.  Since then, we'd expect growth to the point that we should be well into the herd immunity gradient by now (just from natural infections).</p>
<p>9) even around (IIRC) May 2020, CDC estimated that 40% of all people that had had an infection with SARS-COV-2 didn't even know it, meaning no symptoms.  Again, that WAS their number, and again some of us thought it was low; maybe the actual value was even up to 80% or so.</p>
<p>10) the official numbers are hardly meaningful; much less meaningful than most people seem to think</p>
<p>11)  the official number of deaths again pretty much incorporates much of the above in terms of wrongly attributing the virus, fiscal motivations, attributing "suspected of" as COVID deaths, and other factors which I won't go into as this is already pretty long.</p>
<p>As I said elsewhere, influenza infections and flu illnesses and flu deaths are in no way comparable, because the numbers are generated in completely different ways.</p>
<p>This virus does have a couple tricks that influenza doesn't have in that the S spike itself, completely independent of the virus, seems to have danger of it own.</p>
<p>Another trick this virus has is that it has a segment of code that, all by itself, independent of the virus replication processes, can cause the body to express the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.  In fact, the body can normally express this cytokine when fighting a virus.  In the case of a person that has adequate nutrition for the immune system to properly regulate itself, then the body can reduce it's own IL-6 expression in response to the IL-6 expressed due to the sequence in the virus.  If the person does not have adequate appropriate nutrition, their body can fail to properly regulate it's endogenous IL-6 expression.  This can be a significant part of the excess cytokine expression that is the root of the COVID disease processes.</p>
<p>Another reason that this pandemic and other pandemics (such as the 1918 influenza pandemic) are not very comparable is the general knowledge of, and availability of the numerous nutrients required by the human immune system to function properly (especially to not become dysregulated and cause severe disease).</p>
<p>Science first started identifying essential raw materials (called "vitamins", short for vital amines, but soon renamed to "vitamins" since they realized they can't all be amines) in 1912, only several years before the start of the influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>Since then, science has learned a whole lot about nutrition and the human immune system, and all along the pharmaceutical industry has desperately tried to marketeer people into a stupor and ignorance of this scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>There are also various tensions for and against availability of nutrition.  On the one hand, we now have many seasonal food grown in hothouses year round, and distribution from around the globe.  There is also <em>some</em> general idea that a more diverse diet is better than fewer foods, among most people.  Yet on the other hand Big Food has ever worsening farming practices, reducing soil health, plant nutrition, health of animal products, meanwhile constantly offer smaller amounts at higher prices.  There's also been an explosion of highly exclusionary diet fads.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you can analyze "official numbers" as much as it takes you to climax, but it's just not very meaningful.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that we DO KNOW that significant portions of the population do NOT intake enough of one or more (often multiple) of the roughly TWO DOZEN different raw materials known to be required by the human immune system to function properly, and various pharmaceutical corporation products also do nutritional harm to people (such as loop diuretics and PPIs), so that whatever numbers you are looking at are not even about the virus itself; they're mostly opaque obscured confused mislabeled unidentified statistics of the nutritional status of the population.</p>
<p>The cross sections of people known to have dramatically the worst nutritional status is THE SAME as the cross sections of the population "observed" to have the worst results with COVID.</p>

        <p>According to an analysis released Thursday, May 6 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The actual count at the time of the report may actually be 6.9 million deaths, more than double official tolls. The IHME released their report based on modeling, which has proven faulty in the past. HME’s forecasts last spring were criticized for projecting many fewer deaths than actually occurred. In March 2020, the organization projected fewer than 161,000 deaths total in the US. Then in April 2020, the group revised their death toll projections through August to be 60,415, with an uncertainty range between between 31,221 and 126,703 deaths. The projections were out of step with other epidemiological models, which were anticipating far more casualties from Covid-19.</p>
<p>Even if the IHME models and projected death count is correct, we would have between 7.5 and 9 million deaths. Further, this would be associated with a higher number of COVID cases worldwide, that were simply not detected through testing. Worst case scenario, even if the number of cases reported by the WHO is correct and the actual death toll from SARS-CoV-2 is 9 million, this is still just over 5% mortality, half that of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic.</p>

        <p>Even so we have to differentiate between types if deaths.</p>
<p>In the case of Covid-19, we had a massive population of very old people due to a 20-25 year population boom that started 80 years ago.</p>
<p>Life expectancy is \~79.</p>
<p>This is important because deaths have been increasing, predictably, for a while. Just as this was used against us in 2020, it can be used against us again.</p>
<p>Remember, population jumped from \~750,000 a year to over \~3,000,000 per year for many years... So of course, old people are dying as old people have always died throughout all time.</p>
<p>No, I'm not saying their deaths don't matter -- I'm saying we usually don't turn the world upside down when old people die and none of what's happening was really about the virus.</p>

        <p>I looked into the IHME model last year, and honestly the model had no realistic chance of accurately predicting deaths because it was build around a s-curve model (i.e., it couldn’t predict multiple waves), that was putting massive weight on masks and lockdowns. It was more or less a propaganda tool, and I say this as someone who knows people that worked on it.</p>
<p>I’d say the only realistically useful data point we have is excess deaths, everything else is just too unreliable, and right now excess deaths do not point to our death estimates being wildly off. Even excess deaths is a pain since they are based around some estimated number for the “proper” amount of deaths, but they at least give you a reasonable upper and lower bound.</p>
