    <strong>Feel like I'm taking crazy pills</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like I'm going insane. I live in a pretty liberal city, which is fine. Agree to disagree, live and let live, all that shit. I'm also fairly eccentric myself, being the type of person to wear a gothic cloak rather than a winter jacket. So I'm used to being the odd woman out. I am. </p>
<p>I've been getting most of my exercise at home, perhaps to an excessive degree. But the government took my livelihood away from me, so it's not like I have much else to do. Occasionally though, it's good to get outside, and my two year old daughter needs fresh air too. </p>
<p>I could count on one hand the amount of people not wearing these stupid fucking masks. OUTSIDE! The mandate doesn't even apply to outdoor spaces, but there they all were faceless regardless. It took all of my self control not to grab one of these freaks and shake them. </p>
<p>When did the state of critical thinking degrade in this country to such a point that people will partake, en masse, in what's frankly medieval superstition out of fear of the miasma the government has then convinced is going to kill them? Actually, no. It's worse than medieval superstition because at least the plague doctors packed the beaks with anti-microbial herbs and were wearing what can only be described as a primitive hazmat suit. </p>
<p>I don't want my kid growing up thinking that blind obedience and the erosion of all liberty is normal. It fucking isn't. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills and I just want this all to be over.</p></p>

        <p>You aren't crazy.  I'm tired of the people that cross the street or walk on someone's lawn to avoid me as I walk along a sidewalk.  It's like a game of COVID chicken.   I make sure to snicker audibly at their behavior.  </p>
<p>They call it social distancing but it's really anti-social distancing.  What do we lose as a society when we can't shake hands in greeting anymore?  </p>
<p>We're running a terrible global experiment in human psychology.  I don't think it's going to end well.</p>

        <p>My neighborhood is liberal, but along with all the "hate has no home here" propaganda on every house are some of the most hateful people I've ever met in regards to having an differing opinion on masks/lockdowns or just about anything in general.</p>
<p>98% of people in my town walk around double masked while completely alone. I'm the only person on my block that will check the mail in my own driveway or walk the dog maskless. It's like my neighbors, who are all highly educated, dropped all critical thinking and reasoning to compete with one another on who is the biggest MSM social justice warrior. </p>
<p>I literally don't understand them or how they've bought into this enough to sit on their deck as a family masked. Blows my mind.</p>

<p>lmaooo omg i relate to this so much. these people are the worst cause they need to signal so hard. they should just all put up signs that say "I'm a GOOD person" or something cause that's reallly what its about, they're "not BAD" and it must be advertised !!</p>
<p>and yes it is 100% true that they become really hateful assholes the moment they find out they aren't in uber liberal company.</p>

        <p>Here I thought I was the only goth living in a liberal stronghold haha. But yeah for real, I've seen the escalation of authoritarianism over the past 10 years, sometimes I think it was just ignorance but I could've swear the world was a more sane place back then, even with its myriad of problems.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration with kids, I don't have any myself yet but I'm already trying to figure out how not to let the government dictate how they should or shouldn't think. It's even scarier when some governments even threaten to take them away if you don't comply with their demands. All you can do is teach them the skills to be self-reliant and that hard work is the only thing that will get them far in life.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. Hang in there. More will come out awakened on the other side of this. It's really hard for many people to step out of their box and think about something different that goes against what they believe is true and what authority is telling them. It's traumatizing to many to think that they could be wrong.</p>
