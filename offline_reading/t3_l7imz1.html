    <strong>Why are they so vicious?</strong>
    <p><p>After a run in with some particularly nasty maskers who want disabled people banned from shops because they can't wear masks, I've been shocked at how vicious these people are. Do they not wonder what happened to them in the space of 10 months, that they are now advocating for disabled people to be forced to stay home and not go shopping, effectively removing the rights of disabled people to be included in society? For years disabled people were shunned by society, sometimes locked away. We made so much progress, and all it took was a virus with a 99.74% survival rate for the public to think it's acceptable to lock them away again and remove their human rights.</p>
<p>I remember life very clearly pre March 2020 and all of the rights and freedom we had. I took it for granted, because I never quite realised back then that people could be so easily turned into vicious authoritarians by fear and propaganda. I thought we all valued our rights and freedoms and would never give them up. But now, so many of the things that are being pushed for by governments, the media and most sadly of all, the public are incredibly cruel, tyrannical, evil and dystopian. It's like society has been turned upside down and everything good we knew and accepted before is now being questioned. It's like in the past 10 months these people have had this conversation with themselves:</p>
<p>- 'Do we need disability rights now? No, they're a nuisance, let's ban them from shops!'</p>
<p>- 'What about freedom? Freedom is for selfish people! Selfish dumb people, how dare they want to be free! Freedom is dumb, let's rename is freedumb! '</p>
<p>- 'What about free speech? Free speech is fine as long as I agree with it! Anything I disagree with is dangerous misinformation!'</p>
<p>Have these people ever studied history? Have they ever watched any dystopian film where these topics were explored in depth to point out how utterly terrifying and awful they are? What is wrong with these people? I was brainwashed myself at the start but only for two weeks, and the worst I ever did was jump out of people's way with a scarf over my mouth before someone pointed out I was being terrorised by the news and to stop watching it. I stopped watching up and woke up. </p>
<p>What makes some people turn into vicious, tyrannical, authoritarians who argue for the constant removal of human rights and who are unable to see what they have become?</p></p>

        <p>Yes this does make sense. It would explain the brutal 'it's for the greater good' statements, all whilst people are dying of cancer, going bankrupt and committing suicide. They seem to be able to justify the worst cruelties as long as the media tells them 'it's for the greater good.'</p>

        <p>Yes, scary how they've gone for some of the weakest in society, the disabled people,  isn't it. You can guarantee that if the media said 'old people spread the virus, argh!!!' these people would be starting threads to argue for old people to be locked away. Or if the virus said 'anyone who wears yellow spreads it!' they'd be attacking people wearing yellow. We saw it last year when the media said 'joggers spread it! People in parks spread it! Children spread it!' and all these people went nuts and got aggressive with those respective groups. Teachers here refuse to even teach because the media convinced them that children were 'vectors of disease.' They seem to have abandoned their common sense and their humanity in March 2020 and still haven't found it.</p>

        <p>It’s terrifying how effective the fear propaganda has been. Didn’t take long at all. The government didn’t need guns or military, they weaponized society. Families, friends, neighbors, strangers are now hatefully pitted against either other. It’s really horrible and sad and frustrating.</p>

        <p>I suspect there was some kind of organized operation to change public sentiment that occurred at some point around July/August when there was the shift from "we're all in this together" to "this would be over if it wasn't for x, y, z".</p>

        <p>Absolutely. It has been frighteningly effective. Overnight, seemingly normal people have been turned into frenzied, vicious, power crazed bullies wanting the army to shoot people on the streets. To cover their cowardice they say it's 'to save lives' but strangely, they don't seem to mind about all of the cancer deaths and suicides.</p>

        <p>Their logic is based on illogical theories. Fear is definitely the driver and because of not being informed, insecure &amp; all the propaganda they rather depend on the government to “save” them. Idk just my observation ..</p>

        <p>I've always said that it was like there were a bunch of woke sleeper cells that were activated in the spring once the crackhead died resisting arrest. Half of America became foaming racists who hate white people and want everyone to wear a muzzle. I remember before that half of people didn't even wear a mask, then a flip switched and everyone went insane.</p>
<p>I just wonder what their mindset was one year ago. Were they always like this? Did they always hate everyone and they just kept it under the surface? It's almost like they were all waiting for an excuse to go crazy and reveal what they always thought.</p>

        <p>Really interesting reply and I've been thinking the same thing. It's like these people had a latent, underlying authoritarian gene that got activated by the media in March 2020 and went into full on attack mode. I'm assuming looking at history that some of these people will only wake up if millions end up dead in camps. I pray to god it doesn't end that way again. It's horrific seeing so many people today would have fitted in perfectly into Nazi Germany.</p>

        <p>The ones I spoke to said they weren't scared for themselves but wanted to 'protect vulnerable people.' All whilst wanting to remove the human rights of disabled people.</p>
<p>Edit: I do think you're right in that fear is playing a big part for a lot of them, but some of them just seem to be enjoying bullying and harassing people. It's like they've finally got an excuse to be vicious when previously they always had to reign it in.</p>

        <p>Fear is the basis of their entire existence at this point. That is the obvious distinction between the two Earth’s we are seeing: 1 faction being ruled by fear, the other refusing to.</p>

        <p>They are beyond "being scared" They are controlled from the propaganda of the media. Plain and simple. No amount of fear can make a human being treat an other human being like crap. Plain and simple</p>

        <p>I think the real fear is that they aren't as good of people as they thought and they're trying to keep up with the definition, or maybe just the fear that others won't believe they are good people.</p>

        <p>Yes, fear and cowardice = really nasty behaviour. They cover it up by virtue signalling phrases like 'it's to save lives!!!!' and 'you're killing people!!!' etc but really they are only concerned about themselves and are struggling facing up to their own cowardice.</p>
