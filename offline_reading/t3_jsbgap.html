    <strong>How Many of Us Have Actually Had the 'Rona?</strong>
    <p><p>Just like the title says. I'm curious as to how many of us with our mindset have actually personally had to deal with the virus?</p></p>

        <p>My uncle died of it early in the pandemic. He was 79, in a nursing home, and had a lot of conditions. </p>
<p>He would never want to see us living like this.</p>

        <p>Most of wouldn't get tested so wouldn't know.  I've had symptoms a couple times of the last year, I didn't rush off to get tested because they are just mild cold symptoms.   Only idiots rush off to get tested for something just for the lulz.  Seriously, what does getting tested accomplish?</p>

        <p>Someone who supports all of this shit just admitted to me today that's why everyone in their office gets tested a lot. They get two paid weeks off if they test positive and the entire rest of the office gets to WFH for two weeks.</p>
<p>She tried to pretend they were doing it for "holy" reasons, but I said "but what about everyone around you not getting paid and losing jobs and not getting to go out and do anything fun if someone tests positive?"</p>
<p>And that's when she admitted they all hope to test positive because of the paid leave and WFH and the fact most of them are probably not staying at home while they wait those two weeks. They're doing whatever they want to do. Which is limited, given lots of things are still closed, but they are using it as a "vacation" to do less work.</p>
<p>They vote democrat because they want to help the poor, because repubs see everyone poor as a leech looking for a handout. But that's precisely the problem, a lot of these people <strong><em>are</em></strong> leeches. I'm a moderate, so I want to help the poor, but I also want to motivate the leeches to stop leeching and actually work. These 'soft-hearted' democrats don't want to believe leeches exist, or they live in a fantasy world where we can afford leeches and it's really just because others are so wealthy and greedy that the poor exist at all. Some wealthy are greedy, but some poor are leeches. Why is there zero middle ground anymore?</p>

        <p>Before the panic but during the intro of it to my area my whole household became ill with wildly different symptoms one after another. I was the worst off - still coughing once they started the panic like a month later. I was like "ah, that's probably what it is" and then I went on with my life (including not going out while ill because that's what I normally do !)</p>

        <p>I got it in early February. Probably. No idea, this was before the testdemic. Took a day off work, sore throat, runny nose, a dry cough. Felt 100% in a week. We destroyed the country for this?</p>

        <p>I think I had it the week of Thanksgiving break. I think every adult <em>(kids were all symptom-less)</em> in the ice rink had it Nov/Dec. And then everyone else I knew outside of the rink had it Dec/Jan. By Feb, I didn't know anyone who was sick, but whispers started of a lockdown possibly happening in the future. March Friday the 13th was the last normal day in the universe before insanity descended.</p>
