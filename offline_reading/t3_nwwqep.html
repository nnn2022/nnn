    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 18/x: The most serious problem was loneliness: More than 33% of people living in nursing homes no longer recognize their relatives. At least 7% died there because of loneliness.</strong>
    <p><p>The protective measures in nursing homes during the corona pandemic have led to loneliness and isolation among the residents, according to the management of the nursing homes. Occasionally people died from the loneliness they experienced. This is the conclusion of a report by the Institute for Medical Sociology and Rehabilitation Science at the Berlin CharitÃ©.</p>
<p>If residents were infected they were isolated in every second facility. According to the report, social offers such as church services or game evenings are no longer available in four out of five homes that offer such a thing. Meeting rooms were closed in many cases. </p>
<p>Although almost all institutions tried to enable their residents to participate in society by providing smartphones or enabling contact with relatives in front of the window, more than 90 percent of those surveyed observed effects on the residents.</p>
<p>According to the information, the most serious problem was loneliness; more than a third reported that residents no longer recognized their relatives. Around seven percent of the home managers reported severe grief, depression and dying from loneliness.</p>

        <p>That is really tragic ðŸ˜”</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the article. I agree that the elderly should never again be socially isolated. That was much too cruel. I also remember this article about an 89 year old woman who was more scared of dying alone than she was of Covid:</p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/nyregion/dying-alone-coronavirus.html</p>
<p>Many elderly people, including the ones not in nursing homes, wanted to be able to spend time with their loved ones, but restrictions prevented them. When you don't have much time left and you know this might be your last family gathering/celebration, it must be even more excruciating to have to cancel/postpone and wait to see your loved ones.</p>
