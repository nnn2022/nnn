    <strong>Hospital won't allow my mom to visit my dad</strong>
    <p><p>My dad had an accident that potentially requires surgery. They don't allow any visitors, not even my mom. They are married. My family is scared, my mom is breaking down. How is this legal? Is there anything at all that can be done?</p>
<p>Edit: I blame the hospital for letting his condition get to this point in the first place. When he first contacted the hospital they did a virtual call where I'm betting they couldn't see the extent of the infection through the 240p webcam, so he wasn't admitted, initially.</p>
<p>UPDATE: idiotic hospital staff misdiagnosed my dad. He was released and we are going to have a normal Christmas. Thank goodness for this. Many others are not so lucky and are forcefully separated from their families. I wish everyone here a Merry Christmas despite the lunacy of this era.</p></p>

        <p>It is not legal, nowhere in the law could it be legal *but* people don't question it because "oh no, scary corona" but with a bit of resistance that should not be an issue at all! Hope your dad is okay!</p>

        <p>That's exactly my opinion. Are they going to shoot someone who tries to go in and visit? I won't lie - I am scared to try. If I get arrested then I won't be able to take care of my family. If I get hurt I could have a miscarriage.</p>

        <p>What country are you in?</p>
<p>Nobody here can give you sound legal advice. If I were in your situation I would study my government’s website, where they publish law, and might also consult with a legal practitioner. I would make a record of what was said to me, and would ask for the hospital to provide details of which laws they were acting under.</p>
<p>I’d consider reaching out to legal charities, who might be able to help, and would also contact my political representatives, requesting their assistance in the matter.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

        <p>Call a lawyer, the news, any and all resources. This happened recently to one of our good friends. Her husband was in major accident and they would let anyone not even his wife in until they protested outside and the news covered it. Then the his wife only was allowed in, which is better than no one advocating for him. I would call a lawyer because I believe they have to allow an advocate in, Incase of an emergency. I’m sorry this is happening to you and this worries the shit out of me for my own family. Keep fighting!</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear you three are going through that.  I hope his recovery is smooth whatever the outcome.  </p>
<p>I hope you find answers you like, but you may not.  This is how they "help" now.  They wonder why deaths keep going up.  It's because they are alone and scared and hopeless.  They die after being abused by these ridiculous so called safety guidelines.  </p>
<p>Keep your mom calm if you can.  Give her lots of love.  Do positive visualization excercises regarding your father together.  May be cheesy, but imagine sending love, feelings of safety.  Etc .  Or more body focused healing/recovery centered visualization.  </p>
<p>Might not help, but I think it couldn't hurt.  Best wishes.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen several stories like that and always think “do these people really just allow others to tell them they can’t sit with their family member in the hospital”.</p>
<p>There is muscle and there is will and then there is the overpowering wave of force that is the state and the media that the hospital will bring down on you for attempting to use either. So yeah, it’s scary. But I still don’t think I could stop myself from head butting a few nurses until they pulled me from the hospital room with security.</p>
<p>Give them a reason to post those sad unmasked “look how bad my face looks” pictures for social media.</p>

        <p>Well I certainly couldn't do that... If I were a man rather than a pregnant woman I would certainly consider it. My mom is not exactly in perfect health and is too compliant to demand access to my dad. My siblings are too concerned with not being arrested so they can take care of their babies and toddlers, which I get. It just seems like everyone lacks the strength or the will to do anything of substance.</p>

        <p>If the hospital do not allow visits, that means they are up to something! This is why I do not trust hospitals. GET YOUR FATHER OUT OF THERE! They are probably planning to kill him using COVID-19 as an excuse. </p>
<p>There is reason why they do not want visitors because they do not want to show the empty wards, OR they are planning something and they do not want prying eyes. Conspiracy theory? May be? Could it be true? Oh yeah, and I wouldn't put it past me.</p>
