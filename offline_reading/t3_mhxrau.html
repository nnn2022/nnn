    <strong>What was the biggest reason behind mass covid testing, bioweapons research or to push the narrative?</strong>
    <p><p>It never made sense to me why they had so much testing for a virus they had no treatment for and was not a problem for over 99% of people; especially when they were already making everyone act like they already had the virus.</p></p>

        <p>I never understood why they needed that testing method. If asymptomatic people were capable of spreading, then their normal breathing would have to be enough to spread, so there should be a measurable amount of the virus exiting my lungs on every exhale.  Yet you need to reach into the pits of my sinus cavity to try to find something worth testing?</p>

        <p>multi faceted for sure...
compliance, fear, authority...also,
I am pretty sure they are using nanofibers and other crap on those swabs.
Swabbing the cribirform plate is dangerous enough as it is...
Why do they have to go that deep if this scamvirus is so infectious?
could just spit or nasal swab the tip and you would be good to go.</p>
<p>cribriform plate its the perfect place to insert medication, vaccine, foreign agents if you want it in the brain ASAP.
possibly infecting you or delivering medication or nanobots or even metals ect.</p>
<p>I am sure we will see a whole lot of brain cancer in the next 5 years because of it.
Lots of microscope videos out there showing what I described here.
They are now starting to find them in masks as well...the blue ones that everyone wears everywhere.</p>
<p>Same story...</p>

        <p>The testing inflates covid cases, strengthens the government's position and abuse of power.
I am certain this is a globla effort to push the new human/AI era which will make the rich richer and the poor more ever reliant on the state. Its the great reset playing out before our eyes. The Davos forum said this...., fact and people are still walking around with their heads in the sand. It's madness. 
We need to wake up and push back</p>
