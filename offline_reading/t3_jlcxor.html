    <strong>A simple question, hope it doesn't offend.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm highly against the new normal, and I love that there are spaces where skeptics can discuss this stuff, but why does it seem that among skeptics there seems to be a lot of stereotyping and closed mindedness floating  around. Honestly shouldn't all of this be opening us up to bridging some of the gap between different ideologies on account of the fact that we're having those very ideologies policed on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Doomers are awful, but everyone from a left wing, queer or feminist ideology is not a doomer and a lot of us are sick of being lumped in with them like a lot of conservatives, libertarians and right leaning ppl don't like being lumped in with white nationalists and Christian fundamentalists for example. </p>
<p>Regardless, keep questioning and keep your mind open to the possibility that somebody who looks like you're enemy may in fact be your ally tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>Skeptics are the only people who can change their long-held beliefs quickly when new (convincing) information becomes available.</p>
<p>I used to be big on libertarianism and the Austrian school, until I came across Anthony Migchels' website 
https://realcurrencies.wordpress.com and realised that Mises and Rothbard were simply controlled opposition, set up to shield the real enemy, and like many other, Austrian school is also a fake body of knowledge.</p>

        <p>I'm cool with anyone who thinks critically about what's going on.  I don't care about politics or even what conclusion you come to.  As long as you take in the data and consider all factors I appreciate you.  It's the people just blindly watching CNN or Fox and letting the TV think for them who cause me frustration.</p>

        <p>I don't see alot of that here, but I only comment and don't argue. I think when people get into somesort of misunderstanding then both people defend the side they lean towards and they can end up sounding stereotypical or making exaggerated arguments as an example to get the other person to understand. I think people just can't express their thoughts well in text.</p>
<p>But you are probably right too. I feel like there's some hypocrites here who claim to be for personal autonomy and anti authoritarian, but don't think weed should be legal or abortion. Topics like lockdowns might be good place to come together though and hopefully everyone can open their minds to other people's perspectives more.</p>

        <p>I'm a queer leftist feminist (albeit not the kind with a trendy liberal arts degree) who is vehemently anti-lockdown, and I'm so sick of how the US mainstream media wants to pretend we don't exist. As if everybody who doesn't worship Trump is just staying at home like good little boys and girls...please! I do cringe at the occasional comment in these subs referring to mask wearers as "soyboy betas" or whatever, but overall I've found this and other anti-lockdown subs here to be refreshingly welcome towards anyone regardless of political affiliation.</p>

        <p>Oh i dont care about party affiliation or identity politics, nobody does here, But if a queer person does promote masks for example the easiest is to also lap in an insult on said identity. Mind you the only way we'd know if someone was queer would be if that person mentioned it so we'd know it of some importance to them we know what they identify with. So yeah. Hope that clears something up. We accept you whatever you are, the only exception to that is authoritarian fascist idiot.</p>

        <p>But what comes productively of insulting their identity? It just makes you look like a bigot, even if you aren't. Don't you think for anybody else who sees that, you could potentially ostracize them or give them the implications that they wouldn't be welcome in a forum with you? See you can't just pretend like there's no fear in the queer community of being judged for their identity, and it isn't identity politics just to announce your identity. Isnt it making it about said identity once you insult them?</p>

        <p>Good point but I also believe in insulting people, people too weak to take a punch especially one written in text. Idk I dont think they'd be much use whatever their identity. It's how I was raised and how I've lived my live. I've been actually misgendered once, like completely I am born a man but my aunt or rather my mom blaming it on my aunt bought this hideous silver jacket with fur lining and it was sooo girly I hated it but she said, you aunt bought it and youll appreciate it. In a dark rainy day 3 boys around my age back then asked for directions approaching me from the back with "girl" Horrible but seeing as I knew what I was wearing I didnt blame em and they understood the situation, I could have gotten offended and rage on them. But I did not because I understood the situation and the reaction, this is a sensitive subject on all sides and sometimes it brings forth an emotional response, it's never useful, but sometimes you just want or need to insult someone, its almost never productive but its some much needed stress release. So in conclusion I prefer people with tougher skin.</p>

        <p>I understand your point. I personally don't think I'd take that approach because from personal experience with dysphoria, I know that an insult directed around gender identity can pierce even the thickest of skin. Once someone attacks my gender expression, it brings forth a reaction that no other particular type of insult can. It brings back the feelings that come from being outcast. Being misgendered as trans is kinda received differently because of how often it is done with malicious intent as opposed to a simple misunderstanding (at least in my experience).</p>

        <p>Yeah, my exact response would be, "man up" the whole problem people alike you have in general is this symbiotic need to be accepted. One thing I'll give advice to you, no amount of acceptance or love will make you happy. Learn to accept yourself, love yourself and forgive yourself. You made the choices in your live, to live with them is up to you, not me, not anyone. Any idea and in this case personality or choice that can't stand up to scrutiny is not a good one. Though love is the best love and A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link and I'd love for you to be the link that keeps it all together. Learn to see see words for what they are, vibrations of air that our brain interprets as certain key's related to phrases and expressions. You choose to let things get to you or you choose to see vile people who baseless insult you for who you are as worthless and so are their words in that case.</p>

        <p>I don't love the phrasing but I can understand your point. Nothing anybody says can change who I am. I still think acceptance is important especially now since we're being isolated, though you're right about it not being the only thing or the most important thing. I appreciate the fact that we could have this discussion and I'm thankful that it didn't turn into the mess that a lot of my attempts to discuss this turn into.</p>

        <p>I always try to stay decent but also direct as shit. You were very tolerable as well and I don't give 2 shits what you say you are, because in the end you're a decent well versed person and I know I say it should not matter to you, but you have my respect for it, regardless</p>
