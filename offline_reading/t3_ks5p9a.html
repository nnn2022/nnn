        <p>A "pro vaccine advocate".... sorry, can't feel the least bit sorry for him. The more of these "pro vaccine advocates" that drop like flies, the quicker people will wake up to what is going on. Even <strong>ONE</strong> death from the noxious concoction is too much and it means that the (so called) "science" is flawed! And it should NOT be called "science" but quackery. It is better that their priests be the ones that fall, rather than innocent (duped) people. I know this all sounds harsh, but Pig Pharma has NO RIGHT to experiment on people!</p>

        <p>Almost agree with you, except I see pro lockdowners saying the exact same thing about people who refuse the vaccine and how they 'have no sympathy for them if they die of covid.' We need to be better than they are. We need to be the empathetic ones. The world will come around.</p>

        <p>No. I want people (en masse) to learn, which means that I want people to experience the natural and predictable consequences of their decisions. This is not punitive - it is in fact out of concern and care for the future of humanity. </p>
<p>We paid a terrible price (multiple times) to learn the importance of long-term testing, and that short-term safety is no guarantee of long-term safety. And we have completely thrown out that lesson because of a minor virus and a lot of hysteria. </p>
<p>Forgetting this lesson is unspeakably dangerous and stupid, and if these vaccines are not a disaster, then we will be encouraged to be similarly lax in the future - until we learn the lesson again. Who knows what kind of horrible price we’ll pay? Better to pay it now and prevent the issue from arising again in a few years. </p>
<p>And if you want to be sympathetic, save it for the laymen getting vaccinated. Medical professionals should know better. This doctor NEVER would have prescribed a new drug to a patient with such little available safety and efficacy data - and he should damn well know that, while vaccines are often great, we’ve had some rather horrific mishaps with them as well. He knew better, and he chose to make the wrong decision. Like everyone else, he deserves the natural and predictable consequences of his actions.</p>

        <p>I understand where you're coming from and agree that people need to learn. However, little thing called tough love, you can let someone suffer from the consequences of their actions and still empathize with them.</p>

        <p>I agree eveybody deserves compassion. It should be a free choice and nobody should be stimagtized or forced. Only thing is I now see posts of nurses who are presurized to vaccinate. That is pretty bad. Everybody should make their own informed decisions.</p>

        <p>More of a social distance kind of guy, extended and repeated lockdowns can have a ripple effect that can cause other public health problems let alone economic ones. They should only be used when absolutely necessary. But back to my question that has yet to be answered by anyone here: What is the flawed science behind the Pfizer vaccine?</p>

        <p>How rushed these vaccines were. Usually vaccines take years to develop and a thorough set of trials. One also has to ask why masks and lockdowns are still mandated even after receiving this vaccine. That is suspicious.</p>

        <p>Science wasn't flawed- it was faked.  Hydroxychloroquine was and is a safe and effective treatment against covid-19.  And even if it didn't save the patient, at least it didn't kill them as it wasn't a dangerous drug.  It was safe.  And yet after the very first mention of it, it was demonized by the governments and pulled from the shelves in some countries (France for example had it as Over the Counter, but pulled it and even placed it on the poison list).  Why?  Because they wanted the virus to be feared.  Having a safe and effective treatment that was also very cheap was a detriment to that plan.  </p>
<p>Science wasn't flawed- it was faked.  Never before has an mRNA "vaccine" been approved by the FDA and that's true today.  It was ONLY allowed to be used under the EUA.  That's the Emergency Use Act.  It's a footnote that is used as a loophole.  It's why you're wearing a mask right now.  Masks everywhere all have the same warning label- "This is not approved by the FDA to be used in a medical capacity" or words to that effect.  Every single mask on the market has that label.  ALL of them.  But they're allowed under the EUA as long as there is an Emergency.  Thus, the governments need to keep Covid an emergency or they CANNOT USE THE VACCINE!!!  It was only approved under the EUA because it wasn't approved by the FDA.  </p>
<p>And... that somehow seems to not bother anyone.</p>

        <p>And people who would’ve otherwise gotten over the virus with no issues. Sad.</p>
<p>With a survival rate as high as this one, I really don’t see why a healthy young person would take their chances with a vaccine, especially considering it hasn’t been proven to prevent transmission. Their “I’m doing it for everyone else!” narrative goes out the window.</p>

        <p>So I'm definitely safer without the vaccine since covid didn't kill me.  Hell, I didn't even get sick from covid.  It was fought off right away by my immune system.  If I were to get the vaccine and suffer an ill effect from it, that would already put me worse off than I was from the virus itself.  And since reinfection isn't possible, I stand to gain nothing from the vaccine even if it goes well.</p>

<p>You don't take it because you might get sick, but because who you might get sick. Because hospitals are overcrowded at the moment, medical personel is giving up and resources are spread thin. This is bigger than you or me.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Here's a study that covers that.  Also, your precious government is calling every disease a covid disease.  There are articles out there celebrating the eradication of influenza.  100 years of the flu and it's suddenly gone?  All because the government needs people to be afraid of covid?  A virus that hit once and only once.  A virus that was gone months ago.  </p>
<p>The flu hits every single year so imagine how long they can keep someone like you afraid if they simply tell you that you have covid- not the flu- and they can keep telling you that year after year since the flu keeps coming back!   You were never ever afraid of the flu so now, they'll just call it covid and you'll be afraid of it for the rest of your life.  </p>
<p>Also, the test itself is a joke- it's pumping out false positives at a rate of over 90%!  It was reported on by the NYT, ruled on by the court in Portugal, and even admitted to by the guy who created the damn test.  He didn't design it to be a diagnostic tool because it fails in that regard.  It fails hard!!!  And he's dead now and can't be here to tell everyone how stupid they're being for letting the hospitals use it for just that purpose.  </p>
<p>So no, there is no reinfection.</p>

        <p>And my hospital is empty right now.  I assume you know what the word empty means, right?  I say that because people seem to come back with anger and rage anytime I tell them that the hospital where I work is not overrun.  I will not be getting the vaccine.  I don't need it.  The vaccine has not been approved by the FDA and there is no risk of reinfection.  My hospital is not overrun.  Maskless asymptomatic spread is so close to zero that it's not statistically different than zero.  Masks haven't been proven in over a hundred years to stop viral transmission anyway and only help to stop coughing and sneezing mucus spray.  That's all they do.  I am not coughing or sneezing.</p>

        <p>Not enough people understand that masks only work on the symptomatic because when you are symptomatic [the symptoms] cause the much larger and more abundant sprays to be trapped.</p>
<p>Think about it this way.  You can’t see someone breathing but you can see someone sneezing.  If they had a mask on you wouldn’t be able to see them sneeze.  Now this begs the obvious question of how are you going to make someone sneeze in their mask?  You can’t so ask them to stay home.</p>
<p>I have been a germaphobe my whole life after a bad bout with asthma as a little kid.  Anyway I have never felt comfortable around people coughing or sneezing, I’ll regularly move 5 isles over if I hear someone sneeze.</p>
<p>I am 100% in favor of public shaming, shouting down and ridiculing anyone who is out and about with symptoms.  I wouldn’t support but could even understand a mandate that required you to stay home if you were symptomatic.  I understand the inherent problems that would come along with this such as “what is a symptom” and we all know that with cOvID everything is a symptom.</p>

        <p>Covid is gone.  Covid no longer exists.  What we have now is flu season.</p>
<p>Not one single credible study shows any kind of proof that you can get covid over and over.  Covid ended months ago.  </p>
<p>Ever check out the articles saying influenza has been cured?  It's because they are now calling the flu Covid just to keep people afraid.  It's now the flu.  Covid means flu now.  Covid also means the common cold.  Covid also means allergies.  Covid means everything and anything!  </p>
<p>You're a germaphobe- I get that- but 2020 is over.  Covid was left behind.  Even if the virus was indeed real (and there's mounting evidence that it wasn't), it's not anymore.  It's just everything we have already had for the last 100+ years.  </p>
<p>So it's back to normal for people like you.  Back to the same way you and everyone else lived before 2020 happened.</p>

<p>Seems like I'm partially wrong. I was expecting a loooot more cases of second infection, but <a href="https://www.gezondheidenwetenschap.be/gezondheid-in-de-media/kun-je-twee-keer-besmet-worden-met-het-coronavirus">they did happen.</a></p>

        <p>Almost every single case was only verified, at best, with the PCR test which has been proven to be pumping out over 90% false positives.</p>
<p>The PCR test is unreliable.</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">Portugal court rules test as 97% false positives</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">New York Times- up to 90% false positives</a></p>
<p>The article you linked didn't link a single one of the cases it mentioned so I've no way to verify how each one determined it was a reinfection.  If they weren't sick and they simply tested them until they tested positive twice, that's not a verified reinfection.</p>
<p>There is no test on this planet that is capable of diagnosing Covid-19.  Elon Musk got tested 4 times in the same nostril by the same nurse on the same day using the Rapid Test.  <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/13/elon-musk-says-he-took-four-rapid-covid-19-tests-with-split-results/">Two tests came out negative and two tests came out positive.</a></p>
<p>It should really start to bother you that there's no way to test for a virus that has the exact same symptoms as the flu.  The CDC lists the symptoms as exactly the same.  There is no difference between the two viruses and they are now calling flu patients covid patients.</p>
<p>We are looking at a virus that can't be seen, can't be diagnosed, and can't be verified.  We're hiding from smoke and mirrors.  At no point has this virus been isolated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-isolated-idUSKBN28E2SB?utm_source=reddit.com">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-isolated-idUSKBN28E2SB?utm_source=reddit.com</a></p>
<p>According to this "fact check", they isolated the virus by taking someone who appeared to have covid and isolated antigens and RNA strands... but RNA strands that are released to reprogram other cells to generate the virus are the same in just about any virus that reproduces in this manner.  The very fact check even says that they didn't isolate the virus itself!</p>
<p>When will this start to bother you?</p>
<p>The symptoms of covid are so generic, that anyone could "have covid" if they sneeze!  Asthma, the common cold, influenza, allergies, or any virus or condition out there that does the exact same things each and every Winter and/or Spring.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not saying the virus was completely a hoax- I'm merely stating that no, you cannot verify at all that reinfection happens since there's no way to test for Covid.  And if there's no way to test for Covid, there's no vaccine for Covid.  And if there's no vaccine for Covid, why are we taking a Vaccine that's experimental and has never before been authorized for use?  It's only temporarily approved now under the EUA.</p>
<p>Even if the virus is NOT a hoax, our response to it definitely has been.</p>

        <p>I agree that this is very likely correct, because that's how damn near every other virus works. But this effect wasn't studied formally in the trials, so there was no data at the time of the EUA. There is absence of evidence, not evidence of absence.</p>

<p>Backup of the screenshot in Berenson's tweet, which is the deceased doctor's wife describing what her husband experienced before dying: https://linkpicture.com/view.php?img=LPic5ff68e9c8c30c87272370</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of what his wife wrote (the name omitted here but can be seen in the original publicly shared post):</p>
<p>"The love of my life [...] Died the day before yesterday due to a strong reaction to the COVID vaccine.   </p>
<p>He was a very healthy 56 year old, loved by everyone in the community delivered hundreds of healthy babies and worked tireless through the pandemic.    </p>
<p>He was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine at MSMC on December 18, days later he saw a strong set of petechiae on his feet and hands which made him seek attention at the emergency room at MSMC. The CBC that was done at his arrival showed his platelet count to be 0 (A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.) <strong>he was admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute ITP caused by a reaction to the COVID vaccine. A team of doctors tried for 2 weeks to raise his platelet count to no avail. Experts from all over the country were involved in his care. No matter what they did, the platelets count refused to go up. He was conscious and energetic through the whole process but 2 days before a last resort surgery, he got a hemorrhagic stroke caused by the lack of platelets that took his life in a matter of minutes.</strong>   </p>
<p>He was a pro vaccine advocate that is why he got it himself.   </p>
<p>I believe that people should be aware that side effects can happened, that it is not good for everyone and in this case destroyed a beautiful life, a perfect family, and has affected so many people in the community     </p>
<p>Do not let his death be in vain please save more lives by making this information news."</p>

&rt;In a conference call with reporters, the U.S. public health agency said allergic reactions are occurring at a rate of 11.1 per 1 million vaccinations. That compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million shots.  </p>

        <p>I'm a physician; if I presume the account is accurate, i.e. 'healthy', accurate time line, actual '0' platelet count, this is 'incredible', not to be believed. Even if you assumed either route of an effect (suppression of bone marrow, OR actual direct destruction of platelets), it could not happen in that time frame OR would not present that way. The former mechanism would take weeks to months to show any clinical signs, and would likely be non-lethal. The latter would have multiple obvious effects and symptoms other than only signs of poor coagulation.</p>
<p>Either a pre-existing condition and unrelated, OR the reported conditions are not close to being accurately reported.</p>

        <p>Apparently you're not able to make the cognitive leap, so let me spell it out. The point of this sub is personal choice and personal risk assessment. People should be able to make the choice whether to lock themselves in the house, wear a mask, decide whether it's safe to send their kids to school. People should be able to make a choice whether to receive a COVID vaccine or not. It's the mandates that are the problem.</p>
