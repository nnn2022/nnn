    <strong>I cant fucking go on like this anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>My country's government just announced that they're going to continue remote learning until the end of 2020. I'm literally on the verge of crying, because school is literally the only time I leave the house, and now I have that gone as well. Just a few days ago they announced that they were gonna reopen schools from September, and I was excited to go back if it meant I could escape the confinement of my house. I'm sick of being inside. I'm going to be starting the most important years of my life, and it's going to be through online learning. And the worst part is that my "friends" are so okay with it, even praising the government for taking away their rights. Fucking hell. I cant stand it anymore. I've been in quarantine for 5 fucking months, and now add 4 more to that. 9 FUCKING MONTHS OF NO SCHOOL. I'd also like to add that my country had the strictest lockdowns ever, and they're one of the countries with the most coronavirus cases. So why fucking bother with the lockdowns if the cases never even went down. We mandated masks, banned flights, banned any social interactions for what? Increased taxes, joblessness and mental health risks. To anyone who still supports such diabolical behaviour, fuck you. You've ruined mine and a increasing number of people's lives with your fear mongering.</p></p>
