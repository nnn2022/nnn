    <strong>Remember when “Red Pill” was the side of Reddit about picking up women? The definition changed over the last 17 months.</strong>
    <p><p>I used to casually browse “The Red Pill” and it was a bunch of men who were “red pilled” about women and used “red pill” strategies to do stuff like date multiple women and dominate their wives. It was creepy and weird, and it’s now heavily  censored by the Reddit overlords. (I don’t support censorship as full of it those guys were) I am not even sure if it actually exists or it got yeeted away. </p>
<p>But the definition completely changed. Prior to 2020, other political/ social groups used the term to describe an awakening, but it was still a defining term for the “picking up women” community. </p>
<p>Now the term “red pilled” means awakened to the way politicians and people in power treat and manipulate the masses (us).  </p>
<p>I wish I could go back to the time when “red pill” was a group of men trying to pick up chicks.</p></p>

        <p>That subreddit started out as meaning an awakening to the truths about being a man and to reject the way society changed to tell men how to act.  Red pill has always meant awakening ever since the matrix movie came out.  Just because that sub was transformed by incels over time seeking a way to get laid and circle jerk on the woman hating, doesn’t mean that it was something to be defined as picking up chicks.</p>

        <p>It’s gotten so fucked in my area that I’ve met many people who think that buying into mainstream media narratives is what it is to be red pilled. I simply do not get it. That somehow what the news and politicians say is the truth behind the veil.</p>
