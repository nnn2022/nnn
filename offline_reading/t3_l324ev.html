    <strong>The idiot at the bowling rink!</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so fed up with everything!! My friends and I were at the bowling rink. We were in our own lane, talking amongst ourselves, but we kept our masks off (we are all conservative, homeschooled teen nonbelievers/freethinkers). We were all having a great time, until about an hour in, some old guy staff member arrived. He eyed us, and then slowly, condescendingly, walked over and told us to put our masks on. We just ignored him and kept talking and having a great time. He then roughly GRABBED my female friend's arm and told her to put a mask on!  </p>
<p>The man continues down the lines of bowlers who are not wearing masks either. There was a lady who told him she wasn't sick (and neither were her kids" and wasn't within 6 feet of everyone, and therefore didn't need a mask. My friends and I were rooting her on. They went back and forth for a few seconds, before I hear him yell, "Shut off lanes 19 and 20, they are refusing masks!". He then came up to her <em>again,</em> and told her and her kids to put masks on. She then said, "Call the cops on me, let's see what that does for you." He then called the cops and kicked her and her family out. The cops came and had a talk with her. I don't know what happened after that.</p>
<p>My friends and I continued to chat with our masks on, but on our chins. He was just GLARING at us for the longest time, until all 9 of us decided to turn around and glare right back at him. Needless to say, we left right after we finished our game.</p>
<p>Like I said, I'm just soo fed up with all the doomers.</p></p>

        <p>It’s not about the mask. If he really thought there was risk he wouldn’t have come close enough to freaking grab her arm!</p>

        <p>He grabbed a 12 year old girl. That’s assault. Next time call the cops on him for harassment and assault.</p>
