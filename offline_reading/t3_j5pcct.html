        <p>It seems like the meaning of a "case" shifted when convenient, now to include anyone who has the virus present in their body, regardless of whether they show symptoms or not. And in spite of that, many still believe that a case equals to hospitalization and/or a death sentence. I personally wouldn't count something as a case unless a person has the virus and has been hospitalized as a result from it. They have purposefully lowered the criteria for what a case is and how deaths are attributed to it just so they can get some big and scary numbers out through fearmongering propaganda in order to push their agendas with the public's approval.</p>

        <p>there are two kinds of 'cases', a political case and a medical case</p>
<p>a political case means a positive result for the rona by the manufacturing technique known as the "rt-pcr test' and the results of these 'tests' are easily manipulated by ramping 'cycles' up or down.</p>
<p>a medical case requires the presence of symptoms, regardless of any test. a 'positive' test result without symptoms is not a  medical case.</p>
<p>the general public is being sold 'a bill of goods' and they are buying and paying the price with their own 'normal' lives.</p>

        <p>My biggest problem that I have for all of the testing is that this is the first time in the history of infectious diseases, that we have tracked and made a big deal about asymptotic cases.  Why are we testing asymptotic people?  Why are they even getting tested in the first place?  In years past, I didn’t go get a flu test unless I felt sick!</p>
