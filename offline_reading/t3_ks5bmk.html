    <strong>Do you have to have a Covid vaccine to get into the medical field now?</strong>
    <p><p>I know first responders are forced to have it because they made my neighbor whose a firefighter take it. My plan at the start of 2020 was to get certified as a phlebotomist. Do that for work for 12 dollars an hour while doing some side work from home. I‚Äôd also go to medical school and get my associates degree in nursing and start gaining experience. I wanted to be a forensic pathologist, you basically take samples from bodies and look them over. I don‚Äôt even want to work with people but I‚Äôd have to begin with the nursing degree and gain experience in that to quality for what I really want. I don‚Äôt want the vaccine because I have had severe allergic reactions before where my whole body puffed up and throat started closing. I also already had Covid and it was so minor that I don‚Äôt understand why it would be required for everyone needing to be vaxxed for it.</p></p>

        <p>Optional at all the major hospital systems here. Tons are refusing it, myself included. I am more than happy to take my chances with COVID, which is a better known  risk (which is minimal to me)</p>

        <p>A lot of current medical workers are refusing the vaccine, including tens of thousands of nurses in the Netherlands alone. Given this I wouldn't think so.</p>

        <p>Not all firefighters are forced to. I think its very dependent on what each place decides</p>

        <p>I have family and friends in the healthcare system working in multiple counties within Virginia and <strong>none have been mandatory.</strong>  üôè</p>
<p><em>(not to say that won't change)</em></p>
<p>There are many stories popping up about how a MAJORITY of healthcare workers aren't vaccinating. When the stories are put on Reddit the comments are alarming, as the majority of comments call for mandatory vaccinations due to ingorance and fear.</p>

        <p>I'm a home health nurse in SC and so far have not heard anything about needing it. An aide I work with recently took it and I only hope she suffers no ill effects since she's not exactly healthy or young.</p>
<p>I do worry there will be some stigma against healthcare workers who choose not to get it. I'm refusing as long as I'm able. I don't want a vaccine that's been rushed. But at the same time if it's mandated it'll put me in a compromising situation and I can only hope for the best.</p>
