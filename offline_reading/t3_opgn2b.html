        <p>SS: Her story is a complete fabrication and embellishment as she tries to fear monger and push for vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;April 2020 - Pregnant, prohibited from Covid Ward (see link below)
&rt;October-December 2020 - Her hospital's peak Covid hospitalizations
&rt;December 2020 - delivers baby
&rt;January or April 2021 - Returns to work, ward unknown.</p>
<p>At the earliest she returned to work in January, but we all know she probably took maternity leave...putting her back to work around April.</p>
<p>Her county's death rate from April is 6-12 patients per day, and there are multiple hospitals in her county. In essence, she is lying about everything, the numbers don't add up, and her previous article about her family last year highlights she was deliberately kept away from Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>The lies need to stop.</p>

        <p>Many of my friends and family work in healthcare settings like diagnostic labs and hospitals <em>(which I have also worked for years).</em> </p>
<p>The <strong>FEW</strong> that have gotten the jab had their job threatened and were scared to seek legal recourse. In my area, the local hospital serves 2.5 million people annually. There have been &lt;50 Covid Deaths since Jan2020. </p>
<p>My best friend's mother runs the Covid floor, and some peers (F&amp;F) of mine work in the same hospital and all agree it's BS. The Covid floor has been empty nearly everyday and the busiest day was back in March2020...</p>
<p>Most of what we see now are the cascading effects of a record number of delayed treatments, coupled with increase mortality due to fear porn scaring people from seeking treatment for their ailments, coupled with the largest layoff of healthcare workers in history in 2020... <em>but it's just labeled Covid because that is exponentially more profitable since there is no treatment for it, medical errors can also be labeled Covid which has been the 3rd leading cause of death in the past decade</em></p>

        <p>I live in one of those red midwestern states that they keep blaming for new cases. In my county (which is not small) we have had 3 deaths in the last month. </p>
<p>My aunt worked at a local hospital and retired this spring. She told me it was never how the media portrayed it at least at her hospital. </p>
<p>In Alabama where this news comes from, there are like 550 people in the hospital with Covid. In a state of 5 million. The cases where I am are much lower than that and I have out of town relatives thinking people are just dropping dead left and right and they are afraid to come here. </p>
<p>My county, yes where we’ve had 3 deaths in 4 weeks, has been on the news for a surge in cases and deaths. Sure it’s a surge, up from 1 or 2 last month. It’s honestly all so ridiculous at this point.</p>

<p>Isn't it interesting when you web search a blanket, broad term like "ICU capacity during pandemic" and you are blasted with fear porn propoganda...</p>
<p>Yet our anecdotes of local regions, just like web searches of local regions, paint an entirely different scenario.</p>

        <p>If I'm not mistaken, the goal is to keep the ICU at 100% capacity. Hospitals make a shit load of money keeping the ICU packed. It's where they get to use all the crazy expensive medications and tubes and fancy equipment. Every time my wife hears, "the ICUs are at 80% capacity" she is like, "why is 80% capacity a problem?" She has worked on ICU floors her entire career and now she is the DON at an ICU specific hospital. The whole damn place is ICU patients. Every room is used most of the time. I hear about that shit every night when my wife gets home.</p>

        <p>My wife is a nurse practioner in an ICU hospital. They get some of the worst of the worst. So bad that the nurses are limited to 2 patients at a time. They haven't seen a single covid case during this second or third or whatever wave this is. They have only had to deal with 2 or 3 cases since it started. Those cases ended up at her hospital because a smaller community hospital, about 45 minutes from where we live, was short on nurses and they needed a place to put the people. So, I'm not sure where all these terrible cases and deaths are happening but, they aren't happening where we are. And, we are about 20 minutes outside a big, southern city. </p>
<p>Now, 2 or 3 days ago, 4 or 5 nurses showed up at work and popped positive. All at once, on the same day. None of them had any symptoms. All but 1 were inoculated. So, maybe the vaccine is lessening symptoms or the vaccine is causing the positive test results. Or, maybe, all the PCR tests are still fucking useless. I'm going with option 2. I think the inoculations are causing, not only injury but, positive test results. If so, this would be ideal for the ultimate objective. They kind of make the vaccine look useless but, more than anything, they allow our media and all the church of covid members to blame those of us, who just don't trust the fucking experimental medication, for all the cases and deaths that are caused by the inoculation. </p>
<p>Bottom line, the nurse discussed in this post is full of shit. Or story is horse shit. Things like this show the desperation that everyone should be questioning. In fact, and I would have to find the stats but, I don't think there have been any deaths of younger people in the state of Alabama. This doctor seems to be talking about younger age groups. Alabama has seen any deaths in younger age groups for quite some time. I will see if I can find those stats. </p>
<p>It's all a bunch of shit that will continue to get worse. The media, the medical professionals and our public servants have gone off the rails. They have been outed and there's no going back. They are full steam ahead on a global scale.</p>

        <p>I don't know if they would tell me, but if I ever get tested positive, I'll ask what the number of cycles was (not sure if that's the correct term). I've heard they are using the max 45 for unvaxed and 28 for vaxed. What a racket!</p>
<p>I've also heard that the EUA for the PCR test itself requires using the manufacturers' recommended threshold, which are very high.</p>
<p>Even Fraudci has said that any hit over, I think it was 35, is garbage.</p>

        <p>If this woman didn't have a Facebook page it would've been impossible to know if she even existed. Based on everything I've seen, she wouldn't even be allowed any covid patients. She was moved away from them awhile back, for health reasons, and I just don't think she would be around them now. I could be wrong but, with what I know about healthcare facilities these days, I just don't think she we would have contact with that high risk population. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I will look up the data in Alabama. If I recall, they haven't had many or any deaths amongst young people recently, making this idiots story an even bigger pile of dog shit. I will get an update on this a little later.</p>
