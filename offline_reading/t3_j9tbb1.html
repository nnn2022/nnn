        <p>The obsession with rules is mind boggling. About a dozen of the Tennessee Titans got it and both the actual NFL and /r/nfl are obsessing over a couple of times where coaches removed their mask to talk.</p>
<p>Because 53 grown men with families, friends, parties, and events, who work out and hit each other 6 days a week, couldn't possibly get sick unless there was a moral failing and lapse in obedience in front of cameras. It's that one coaches fault.</p>

        <p>The NFL theatrics are driving me nuts. None of these guys are sick so who gives a shit if they're testing positive? It's not like they work in nursing homes. If they're not sick let them play, if they're sick don't play. Enough of the nonsense.</p>

        <p>I've stopped watching the NFL and sports in general. People think it's because of the BLM and kneeling stuff, no. No, not at all. I couldn't give a damn less about that. </p>
<p>It's because every time I turn a game on, every time I turn the news on, every time I go into my fantasy team, I'm reminded of this bullshit. I'm sorry, but empty seats with cardboard cut outs, fake noise, and mask theatrics everywhere drive me away. Baseball was the worst with this shit when they tried to make the players social distance by sitting in the stands. </p>
<p>Like give me a fucking break, you know as soon as the cameras come off that they don't give a fuck. Call me weak, I don't care, I can't watch this shit with these theatrics. I honestly think this is a bigger reason why ratings are falling than the BLM stuff. Sports feel so fake this season.</p>

        <p>Sports feel so fake this season.  You hit the nail on the head.  Football used to mean a lot more to me because it was about a city coming together behind its team.  The fans in the stadium were a critical element of this because they represented a microcosm of the city or state that their team represented.  This elevated it above a mere "game" to a chance for local pride and bragging rights.  Without fans present, its hard to see football as anything more than a bunch of dudes being paid millions of dollars to toss a ball around.  It is so empty and meaningless.  I dont know if it will ever interest me again, now that my eyes have been opened to how petty and childish football feels now.</p>

        <p>I said when this started that if I wanted to see sports with no fans, I’d go watch D-League (recreational, beer league) hockey at the local ice rink. Not professional sports with cardboard people in the stands.</p>

        <p>The obsession with masks is beyond insane. Masks are the talisman, the visible symbol of their religious cult. The mask is the utmost protector from the plague, and thou shalt not taketh the mask off, for the plague shall spreadeth to all if doth remove it for one second. These morons actually believe masks repel the virus like garlic does to vampires.  It's complete idiocy and medieval quackery masquerading as 21st century science and reason.</p>

        <p>&rt;The study offers insight into the reality that tens of thousands of Americans are acquiring COVID-19 on a daily basis despite overwhelming adherence to mask wearing. Masks simply aren’t working to “slow the spread” or “stop the spread.” The study also dismisses “public health experts’” claims from individuals such as Dr. Anthony Fauci and others that Americans are not following the guidance being disseminated by the CDC and other disease control agencies.

        <p>Exactly! Ive been telling my family this but they are libtard sheep. Anyone that puts a mask on is signaling to the NWO pedophiles that they are ready to submit to vaccinations and having their wombs and minds controlled by the liberal shadow government. I dont know why they cant see it. Its fucking pathetic. Plus masks just look so damn effeminate that any man that puts one on immediately looks like a little manbaby</p>

        <p>Masks have always been something someone with visible symptoms of a respiratory virus wears for only as long as they have visible symptoms, to <em>mitigate (not completely get rid of)</em> the chance that they will spread the virus. This is why if you've ever been to the doctor during flu season, they will give a person who is sneezing and coughing a mask to wear in the waiting room. This is so it is <em>less likely</em> that the droplets from their uncontrollable sneezing/coughing can travel far enough to infect people. It doesn't mean that the person is now unable to spread the virus at all...it just means the chance is lowered. Masks were never meant to be a panacea against stopping respiratory viruses. </p>
<p>But now you have complete idiocracy with this whole covid mask obsession. None of it makes any sense because asymptomatic spread is virtually nonexistent, and everyone wearing masks at all times, because they perpetually have covid but never even know it, is lunatic quackery. It actually makes things worse, and makes the virus more likely to spread, because 1. the majority of people wear cloth masks, which unlike surgical masks, do absolutely nothing, they are simply too porous and 2. People are always touching their masks, setting their masks down on surfaces, wearing the same mask for hours and hours, even days, etc. Masks become nothing but a harbor for various pathogens, doing far more harm in this stupid situation.</p>

        <p>It's almost as if masks aren't an effective community measure for controlling viral spread. This is doubly true for the asymptomatic individuals who don't produce the dreaded droplets in statistically significant quantities. If only the last 45 years of research all pointed towards that conclusion. (/s)</p>
<p>I'd be curious to see the percentage of individuals who test positive that always wear their masks and follow the guidelines versus those who generally just live their lives.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I only know of two people who have tested positive. Both work in healthcare and therefore have to wear the gamut of PPE and follow the laundry list of protocols. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, other people I know who refuse to follow any guidelines and have been going to every social gathering, wedding, birthday party, etc. possible since March and haven't had a single case amongst them or anyone they know.</p>

        <p>I agree. I've picked up some who listen and they listed a counterargument. I listened to them. </p>
<p>The consensus is that cloth masks are the least effective and actually make infection risk of the wearer higher than being unmasked (they seem to allow the particles to permeate through the damp mask and hangout by your mouth longer), however, they still filter particles and if nothing else is available, and you are healthy, it may be worth wearing. </p>
<p>The best masks (and they do work) are N95 masks. They filter the proper particle size and reduce transmission as well as infection rate for the wearer. </p>
<p>Make sure the mask fits tight and that your breath isn't flowing out the sides so that the mask can actually filter. </p>
<p>So wear N95 or equivalent (KN95 work too) masks and cloth masks if you are fine with the risk. If not, find medical masks and make sure they fit tight. </p>
<p>Voila. The absolute truth about masks has been given. No political bullshit, no lying, fear mongering, or bias. Just the facts.</p>
<p>Masks alone aren't very effective if you're shoulder to shoulder with people. That's why good hand hygiene, respiratory ettiquette, and social distancing are key. </p>

        <p>Great, but what percentage do those who aren't getting covid report? If it's 99%, this says the opposite of what's implied now.</p>

        <p>I like this theory!</p>
<p>We can conclude, then, that by not letting me have a dog, my landlord is putting everybody at risk for Covid, and this has to stop!</p>
<p>I think I'll get a golden or a dalmatian. I hear they're especially good at stopping the virus.</p>

        <p>I'm just pointing out that 85% of covid positives reporting mask usage is meaningless if we don't know the general mask usage statistics. I'm anti-lockdown myself, but weak arguments aren't going to help the cause.</p>

        <p>That certainly sounds plausible, and there's no denying that a year ago, the consensus was that masking did little for the general public.</p>
