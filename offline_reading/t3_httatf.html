        <p>Not surprising. I've been seeing this shit since March, and it's not slowing down at all. This is why I am so cynical about the whole thing. Most people are legit just like the guy in the post, and that is not an exaggeration.</p>

        <p>Eh i actually don‚Äôt know anyone that‚Äôs in this deep and I know a LOT of people (I‚Äôm extroverted so naturally seeking out everyone who is on my level about this). I know people who aren‚Äôt trying to go to a restaurant yet but work in offices and dont shit a brick every time they go in. They just make themselves scarce elsewhere but also still have friends over to the house. Everyone I know assumes everyone else is doing some level of comingling with a lot of other people and it‚Äôs accepted. No one is going to a club yet but the level of caution is nothing like it was 2 months ago.</p>
<p>I have a subset of friends who will go to restaurants/bars with me and who ive seen at weddings amidst living in a place with the ‚Äúworst in the world‚Äù per capita case count. (Btw the wedding was 2 weeks ago and no one at the wedding got covid so riddle me that).</p>
<p>My parents are both 100% skeptics like me and my dad goes to bars/restaurants with me and flies to where I live all the time from one hotspot to another. He loves his work and travels for a living and hasn‚Äôt stopped. My dad and mom‚Äôs friends also are skeptics. They know a few acquaintances here and there who aren‚Äôt as ‚Äúbrave‚Äù but most of them have comorbidities and are isolating but not suggesting everyone else pack it in for them.  But my parents and their friends are in their 60s and don‚Äôt want to spend the latter part of their lives holed up. My parents at the start said ‚Äúit I die from a virus, it was meant to happen and could‚Äôve easily been the flu that did me in.‚Äù They like their 99%+ odds, tho. </p>
<p>On Facebook, i see far more people on vacations to all different places around the country. I see people have normal graduation parties. I see people renting beach houses in Florida and North Carolina and New Jersey. I see people on packed beaches, i see people camping, I see people at bars and restaurants and people celebrating their anniversaries and weddings still happening and birthday parties and baby showers. I see my friend‚Äôs kid‚Äôs sports teams practicing and playing. I see resort parking lots in my city full of cars. </p>
<p>The things like this that you‚Äôre seeing written above are by people who had a lot of problems before this all went down and this has activated a horrible part of their psyche that has driven them to interpret this in such an insane way. This shit is a minority thought perpetuated by foreign bots who want Americans to get demoralized and think that some kind of majority actually believes this shit. I can tell you for all my personal social media that life is going on for a solid amount of people. There are cities like San Francisco that I‚Äôve heard are kind of wacko but all the non wackos are the ones going elsewhere to be normal so I‚Äôm not gonna generalize and say there‚Äôs anywhere that a whole population fits the absolutely insane panic and rhetoric of the above post. It‚Äôs dramatic as fuck and not indicative of a majority.</p>
<p>Take comfort in the fact that I‚Äôm just 1 person and see so much normalcy going ahead. I honestly think the media and government is losing this one solidly.</p>

        <p>I suppose there is some truth to what you say. I have been terribly depressed recently as I see no end in sight to this madness, and just knowing what the mainstream narrative about this is, and how it is blatant lies and ignorance is enough for me to feel enraged, disgusted, and depressed. It's really difficult when the whole world looks and feels like a mashup of Orwell's 1984 and Idiocracy. I feel really hopeless at times but I try and remind myself that reddit and social media demographic were never a sane and intelligent bunch to begin with. I just saw on the mask skepticism sub (which has been brigaded to hell and needs to just be put of its misery at this point) that they want to wear masks forever. They are glad that it's become normalized and they want to wear them every flu season or just all the time in public. They think that people should have just kept wearing them after 1918 pandemic ended, so they should have already been normalized for a 100 years.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then I see shit like this copied post...it's absolutely psychotic and has no basis in any sort of reality. To know that they are spreading this bullshit out there and everyone is just eating it right up...It's all horribly demoralizing, and I keep seeing this shit every day and I feel trapped in this Orwellian nightmare. It doesn't help that society reflects it. I don't go out anymore because I get reminded every minute that I'm living in this dystopian hell. I'm sorry that I don't share your optimism about how this crap isn't indicative of the majority, because every where I turn, it seems like it is. The masses have fallen for all of it, they love it, they gleefully beg for more, and they have all let their inner fascists run wild, shaming and ridiculing anyone who challenges their mindless narrative. They are getting off LARPing their apocalypse fantasies and playing out their Gestapo wet dreams. Maybe I need to just get off reddit and the internet in general for a while. I'm just so tired and weary at this point, and I really don't know what to do. But you are right about bots...I have no doubt that there is a heavy presence of disinfo agents/shills/bots on reddit and social media, and other parts of the internet. Their goal is to stoke the mass hysteria and further destroy and demoralize America.</p>

        <p>But see the thing is: you have to pull your own normalcy. The tyrant governors are going to do what they do no matter what. None of the things I‚Äôm seeing people enjoy are happening in places where the governors aren‚Äôt trying to clamp down. Everyone is living in spite of all that. Hell even baseball practice games started back up last night the same way they started in Taiwan a month back. I didn‚Äôt expect to see it happen but it actually did. The Yankees and Mets played a practice game before the actual season starts. And no one stopped that. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard as fuck right now and I get that but to keep my sanity, I‚Äôm really digging for the positivity despite whatever freak wrote the OP. And it‚Äôs there. People aren‚Äôt listening to dumbasses like the guy in the OP. Full stop.</p>

        <p>Maybe you should expand your social circle.  I know maybe two people with a similar view as the person in the post, another handful who think it's a hoax, another handful that think "it's not that bad" and then a few hundred that think we should follow the recommendations of the medical experts.  That's it's temporary, and life will return to normal, mostly.</p>
<p>Again, expand your social circle - or actually listen to what people are saying.  Most are not really "doomers" like you think.</p>

        <p>Yet there are people on LDS that still think we should "listen to what the other side has to say", and debate them. So one side gets to blatantly lie, deceive, manipulate, spread the most shameless ignorance and misinformation and revel in their mass hysteria? They get to go on ridiculing, shaming, dismissing, and silencing any real data or truth or anyone who dares speak such, and the we on the other side need to just lay down and play nice and enable this mass psychosis. How will this shit go down in history? You're telling me that they will write history with these blatant lies after all the damage and destruction they caused and we'll be the ones looked at as the tinfoil crackpots? Meanwhile, the insane, delusional side led by nefarious media and quacks gets to pat themselves on the back from saving the world from a horrible apocalyptic pandemic? Nope, not now, not ever. Document everything. Do not let them get away with these crimes against society. Do not let the stupidity and insanity of the brainwashed masses win. And do not let the puppet master media and "experts" pull this Orwellian shit on the world.</p>

        <p>I can‚Äôt help but think there‚Äôs something more sinister at play with these posts. Lots of foreign interference is coming out about stuff on twitter and reddit.

        <p>I had a big reply type out about how this person doesn‚Äôt have evidence and this is yet another spurious and untested claim designed to maximize fear and then I stopped and had a revelation. Someone who thinks like this is a sad, sad person who doesn‚Äôt deserve a thoughtful response because they are so detached from reality that no amount of logic or reason will appeal to them. No wonder they love spending every waking moment of their lives indoors, sheltering from the world.</p>

        <p>Oh man, I can only imagine how many downvoted her coronavirus post got, and how much harassment she received... Poor her...</p>
<p>Oh, wait, that doesn't happen to them, we get all of the downvotes, hates, death threats etc. And they can very literally post false information and get tens of thousands of upvotes.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I saw a post where some guy with asthma was bragging about how he wears a mask at work all day, even though doomers' own precious CDC guidelines say that people who struggle to breathe shouldn't wear them, considering certain masks can reduce your blood oxygen by up to 20% which is 20% more than these psychotic, delusional "corona warriors" can afford to lose from their brains. Or perhaps their brains use less oxygen than normal ones. He bragged about breaking the rules they drool over and redditors were so gullible nearly forty thousand people had upvoted it at the time.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for being here - it's nice to have a break from the constant harassment and doomers complaining and moaning about the end of the world, and how they know what's best for everybody.</p>
<p>I appreciate you guys more than you know! :)</p>
