    <strong>Covid Cops</strong>
    <p><p>What’s the future of security in the United States? </p>
<p>The government has a monopoly on police across the country. It’s already clear that many folks despise police as made evident by the record billions in infrastructure damage due to rioting this year. </p>
<p>Now that governors are strengthening their grip over their respective states (Newsome, Cuomo, whitmer, etc), it would stand to reason that a majority of the population begins to resent the people enforcing these laws. </p>
<p>The police have been arresting people trying to operate businesses. There is ever increasing surveillance as the nation is carpeted with 5g. How could anyone possibly feel protected by cops?</p>
<p>Are privately owned security groups going to become the Watchdogs of society? The police are “treading” on the very citizens that have traditionally supported them.</p></p>

        <p>It’s amazing how in certain places, police will enforce mask wearing and gatherings 1,000x more than they will enact control over rioting and looting. At the same time, leftists hate the police so much that they want them abolished/defunded up until the point they see someone opening their small business. Then the police suddenly matter to them. </p>
<p>As for your question, who knows. I could definitely see it happening in blue cities and states. It all comes down to how we vote — and I have little hope that the majority of people who vote for destructive leaders like Cuomo and Newsome will ever come to their senses.</p>

        <p>Honestly it depends. Cops are slowly starting to lose support on both sides of the spectrum. The left has kind of always hated them at this point, but they’re starting to attack right leaning people... Well further right individuals like the proud boys n stuff so that’s abit more of the extreme end. But if people are smart, they’ll see the pattern. Of course they’ll go after the extremist first, then they’ll come for you. Better to stop them now and then figure what to do with the extremist before the boot is on your neck.</p>
