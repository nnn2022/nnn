    <strong>Why is Canada experiencing relief?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Ontario andfor over a year until July 16th we were under varying degrees of brutal lockdown, (we're still in low level lockdown but the brutality has abated recently.)  At the same time that we've been experiencing "occasional indulgence" (as per bidermans chart of coersion) the rest of the western world has been ravaged by covid tyranny: France, Ireland, Greece, UK, and now Germany are implementing or intimating at harsh freedom restrictions for the unvacksed. Australia and New Zealand are going to "chase up"/"hunt down" the unvacksed. Why is Canada off schedule with the rest of the western world? What do you think they have in store for us? (I've excluded America because I think their 2nd amendment makes them an entirely different theater of war for the globalists.)</p></p>

        <p>We should be just behind Israel given the amount vaxxed. 
Our charter is probably what stopped the feds from mandating vaccines and left it up to the provinces deal with the legal fallout and lawsuits.</p>
<p>Edit: Trudeau already sold us out the the world economic forum anyways and said Canada was dedicated to the great reset.</p>

        <p>Man its hard to say. I hate giving timelines cause they always seem to surprise me as of late. Once the booster are pushed I think less people are going to be ok with this. The majority will still take it. Most people here are lemmings. This will get really bad as they start to blame the unvaccinated. Hopefully the SCC saves us but I ain't holding my breath given their interpretations of section 1.</p>

        <p>The Canadian Charter of Privileges and Permissions is worthless. </p>
<p>There are absolutely no rights the Government cannot vetoes by enacting Section 33 of the Charter that allows the Government to suspend your Charter Rights for up to Five years and they can just keep doing it over and over like they do in Quebec. </p>
<p>Then there is the Oakes Test that was created by the Supreme Court of Canada to help the Government circumvent Canadian Constitutional Protected rights. Basically it allows the Politically Appointed Judges or Cops or Government to violate your personal rights if they are demonstrably justified in a “free” and democratic society and as long as its the minimum infringement they can do almost anything... hmmmm we gotta save grandma and you won’t take your medicine. </p>
<p>Lastly, Canada is mainly Governed by mob rule (aka public opinion) and the Government controls all sources of media now. Everything is funded and controlled by the Government. Internet, TV, Radio.  The few oddballs and YouTubers will be taken out by the Liberal Governments Censorship Bill C-10. </p>
<p>Canada is fucked and Canadians do not have protected rights. </p>
<p>If you have the means to leave I suggest you do ASAP.</p>

        <p>Section 33 doesn’t get used though for obvious reason. I don’t think the feds have ever used it. And whenever a province does it normally backfires in thier face politically. </p>
<p>But I do agree given the section one Oakes test the charter is kind of a joke.</p>

        <p>Quebec uses it regularly for language laws and has been violating the Constitutional Freedoms of Canadians for years.</p>
<p>Alberta used it once. </p>
<p>Ford is threatening to use it this year to stop political ads that are negative to his re-election. </p>
<p>From Ottawa or CBC... Crickets</p>
<p>Quebec gets away with it because there is no political backlash from Canadians. Canadians are OK with other Canadians losing rights.</p>
<p>When Trudeau wins his Majority this fall he will force this down our throats.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>In WW2 Canadians were know as brutal and heartless killers in the trenches of Europe. In fact, many Germans still dislike Canadians for this to this day. We were known to commit our own atrocities in the trenches. These days the only trenches are between the left and right.</p>

        <p>Well Quebec is Quebec. </p>
<p>If Ford uses it is political suicide imo. </p>
<p>I worry you are right about Trudeau.</p>

        <p>I think it is to facilitate moving forward with a federal election.  Following that, I expect we will fall right back into "lock step".</p>
