    <strong>Dad called me stupid and brother called me a liar.</strong>
    <p><p>I went up to my dad's for the first time in a while. My step mom, brother, dad and I were going to watch a movie and eat pizza. All three of them are some what covid cultists. Not to the point of telling me to wear a mask and stay six feet away but have made it clear that they want me to take the covid shot from day one.</p>
<p>I was talking to my step mom and I could overhear my dad and brother talking. Then my dad said that people who choose to not take the shot are stupid. Then I loudly asked if that included me and he was hesitant but said yes. Then when I said the vaccine has killed people my brother very adamantly said NO it hasn't. Um, WTF? It has killed people including people I know and he still said it hasn't. </p>
<p>I stood up and walked out slamming every door on the way out. My dad followed me trying to calm me down and apologizing for hurting me but still not going back on what he said. I was so angry I could hardly see straight. </p>
<p>The next day I checked on my smart watch app to see what my heart rate was and it got up to 150 a couple of times. My head was still spinning and felt run down exhausted.</p>
<p>I just want our relationship to go back to what it was before but I just dont know how I can forgive eather of them. My brother hasn't even attempted to apologize, I don't think he even realizes that he hurt me; and my dad gave a halfhearted apology. Should I just try to forget that night and tell them to never bring up covid or the drug around me or should I demand that they actually apologize? Or any other suggestions are very welcome.</p></p>

        <p>I'm with you. But it gets worse than even that. My wife, with whom I don't get along in the slightest, has threatened to go against my wishes and vaccinate our eight-year-old son as soon as they make the vaccines available for children under the age of twelve...</p>
<p>And I know everything there is to know about the dangers of these experimental vaccines (antibody dependent enhancement, pathogenic priming, spike protein damage, leaky vaccine-induced mutation, prion disease, etc., etc.).</p>
<p>This madness is tearing people--families, friends, lovers, tribes, cities, nations--apart.</p>
<p>My guess is that some people want that to happen...</p>

        <p>Emergency injunction. 
And I'd start now.</p>
<p>Once the drug is available, it's too late.</p>
<p>You have to get the decision from the judge and have her notified of the ruling to prevent her from doing it.</p>

        <p>Given the political leanings of the courts these days, trying to get an injunction could, and probably would, backfire. This is 10x as likely if OP lives in California, New York, or anywhere in Canada.</p>

        <p>If you’re relatively early in your marriage I can tell you it’s common to find it hard to get along with your spouse and to notice all the things you dislike…sometimes for long periods. Familiarity breeds contempt, after all. But if you see something in there that you love and that’s worth fighting for then do it. Start by working on yourself and what you’re doing for the relationship. A little effort can go a long way.</p>

        <p>Never, ever get angry or emotional. It will be very difficult, but if you get emotional, you lose. Leave it to them to get emotional because only people on the losing side use their emotions to make a point. Also, try not to argue or debate it either. The juice isn't worth the juice if they aren't open minded.</p>

        <p>That is the challenge. Who gets emotional is loosing. Answer like the Zen monk Hakuin, who got wrongly accused of having fathered the child of a young village girl. Her parents where outraged and brought the baby to the monk and said he must take care of the child, since he is the father! Hakuin in his perfected equinimity just answered with the now famous quote: "Is that so?" He took care of the child by begging every day for milk from the villagers. After a while the lying mother got remorsful and told her parents the real father was a random guy from the fish market. The parents realizing what they had done to the innocent sage monk, approached him and told him they want the child back, he would not be the father. He answered:"Is that so?"  and handed back the well nourished infant.</p>
<p>You have to endure the onslaught of physical sensations in your body, when you get challenged. Keep quite, don't answer much. Breath, feel the breathing as an anchor of attention. Don't focus on their words. If you don't react, things will settle down quicker in you and you have nothing to regret. That is true strength. And they will feel it.</p>
<p>For a modem version, see the Jordan B Peterson interview on Channel 4 with Kathy Newman. Non anger is the true power weapon. Boom.</p>
<p>I'm still working on it myself.....hard...but it's get better through practice.</p>
<p>You are not alone. Keep calm and NNN sane!</p>
<p>Peace</p>

        <p>Breathe. Your breath is powerful. You can mindfully change your heart rate just by breathing properly.  Practice deep belly breathing through your nose - long inhale and equally long exhale. Then in a stressful moment you can better control how you breathe and therefore how you react. If you really need to let something go (emotions, negative self talk, tension, etc) exhale through your mouth.</p>

        <p>Don’t worry fren, they’ll apologize to you one day, because it’s becoming more and more clear as the days go on that people who share your feelings are on the right side of history. </p>
<p>Medical autonomy is something you should NEVER feel bad for defending, no matter how much the media and government insist you should. Trust your gut, and don’t let your family bully you into making a medical decision.</p>

        <p>This is what they want. They, as in government.  They want people turning on their families. They want people divided. People are bombarded with vaccines, covid and masks and how bad it is and everyone's going to die if they don't follow the governments orders. </p>
<p>Don't let them get to you. Don't worry about what your family thinks. They will come to their senses soon. </p>
<p>There was a poll in Australia a few weeks ago that asked if you got the "delta" variant then what was you chances of death? The average answer was a 32% chance of dying. People are brainwashed.</p>

        <p>Even the cdc says the survival rate is 94 6% for over 69 year olds and over 99% for younger. Then delta is even less deadly. My brother has a reputation for researching a lot but he still says NO ONE has died of the covid shot. So obviously he only reads government approved sites.</p>

        <p>I try to explain it but they refuse to listen. I explained how the covid shot is drastically different than a typical vaccine and how the spike proteins the shot tricks your cells into making are the same proteins than causes damage from covid.

        <p>Your Dad has apologized. 
From the found of it, not for his views or as an admission he's wrong, but he's apologizing for hurting you.</p>
<p>Your brother owes you an apology. It's just that simple.
He called you a Liar. It's a provable fact, there are over 6000 on VAERS, and it's estimated that VAERS is usually only 1/10th of the actual.</p>
<p>They don't confirm that the Vaccine is definitely what caused the death, because the don't confirm ANY side effect.</p>
<p>Understand that according to the rules, it can even get silly.</p>
<p>If a person got a Polio vaccine today, and then tonight, for some unknown reason, the just jumped up off the couch and ran out into the road and got hit by a truck...
If the Family filled out a Vaers report...
"Jumping up and running outside without regard to your own safety" would then have to be listed as a possible side effect.
But with only 1 instance in how many billions of doses, what are the odds the Vaccine actually caused it. </p>
<p>The covid shot on the other hand...
There are THOUSANDS of reports.
At least 6000. Which is more than the number of Vaccine death reports for ALL vaccines since like 1980 or something.</p>
<p>And they share similar characteristics.
They are previous healthy people succumbing to heart attack or stroke, both of which are caused by abnormal clotting. There is a warning on the shot of clotting issues. 
There are microscope pictures of blood from vaccinated patients, showing blood cells with rough irregular edges that are clumping up, vs healthy cells thstcare smooth, round and well spaced in the plasma.</p>
<p>The "Preponderance Of Evidence" allows no other conclusion. People have died and are continuing to die, and tens of thousands more have suffered from heart inflammation that has left them virtual invalid, unable even to climb stairs.</p>
<p>And he called you a LIAR.</p>
<p>It's near psychotic on his part to not acknowledge the fact that people have died.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I was hoping for a good middle of the road response. I know I've probably gotten as much of an apology is I'm going to get from my dad but I don't think Im ready to forgive him yet either, trying to but just not yet. But knoing my brother I doubt he will ever apologize because he always has to be the smartest person in the room, he will never admit he was wrong and will never even give a half hearted apology because he sees that as admitting he was wrong.</p>

        <p>My sister who took the vaccine while 8 months pregnant - won’t come around me and my fiancé and our three year old daughter because we aren’t vaxxed - she didn’t have the balls to tell me how she felt she told my family and on the Fourth of July when I realized my parents made a ton of food and we were the only ones there - when I asked where her family was they said well she just doesn’t want to get the baby out - mind you she’s vaccinated and apparently her baby is too - along with her 13 year old step daughter - I called her a pussy for not coming to me first - also I am eight months pregnant - shouldn’t I be worried about being around her!! It’s dividing families left and right - I won’t back down to please anyone I’m doing what I think is right for my family - she’s a first time mom and I don’t even get to see my new Neice -
Saw her once with a mask on - that’s it -</p>

        <p>Man the brainwashing is so deep. I had visited with my parents in nova Scotia. My mom told my son that his vist was worth the risk, unless she ended up on a ventilator.
Also thinks that it's a businesses right to keep out those who didnt get the gt and get this can shop online. So why arent the cowards doing the online shopping!?
And on the gt front she says fine I wont get it, you want me to die!? 
Like jfc I dont want you to get it because I dont want you to die. She has liver problems from chemo and I've been hearing that the gt effects the liver. Fuckkkkk.  I preach and share information because I fucking care. God helps us</p>

        <p>Children are the future. After all of the hell that the world powers put kids through in the name of covid safety I don't want to see the future. Sure all of the restrictions may have added a couple years to the lives of the elderly but just look at the life long psychological damage it has done to the kids. Suicides are at just horrifying levels. How can anyone say the lockdowns were worth it after seeing all of the collateral damage?</p>

        <p>My dad has changed the most. With my brother I completley expected he would fall for the government propaganda hard, hes the typical collage brainwashes Democrat. My dad on the other hand was the one who always taught me to distrust the government, he was a conspiracy theorist classic. I learned phrases like deep state, the powers that be and all of the general corruption of big government. So I was shocked that he fell for it just as hard and fast as my brother did.</p>

        <p>What your dad said was hurtful and wrong. I'd have been furious too. And it must feel terrible to have family gang up on you like that. But don't back down and hold strong to your stance. The fact is there ARE people dying from this. If anything, you should pity your brother and father because they seem to be in denial and show ignorance. Perhaps that can help to calm down.</p>

        <p>Heres a peer reviewed <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm">study</a> on how the vaccine may save 1 life, but that 1 life saved will have 2 lives ruined by the vaccine. </p>
<p>Also heres the math showing that those who are young are more at <a href="https://twitter.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1416426039039909894?s=19">risk</a> from the vaccine than covid. </p>
<p>You can also see the vaers reporting system for vaccine deaths.</p>
<p>Also, cause why not, I'll throw a compilation of those who have died or seriously fallen ill to the vaccine.</p>

<p>As for the other things I listed, are you going to adress them at all? Or are you going to focus on the retracted article?</p>
