    <strong>Airlines are getting this all wrong</strong>
    <p><p>The way I see it, there are 3 types of people in regards to flying right now: a minority of paranoid people that would never fly during a "pandemic", a group that feel safe with a mask and a group that would travel as normal. These two groups that would fly aren't flying right now not because they are scared, but because they aren't allowed to; even if they can fly to new york, for example, what would they do there? Everything is closed. But airlines insist on putting new rules to convince people that they won't get the coronavirus on a plane, mandatory masks, no in-flight service, no magazines, mandatory face shields, etc. Rules like these will push more people away then bring in, but airlines seem to keep insisting on this strategy.</p></p>

        <p>I agree.  I want one airline to abandon all the security theater.  People concerned about the virus can fly some other airline.  This one is for people who know this is bullshit and want to get back to normal.  I bet there is a big customer base for that.</p>
<p>My husband works for an airline, he says they just keep adding service to SD and Florida because they can't keep up with demand.</p>

<p>Makes a lot of sense. People need to get away from hysteria and derangement even if it's for a week. Airlines have to make money somehow</p>

<p>Count me in! I used to average about 125,000 miles flown annually for business and pleasure, but now I'm down to zero out of choice. I'm not interested in playing along with the dumb hysteria while paying for the privilege.</p>

        <p>Same.  I just had my fourth international trip cancelled for the year and have just driven somewhere during pto.  It beats following all the stupid airline rules.</p>
<p>My husband has flown.  He informed me that they no longer show you how to put on an oxygen mask and instead just harp about compliance cloths.  Wcgw.</p>

        <p>I love how Subaru went based and made a commercial about going out in public, enjoying life, and hugging your grandma. Maybe they made one for doomers too and I just saw the targeted one. Or they assume doomers won't be leaving their house anytime soon and will probably be unemployed in a few months and won't be buying a new car. Or they don't want people to realize that cars kill more people than colds do.</p>

        <p>I just flew out for the first time since this started honestly they lost my money from what I saw. I won't be flying anywhere on purpose now until this is over. Wearing masks the whole time and getting told to pull it up if it's under your nose. Unfuckingreal.</p>

        <p>My husband and I flew to Rome in August and then Sorrento at the end of September. Under normal day to day activities I don’t wear a mask, but I knew I had to in order to fly. I sucked it up. We don’t usually order food on that flight as it’s pretty short, but we both ordered coffees and a bit to eat simply so we could catch a break. </p>
<p>We enjoyed out trips, as usual. But on our second last day in sorrento they mandated outside masks. I was devastated. The next day we went to our favorite outside cafe across from the place we were staying, and that was it. I refuse to walk around outside with a mask.</p>
<p>Since then Italy has made masks outside mandatory country wide. You now have to get tested to visit the country, and the uk has taken Italy off the travel corridor list. 14 day quarantine coming back.</p>
<p>I’m going to guess mask wearing on planes will never go away. This is how it is. If it allows me to go to my favorite place on Earth, I’ll wear a mask to get there. Anything else. Fuck that. I suspect we won’t be going to Italy for a long time.</p>

        <p>You’d be surprised. This lady who gave me the business about wearing masks and following CDC guidelines just bragged about how she’s going on vacation to visit family in different states and she said sheepishly oh she’s not following guidelines teehee. Because <em>she’s</em> seeing <em>her</em> family. So it’s different. Someone at our table joked that she’d be fined and I said “I don’t know what’s worse, the fines or the shaming?” She didn’t answer.</p>

        <p>People on the flights I’ve taken are mostly not scared. They are playing along at this point. Most are clearly going on vacation at this point since no one is traveling for work anymore. You still see the oddball in a hazmat suit but ironically they are always sitting in a middle coach seat and won’t pay for first.</p>

        <p>So I can’t speak for the airlines as a whole but I do work for one. They probably figure that the people who want masks, and the people who tolerate masks(note the difference) exceeds the amount of people that are not gonna get on the plane because they hate masks. US travelers already put up with the TSA so honestly it’s not illogical. When this changes they will absolutely reverse course</p>
<p>Also airlines are starting to unblock seats so that’s a area where they realized the could get some good PR while their numbers were down, then as the numbers climbed they started to use the seats. </p>
<p>In addition it’s cheaper to have less or non existent meal service.</p>

        <p>Have flown 4 times. Magazines are on board the last two times, no social distancing, sharing 4 pens amongst 100+ plus passengers as they didn't fill out the landing forms.</p>
<p>I have no issues flying, I haven't caught any thing so far and (touch wood)  I won't either. Not even a cold and I do normally have a cold from flying at least once.</p>
<p>Pretty much normal apart from having to wear a flimsy mask as part of the rules.</p>
<p>I also used anti bac gel before any of this happened..used to get comments about how I had a bottle in each bag but that's because I know the planes aren't cleaned properly the same for door handles, card machines in every day settings etc etc so for me nothing has changed.</p>
<p>I have noticed that going through security is a lot quicker..which is great!! So all good really. Not stopping any part of my life for this virus.</p>

        <p>Business travel is mainly because of necessity, doesn't really matter how much it costs. Business travel is down because more companies are just doing zoom calls instead of meeting in person. Also, there is a possibility that the justice system finds the company guilty of getting an employee infected with covid because of a business trip, so for liability protection, lots of companies won't go back to in person meeting for a while.</p>

        <p>Ah agreed! The shuttle bus for some flights are even more ridiculous! People still crammed like sardines in a tiny enclosed space, not even possible to social distance if you wanted to. One flight we had to take a shuttle bus to, and for whatever reason, they left us sitting on the bus for a half hour. Doors closed, just sitting there. No room, no distance, breathing in a small enclosed space. Good job guys. 
 Not that I care. I don’t care. But the logic just baffles me time and time again.</p>

<p>Also they may be worried about lawsuits and not being mask nazis could be painted as negligent (that’s not following science but oooookay). And then lastly, i reckon they must’ve done focus groups for this right? </p>

        <p>“Because it works,” is not the metric airlines use for enforcement. Remember in the earlier 2000s when they used to FREAK OUT if anyone had their cell phone on during take off? They’d be walkin’ those aisles, chastising them, claiming that if any one goddamn person didn’t have their phone in airplane mode it would endanger all the passengers because it would fuck with the air traffic control. Haha, it’s funny just to remember! Anywho, yeah, they had the studies that was bogus way back then, too. They kept doing it because of control and being slow to change.</p>
<p>Also, airlines spend millions a year on the inflatable life vests that no one would really have a chance to use in a plane crash. But they keep ‘em stocked up and show us how to self-inflate them every single flight. Not because of science, but because they think people will get upset if they stop.</p>
<p>So no, little dude, I don’t think it’s fair to say that airlines are pinnacle of science. I’d say that they are capitalist entities that want to both entice and control customers. That you’d be so naive otherwise is UFB.</p>

        <p>I fall under the "travel as normal category". I have to fly atleast 4 -6 times a year for work.aka no flight no paycheck.So just short of a rectal thermometer to monitor my tempature the entire flight...im still getting on that plane.</p>
<p>That being said I don't feel like these things are for me.There to try and get the very few people that are in the fence about flying.</p>
