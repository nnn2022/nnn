    <strong>Parents Getting Vaccinated Seeming to Affect my Period</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so I am really freaked out because it is one thing for it happen once but it has happened again.</p>
<p>Background: I am 22 and live with my parents. My period is actually irregular due to PCOS in which i have to use birth control to even get it. Thus, I am even more freaked out. I have been using birth control pills for years so I know what I am about to lay out is abnormal. </p>
<p>Earlier in the spring, my mother received her Pfizer vaccine and I noticed pretty quickly afterward I had received my second period of the month. Which has NEVER happened before as I am lucky to even get a period. It made me pretty suspicious because I have seen evidence hinting towards women’s cycles being affected.</p>
<p>Fast forward to just a couple days ago, my dad got injected with Moderna vaccine and today I am getting my period again after already having it a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>This is really freaking me out. I wish I could just wave it off as a conspiracy theory but I am really worried. I’d hate to think my parents’ actions are affecting MY reproductive system.</p>
<p>And now I am getting shamed by people I am close with for going to Las Vegas this weekend without a vaccine… especially with the “delta lambda pi phi omega epsilon” whatever sorority girl variant is out there. I just don’t understand.</p>
<p>Any other person going through this? I am legit freaked out.</p></p>

        <p>I wish this stuff was a bad joke, but I'm hearing it again and again. Both from women I know and women on the internet. No way this shit is affecting others unless the vaxxed are shedding poison spike proteins. God help us all</p>

        <p>This happened to me as well.  I don’t live with my parents, but I see them almost every day.  I was with my parents the day they got both doses and within days, my period came early and was completely awful.  Mind you, I am 40 years old and have always had consistent cycles with little to no side effects. What was more troublesome is that they were holding my toddler and babysitting her that day.</p>

        <p>I am the only unvaxxed at my job, (all women) and the past two months my periods have been late and not normal. I didn’t correlate it with them receiving the shots, but it is very interesting now after reading this. Wild coincidence if that’s all it is. I could certainly be open to hearing more from others!</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure I had a decidual cast miscarriage earlier this year right after being around my vaccinated mother and step dad. When I read about other women’s testimonies and the vaccine shedding I started sobbing. I had seen them right after both of their vaccines and it happened 2 days after seeing them. They are just gaslighting us women acting like we can’t put two and two together. It’s so terrifying. I’m pregnant now (thank God) and my family won’t stop trying to push the vaccine on me. Even though my sister got the J&amp;J the DAY before they pulled it. They won’t stop harassing us and trying to make our lives “harder” until we cave. I guess they don’t realize how scared we are about the very real side effects. I will never forgive myself if I become infertile, hurt my unborn child, develop neurological issues, heart issues or possibly die. I told my sister about my infertility fears (before I got pregnant) and she said she hopes it makes her infertile. There is no downside to these people</p>

        <p>This happened to a close friend, except she spent time around those who had gotten the shots and she missed her period for 3 months. She took ivermectin along with an herbal tea blend (white pine needles, fenugreek, turmeric, ginger) and her menstrual cycle started again within 3 days. May be worth a try even.</p>

        <p>I also thought this sounded absolutely insane but it looks like second hand exposure was something Pfizer was tracking and aware of as a potential risk, especially to pregnant or breastfeeding women. Exposure could come from contact with a male in their household who was given the vaccine as part of the trial or through occupational exposure. </p>
<p>Pages 67-69 of the Pfizer Trial Investigational Protocol 1 discusses it. </p>

        <p>Yeah, it discusses what could happen if the solution (or as they call it, intervention) got onto you or you inhaled it. Think: You break a vial of this shit and breathe it in, or it splashes on your hand. Please read the thing right before spreading this. </p>
<p>Nothing there is saying that a vaccine administered to a person can esape that person's body.</p>

        <p>According to that document,each person getting the Pfizer Vaccine had to consent to the possibility of exposing pregnant women through inhalation or skin contact. Also according to the document, </p>
<p>&rt;an “exposure during pregnancy” event that must be reported to Pfizer within 24 hours occurs if:
<em>A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.</em></p>
<p>How would a male partner who has discontinued the study expose them to direct contact with the vaccine? “Environmental exposure” is also defined as vaccine shedding in the recent lawsuit brought by America’s Frontline Doctors, specifically in reference to this protocol.</p>
<p>Also, you don’t have to be rude about it. I always appreciate people checking my work. I just don’t necessarily share your interpretation, specifically because of the section I quoted. Though I agree it does in a vacuum seem far fetched.</p>

        <p>I'm avoiding the vaxxed, I am chronically ill enough, just reading too many stories like yours. :( I believe you. I wonder if they are shedding spike proteins too.

After they started getting jabbed, I had No sore boobs and heavy cramping. Then the next month no signs of it coming, I just started bleeding out of nowhere.  This month, sore boobs again and cramps, but no bleeding yet. Sorry if tmi. Something is up.</p>

        <p>I visited my mom the day after her second moderna (which made her horribly ill) and I noticed unusual spotting but got my normal period on time. Next cycle was a few days longer than normal, very unusual for me but didn’t think anything of it. My last period came a full two weeks early and lasted forever. Very disturbing to be so off my cycle, might have been a super early miscarriage, I’ve had a few it seemed somewhat like that. So yes, it’s been a disaster since then.</p>

        <p>This is so weird. I read through this expecting responses like "oh it's probably just from stress knowing that your parents are taking this experimental shot" What I didn't expect is dozens of similar stories in just this thread.</p>
