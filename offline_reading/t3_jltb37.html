    <strong>A message of hope - we will reopen.</strong>
    <p><p>I know that was a hard week for us all. But I see some signs of hope for skepticism:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is actual criticism. There is still a lot of hysteria, but it not an absolute consensus anymore.</li>
<li>In March, belief in covid zombie apocalypse was universal. Skeptical thought changed from total fringe to somewhat acceptable.</li>
<li>The public is tired. It is taking longer than we expect, but people have resumed their lives. I really donÂ´t expect empty streets in any European capital.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably, I really think that, whenever the system allows, people will snake restrictions and lead the most normal lives possible. I really think that cheating will run rampant. People will go to the office and take the Tube. They will see boyfriends and family. In immigrant and poor hoods, probably shops will be with doors half open.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be feared, not hated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Force an already fatigued population into a new dose of the psychological toll of isolation will only increase and cause anger and an even harder desire for normalcy. The perfect situation for the Macchiavellian advice to not be hated.</p>
<p>These lockdowns are an attempt for the leaders who imposed them to keep the narrative that they will beat the virus in a few months of sacrifices. They are stressed too that the narrative of March failed, but, if they assume it, their careers are destroyed.</p>
<p>It will take longer than expected, but it looks like Covid and lockdowns will become a Vietnam: a very stressful battle that went for nothing, unless they get the vaccine before that.</p>
<p>Remember: now, there are prostests and riots.</p>
<p>They took longer to impose them, remember that cases were rising in the UK since september and it was a gradual increase. I really expect that it will not be another 4 months. Any mercy of the curve, they will be faster to reopen that it was the first time.</p>
<p>There is hope. We have advanced. It might be longer, but we will win at the end. There will not be a new normal neither an economic apocalypse.</p></p>

        <p>Anything that degrades the human experience will go away. That includes social distancing, quarantining, and occupancy limits. We will stuff stadiums again. We will travel abroad again. We will party again. Maybe we won't ever use a giant ketchup bottle for our burger at a fair again (there will be single-serve packs instead), but that doesn't degrade the experience.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your positive and inspiring post.</p>
<p>It's interesting to hear very negative responses referring to "doomers".  Talk about pots and kettles.</p>
<p>You cannot keep the human spirit down.</p>
<p>Look at Hiroshima on August 26th 1945 and look at it now.</p>
<p>Compare 1939-1945 and compare that to 1945-2019.</p>
<p>There's always some shit going down, but there's always something to keep yer pecker up!</p>
<p>Peace, friends!  Humanity is going to prevail ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

        <p>I really love posts like this because it is the antithesis of the constant doom and gloom that social media and news outlets project about this virus every day. It's really quite telling of these passionate lockdown advocates that they label the only message of positivity we've been provided so far as being the ramblings of a madman or conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>It's become painfully obvious at this point that the message spread by social media and news outlets about this virus is not in the best interests of our humanity, or in the best interests of us in general. There can never be even a sliver of hope in the world unless either the virus is completely eradicated, or the "hope" is disguised as some new normal garbage that only seeks to make our lives permanently and unnecessarily different because of this virus. That is the sorrowful message they have to say about this situation, and it's revolting.</p>
<p>This, on the other hand, is a sign of hope, which is what they seem to hate and avoid at all times. I don't even care at this point if it's being willfully ignorant. At least I can claim not to have my entire life controlled by fear, and my every action done out of a genuine fear that it will all be for nothing and that I'm going to kill someone if I don't.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a comment I saw on this very subreddit that made me sick. Someone else was talking about how we should be approaching this virus in a calm, collective manner, not in a panicked manner with wanton abandon, to which someone replied that the fear is well-warranted, because it heightens one's senses and allows them to get their priorities in check, which they, in this case, described as distancing and wearing masks at all times.</p>
<p>It's as if the only manner they can possibly seek this virus through is through mass panic. Meanwhile, there are massive crowds in China right now, the SOURCE of the virus, and they're laughing in all of our mask-wearing faces while we're being heckled by the same misinformed people about how we should quarantine forever.</p>
<p>Anyways, keep it up with this message of hope. Even if it has good intentions, they look at it with contempt and horror, when it only serves to enlighten people and let them approach this in a calmer manner.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing!  I only joined reddit yesterday.  I googled "stop coronavirus fearmongering" and found posts on reddit kinda like yours.  I decided to join because I needed an alternative to "doomscrolling".  So far, I've found quite a bit of stuff here to help make me feel better than I have in months!  Can anyone recommend a good YouTube channel?</p>

        <p>i reject the guilt trip. i am not responsible for anyone 'ending it'. i did not lock them down by dictate, i did not spout fear mongering lies about a common cold virus. i am not purposely miscounting cases and deaths.</p>
<p>tell me when the 'reopening' is going to occur, even as stricter lockdowns are being dictated in europe, the usa and elsewhere</p>
<p>what good are riots? what good are protests? they are useless as can be seen by the results of them.</p>
<p>this post is bullshit</p>
<p>hope is what holds people back from taking action.</p>
<p>'we' will 'reopen' when 'we' accept the terms of 'our' evolved form of enslavement. which is now being set up and called the 'great reset'. i was no fan of the 'old normal' slavery</p>
<p>fuck that noise, enough is enough.</p>
<p>i won't be continuously (or ever) 'tested' for the common cold, i won't prove that i am not sick, i won't be tracked and traced. i won't wear a fucking face diaper to 'protect' others.</p>
<p>the gist of this sub is that we reject this 'new normal' form of slavery, not that if we just endure some more tyranny for a bit longer we will be 'allowed' to return to the 'old normal'</p>
