    <strong>It seems like this whole last year has been an experiment...</strong>
    <p><p>In more ways than one. But the primary experiment which I am referring is a test of obedience. </p>
<p>The Nuremberg defence of "just following orders" rocked the world, although there had been previous instances where people basically scapegoated their crimes to their superiors or their orders. </p>
<p>After the atrocities of WWII, Stanley Milgram sought answers for how people could have done such things to their fellow countrymen. His famous electroshock experiment showed just how far people will go when given orders by a "superior". Some going so far as to continue shocking the confederate (name for a person playing a part in the experiment) past signs of distress, then silence. </p>
<p>Further research has shown that these participants were willing to shock said confederate because of a psychological "distance" between themselves and the confederate. A deferral of responsibility as it were. </p>
<p>This last year seems like the Milgram experiment on a nationwide basis. <em>How far are people willing to be subjugated? What are they willing to see their children, friends, or family go through? How much of their community are they willing to see whither and die?</em> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, because said "authority" is a talking head on TV, that creates alot of distance. People can rationalize letting small (even well loved) businesses in their community go under as "well, it happened because of covid". Or worse yet, the skyrocketing teen and child suicide and self harm rates. Our <strong>inaction</strong> through blind obedience has led us here. </p>
<p>We are in a national milgram-esc experiment. And if it is pass/fail- we are getting a major pass by the government, but a terrible fail for liberty.</p></p>

        <p>As a people there's only so much that can be done- and our sin was in allowing our education to be eroded and historical lessons- like that offered after WWII be lost.  If we have stopped enforcing basic decency on leaders then six million Jewish people will have died in vain.</p>

        <p>What good are firewalls against tyranny and crimes against humanity- like the Nuremburg Code if no one in a position to enforce them does so?  Without adherence they are just words.</p>

        <p>I agree, this is a milgram experiment. People don't even care that their own children and young people are being made into social recluses. I believe the virus is real but there's a point where one needs to live despite dangers and not destroy all of life over one thing. There is a lot more people can die of instead of just Covid and one of my friends is probably dying of stage 4 cancer because of Covid. Watching people all run like lemmings off a cliff to take an experimental [gene therapy] has made me want to throw up. I don't even feel the same about people anymore. I lost my health when young and watching people throw theirs away this way is disgusting. Even with businesses, I am poorer but decided to focus on saving two restaurants, thinking if I focused my money on two, they'd have more chance, so I ate out at these two family own businesses-one is taquiera, and one is a greek, sandwich place. I wanted a local restaurant or two to be left. </p>
<p>People didn't give a damn when the NDAA was passed and the right to a trial as a US citizen due to the war on terror was taken away.</p>
<p>Now they don't care, as millions of businesses are destroyed which will destroy endless family wealth and futures. I am poorer, but do I want to live in a place where no one can be middle class, hell no. There were services too many of these businesses offered I ENJOYED even on limited funds as I could.</p>
<p>They don't care that children are going to be given an experimental vaccine, that on is pissing me off beyond belief and I don't even have children for a disease that posts very extremely little risk to them.  </p>
<p>They are lining up for an experimental vaccine that could kill them within in months or destroy their health long term.. By the way I just saw a guy write on a reddit board about problems they are having a month after the vaccine and it all sounds like bad autoimmune stuff which does not surprise me at all. I have severe autoimmune disease, I have gone deaf from ONE. All these dum-dums act like this is fun and games, it's not.</p>
<p>America is turning into a totalitarian cesspool bringing it's brand of totalitarianism to the world. Just look at what happened to the Tanzanian president. </p>
<p>Blind obedience is destroying this place.</p>

        <p>I'm on this subs side and believe that people are overreacting to COVID, but I literally have not found a single piece of evidence that this vaccine is bad and somehow causes gene therapy? Like, what? Could you please respectfully explain your side. Also, about the vaccine doesn't work cause you still have to wear a mask according to them, it's really just Mr. Stupidauici moving the goalposts again.</p>

        <p>Research it for yourself. There's endless websites showing the links. My post history here, has tons of the links I came across, so search through my post history. I have some doozies from pharm companies themselves. Oh an elderly friend of mine just wrote me and told me she got very sick from the first vacc and is going to refuse the second. She was sick enough to call 911.</p>
