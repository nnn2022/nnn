    <strong>Please consider helping me and some classmates sue our university over violating our medical rights</strong>
    <p><p>Any $5 donation or share helps!!  </p>
<p>As a student at Loyola University Chicago, I have officially submitted two religious exemptions. Apparently my first exemption, which slammed the vaccinations for their use of aborted fetal tissue, as well as defended the Biblical call to keep my blood and body pure, was not “Catholic” enough for my so-called “Jesuit” university. I am still awaiting a response on my second letter, in which I took a more legal standpoint, attacking the unconstitutionality of the mandate. But that is just my story. I wanted to share what is happening to some of my friends and fellow classmates.</p>
<p>More students have also sent in religious exemption requests based on their strongly held religious beliefs. Again, my university blocked them all, giving the same weak reason of having a moral obligation to do what is best for the “common good” in difficult times. What if the vaccines lead to female sterility? "Love thy neighbor" doesn't mean I should potentially sterilize my neighbor.</p>
<p>The latest development is the rejection of several medical exemptions from licensed physicians. My university believes themselves to be in the position to play “doctor” by rejecting medical exemptions that have come straight from the offices of licensed physicians. In what world is that legal? If a physician states that their patient has a legitimate medical contraindication, who is the University to deny it?</p>
<p>It appears that my University has decided that since they are Jesuit, they get the final say in deciding whether an exemption letter is sufficient. Us students are calling them out on that, combined with the fact that the University has no right to play “doctor” by overriding physician orders. The grounds are ripe for a lawsuit, and we want to jump at the  opportunity. However, we cannot do it on our own. That is why we created the GoFundMe Page that can be found at my bio. Please donate anything that you can, or please share this post. If enough universities are sued, we will likely see more start to fall on their own.  </p>
<p>I also wanted to address some harsh criticisms that I received when I initially broke with this news yesterday:</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just transfer?”</p>
<p>This isn’t just about college. This is about standing up to medical tyranny. If we tuck our tails and run, we will lose. Every. Single. Time. Additionally, many of us are seniors, or have scholarships, or are athletes; as with everything else, the decision to stay or leave is a personal choice, and this is the choice we have made, for one reason or another. Freedom from medical tyranny is worth fighting for. If you feel the need to interject with “college isn’t worth it”, you are missing the point entirely. </p>
<p>Any contribution or share is GREATLY appreciated. It’s time we take a stand. This is a winning case.</p>

        <p>Ok.  This is one of those important things.  Fellow people aware of shit like me need help.  Im in.  But you have to share all the jesuit crypt secrets with me jk.  I think i’ll try to help with some strategy, i know a bunch of lawyers but honestly they drink a bit of koolaid.  Im going to brainstorm.</p>
<p>There are constitutional rights groups that meet up regularly.  They might be worth reaching out to.</p>
<p>I feel like medical malpractice lawyers just might know whats up.  History of Class action.  But theyre all probably busy rn.  </p>
<p>We have to stealthily educate the herd and circumvent the overlords.  Then when its popular to think lawyers will step up looking to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Rn its still fringe to think.  Im gonna keep thinking.  Im pretty broke</p>

        <p>Picket them, get a sign that says I don't want myocarditis. Ignore the bots/astroturfers giving you a hard time. Most initial consults with lawyers are free. Try and get a medical exemption.</p>

        <p>This post is stupid and a waste of time, leave the school and don't give them YOUR money instead of asking for strangers money. Seems like a greasy ploy more than an actual concern and attempt for change at your uni.</p>

        <p>You go to a school that costs over 40 grand in tuition. You can't afford, along with a group of several other students, to go see an attorney for a consult that will probably cost, at most, several hundred dollars? </p>
<p>I'm sorry, there are millions of people out of work, facing food insecurity and homelessness. On top of that, we are currently in the fight of a lifetime over whether medical tyranny will be allowed to reign.</p>
<p>What your university is doing is wrong, but the entitlement to have other people crowdfund your fight is so cringeworthy. The reason your gofundme has gained no traction is because it reeks of entitlement during a time when so many people are struggling far more. Go fund yourself. It doesn't cost that much to see an attorney.</p>
