        <p>Wow, they <em>never</em> locked down? Six months into this pandemic they’re sure to have one of the highest death rates in the nation.</p>
<p><em>(checks worldometers)</em></p>
<p>Huh, 11th lowest in the country at 191 deaths / 1M. That’s weird. Well, better wait another two weeks.</p>

        <p>The doomers just claim that it'a because South Dakota is very rural and sparsely populated unlike "dense" ass states like New York (even though only the city is densely populated while upstate is just as rural as South Dakota) and California (which also has sparsely populated rural areas once you leave the coast). Of course they're too stupid to realize that they're actually proving that lockdowns don't really work and cause more harm than good because that arguement proves that these rural areas were basically locked down for nothing.</p>

        <p>Gotta love how people try to twist her into complying when all she’s doing is following the initial goal of keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed. And fact of the matter is that whatever version of this virus is spreading right now is not causing the same severity that was seen in Lombardy and NYC. Of course they’d never come out and say it but I venture it’s weakened at this point and we simply won’t see hospitalizations like we did previously. She’s holding the line and if winter wasn’t such a deal breaker for me, SD would be looking real good right now.</p>

        <p>For me, I just cannot tolerate heat. Even the Bay Area's heat has been unbearable for me my entire life, have literally almost died from heat stroke many times.</p>
<p>Cold weather I've never had a problem with. Probably means my half eastern-european genes are much stronger in that aspect</p>
<p>So unfortunately AZ is a no-go for me due to that heat</p>

        <p>July was the worst month for us. I went out to eat a lot during that time and the restaurants were still packed but I think everyone skeptical of everything just wanted to lay low because the coastal media wanted us to burst into flames during that time. Most Arizonans want to be left alone and are pretty good about laying low when we are in the spotlight.</p>
<p>I’m still seeing masks in public places but our mobility is skyrocketing. I had to drive from Phoenix to Gilbert this morning and traffic was normal for a Friday. Everything is open again. Our only cases are coming from our universities (zero hospitalizations. Probably more hospitalizations for alcohol poisoning than Covid I’m sure). </p>
<p>Idk I think some people in this sub wouldn’t say it’s free but when I look next door at California, I can say unequivocally that Arizona is really fucking free right now. The biggest thing for me is that private gatherings haven’t been restricted at any time. People have had weddings and funerals all summer. No one is really restricted from gathering and there’s not any snitching happening in private spaces and it’s pretty loose in public spaces. I’m a freedom loving patriot and I’m glad I live here during this.</p>

        <p>Yeah all the stuff you mentioned is just a plus for me hehe (not that I don't hate sun but I prefer the darker/wintery/gothic look) plus the colder weather.</p>
<p>I also look at it like this: get colder? You can always bundle up more. Get hotter? Well there's a limit to how many layers you can remove so you're gonna get to a point where suffering is unstoppable.</p>
<p>Plus I hate CA's arid climate now. It's definitely bad for my health ever since I had parotid tumor and radiation therapy years back. Now I'm facing dehydration and dry mouth almost constantly. I definitely could use a more humid area.</p>
<p>I can no longer stand a mediterranean climate like CA is. I definitely need a Continental or Tropical climate for humidity</p>

        <p>How exactly did they link those 300 cases? Did they test them before the rally, because they knew they would attend the rally? They just keep coming up with sensational claims. </p>
<p>Using their logic I can say they were 3,000 covid cases before the rally and 2,700 were cured by attending it.</p>

        <p>I don't know if the entire city had one since I don't live in Florida, but I know that sports and other stuff were allowed there initially.with no crowds (the only thing Vince McMahon has done right with his influence and connections to the Trumps) but recently while WWE has been experimenting now with the stupid LED screen audience AEW has been allowed to, or they're trying to stretch mandate rules on, trying to operate at 15% audience capacity.</p>
<p>There are no mask skeptics in the wrestling industry, they're unfortunately doomer-esque, even though they should be skeptics. I mean come on, wrestlers are constantly not social distancing lol. But anyway that's the way it is. I hope one day they can do without masks</p>

        <p>Any South Dakotans here?  I'm from an East Coast city and have an eye on Sioux Falls. Any other places I should consider moving to within the state?</p>

        <p>Sioux Falls or Rapid City would be good. The rest of the state is quite rural, but you might like that too! I guess it depends on what your job is. I'd imagine you'd be able to find work in either of those two cities. Rapid city is on the outskirts of the black hills...a smallish mountain range... So lots of opportunities for outdoorsy activities.</p>
<p>I just got back from a week long vacation in Western SD. It was wonderful! I didn't wear a mask once. They had live bands in the parks and the bars were busy.</p>
<p>I did see some people wearing masks, but they were definitely in the minority.</p>
