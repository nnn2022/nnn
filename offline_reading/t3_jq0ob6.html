        <p>I walked away from the left after the BLM riots because of this very reason - people gathering in mass to protest and riot while complaining about their neighbors having a birthday party for their kid. And the fear mongering was ramped up all summer long to effectively ensure our summer was ruined. </p>
<p>And now this - parties and celebrations in major cities across the US. Those same people will be back on social media on Monday to complain about the "Karen" at Walmart who wasn't wearing her mask properly. </p>
<p>I'm so done..No, these mass parties don't change anything. The fear will be pushed until inauguration day and then there will be a national lockdown and mask mandate until the spring if we're lucky. Then the doomers will smugly declare that Biden beat COVID.</p>

        <p>The problem is that there's a lot of people more interested in fucking other's people's lives over skin color... even in a fucking pandemic.</p>
<p>And that didn't just started yesterday.</p>
<p>But you know... with COVID a lot of people are having a lot of "free time" having no job and no possessions and shit... while still "news hot" that someone just got shot 7 times in "self defense" because he might have a scissor or something and other that was literally killed in cold blood, again, probably in self defense or some shit... why not manifest? why shouldn't they?</p>
<p>When should they manifest then? When it's "all over"? Maybe while job hunting they could go manifest here and there?</p>
<p>Like or not they got enough people to get attention of the whole world.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And that still didn't make any difference...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But people are still judging then and not what they were standing for.</p>

        <p>THis is my second presidential election vote for the libertarian party.  However, I would myself admit that their FULL platform is further than I'd want personally.  HOwever they are the third most popular party and I'd like to see them get a boost into the big leagues at least.</p>

        <p>The dems have been on the wrong side of every major civil rights fight in history.  Party of slavery, party that was (predominantly) against the civil rights act, party of Japanese internment in WW2, party of anti-semiticism, party of Jim Crow laws, party of racial discrimination in colleges.

        <p>You do realize that dems and reps have managed to dance around each other so much over the years as to basically reverse platforms right?  The reps of the past are the dems of today as far as platform policy and vice versa.  Comparing the dems of today to those of a long time ago for that reason does not work and same with reps.  Over the many years, both sides have flipflopped all over the place on official policy.  Just goes to show how much bs there is in ALL the politics.  Gotta consider Plato's cave and not just look at the shadows on the wall/tv.   Neither side are telling you the whole truth, they only tell you the snippets of truth that suit them best.</p>

        <p>Dems still support increasing minimum wage which was used to ensure freed slaves and immigrants couldn’t compete with whites for jobs. Leftists are okay with creating safe spaces for people of color, which is just a woke version of segregation. And dems hate school choice, which keeps primarily poor blacks in their school. So Dems really haven’t changed their position they just made it woke so it seems better.</p>

        <p>I’m so curious why is it actually anti mask people being called “Karen”? I thought it’s supposed to be an archetype of white, privileged and always demanding women and literally most people who still get mad for not wearing masks perfectly fall into that category. 
And I have been called Karen just as much only because of my statement regarding that, I keep seeing other people being called like this and I really don’t understand. I’m not even being biased here, Karen feels totally like always frustrated individual who wants all people to be locked in their houses just so she can have Christmas dinner with her Karen family lol.  I know it’s irrelevant but I’m so.... clueless about the meme lol</p>

        <p>Eh kind of but if you look at it, the "fear" resovoir is being exhausted. Fear hit its height in March-May when the virus deaths were either growing or really high and it was new. Most Americans supported lockdowns. During the summer cases rose and fear rose back with it but not as much as it did in March-May. Few people were telling people to just stay at home anymore and pivoted to masks and got REALLY evangelical about it. Mask mandate support hit all time highs. Now with out "third wave" mask mandates are still popular but increasingly less so (data suggests that only a slim majority favor mandates now vs an overwhelming one in August) and countries that are locking down again are seeing SIGNIFICANTLY more resistance than they did in March. There are protests and riots all over Europe right now. Also, Biden DEFINITELY doesn't have the power to do either of those things now. So while I am very upset Trump lost, I don't think they can keep this shit up much longer. Lockdowns are unpopular now and masks are becoming less and less popular by the day.</p>

        <p>Yep, if Trump was fully truthful that he had no power over the governors, then Biden won't have any power over the governors either.  Also it's not a bad thing if the govt actually helps peeps forced to stay home for 2 weeks so they don't lose all their pay, I feel sorry for so many peeps locally who test positive and only have the sniffles or a headache or no symptoms at all and have to lose all that income with no compensation.  If they are not going to stop the bs, they should at least help those forced to stay home.  </p>
<p>And I also see more and more people with noses hanging out, not caring about social distancing, etc.  Hospitalizations are down, deaths are way down, etc.  However in some highly democratic areas, there overall fear is still very high, plenty high enough to keep this going for quite some time in those areas like Los Angeles.  Their fear may be down but it is still high.</p>

        <p>We'll find out if Biden gets in what kind of loopholes there may be.  But my point is that, if what Trump said was true, then Biden's desires for the control virus are not that important if he has no power to implement them.  I just think it's amusing that a lot of republicans on here are now saying Biden will initiate a lockdown but by your own words, he does not have the power to do that so why are you worried about it then?</p>

        <p>It’ll be really interesting.  People like Noem and DeSantis will tell Biden to pound sand from day 1, and if the feeling is that DC is being too heavy handed the south and mid-west will flat out revolt.  If you look at it from a purely state level, the GOP controls far more states, and Trump won more states.</p>

        <p>Welp here is the thing, if Trump was telling the truth about his lack of power over the governors, then Biden won't have any power over the governors either.   I guess we'll find out in January assuming Trump does not manage to push the election results into the supreme court somehow where it's stacked full of republican appointees.  I do think Biden won this election clearly but I don't really trust either of them, Trump's white house was pushing governors this whole time to issue mask mandates as we discovered through FOIA.  Biden will surely do it too but the main diff will be he will be admitting to it more openly.  Either way, we'll get the testing and the vax which is what is making all the big bucks for big pharma.  IMO, we are spending way too much time and effort worrying on the masks when the other stuff should be so much more of a major concern.</p>

        <p>i hope biden takes office because then it is absolutely certain that nobody will comply with lockdown measures and mask mandates.</p>
<p>trump, who actually has a pair of balls, might actually enforce those things for better or worse, and people might actually comply. </p>
<p>it will be 4 more years of trump, though. </p>

        <p>CDC adjusted predictions to 303 to 330k by EoY 2020. Almost 420k by end of January if current infection rates continue unabated. Biden won't beat covid. It will eventually taper away as herd immunity starts to develop but were a long ways away from that. Were not even at 10% of the population yet but the spiking cases and transmission rates should push up to ~20% by January (remember. Herd immunity is 70% minimum). </p>
<p>People predicted for months that come November 4th, covid won't be a thing. Now its spiking. And so the goal post has been adjusted to inauguration day. This isn't going away because of political milestones. It will only go away once either we have it under control via vaccine or herd immunity. Thats it</p>

        <p>I’m gonna get downvoted to all hell on this sub but here it goes:</p>
<p>Racism is just a different kind of public health crisis, one that kills, and one where protesting seems to be the most effective counter to it. Obviously it’s not ideal to have massive groups gather but in my experience 99% of protestors have masks on at all times, as where in your average “party” you have lots of folks breathing in each others air, no mask in sight. </p>
<p>Also, I think this sub and those protestors share more common ground than ya’ll think; nobody there likes the government, that’s the very same system they are protesting against.</p>

        <p>State-sponsored "protests" during a "deadly global pandemic" that "demands" a myriad of draconian restrictions and rules. Insane levels of hypocrisy, cognitive dissonance, mental gymnastics...the same people who love lockdowns and claim that covid is such a dangerous and deadly virus are the ones that go out by the thousands to March shoulder-to-shoulder...all while calling a backyard barbecue a "superspreading" event and destroying every facet of society where kids aren't even allowed to go to school, restaurants and shops that have ten customers at a time can't even be open, and people can't even go to a park.

        <p>I completely agree and also... to some extent I don't. The biggest transformation of the last few decades has been the destruction of community. It wasn't just parents that taught kids how the world worked, it was everyone in the village. There is no village anymore, just a school full of indcotrinators whose job it is is to ensure that children conform to authority.</p>

        <p>No, that's not the worst part, at least in my opinion.  The worst part is all the people that stayed home for the celebrations (even if I disagree with their politics) because they are deathly afraid still since they've been fed a steady diet of propaganda that they sincerely believe. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.</p>

        <p>This is the most depressing thing I’ve ever witnessed. Millions of us have had our lives ruined over these past 8 months. There has been permanent economic damage done to our country. Our entire election had to be compromised. Systemic change was rushed through to “keep people safe” from COVID, which has led to widespread voter fraud. Then the second their guy gets elected, these same people who crucified anyone who had the gall to go out and live their lives during this pandemic go out in mass crowds to celebrate their win.</p>
<p>On Tuesday it was too dangerous to go vote for our president securely in person. And by Saturday it’s safe to go out and have dance parties in the street because Biden won. This country is hopeless.</p>

        <p>The Constitution talks about what people should do in the event of tyranny and oppression. So no...it wouldn't be hypocritical at all. You don't defeat fascists by cowering and playing by their disingenuous rules. They give themselves the "right" to create a hideous dystopian nightmare, then make you believe you are the bad guy for resisting it and fighting back.

        <p>Well Trump was calling for it and so was Qanon and some other republicans so it was not a totally wild concept that it could happen.  I personally was not super worried though.  We survived through the BLM stuff and that was a much more organized plan of protest.</p>

        <p>If this didn't prove to without any doubt that this whole thing is bullshit, then there is no hope. The Olympic level mental gymnastics these morons do to justify having mass gatherings where hundreds of thousands rub shoulders and hold hands all day and night, while at the same time banning every semblance of normal life and reporting their neighbors for having two friends over. It's beyond disgusting. George Floyd got a national funeral when funerals, schools, businesses, and all gatherings were banned. The media-anointed quacks aka "experts" came out and fully supported the BLM riots. Now gee...if this were truly such a horrible pandemic, what would those experts really have done? Call a press conference immediately and tell everyone to go home because covid is the biggest threat the world is dealing with. The fact that they did not do anything like that and in fact supported this shit...come on. Anyone with two brain cells should have realized at that point that this is all a huge sham, and the "experts" reaction to BLM proves they damn well know it is. They are just willing to stain  the fields of science and medicine forever just for their stupid political agenda.</p>

        <p>It’s because it’s all about control and money. They control the narrative by making these ridiculous restrictions that only apply to honest hard working people. You won’t go out and do this kind of thing because you have a job and a family to look out for.  Even if you did you’d be branded an extremist instead of receiving the praise the “peaceful protestors” got.</p>

        <p>Most blm activists are wearing masks because we acknowledge the virus is real, and also to limit their ability to identify us, since they've started snatching up activists. These protests and trump rallies are large crowd gatherings and that's where the similarities end</p>

        <p>Your article demonstrates that wearing masks works as long as everyone does it. Getting coronavirus is likely with close contact and going to restaurants/bars/coffee shops where people are not following guidelines (can’t wear a mask while you’re eating/drinking). I don’t know why you’re averse to the fact that masks help prevent the spread of the disease to the people around the wearer, as opposed to the wearer himself. </p>
<p>So, your interpretation of the study is misconstruing the findings. Yes, 71% of case patients reported using a mask while in public, but 74% of non-sick subjects also used masks. 42% of sick had close contact with other sick people. Most of those close contacts were family members.  So there is a high possibility that subjects caught the virus while not in public. This makes sense since members of the same household are very likely to pass the virus to others in the household. </p>
<p>While at a restaurant, bar, or coffee shop, those who were sick were more likely to see other people not wearing masks and following guidelines. Going around shopping, salons, and other activities, where guidelines were being followed was not associated with higher cases. </p>
<p>From the paper you linked: 
case-patients were more likely to report dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9–4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5–10.1) than were control-participants. Exposures and activities where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, including going to places that offer on-site eating or drinking, might be important risk factors for acquiring COVID-19.</p>

        <p>You’re contradicting yourself.  You say masks work only if they’re worn all the time, but accept they weren’t worn all the time at this rally (which somehow is still safe?).  You say we shouldn’t lockdown we should just “wear masks” but also acknowledge that it’s impossible to wear a mask all the time while eating/drinking etc.</p>

        <p>Masks, social distancing, and hand washing. It’s a trifecta. You lose one, you lose ground. If people congregate outside of guidelines, you lose ground. </p>
<p>Are bars and restaurants open? According the linked study from cdc, they are a vector ripe for transmission, since masks are not worn while eating. Which county? Maybe we can do some analysis of the risk factors impacting your county.</p>
