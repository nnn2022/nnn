        <p>The death rate for HIV isn't 100%, not sure why you're treating it like it's still a death sentence for those who can access treatment. It's like saying the death rate for leukemia is 100%, ignoring the fact it's far less with modern treatment.</p>
<p>There are studies showing that today, with well controlled HIV, someone isn't at increased risk of death compared to those without HIV. Of course not everyone's is controlled by modern treatment, caught early, and so many don't have access to it. </p>
<p>Well, I suppose 100% of people do die.</p>

        <p>The caveat is "that have access to treatment". Treatment for HIV is very expensive and is the reason why Magic Johnson has survived his infection. Not so much for parts of Africa where HIV has a much worse outcome. May have something to do with lack of treatment (and money).</p>

        <p>Treatment for HIV isn't expensive everywhere. The death rate for HIV is not 100%. My father's side is from Africa and my mum lived in various countries there for a time, I'm aware of the HIV issue there and the inequality but even in many countries there it's improving and there's increasing access to treatment.</p>

        <p>But that was my argument against the OP's claim of 100% death rate and honestly didn't notice you were not them. I really doubt they had say African countries where access to treatment is limited but improving in mind when making a comment that clearly was a reference to changes to disclosure laws in I assume they're American...</p>

        <p>Around the world, including gradually in states over there in America, laws that require people to disclose their HIV status prior to sex or face felony/indictable criminal charges. For example, <a href="https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/blog/laws/do-i-have-to-tell-a-sexual-partner-that-i-am-hiv-positive-in-california/">California</a> where it is no longer a felony to not disclose your HIV status prior to sex. They now appear to on reading require the intention to infect a sexual partner with an STD and it's a misdemeanor not a felony.</p>
<p>Other states and other countries will follow these places in time regarding disclosure laws it appears. For example, my state in Australia caught up some other states with a change of law that means someone with HIV isn't legally required to disclose their status prior to sex. They must take reasonable precautions to avoid transmission, though.</p>
<p>I think people have taken this to mean that people with HIV can now go around purposefully infecting people for thrills I'm not sure?</p>

        <p>So what if this story was kept the same, except COVID was replaced with a serious STD. What then?</p>
<p>This type of shit seriously happens all the time with STDs. People don't get tested, are waiting on their test results, or maybe think something could be amiss but don't get tested until later on. Then they go and have sex with a handful of people and pass it along. No one's bitching about that?</p>
<p>Side note: I find it hilarious how many younger people are so concerned about COVID that they want people to wear masks during sex with them, yet I'd bet good money that most of those same people don't use condoms and/or don't routinely get tested for STDs.</p>

        <p>Please don't spread the hate! And “facing ten years in jail” is definitively bullshit! Here's an article painting a somewhat different picture:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/superspreaderin-garmisch-corona-101.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab-global-de-DE"><strong>Vorwürfe gegen US-Bürgerin: Die angebliche Superspreaderin von Garmisch | tagesschau.de</strong></a></p>
<p>Translation via <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a>:</p>
<h1>The alleged superspreader from Garmisch</h1>
<p><a href="https://tagesschau.de"><em>tagesschau.de</em></a></p>
<p><em>7-8 minutes</em></p>
<p><strong>She allegedly infected many people with Corona on a pub crawl, and the US citizen must be severely punished, they said. Accusations and demands were drastic - but the evidence for this was thin.</strong></p>
<p><em>By Andrej Reisin, NDR, and Patrick Gensing,</em> <a href="https://tagesschau.de"><em>tagesschau.de</em></a></p>
<p>Last weekend, reports had caused a sensation and concern: "A superspreader is partying", was the headline on Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Tagesschau reported "Investigations against superspreader", and the "Bild" reported that "Garmisch-Partenkirchen is angry with the superspreader". In a video caption, the tabloid even spoke of a "potential killer". The newspaper also mentioned the woman's first name and abbreviated last name, which could lead to her identification.</p>
<p><strong>US American woman had herself tested after vacation</strong></p>
<p>The background: a 26-year-old American woman, who lives in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and had returned from her vacation in Greece, had infected numerous people in the Bavarian resort.</p>
<p>The woman works in a hotel for US forces and their families. The company was closed on Monday for two weeks after a total of 25 employees had tested positive there so far. According to the district administration office, the woman underwent a corona test on September 7 (Monday). Then she is said to have gone to several bars on Tuesday. On Wednesday she finally received her positive test result. District Administrator Anton Speer emphasized that the woman "knowingly failed to observe the quarantine".</p>
<p><strong>Exact quarantine order unknown</strong></p>
<p>But even this statement is controversial: For example, when asked, the district office could not specify whether the woman was told that she had to stay at home or whether she was only advised to do so, as the Bavarian Radio reported. This was "difficult to understand at present due to capacity reasons at test stations and offices". Bavaria's Interior Minister, Joachim Herrmann, on the other hand, was convinced: "She had been advised, recommended, told she had to go into quarantine", Herrmann told BR on Sunday.</p>
<p>According to experts, however, the exact wording is what counts: "If a doctor told the woman that it was unlikely or not at all known that she was infected, then she could say: I trusted not to be infected", the station quoted Munich medical lawyer Andreas Spickhoff.</p>
<p><strong>Drastic punishments demanded</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, not only Herrmann, but also Bavaria's Minister-President Markus Söder demanded drastic penalties: the "model case for unreasonableness" had to "have consequences", said Söder and pleaded for "correspondingly high fines". In Bavaria, a fine of 2000 euros can be imposed for violations of quarantine regulations. Herrmann went even further and spoke of claims for damages. Finally, the Munich II public prosecutor's office began investigations on Monday on suspicion of negligent bodily injury.</p>
<p><strong>Three positives and no "pub crawl</strong></p>
<p>But little by little more and more details of the case raise questions: Hundreds of people in Garmisch-Partenkirchen have now responded to the authorities' call for a corona test. Around 740 were already tested at the weekend, and another 300 were added on Monday. The result: three tests were positive. In the case of these three newly infected persons, there was a connection with the 26-year-old: One person works in the restaurant the woman visited on Tuesday, two were guests of an Irish Pub at the same time the week before.</p>
<p>It also became known that the woman was by no means on a "pub crawl" on Tuesday evening, as authorities, politicians and the media still write today, but in a pub. Besides, pure bars, pubs and enterprises of the night life in Bavaria may not open at all yet. Strictly speaking, therefore, the venues are dining establishments. The woman visited another establishment before her test - and thus also before a possible quarantine, as the District Office, which had initially presented the woman as the main source of many new infections, informed the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>Not a single infection definitely attributable</strong></p>
<p>Of 32 new infections that were registered on Friday, only a part is related to the 26-year-old. These were mainly those infected in the hotel where the woman herself works. However, the district administration office can in no way say whether the woman infected her colleagues - or was simply infected there herself. Other new infections would in any case have had no contact with the woman.</p>
<p>So far no infection in Garmisch-Partenkirchen can be proven to be due to the woman, who has been called "Superspreaderin" by authorities, politics and media for days. In this context, the behavior of the district administrator and some media seems questionable, as they blame the responsibility for the increase in numbers of a whole district on the behavior of a young woman without any evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Premature assignment of blame</strong></p>
<p>Even after a corona outbreak in Göttingen in early June, the alleged culprits were quickly found: "extended families" even from the high-rise complex "Iduna Zentrum". They should be responsible for the wave of infection. According to an announcement by the city, the infections were "connected with several large private celebrations". Later, the city adds to this: They follow up on references to a meeting in a shisha bar. Although the city later declared that there was no evidence of infection in the shisha bar, the story was already out in the world. The ARD magazine Panorama investigated the accusations - the evidence for the blame remained thin.</p>
<p>After the corona outbreak at the Tönnies meat company, NRW Minister President Armin Laschet had also said in June that Romanians and Bulgarians had introduced the virus. A little later, the CDU politician declared that it was forbidden "to blame people of any origin for the virus". In July, Monitor reported that Tönnies employees in the Gütersloh district were wrongly kept in quarantine - due to positive corona tests or symptoms of disease, which in many cases did not exist.</p>
