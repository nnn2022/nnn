    <strong>Give me your hand and let's ride the Covid carousel:</strong>
    <p><p>Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>First, what's a coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia says it's "a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds."</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus</p>
<p>If it's a group, <strong>how many members there's in it?</strong></p>
<p>My lazy search tells me that there are 7 types:</p>
<p>229E (alpha coronavirus)<br>
NL63 (alpha coronavirus)<br>
OC43 (beta coronavirus)<br>
HKU1 (beta coronavirus)<br>
MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS)<br>
SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS)<br>
SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19)  </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html</p>
<p>Seven types. Interesting. <strong>Are those other types dangerous?</strong> Let's do another lazy search:</p>
<p>I found information again in the CDC website telling me that an outbreak happened in 2017. "We describe an outbreak of severe respiratory illness associated with human coronavirus NL63 in a long-term care facility in Louisiana in November 2017. Six of 20 case-patients were hospitalized with pneumonia, and 3 of 20 died. Clinicians should consider human coronavirus NL63 for patients in similar settings with respiratory disease."</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/10/18-0862_article</p>
<p>I'm curious now. <strong>Do other outbreaks happened around the world?</strong><br>
So I remembered a lazy search I did last year about Los Angeles, California in 2018. It was because Influenza it seems. Here: read://https_www.latimes.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Flocal%2Flanow%2Fla-me-ln-flu-demand-20180116-htmlstory.html</p>
<p>"Hospitals across the state are sending away ambulances, flying in nurses from out of state and not letting children visit their loved ones for fear they’ll spread the flu. Others are canceling surgeries and erecting tents in their parking lots so they can triage the hordes of flu patients."</p>
<p>I'm sure we can find much more, like here in Brazil, but we are lazy, doing only lazy searchs and the examples above are enough. The lesson here is: it happened before, it always happened (because I'm not alienated and just remember).</p>
<p>Calm down, calm down. I know what you are thinking. Let the carousel finish it's spin.  </p>
<p>Now! Now we ask: <strong>what about the PCR Test?</strong></p>
<p>How it works?<br>
In resume, "The PCR step then uses special chemicals and a PCR machine, called a thermal <strong>cycler</strong>, which cause a reaction to occur that makes millions of copies of a small portion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s genetic material. During this process, one of the chemicals produces a fluorescent light if SARS-CoV-2 is present in the sample. This fluorescent light is a “signal” that is detected by the PCR machine and special software is used to <strong>interpret</strong> the signal as a positive test result."</p>
<p>https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/21462-covid-19-and-pcr-testing</p>
<p>I think we should focus in two keyworkds, "cycler" and "interpret".<br>
<strong>I remember something polemic about the word "cycle". What WHO has to say?</strong></p>
<p>"(1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load."</p>
<p>https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05</p>
<p><strong>Now what about the software to "interpret"?</strong> Another lazy reasearch and I found something interesting about this software:</p>
<p>Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-CoV-2:<br>
"Clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease."</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/136472/download</p>
<p>What?! I'm really dizzy, this carousel is full of questions!</p>
<p>So flu outbreaks always happened, there are other types of coronavirus and the PCR test cycle can be manipulated in order to detect more or less genetic material that are not conclusive to say the person is truly infected? What a ride!</p>
<p>WHO changed the PCR cycle and we can see it as a drop in the graphic around January/Frebruary, what gave us the "second wave":</p>
<p>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>
<p><strong>Second wave which is being used for more surveillance and restrictions.</strong> What was happening about this theme before the "pandemic"? Of course, a lazy search:</p>
<p>"If 2018 was the year of communities standing together in the fight for democratic control over whether or not police may acquire surveillance technology, 2019 was the year that many of these same communities led the charge to ban government face surveillance. "</p>
<p>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/year-fight-against-government-face-surveillance</p>
<p><strong>What happened after?</strong></p>
<p>"The rise of internet usage has certainly made it significantly easier for mass surveillance to take hold in a greater way. Just think about the amount of data people reveal about themselves when they use nonprivate search, for example. It’s disappointing, but perhaps not surprising, that the U.S. Senate voted to allow law enforcement to continue collecting citizens’ search and browsing history."</p>

<p>And ofc the vaccine passports and apps for surveillance.</p>
<p>https://truststamp.ai/</p>
<p><em>Edit about trust stamp: they removed the partners page, where we could see giants like Master Card, for example</em></p>
<p>You can for sure apply this for the entire world. Did you heard anything about privacy protection after the "holy graal covid"?</p>
<p>I could continue, but I need to step down the carousel...</p>
<p>What a ride...</p></p>

        <p>Statistically engineered.  I had mentioned the drop last winter during an appointment with my PCP and his response was it was because flu wasn't being reported- the numbers weren't being sought after... it was all about Covid.</p>
