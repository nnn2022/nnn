        <p>What a fantastic rebuttal! Full of great counter-points and devoid of any logically fallacious arguments! </p>
<p>&rt;    Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, led by China’s leading expert on bat viruses, Shi Zheng-li or “Bat Lady,” mounted frequent expeditions to the bat-infested caves of Yunnan in southern China and collected around a hundred different bat coronaviruses...</p>
<p>&rt;    It cannot yet be stated that Shi did or did not generate SARS2 in her lab because her records have been sealed, but it seems she was certainly on the right track to have done so. “It is clear that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was systematically constructing novel chimeric coronaviruses and was assessing their ability to infect human cells and human-ACE2-expressing mice,” says Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and leading expert on biosafety.</p>
<p>&rt;    It’s documented that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were doing gain-of-function experiments designed to make coronaviruses infect human cells and humanized mice. This is exactly the kind of experiment from which a SARS2-like virus could have emerged. The researchers were not vaccinated against the viruses under study, and they were working in the minimal safety conditions of a BSL2 laboratory. So escape of a virus would not be at all surprising. In all of China, the pandemic broke out on the doorstep of the Wuhan institute. The virus was already well adapted to humans, as expected for a virus grown in humanized mice. It possessed an unusual enhancement, a furin cleavage site, which is not possessed by any other known SARS-related beta-coronavirus, and this site included a double arginine codon also unknown among beta-coronaviruses. What more evidence could you want, aside from the presently unobtainable lab records documenting SARS2’s creation?</p>
<p>&rt;    Proponents of natural emergence have a rather harder story to tell... No one has found the bat population that was the source of SARS2, if indeed it ever infected bats. No intermediate host has presented itself, despite an intensive search by Chinese authorities that included the testing of 80,000 animals. There is no evidence of the virus making multiple independent jumps from its intermediate host to people, as both the SARS1 and MERS viruses did. There is no evidence from hospital surveillance records of the epidemic gathering strength in the population as the virus evolved. There is no explanation of why a natural epidemic should break out in Wuhan and nowhere else. There is no good explanation of how the virus acquired its furin cleavage site, which no other SARS-related beta-coronavirus possesses, nor why the site is composed of human-preferred codons. The natural emergence theory battles a bristling array of implausibilities.</p>

        <p>I don't need to prove a bioweapon exists when the virus has not been isolated, and the "pandemic" kills no one. You are shilling for the establishment, pushing the fear agenda. Truth is rarely based on fear. Also not now. </p>
<p>So long, bat boy.</p>
<p>There is no virus.</p>

        <p>Hey, you and I may not disagree after all. </p>
<p>IMO: <strong><em>If</em></strong> SARS-CoV-2 does indeed exist, and isn’t just a matter of reclassification of already-existing causes of death, then it makes good sense that it originated as a result of gain of function research. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts about SARS-CoV-2 not in fact existing. Genuinely interested.</p>

        <p>No infectious virus can be isolated with the current techniques. Understanding virus isolation is key in understanding they have never isolated any infectious virus. Not polio, not measles, not hiv, not sars cov2. That is of course logical, once you understand that germ theory is not correct. We do not get sick from germs. Germs are our friends. </p>
<p>We get sick from toxins/imbalances, nothing else. All pandemics are toxin based (polio, hiv) or staged, like covid. That's terrain theory, and that's the hated, ridiculed, truth, by brilliant scientist Antoine Bechamp. Pasteur was an amateur, a fraud.</p>

        <p>Nah, there is no Q-whatever you wanna call it. It is a manmade virus that isn't super deadly but TPTB still used it to convince people to get the injection which is the real bioweapon.</p>
