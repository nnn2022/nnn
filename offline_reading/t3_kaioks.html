        <p>I was very disappointed to see that even when sorting by controversial, there was very few people defending the argument, and a lot of deleted comments.  And of course mods locked the thread.  Mods are pretty aggressively controlling the narrative and deleting wrongthink.</p>

        <p>I wish they cared this much about the fact that in 2019 there were more mass shootings than days in the year... but alas, guess the parents who sent a kid to school in the morning, or the families and friends who saw someone off to their jobs only to come home to the police at their door or a news story dont matter as much as your grandma!</p>

        <p>Using blanket gun control to stop mass shootings is about as sensible as using blanket lockdowns to stop COVID spread.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It relies on a flawed emotional argument: "If you don't support my infringement on your rights, it's because you literally support people dying."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People greatly overestimate the risk of both.  The death rate of COVID for people 20-49 is 0.02%.  Kids are more likely to be killed on their way to school in a traffic accident than they are in a mass shooting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "solution" isn't backed up by any sort of demonstrated track record.  Columbine happened during the AWB.  Red flag laws haven't prevented a single mass shooting.  Virginia Tech was committed using handguns.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solution doesn't actually save a measurable amount of lives.  COVID death rates are comparable in places with lockdowns and places without them (excluding rare instances like New Zealand where borderline eradication was possible).  Likewise, mass shootings make up something like 1% of gun deaths and homicides in America.  If we somehow stopped mass shootings overnight, there wouldn't be a measurable effect on the homicide rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguments often rely on shoddy comparisons.  People often cite that America has a higher homicide rate than most developed countries.  But America also has a drug war and gang violence on a scale much larger than other countries.  Plus we share a border with Mexico.  Oh and if you only look at north and south America, the US has the 5th lowest homicide rate, only behind Aruba, Canada, Martinique, and Chile (2 of those countries have less than 1M population).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguments rely on misleading data.  People often say, "10000 people die from gun violence every year in America," but don't mention that suicides make up 2/3 of gun deaths.  Countries like Japan and South Korea show that banning guns doesn't stop suicides.  This kind of data inflation is also obviously seen with COVID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solution disproportionately affects people who follow the rules without affecting people who ignore the rules.  A mask mandate and dining shutdown is death for businesses.  But people who don't bother wearing masks will continue not wearing masks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>I never said anything about gun control my dude... </p>
<p>There are plenty of factors that go into a mass shooting/mass murder maybe if we cared as much about a 45yo mom who gets shot at work because her coworker has no mental health supports or a 6yo kid who gets shot in a gang shooting (which are also... mass shooting events if they are over 3 ppl...) because their community is allowed to go to shit because they’re undesirable, we’d have a better world overall... </p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to stop mass shootings that aren’t gun control and to your point dude I live in Canada, WORST mass shooting in the entire country happened this year in the country’s most locked down provinces, all with legal guns. Gun control is only one tbh small piece of how to solve the problem of people who have so little to live for they think they should take others down with them.</p>

        <p>Ahh that's reasonable. </p>
<p>Yeah unfortunately gun control seems to be the only proposed "solution" to mass shootings.  That and security theater.  Trying to address the mental health issues that cause people to commit these crimes is something neither party is interested in.</p>

        <p>That's because those that are the loudest about gun control have no interest in legally owned weapons of citizens.. they want to disarm us and that should terrify everyone - even those with no interest in guns.... And the citizens that loudly agree are so stuck on party lines they don't think critically about anything their party proposes, they just say the opposite of whatever the opposing party says. (And of course people of ALL parties do this just to stick it to the other sides).</p>

        <p>We had to cut out a family member for similar thinking.  We have small children and and are very adamant that the lockdowns are destroying the youths’ lives and opportunities and since kids are pretty much spared that at the very least we should return to normal for our kids.  But this person, well educated and not normally a psycho, said she couldn’t believe that we would value children over older people and that our children would be cursed.  Ffs shouldn’t we all protect kids over ourselves???!!!</p>

        <p>I keep seeing shit shared that says "If our parents and grandparents were told to stay inside to save our lives they wouldn't think twice about it. They deserve the same thing." Or something along those lines...</p>
<p>Bitch my parents and grandparents value my and my children's freedom so nah.. they raised us to be ready to defend ourselves about tyranny and they'd have done the same damn thing for me when I was a child that I'm doing for my children this year. Refusing to back down, conform, or accept these police state wanna-bes...past generations have fought for the life I have today, it's my duty to continue to not only keep it the way it is but maybe even make it better for those that I'll leave behind one day. </p>
<p>I have an elderly grandparent whose weekly domino game kept being cancelled due to The Great Hysteria so she said forget y'all and her group, mostly elderly ladies, started doing dominos at their homes together instead.</p>
<p>They need to quit fooling themselves with belief that the older, actually at risk folks want this.. they've lived through some stuff. </p>
<p>They lost children and spouses in war, grew up in The Great Depression that shaped them into preppers early on, lost careers in the 2008 crash, saw our country attacked on live TV at ages they fully comprehended the horrors, known people who fled countries of dictatorships.
As a whole the older generations do not and never have trusted the government.. you really think they're gonna start now ? 
These are the people who raised us ready to fight against them.</p>
<p>It's the younger folks whose minds were warped by peers that are all for this tyranny because the government has spent decades now figuring out exactly how to convince us we're too stupid to deserve an ounce of independence. They have spent decades molding us into a group of adults that practically beg on our knees for Big Daddy Government to make every decision for us and they then introduced cancel culture to seal the deal for those of us that had elders strong enough to keep our minds from being warped.</p>
<p>Don't fall for it.</p>

        <p>Lol. I definitely don’t agree with any of the ‘security’ measures on airports - I doubt they’ve stopped a single terrorist by taking away a water bottle. </p>
<p>I’m commenting on how different deaths from a virus and from a long-planned attack by a trigger happy, apocalypse-bent terrorist organization are, and how illogical it is to compare them, particularly in terms of prevention.</p>
