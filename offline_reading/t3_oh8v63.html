    <strong>Dear advertisers:</strong>
    <p><p>So during the 2016 election season, as we later found out, a company was hired to produce micro-targeted ads that were <em>scientifically fine-tuned</em> to create the inevitable effect of reliably changing our minds to vote for whichever candidate that paid the right price. It was huge news all over the world: Cambridge Analytica does the impossible! Up to 200,000 variations of one advertisement alone multiplied by some ridiculous other number of iterations claimed to be used per each person to line us all up from shortest to tallest in every psychological dimension imaginable to figure out how to get us to move and shake exactly the way they wanted us to without question. It was a smashing success! A new glistening horizon in the industry had been established as the preeminent 'low-bar' standard for all subsequent public relations campaigns.</p>
<p>-brief pause-</p>
<p>Flash forward to 2020: "here is a government-funded ad digitally scrawled out by an angry three-legged albino pangolin with early-onset dementia that will confuse you, piss you off and make you totally lose trust in all institutions all at once. The follow-up advertisement will be a middle-aged, balding man, arms crossed, poorly dressed, shaking his head, scolding us for not properly understanding the aforementioned ad as if we should have known how stupid we needed to be before we set our eyes upon it.</p>
<p>Dear any advertisers out there: what the hell happened? Was the CA story bullshit, too? You were supposed to protect us and spoon-feed us so that we could consume product more efficiently and effectively and at a bargain that we couldn't refuse! Are we not supposed to consume product any longer? Why do I not have a Monster Energy Vaccine in my hand <em>right now</em>, ready to bike off a cliff, from a hot-air balloon, safely yet furiously into a bleak, fiery abyss, on camera and in front of some sick babes wearing bacon bikinis and oversized top hats? Have you finally dared to lift your finger from the pulse of America? Or <em>am</em> <strong><em>I</em></strong> in the wrong, here?</p></p>
