        <p>UCLA is corrupted? Not only is it in California, but it is dependent on the state and private donors for funds, and those donors might have an implicit agenda in maximizing vaccination rates and would use their economic beneficiaries as tools to implement it.</p>

        <p>Because it’s California and the typical belief here is that minorities especially Latinos, must be coddled. The progressives/neolibs with their savior complex don’t believe that Latinos can’t think for themselves, can get health care and housing and insurance and whatnot on their own. They think everything is racist. If Latinos aren’t getting covid tests or the vaccines, it is automatically assumed that it’s because of racism, they are purposely being excluded. I am serious. Life long Californian here in a predominately Latino area so I see this shit regularly. The SJWs are saviors always out to save the Latinos from racism. When the vaccine was first released and elderly were at the top of the list, the vaccine went to pharmacies that served the most elderly. It was all over the news because OMG of course rich White people get the vaccine first! There are parts of the Latino community that definitely do need outreach but it’s really common here to believe that if the Latinos do not fall in line with the majority and do what the libs/progressives think they should be doing, it’s because of racism. And that’s where the libs come in and try to save them.</p>

        <p>I live in Estonia and they see targeting the Russian demographic, which is known to be more sceptic towards vaccines and all kinds of woke propaganda. Sure it’s very different from the US, but if I can have a guess I think ethnic minorities are more likely to resist such propaganda and hence, it takes more concentrated efforts to try to change their minds. So likely that’s why they’re targeting Latinos?</p>
