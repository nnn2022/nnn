    <strong>Quick question</strong>
    <p><p>Why is it that when a liberal or democratic person gets offended by what you say or disagree with what you said they attack you personally. But when a republican or conservative disagrees they at-least try to give reasons n sources. . .without attacking the person. Now it’s not blanket both sides have good n bad ideas. Is it due to the fact the BLM peaceful riots are allowed to steal burn and kill people with no jail time? While a actual peaceful protest on Jan 6 is held without bail along with being forced to watch reprogramming materials…</p></p>

        <p>I've gone left to right over the last 10 years and would agree there is much more nastiness, blanket dismissal and ad hominem attacks from the left.</p>
<p>I think it's because they have convinced themselves that they have the moral high ground and are therefore superior.</p>
<p>And because they can't support the positions they hold in an argument.</p>
<p>As an example, the comments on the liberal, broadsheet Guardian newspaper are much less tolerant of any dissenting opinions than on the right wing, and 'lower brow' daily mail.</p>

        <p>Rhetorical question as we cannot get inside people's heads to tell what pushes them.  There's either a base respect or a lack of it at the basis of the response where some people assume you must agree with them without question while others recognize you may hold other views and try to respect that.</p>

        <p>Your political enemies always look dumb.</p>
<p>Same goes for the left: if you hear them talking to each other about you, they all think that conservatives have negative IQ, never read Karl Marx and can't make a sound argument.</p>
<p>If your enemies were indeed dumb, you would've won by now. They aren't dumb. Also, so what if they were? Intelligence is overrated. Charachter, courage, organization have nothing to do with intelligence, but a lot more useful in politics.</p>

        <p>A lot of my friends are extreme leftists, and I think the answer to this is that there’s a lot of propaganda on the left that does make those arguing from the right seem like they’re openly racist/homophobic/just terrible people with no morals. They go for personal attacks because it feels like people from the right are attacking you viciously when they’re not conforming to the kinds of political correctness that you expect from other leftists.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t agree with being forced to use certain terminology or having to walk on eggshells with what language you use, but when you hang out with extreme leftists you just kind of get used to it, so when you have people so clearly NOT conforming to those standards, you’re kind of sensitive to that. It’s wrong, but I think that’s what makes them lash out, because it feels like a personal attack just in the way that you speak, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Also I don’t think it’s fair to say that Jan 6 was completely peaceful. I’m not saying the BLM movement was in any way better in terms of damage, but they definitely weren’t sitting outside calmly with picket signs on the 6th either.</p>
<p>I don’t really want to get into any political debates here, I just wanted to shed light on a possible question to your answer, and I hope that helped!</p>

        <p>Let me start with thank you for taking your time (along with everyone else) but walking on egg shells is how I feel when I go see friends that are lefts. The right friends I feel like if I say something out of line they laugh hit me besides head and we stay friends lol. I agree some was peaceful and a lot was pent up anger. I get it. But no debates just asking for others opinions to help get my thoughts out in words that make sense to the masses. I struggle with thoughts to words. But you all been great. Thanks again</p>

        <p>Yeah I totally agree. I’m really conditioned to talking to my leftist friends, and now that my romantic partner leans right I definitely am having a hard time letting go of those preconceived notions of how people should talk. A lot of times I catch myself calling him out for no reason because of what I’m used to. It’s definitely a transition but it’s really freeing being able to discuss my thoughts and feelings freely, and I’m trying to transition to his way of doing things.</p>

        <p>Best answer, I guess, is you are just ignoring insults from "the right". Both have extremists, both equally insulting, dismissive &amp; authoritarian. </p>
<p>Jan 6 was NOT peaceful!!!!! One Cop was killed. That is not peace. It was perhaps the absolutely worst planned &amp; executed attempt at insurrection in the history of the world, but peaceful was not a part of it. (Unless you mean the actual peaceful part outside, where no one was arrested. (Which was the vast majority)</p>

        <p>There were 0 cops killed on Jan 6. https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/capitol-siege-sicknick-dead-natural-causes-1.5993884
There was however a police officer shooting and killing an unarmed woman that you probably didn't hear or care about because she wasnt black and supported orange man bad. No fiery peaceful protest for this police shooting. https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ashli-babbitt-capitol-police-shooting/2021/04/14/452fb414-666a-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html
January 6th while a dumbass thing to do was not an insurrection. Capitol police allowed them to enter the building by standing down out front. I didnt see anyone but the police carrying a weapon, I did see plenty of photographers though. Political theater not an actual insurrection.</p>

        <p>OK, I hadn't seen the update that they decided he died of "natural causes" (As natural as the vaccine deaths!).</p>
<p>However, your own link disproves your claim the police all "let them in". Some did, whether they were inside men or just decided they were not getting paid enough to face a mob is up to debate.</p>
<p>I did see the video of the stupid woman that was shot trying to climb through a broken window at a guy with a gun... Would YOU do that? </p>
<p>If all 'political theater', then they are all actors. I guess you choose. </p>
<p>LOL@ your lame attempt at insult in a thread about "the right" doesn't insult! Are you an actor?</p>

        <p>Probably a lame attempt at an insult because none of it was meant to be, just trying to give you some information you may not have seen or considered.
No I wouldn't do that.
Just because its political theater doesn't mean they all have to be actors, I'm sure you've heard of useful idiots and agent provocateurs before, and many political factions had vested interests in this day looking like the worst thing to happen since 9/11. Agent provocateurs can get a lot done with little man power. Here's one from that day. Says he was there to document which may have been his original plan but when opportunity arose to provoke and egg on the crowd he became an agent of his cause. https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13749423/black-lives-matter-activist-john-sullivan-charged/
All you have to do is set the stage, the useful idiots and strategically placed agents will the do the work.</p>

        <p>People have been fed this line about the "insurrection" from the media and cannot even use common sense. A couple of my friends were like "what do you think of the insurrection?" And sincerely concerned about it.  I said unless they brought guns, bombs, tanks, then it was a handful of whack-a-doddles  upset about the election and nothing more.  </p>
<p>You cannot overthrow governments by entering a building illegally and wearing a horned hat and taking somebody's lecturn!  </p>
<p>Unless someone can show me some proof of regime change with horned hats I stand by my statements! Haha</p>
