        <p>All I know is that eventually I am moving to the most anti lockdown, anti mask, anti vaccine passport, gun loving state that I can find. The majority of states are filled with these people. They just aren't wasting time on the internet complaining about it.</p>

        <p>Good luck. This is going to be implemented everywhere including the likes of Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>And before you come back at me with a "LOL THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN!", here's a list of all the things I "predicted" that peole in this sub (and Reddit) said would never happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That the lockdowns would go past two weeks, and likely last months or years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That masks will become mandatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Biden would win the election (no, I don't support him, but it was super obvious they were going to hand over the US to the globalist supporters)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Biden's win would not end the tyranny (it's not over, those who say it is are delusional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That vaccine passports would happen altogether</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I almost want to be petty and summon the regulars from here who chastized me over vaccine passports, but I'll refrain from that for now.</p>

        <p>That state would be the great state of Texas. Specifically EAST Texas. Stay away from Austin. Hopefully Texas won't be the new California.</p>

        <p>So when brought up the point of ‘ Immune compromised people shouldn’t be travelling or getting exemptions’ people jump up and shout discrimination.
Well perfectly healthy people have given up a year of their lives. I’m in Ireland and my job closed because of the lockdown. I could have worked throughout but this business along many others was non essential. If they let us back out people would be out in full swing with no worry at all. All you could have looked at was the few weeks we had available over Christmas. How about if you’re sick / paranoid / afraid stay SAFE and at home please!</p>
<p>Also to add I spoke about this with my partner. He isn’t nowhere near worried as I am. But I asked him ‘When would it stop?’ ... the government would have power to implement other ‘necessary’ vaccines such as the flu vaccine that has declined for years. He hasn’t even taken it in a veeeery long time simply because he doesn’t need to. But he scoffs at me saying they would never do that. Hellooo the passports for travel and other every day life was a conspiracy and here we are.</p>

        <p>People in the UK usually are for vaccine passports and they are pro-vaccine... This is what the survey data shows.... </p>
<p>I am really not sure if I am pro or against, but definitely, I am against that passport.</p>
