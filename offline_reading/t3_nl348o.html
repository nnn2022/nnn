    <strong>The worst part of this situation has been the complete loss of credibility of "experts"</strong>
    <p><p>We've all seen it. The backtracking, changing of rules, and blatant misinformation spread by those who want to be called "experts". The CDC, the media, the WHO, and many, many politicians have all spread lies and misinformation. It's eroded trust people have had in these people and organization. Even some of my pro-mask, pro-vaccine, pro-lockdown acquaintances don't trust Fauci.</p>
<p>Even assuming that all this misinformation was an honest mistake, the blatant hypocrisy of leaders has damaged credibility. The governors of multiple states told people to comply with COVID rules, then broke them themselves. Hell, look at Whitmer, who when she was caught breaking her own rules for the third time, said it was ok because the place she went had good pizza.</p>
<p>This isn't the last pandemic. During the next one, public distrust will be high because of their experiences with this one. We can only pray it's not deadly.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for this, it encapsulated my exact sentiments on this issue perfectly. Once the whole truth is out about this scamdemic, the public have zero (and I mean absolute zero!) trust in all officials, be it medical or government regulators. And then if a real serious pandemic happens, people could die because they won't know who to trust anymore. People need to hang for this!</p>

        <p>Agree.  </p>
<p>Government agencies (health, CDC, CIA, FBI, all of them) should be a-political and only deal n facts.  The raw data used needs to be easily available on their sites, statistics, facts.  NO politics.  Whatever their data, the decisions need to be made by our elected representatives with our rights in mind, not made by unelected people, especially ones with a vested interest in the outcome.  </p>
<p>That is the worst outcome of the last few years, the complete erosion of public trust in government agencies.</p>

        <p>When this whole thing first started I honestly thought “this’ll be a good practice run for a more serious pandemic. Govts can get some good plans in place for what to do, practice, etc. in the end we’ll come out the other side better prepared.” </p>
<p>I couldn’t have been more wrong. If we have a serious (in terms of lethality, I understand this was still serious to a lot of people) pandemic we are so screwed it isn’t even funny.</p>

        <p>I so wish I had your optimism.... All I see are bleeting sheep that can't wait to obey the next restriction &amp; refuse to believe even the 'advice' they can ease up.</p>
