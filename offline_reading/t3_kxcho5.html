    <strong>I feel like the lockdowns starting to get to me.</strong>
    <p><p>I miss talking to real people my age. I’m cut off from contact with anyone who isn’t my immediate family or neighbors, and I basically live on discord. </p>
<p>I spend almost all my time in my room, and what time I do spend outdoors doesn’t feel any better, especially since it’s usually just working on projects.</p>
<p>I’m starting to find it harder to find motivation or enjoy things. I’m trying to get into muscle building but all I got is a fuckin’ pull-up bar that I can’t set up anywhere around our entire property.</p>
<p>My only place I can redirect my negative emotions is into my seething hatred of the elite who did this, I wish, every day, for a revolution and them to be fucking crucified.</p>
<p>I’ve held out for a really long time living like this and only now I think I’m really starting to decline.</p></p>

        <p>For me, its dating. I used to live up in Chicago and while I'm not a huge player, I had plenty of dates, nights, etc. Now I live back in my small hometown with pretty much just dating apps. I HATE dating apps, always have. Its the most superficial shit ever. Ive missed out so much opportunity to meet someone. Its awful</p>

        <p>I can relate. I've felt a lot more slothful. However I've moved from a large metro months ago and only got a car in the last month. Fortunately the restrictions here are not as bad so I'm planning on getting back into activity and every few weeks I enjoy going to a spa. Many of those are closed across the country including the one I used to go to.</p>

        <p>You can workout with anything heavy, sand bags work and are cheap and available. TrainerHub has a bunch of sandbag workout videos on YouTube. Getting active is a good idea, do with whatever you have. It will help a lot. https://youtu.be/PKkvk33P6OA</p>

        <p>Same. I was really involved in music before this (like spent all my time at bands involved) and now it's just gone. I still can't believe it, I just feel like I'm living in the memories of what I used to love. With bands, it's not just the music but the people, and the events. Sure, I'm quite introverted but just before lockdown I was getting better at talking to new people and I'm really sad that I lost that progress. Now the enjoyment I used to feel for music isn't there, it's making me want to quit but everyone just expects me to be fine and nothing to change. I've lost the motivation to do things, particularly music, and earlier this year I didn't feel any joy for a month. I thought I'd gotten out of that, but it keeps coming back - that empty feeling like all the happiness was just sucked out of you.</p>
<p>But it's only with this most recent lockdown that I realised I was still pretty lucky. Sure, school was a covid nightmare, but I still got to go. I got to see people, and see how many covid rules I could break and get away with (which is oddly fun). I went on a weekend trip in September with a friend, and have met a few friends at their houses over the year. Now though, I haven't heard from anyone in a while and the one friend I have heard from isn't allowed to come visit because her mum is worried. I'm stuck in this fake online schooling (I <em>hate</em> real life being replaced with a camera, it's so superficial) and I just feel no drive for anything anymore. I've been screwed over this year to the point where caring about passing exams just feels painful, I don't want to prepare for this kind of future and I'm sick of waiting for people to fight. Alone, I can only push them a little and I can only really do it face to face.</p>
<p>The only thing that I'm holding onto is art. This year, I've poured my time and emotions into it, my skill has hugely developed and it's helped me discharge the rage I feel. However, I'm worried now because I can feel the onset of inevitable burnout, and I don't know what else will keep me going. I'm in a perpetual cycle of a deep rage and the burning desire to go out and fight against this, but then I realise that still nothing has changed and I just feel worse. Then the emotions hurt too much and I end up in a state of apathy where I feel empty, with the occasional day of being positive this can't last forever. I really don't know how much longer I can hold out. I'll keep pushing on until the spring, many have said they won't got past a year of this and I'd at least like to see if they'll stick to their word.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant. Wishing you the best, you're not alone in your will to fight.</p>
