    <strong>Stat Inaccuracy? (long read)</strong>
    <p><p>Right, so I've been trying to do some research into the total deaths per 1000 worldwide for 2020 and something seems a bit off. Came across this website:</p>
<p>https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/death-rate</p>
<p>Although it states that this data does not include covid deaths, hear me out. There it states that the amount of deaths is: 7.645 per 1000. However, I did come across a site which is challenging the accuracy of this: </p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-death-rates/fact-check-annual-deaths-data-does-not-show-2020-as-having-one-of-the-lowest-rates-in-recent-years-idUSKCN26D0YP</p>
<p>In short it states the reason not to trust the data is:</p>
<p>"It (macrotrends) also lists its data source as the United Nations (UN), which published the latest World Population Prospects in June 2019 (here). The death rates per 1,000 people listed in the UN spreadsheet are close to those published by Macrotrends – although not identical. This was explained by a UN spokesperson as the data being approximations and could therefore mean Macrotrends interpolated its own version by using the UN’s five-year data"</p>
<p>Fair enough, you might say, yet upon clicking the link provided and being directed onto this spreadsheet I discovered that the data for that clearly shows 7.6 per 1000 as the figure. So what? 0.045 difference? How is that a valid argument? Why use the word 'interpollated'? Also if that data used by the UN is also inaccurate and just a prediction then where is the actual figures??</p>
<p>It is pretty difficult to find more stats on total deaths per 1000 worldwide but I did manage to find another site stating 7.7 which when the figures over the years is properly studied actually shows a continual decrease since 2000. All this data is classed as the crude death rate, that is at midyear. So again people could argue still that this doesn't represent the year as whole.  But how did these figures become invalid because of that? This is the method used when taking data scientifically and has been used in all the years previously. So how can that argument stand? Also, how do they not include covid deaths if the figures are supposed to accurately represent total deaths per 1000 for the year? </p>

<p>Maybe I am being dumb here, and some expert will come along and refute this. But from what I can see it seems they just thought 'oh just throw some figures at them and they won't question us anymore.' Anyway, sorry for my rant but there isn't much else to occupy my time when I am not allowed to go to work or do much else.</p></p>

        <p>This is a confusing bit of statistics, but in essence, it's because getting accurate data for all deaths in the world (or in a country for that matter) is ridiculously hard to do. The solution statisticians come up with to this problem is making models and predictions of a value, then using the data they do have to update their models and predictions. </p>
<p>This, under normal circumstances, works very well: population trends are normally pretty smooth and consistent, so we tend to be pretty close. However, when large events like COVID happen, the models become inaccurate, since they were built on previous years' trends and those years didn't have anything remotely like COVID.</p>
<p>Many people, however, want 2020 population statistics. The best we can do until we have working models that account for the oddness of this last year, therefore, is to work off of the old models and tell the reader that we're not including COVID numbers.</p>
<p>I hope this helps clear some things up. It's a really interesting and confusing field. At least personally I feel it might have been better to publish no statistics on 2020 population trends rather than what wound up published, but hey, I don't get to speak for all statisticians.</p>
