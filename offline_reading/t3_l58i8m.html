    <strong>Take Your Degree, And Shove It up Your Ass. It won't mean Nothing, In the Near Future.</strong>
    <p><p>Yeah you heard me. We are not going back to normal you Fuckers. This is the great Fucking  Reset. Masks will be made fucking mandatory, and same with this bs Vaccine.</p>
<p>Most middle class businesses have already been destroyed while, your getting petting monthly checks to "stay home" which you think the government is doing a favour to you. </p>
<p>No you low IQ idiot, inflation, and cost of living will rise so much that your petty check won't mean nothing. This is the great fucking reset.</p>
<p>Listen the fuck up. The people that think all this nonsense that is made mandatory, and keep giving the gov the applause that they are doing something "great" to help us, go fuck yourselves.</p>
<p>They want you to bow down to them, and be their slave. You guys are getting fucked in the ass and yet you don't see it. You guys worship that son of a b fauchi fuck doll and bow down to suck his cock. </p>
<p>They fucked up the economy so much,  we are not going back to normal. We are all fucked. And these Biden worshippers, are blind to even see it. Take that degree and go fuck yourselves with it. It won't mean shi in the near future.</p>
<p>All the guys I've talked to that did MBA, and what not, they legit told me it's over man. And it truly is.</p></p>
