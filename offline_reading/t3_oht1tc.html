    <strong>We have to be able to do something...</strong>
    <p><p>Reading all of these posts here, all of these horrible stories and doctors coming up with nightmare scenarios (people dying in a few years, etc.) really leaves me frustrated and scared for the future. I was on vacation with my best friend a few days ago and we smoked from the same joint and now I am paranoid since he is already fully vaccinated. This whole entire Covid Scenario and the Vaccine Propaganda + the silencing of doctors raising concerns really feels like a f*cking nightmare.</p>
<p>I have never been a big conspiracy theorist, but it is so obvious at this point that something very fishy is going on in the world right now. I feel like I can't trust anyone with my honest opinion, and the abuse dynamic between the state, MSM, big tech and the people makes me incredibly angry.</p>
<p>Like seriously furious. I want to hear your thoughts: What can we do? How can we punish the corrupt in power and awaken the giant that is the people?</p></p>

        <p>Your not crazy, though the shills on this sub would try to make you think so. Don't buy into any of their BS. Use your critical thinking skills. If the stuff they are injecting into people would spread all on its own through contact they would have only needed to inject like 10% of the population. </p>
<p>I've been around people who have taken it, I feel fine. I refuse to take anything in the entire "vaccine" family. But to each their own</p>

        <p>I'm not sure, to be honest. I've posted the same and everyone is silent. Try to find local grassroots organizations that stand up for freedom, whether its vaccines or not...those are probably the people to start with? As for being around the vax, no idea really if they've been recently or not usually so I just assume all are shedding spike proteins. It may turn out they aren't, but my remedies are harmless and actually good for me (drink pine needle and dandelion tea almost daily) If anything, drinking the tea just makes me feel I'm doing something. I've also started to live my life as if I've been given a terminal illness diagnosis. I know some may say thats messed up, but even if we do somehow suddenly fight back many will likely still die, things will get worse before better...and when you think of all the freedoms that have been taken lately...whether you have given in or not it was still attempted, we've been gaslit for over a year...well getting some trauma and grief help is important while we have time to do so. Good luck, and hopefully find some comfort in its truly never hopeless if you are still alive, right? Nobody truly knows the future, or what will happen-good or bad.</p>

        <p>In Canada, I would immediately cut off their covid19 related benefits.</p>
<p>Make them worried for once in 18 months. Maybe they'll start to look around at their destroyed economy, and the damage that ensued while they were apathetic and complacent.</p>
<p>Make them look around and see if there is enough of a true threat to warrant continued lockdowns and fear.</p>
<p>Until then, why bother? They can afford to ignore everything.</p>
