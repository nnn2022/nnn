        <p>Yea, that's what gets me about those people. The average vaccine goes through at least 5-6 years of testing before being mass distributed among the public. This vaccine was rushed out in less than a year, but if you try to point this out you are labeled an "anti-vaxxer" and "covid denier" by the morons already lining up.  </p>
<p>I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I'm also not taking a vaccine that went through less than a year of testing and development. There is no telling what kind of side effects and long term issues it's gonna cause.</p>

<p>Honestly? I couldn't care less what other people think of me. Never have, never will. The thing that makes me nervous, is these people talking about not allowing people to go back to work, or go to the store or whatever unless they prove they get this vaccine. I would like to think that would never happen in this country, but after the last year or so I'm not so sure.</p>

        <p>I don't know what the numbers are worldwide, but the antivaxxers here in the Netherlands were very rare. A few places in the whole country, maybe 2-3% of the population. But for this vaccine, over half of the people don't want it.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs actually 10-15 years. They spent between 1233% and 1900% less time on this vaccine than normal.  <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation">Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years and involving a combination of public and private involvement.</a></p>
<p>The COVID vaccine is shipped in 9 months. That means it is going through that entire 10-15 year process 1233% to 1900% faster than a normal vaccine. It normally takes <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">4-7 years of discovery</a> research and pre-clinical trials on animals before phase 1 of human testing even begins. The three phases of human trials takes <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">6-9 years</a> to complete. Finally, there is regulatory review of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">2-4 years</a> prior to approval. </p>
<p>These regulations are in place for a reason. Obviously part of that timeframe is obligatory bureaucratic government red tape which could certainly be removed in an emergency, but going from 10-15 years to 9 months is fairly extreme. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for a person to be concerned that many steps were skipped that would normally identify dangerous or deadly side effects in the normal 10-15 year process.</p>

        <p>Wow, so apparently I was way off. Good to know the lengths they <em>usually</em> go to make sure a vaccine is safe. And I agree, cutting some red tape could be a good thing, but just getting rid of it all and going from 10-15 years down to less than one is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>They only do testing at the very end anyways. The side effects are monitored after it has been cleared. Would be pretty darn useless to make one and only 6 years later use it. That's the way it has always been.</p>

<p>&rt;    Would be pretty darn useless to make one and only 6 years later use it. That's the way it has always been.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs exactly what happens. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">Only 1 in 100 vaccines</a> make it to approval and release. It‚Äôs called an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù and it has considerable financial risk as well as considerable financial reward. </p>
<p>&rt;    They only do testing at the very end anyways.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/history/index.html">You are wrong.</a></p>
<p>Phase 1 trials are small, involving only 20 to 100 volunteers, and last only a few months. The purpose of phase one trials is to evaluate basic safety and identify very common reactions.</p>
<p>Phase 2 trials are larger and involve several hundred participants. These studies last anywhere from several months to two years and collect additional information on safety and efficacy. Data gained from phase two trials can be used to determine the composition of the vaccine, how many doses are necessary, and a profile of common reactions.</p>
<p>Phase 3 trials are the next step, unless the vaccine is ineffective or causes health problems, and are expanded to involve several hundred to several thousand volunteers. Typically, these trials last several years. Because the vaccinated group can be compared to those who have not received the vaccine, researchers are able to identify true reactions.</p>
<p>&rt;     You don't believe vaccines work</p>
<p>Citation needed where I said that. </p>
<p>Vaccines absolutely work. I have every normal vaccine you get growing up. If I had kids, they would as well. I even got the swine flu vaccine a few years ago as a first responder as I had an increased risk of transmission. This vaccine is objectively rushed.</p>
<p>&rt;    you don't believe masks work</p>
<p>Citation needed where I said that.</p>
<p>I said mask usage and mask mandates have objectively NOT lowered deaths anywhere in the world in any statistically significant way in the last 9 months. </p>
<p>For the third time, please supply me with some non/island/isolated nations where mask mandates or lockdowns had an effect of lowering deaths.</p>
<p>&rt;    you don't believe social distancing work.</p>
<p>Citation needed where I said that. Staying away from other obviously lowers the risk of viral transmission.</p>
<p>&rt;    This subreddit is a disgrace and shows that there's still a long wqy to go to work on education in the western world.</p>
<p>Ironic considering your lack of knowledge, lack of sources, spelling errors, and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>Look - you obviously checked my post history after I proved you wrong in another sub and came here thinking everyone was an anti-vaccing idiot. Literally everything you said was an ignorant statement and/or a personal attack.</p>
<p>Turn off CNN, get off of Reddit / any other echo chamber you‚Äôre in and do some research. It is important to challenge your beliefs otherwise you don‚Äôt know if they are true.</p>

        <p>THE URGENCY OF COVID-19 REQUIRES INNOVATION </p>
<p>One approach to speed up testing of vaccines is through ‚Äúadaptive trials‚Äù. These are trials that are constantly tweaked as they go. Usually in a vaccine trial, researchers will write a plan and stick to it through the entire course of the trial partly because of the expense involved in making changes. However, by making changes in response to new findings, things move much faster. Changes might involve expanding the trial to include new components looking at the safety and efficacy of additional vaccines, or to include new study sites and more study participants so that differences between the vaccine and control groups become apparent more quickly. These changes aren‚Äôt guesswork - they are based on clearly defined rules that have been set up by scientists who are experts at evaluating uncertainty. ¬† </p>
<p>COMPRESSING THE TESTING PHASES CAN SPEED UP TESTING </p>
<p>Another approach is to¬†reduce the time between the start of different phases of the vaccine clinical trial process as much as possible. For example, starting a phase 3 trial while a phase 2 trial is still ongoing and before it has yielded preliminary results. Any safety concerns raised in the phase 2 trial would still result in stopping the phase 3 trial, too. But as this approach can increase the potential risks to some volunteers, such as safety indications not being seen until later in the phase 2 trial, volunteers¬†would need to fully understand and consent to those risks. The benefit, though, is the time saved by not waiting for phase 2 to be complete before phase 3 begins.</p>
<p>MATCHING CLINICAL TRIALS TO WHERE DISEASE OCCURS </p>
<p>To show that a vaccine is efficacious, participants in phase 3 trials need to be exposed to the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. If the people who received the vaccine develop less of the disease than those who received the control, it indicates that the¬†vaccine protects against the disease. If the disease is common in an area, then any protection provided by the vaccine should become apparent quickly. However, if the disease is rare in the area where the clinical trial is taking place, it can take a long time for protection from the vaccine to become apparent.¬†One solution is to have the clinical trial in an area where the disease is common¬†even through the vaccine was developed elsewhere. This has been done in the past with many vaccines,¬†including Ebola vaccines, although great care is needed to make sure that everyone involved with the clinical trials benefits from them. </p>
<p>Another solution involves¬†challenge trials, in which the virus is purposefully given to people who are taking part in a clinical trial, people who have received the test vaccine or the control. These trials have already happened for¬†diseases like typhoid fever¬†where the risk from the immune response is relatively well understood and where serious infection can be treated well, if monitored closely. COVID-19, however, can cause very severe disease that can result in someone‚Äôs death even with treatment. While challenge trials would avoid the wait for natural infection exposure to see if the vaccine works, many research teams consider this approach¬†ethically problematic.</p>

<p>Also, I can write faultless in my mother tongue. English isn't my first or second language, it's my third. I will admit that I sometimes have difficulties wording my statements and arguments. It's harder for a non-native speaker to go in on a person who is <em>presumably</em> be a native speaker since birth.</p>
<p>Also, you just assumed that I watch CNN. I don't. I could also just assume you watch Fox News which is arguably even less factual than CNN because you're a conservative. </p>
<p>I choose primarily not to take part in these kind of echochambers like r/conservative, r/donald_trump, r/Politics or just too many political subs in general. I despise those echochambers, but you seem to be quite active in them.</p>
<p>Only thing I'm telling you is; We had vaccines back in the 1700's, technology has come a way since then. This is unprecedented, but there's a first for everything. Like I said, it's a very high priority thing. I 100% believe in the science behind it.</p>

        <p>Even if you believe in corona. </p>
<p>Considering how things have been going, we are guaranteed gonna fumble the vaccine. </p>

        <p>Okay I'm not here to disagree with you, but do you have any kind of credible research you've read that ACTUALLY points towards this nano tech being used in vaccines? Or is it just hypothetical? I would love to believe you but I'm afraid I need some form of proof, otherwise I could make the same hypothetical claim that I'm Jesus...
