    <strong>What are we actually going to do if things get worse before they get better?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a slight feeling that even if things do get better, we will be in for the fight of our lives before they do; concerning masks, potentially mandatory vaccination, and passports. What exactly are our plans going to be if/when we have to go through persecution? I don't feel like we're gonna escape being persecuted for what side of the fence we're on honestly, but I'm hopeful if we fight it hard enough it won't be a lifelong situation for us. I'm definitely staying out of the city and will probably learn how to manage and live off the land. Trusted and secure connections will be a must since it'll be wise to have people willing to help you if it gets SUPER UGLY, which I am praying it won't. I'm sure there's more, but it seems like that's my biggest two things as of right now. I'm wondering if anyone else has any plans for if it hits the fan.</p></p>

        <p>It's not gonna be an easy one to win, but I believe we can overcome if we truly get involved and stand up to them. It only takes one person to start a change for billions. Time only proves that time and time again so I'm gonna try and stay hopeful about this.</p>

        <p>The CVD circus was a success, of this I have no illusions. It proved to them control over millions is easy, effective and nearly absolute. 
Next up is a razing of the economy, like you've never expected before. Grain, lumber, petroleum supplies are all being manipulated currently. Expect shortages, hyperinflation and the ensuing chaos. They are safe from the coming maelstrom; we are not. Prepare accordingly.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I feel like I'm wasting my time sometimes with worrying about a career if the second great depression is on the horizon. I don't even know where to start with saving money and preparing for the fall of the economy.</p>

        <p>I’ve been consistently against masks, so far it’s only been an issue from people that aren’t exactly “pillars of society” namely low wage virtue signalers (maybe 1% of people, usually in terrible shape). 
But those people already weren’t fans of me pre-Covid so why would I start to care about their opinions now? They likely lead unfulfilled lives, which is why virtue signaling gives them such a thrill</p>

        <p>I think learning to live off the land is a very promising idea. How can one possibly accept to live in a world where the government makes suggestions and even laws about what you can and can't do?</p>
<p>I would much rather be free.  Let the sheep all be comfortable in their masks.  I'll be out in the wilderness with the rest of the hard, strong men who desire true freedom.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It'd be nice to have a group around you who actually see what's going on. And besides, learning to sustain yourself from the land around you would be a good thing to learn anyway even if I don't have to live in the woods at some point.</p>

        <p>I know it sounds dramatic but I really don’t know what else to do... I will fight to the death to reject the vaccine. I’m not in a position to buy my own piece of land. I will eat pine cones and drink salt water til I die. I couldn’t bear knowing that concoction is inside me. My fear is that I’ll get arrested and literally have the vaxx forced into me while I’m denied any suicidal recourse.</p>

        <p>I'm not in a position to buy land either, but I would still leave. I'd try a small town first, but if it got to the point where they're kicking down doors to force vaccines, I'm just gonna live in the woods lol. Buying land would make you traceable I'm guessing and I would want to make it as hard as humanly possible to find me if it ever gets that bad. I think kicking the bucket is a bit extreme. I don't want to be forced to be vaccinated like that, but I can do a lot more to aid others and myself if I'm alive than I can if I took myself out; at least that's my reasoning for not going off the rails in that situation.</p>

        <p>That’s actually a much better way of looking at it. Even if I’m doomed, my life needn’t lose meaning, I can still try to save others. Thank you for the change in mindset</p>
<p>But yes definitely still going off the grid before it gets to that point. If there isn’t already an unvaccinated commune in the works we should make one lol</p>

        <p>There is strength in numbers. I admit I am struggling with this in my area, but if you can try to connect with similar minded people who are open to resisting the new normal in any way shape or form and agree to help each other out if needed and organize resistance if necessary, you have a better chance than if you were alone.</p>

        <p>In maryland they lifted mandates last Friday.  Went to a dock bar on Saturday.  Had to be 150 to 200 people from all walks of life.  Not a single freaking mask!! Grocery stores however,  it's 1 out of ten not wearing a mask but Monday it was 0 out 10. Things are looking up!</p>
