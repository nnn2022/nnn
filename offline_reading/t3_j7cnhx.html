        <p>As a childfree person I used to browse that sub occasionally but have since stayed away as it’s become a toxic echo chamber. I get many people who choose not to have children may deal with cultural tension (especially women). But some have just completely turned it into hating children in every way possible. It’s like being an atheist and focusing so much energy hating anyone who follows a religion. Like get a life.</p>

        <p>You are correct that not having kids is the default.  If you don't engage in specific actions in order to produce a child, it's not like you're going to wake up one day with a newborn that has your DNA.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, society puts tremendous pressure on people to have children, and that pressure has lead many people to believe that having children is the default, when it's far from it.</p>

        <p>But Susy might give it to Billy and Billy might give it to Jill and Jill might give it to Fred...</p>
<p>So a kid can't go trick r treat because they MIGHT get a virus that they MIGHT give to a family member that MIGHT be in the very small group of people that actually have a serious case? Is this really the world you want to live in? Where kids can't engage a fun tradition over a century old because somebody twice removed from them could get sick? </p>
<p>Plus, kids have ALWAYS been little germ carriers. Any time I get a cold, I (half) jokingly start bitching at the parents in my office saying I know it was one of them bringing it to the office after their little shits brought it home form school.</p>

        <p>Its not gonna last long if you people actually listened to what medical professionals are telling you to do. The only reason its stoll a thing is because of idiots refusing to wear a small piece of cloth to protect themselves and others. god i hate the us.</p>

        <p>First of all, this doesn't make sense. The point of masks is to slow the spread, no? So if it is SLOWING the spread... It is SLOWING the whole process. Or are you under the assumption we can actually STOP the virus if we all just do what we're told? It would require a truck load of hubris to believe we can outright stop a virus by wearing cloth on our face. </p>
<p>You act like the US is uniquely dealing with Coronavirus... While every other nation on Earth is still dealing with coronavirus at comparable rates to the US. Remember to control for the fact the US is the 3rd most populated nation when looking at the raw case and death numbers, before assuming we are the worst ever because we have such higher numbers. </p>
<p>Additionally, if your solution requires 100% compliance from 330 million people in one of the most culturally diverse nations on the planet, you don't have a solution, you have a fantasy.</p>
<p>Also, cloth masks can actually INCREASE infection rates, even when properly constructed and worn by health experts.</p>
<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
<p>And, I know, they made their little note after coronavirus about cloth masks as a last resort however I will point out that they A) don't deny their findings that cloth masks increased infection rates and B) apply this to health workers, not the general population. How many regular people are wearing double sided cloth masks that they sterilize daily and don't mess with throughout the day?</p>
<p>Plus, we weren't even talking about masks, we are talking about whether kids should be allowed to trick or treat or not. You seem to be implying that they shouldn't over the mights and maybes.</p>
<p>You didn't even know that this virus has killed next to no one under 18 and thought they were a high risk group until someone in this sub told you otherwise, yet you still back masks and cancelling Halloween. </p>
<p>How much research have you actually done outside reading fear mongering news articles and reddit posts? Are you aware that the infection fatality rate (IFR) is only 0.2% (0.02% if you are under 50)? Or that the average age of death is over 80 and therefore over the average life expectancy? Or that, while 230,000 sounds like a scary number is actually only 0.07% of the US population which is comparable with the rest of the world? Are you aware that while new cases have been trending up for months, new deaths have been trending down? Cases peaked in July, but deaths peaked back in April, shouldn't the deaths have peaked in July or August to match? Also, just for the sake of keeping all of this in context, are you aware that, without COVID, about 2,750,000 people die each year in the US (An average of 7,500 per day)? Which means COVID hasn't even hit 10% of the usual death rate. Going back to the average age of COVID death being well over average live expectancy and most deaths occurring in nursing home and hospice patients, it is pretty fair to assume that a large percentage of COVID deaths would have died before the end of the year even without COVID, but that is, admittedly, a hunch I can't confirm until the year ends and the total US death rate is compiled.</p>

        <p>Actually several countries are reinstating and re-tightening restrictions. Many countries, such as <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/">Spain</a>, to name a few, have all seen a rise in new cases over the past month.</p>
<p>You're now in insulting tantrum territory and haven't addressed or disputed a single point made and the only points you have made have been factually incorrect. Are you perhaps approaching this from emotion rather than logic?</p>
<p>Kids aren't a high risk group and are barely affected, this would not all be over now if only we'd have worn masks, other countries besides the US are seeing a rise in cases and are locking back down to varying degrees and the US is far from the worst in cases and deaths per capita. You are 0 for 4 and still haven't made a compelling case for cancelling trick or treating.</p>

<p>Heres a story for your smooth brain to enjoy. When seatbelts were first invented people didn't use them because they said it "infriged upon our rights" some of them would just cut the seatbelts out of their car entirely, so they said they would fine people not using them so they would use their seatbelt and not fucking die. Now can you guess what's happening currently? Dumbasses like you literally repeating history and getting you and other people killed because you won't put on a mask that you <em>can</em> breathe in while in a store buying groceries.</p>
<p>Also im calling you a dumbass because you <strong><em>are</em></strong> a dumbass.</p>

        <p>Idk what the definition of “doomer” is here but I do believe Covid is a problem (so maybe that definition includes me idk) but I also believe life has to go on and life isn’t gonna just stop. I’m tired of being confused about what’s okay to do. I needed to get out for my mental health. After being cooped up for so long I was impatient and short tempered with my small children and husband. That wasn’t okay. Once I allowed myself to  open my world a bit more I am suddenly more mentally healthy. I just wish all of this wasn’t stupid politicialized ON BOTH SIDES.</p>

<p>Indeed. I mean, at most, we’re looking at a flu-like bug here.  At most.  We don’t know the numbers they say are real.  I dont see people turning green and falling out, so my inner voice calls bullshit.  My intuition knows when to nope-the-fuck-out, and now is not one of those times.  If everybody lived their life... and according to the fairytale; we catch this flu, then we catch this flu and recover like 99.x% of others... thats if the fairytale is real... I encourage you to watch <a href="https://ise.media/video/plandemic-ii-indoctornation-23.html">Plandemic 2 documentary </a>.. you’ll see damning evidence this is a con and a half.</p>
<p>Edit:  </p>
<p>also realize you said you <strong>“believe”</strong> covid is a problem.  Thats should be pretty telling.  Its not so obvious that you “know” and one would have to be blind not to “see” its a problem... but you have to “believe” it... pretty crazy that its literally all stories being told by the media when you really think about it</p>

        <p>I mean, masks are a very small price to pay for going out...</p>
<p>The idiots on this sub just think they're special and don't want to wear masks cause they're selfish pricks that don't seem to understand that there are people who are essential workers, but also have difficult illnesses, which make them vulnerable. </p>
<p>This means that there is a surprising amount of people who are in a high risk group (couple of my friends included, who can't work due to a limited immune system, but have to because they will starve otherwise) whose lives rely on people wearing masks. Sure, the odds of them dying are low, but after effects are brutal and few young people can go on today with months off work.</p>
<p>So please wear a mask. Even if you think you're safe, you're wearing it to protect others. It's our societal duty to protect the weak. To do otherwise is evil. Especially if all it costs is a mask for 10-20 minutes when you're in a store somewhere surrounded by other people and maybe outside around someone for more than 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>NoNewNormal is a sub for the selfish and the cruel, people that do not feel compassion, but only greed and love for themselves, whose pride is so large that they can't even bother wearing a mask. They don't care about the old or the sick, only about themselves. </p>
<p>I hope no one on this sub or their relatives or friends  catches Covid, cause it sucks. </p>
<p>Hell, each bed in the ICU occupied by a Covid patient because someone 2 social links from them didn't wear a mask is a bed where someone else could lie on, someone else in danger can be saved. A child may die because a preventable disease is taking up their space.</p>
<p>Edit: I know I'll get tons of downvotes and comments denouncing this, perhaps even a ban, but if my message gets to one of the people here, then I may have saved a life. <strong>You</strong> may have saved a life. Not that of your brother or your son, but the life of your brothers old, frail mother in law, or your son's kindergarten teacher.</p>

        <p>Masks are only good if you are in a controlled and sterile environment and you keep that mask sterile when not in use.  </p>
<p>Stay home if you are scared.  Stay home if you are sick and stay home if you are high risk.  But don’t force others to share your views.</p>

        <p>That's absolutely not true. Wearing a mask only protects others from the wearer it does not protect the wearer. It does absolutely stop shit from frlilying out of your mouth onto others to say otherwise is an out and out lie.</p>
<p>Do you have anything that proves the claim you made about a sterile environment cause there's tons of research proving what I say. </p>
<p>Also how fuckin hard is it to wear a mask? Even if it only helps a little bit it's so easy</p>

        <p>&rt;Plandemic (a portmanteau of "plan" + "pandemic") refers to a pair of conspiracy theory videos, the first posted to several social media platforms, on May 4, 2020, and the longer one posted August 18, 2020. Both, produced by conspiracist Mikki Willis, promotes falsehoods and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. They feature Judy Mikovits, a discredited former researcher.</p>

        <p>From what I've gathered, this subreddit claims the numbers are either faked, consist of old people mostly and people that would die anyways shortly or that it's not as bad as it seems. </p>
<p>Problem is, the "fake" rhetoric doesn't work, cause both Democrats and Republicans kinda, sorta agree that it is pretty high, as well as most institutions that specialize in these sort of things. And Democrats and Republicans rarely agree on anything.</p>
<p>The third part is just plain old misinformation at play. If you ask how many (round up to the nearest 10,000 or 100,000) have really died, they won't be consistent. Some say 50,000. Some say 150,000. </p>
<p>The second point is the most dangerous one though. It is utter and blatant disregard towards human lives.  It implies that the weak and the elderly don't deserve a chance when something like this happens. It implies that during hard times, we should focus on the strong and make their lives continue as they have instead of protecting the vulnerable by inconveniencing the strong. </p>
<p>I have parents that are vulnerable. Grandparents as well. And while they can minimize their exposure to the world, they can't stay locked inside forever. The longer this goes on, the more likely they become to catch it. And if I want to see them, any of them, I have to lock myself in as well to make sure I don't catch Covid. Meanwhile, if almost all of us stayed locked inside for a month at most, the disease would fizzle out. We have seen that in New Zealand, despite new waves. And life there is back to pretty normal already. </p>
<p>I don't want my family to stay locked away for a year because they might kill one of the older family members of they catch this. </p>
<p>But the cunts on this sub, they don't care. They don't care about their vulnerable family members. They think society is about individuals, not the group, that each individual is responsible for their own health and safety, that if you get sick and die, it's your fault because you weren't careful, while the rest of them run around practically bukkake-ing each other in bodily fluids. </p>
<p>These are the people that look at the super spreader event at the White House and think "good on them for not wearing masks"...</p>
<p>It is a Greek tragedy to have this sub open. Because I want to laugh at them, a lot of the shit here is pretty funny. But the downside is that some of them will infect people that will infect people that will die from complications related to this disease. And they won't even shed a tear for them. </p>
<p>The people here lack humanity.</p>

        <p>Is recognizing “dying people die” and opposing further destruction to people’s lives while sinking the economy for future generations as an exercise in allowing a self-righteous, condescending virtue-signaling circle-jerk club to hijack our future really about compassion?</p>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that those of us whose lives have been personally affected by this shitshow of an opportunity for the morally bankrupt to iron off their Superman capes and throw them over their faces, sometimes have other people’s lives in mind, as well. </p>
<p>My father died in a hospice with only my aunt who held his power of attorney being allowed to visit him for the final months of his life due to their COVID-19 policy. He was one of very many of these dying elderly people that I often hear invoked. Did anyone ask them what it was like last seeing their relatives through a window like they are a prisoner?</p>

<p>It’s certainly not “compassion” I see as a driving factor for those who want to turn our entire society into a prison camp with masked guards reporting social distancing violations. It’s not compassionate to ignore the excessive burden on the mental health of people being isolated by this, some of whom have already committed suicide due to the stress.</p>
<p>Only you can know what your motivations and intentions really are, but I would encourage you to not be so certain about what lies in the minds or hearts of others.</p>

        <p>As an Icelander, I've seen what we were able to do. We nearly got the whole thing under control and then we relaxed too early and it went to shit.</p>
<p>New Zealand has done very well for itself though. </p>
<p>And if people were willing to wear masks in the first place, from the start, your father may have seen his family before he died. He suffered alone because there are selfish pricks out there that don't want to listen to experts, they don't want to be inconvened. </p>
<p>Imagine if people had listened to the experts from the start. Yes, they made mistakes. We all do. But people that have dedicated their lives to fight diseases are the best people we have to tackle these problems. The western governments can take the economic hit. They can support their people for the time it would have taken to get this under control. </p>
<p>And then as things slowly would have reopened, we would have seen a recovery. Instead, it's a up and down pattern that trends downwards and the US is nowhere nearer to ending the pandemic. </p>
<p>&rt;Is recognizing “dying people die” and opposing further destruction to people’s lives while sinking the economy for future generations as an exercise in allowing a self-righteous, condescending virtue-signaling circle-jerk club to hijack our future really about compassion?</p>
<p>Yes, people die. But we can still help and prevent a lot of them. And regarding cost, it costs a lot of money to keep the sick, the old and the dying alive. We could definitely boost the economy by simply discarding them all if all you care about is the economy. Could probably even give millions of young people a great economic boost at life. </p>
<p>But I'd prefer if we didnt do that at the cost of the old, the sick and dying. They have suffered enough without people calling for them to die for the all encompassing beast that is the economy. </p>
<p>&rt;It might surprise you to learn that those of us whose lives have been personally affected by this shitshow of an opportunity for the morally bankrupt to iron off their Superman capes and throw them over their faces, sometimes have other people’s lives in mind, as well. </p>
<p>Then I imagine a mask wouldn't be too difficult to put on.</p>

<p>Stress because the US majority government won't even help the people. Look at the suicide rate in countries that actually have this under control and you'll see a different picture.</p>

        <p>I realize we want to blame someone for this situation and mask vs. maskless has become the uniforms of seemingly opposing teams in society, signaling an almost ideological divide in values and priorities but I think this is an over-simplification. </p>
<p>The messaging on the masks was contradictory and confusing. People in North America were originally told not to wear masks because only health care providers needed them.  Then they were told only N95 masks are effective. Then they were told having a scarf or bandana around your mouth and nose is totally fine. The science on face coverings during flu season that I’ve seen seems to indicate face coverings are not effective barriers for the transmission of viruses. Suddenly we are being told something impromptu that contradicts completely the way we have been dealing with viral infections previously with a lack of compelling evidence to back up the claims. </p>
<p>The mask wearing ritual has become a kind of superstition possessing religious-like adherents and dividing us against each other but there’s no clear lines of distinction. We have people wearing masks in their cars blaming the people who only wear them in public spaces. We have people who wear them alone outside blaming the people who only wear them indoors. We probably have a few people wearing N95 masks which are still, as far as I’m aware, the only ones proven to be fully effective blaming the people wearing flimsy cloth masks. </p>
<p>The messaging has been all over the place. I wouldn’t dispute preventing or minimizing droplets of body fluid is considerate and should be encouraged, when it’s a likely occurrence. The people I’ve seen resisting wearing the masks aren’t sneezing or coughing all over the place. In fact the only people I’ve seen sneeze in public for the past 4 months have been sneezing in their masks and probably spraying out droplets through the spaces between it and their face assuming the mask is going to catch it all anyway. </p>
<p>I wear a mask on public transportation to and from work and in stores, not because I believe it will magically protect me from this virus or because I’m concerned I will spontaneously and uncontrollably sneeze or cough on someone or some products someone will touch, but because it requires less mental energy to just do it consistently rather than investigating in which places it’s required or not by the property owners before entering. It also reduces the stress and worry of the majority of people who are under this sort of spell of fear, and are finding what is, in my opinion, solace and comfort in a largely symbolic gesture. There’s connotations to wearing or not wearing a face covering which now have everything to do with assumptions of one’s principles and values rather than anything concretely demonstrated by science. I think this is dangerously divisive and not a healthy direction to take western culture in. Like many people, I’m concerned our values are being eroded possibly irrevocably by unscientific obsessions with “purity” masquerading as “hygiene”. A culture where people are afraid to shake hands or expose their faces isn’t one I want to live within and I’m not convinced this obsession against human contact is going to just vanish even after this pandemic scare has finally ended. So, I can understand why some people are so set against cooperating with this at all because what it represents is in the eye of the beholder. This is an unprecedented time and people are going to react differently based on their own particular values and concerns.</p>
<p>I don’t condemn those who refuse to wear the masks because I recognize for them it isn’t “just a mask”. It represents a fundamental shift in the nature of our society and how we are connected to one another and they are unconvinced it’s really just some temporary, one-off sort of event that isn’t going to be normalized into something permanent. If masks save lives during COVID than shouldn’t we be wearing them during flu season every year? What about the next  “SARS”, “MERS”, “H1N1, etc. Shouldn’t we be spending a quarter or maybe half the year walking around with our faces covered and not getting within 6 feet of each other so we can save some lives? It’s not the masks, it’s the precedent it’s setting. I find it disturbing myself and I’m also conflicted about it.</p>
<p>Where I live, in British Columbia, our government was recommending using “glory holes” as a form of “safe sex” for coronavirus. I’m not joking. There’s a level of anti-social, neurotic insanity at play here that absolutely should be ridiculed and opposed openly before it gains any semblance of legitimacy. That line of distinction is not necessarily always as clear cut as most people find it to be with the “glory holes” advice. </p>
<p>As for those who are at high risk and in forced isolation, the people whom nearly unilaterally have been the ones who have lost their lives as a direct result of the virus, I believe they should be given a choice with how they are spending their (in most cases very limited) remaining time, and what level of risk they (or their loved ones) want to accept. It’s very sad that so many of those who have died from this virus did so in isolation and so many others who have died of other causes also suffered the conditions of isolation due to concerns they could become infected by visitors. We need to consider quality of life as well as quantity and I am sure many of those who did die without their families being present and not having been able to see them properly for several weeks or months beforehand would have chosen to take that risk of infection if it was an option for them to do so. In the case of my father, the hospice treated him very well. The staff there were very caring people, I am told, and my aunt was with him at his final moments. Thousands of people in similar circumstances likely suffered through much worse isolation than that during their dying process, which is terrible.</p>
<p>I agree this was mishandled in a variety of ways and had things been clear from the beginning, people would have been more supportive but I am not convinced there would have been a different outcome solely based on mask wearing. Perhaps with a total and complete lockdown of the type done in some Chinese cities for a short duration, there would have been better progress and compliance levels but dragging out this half-assed arbitrary and contradictory style of lockdown for several months can’t be a realistic option and I believe it’s doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>As you probably know, many people on this subreddit are looking to Sweden where the international media predicted total disaster due to it’s refusal to follow the popular approach to handling this virus and has seen it’s infection rates plummet while those elsewhere in Europe and America had continued to increase.  It certainly seems rather curious there’s been such a different outcome in a country that rejected lock downs and masks. </p>
<p>Apologies if I missed directly responding to some of your points. If so, it’s probably because I’m in agreement on a lot of what you said, but seeing as how this is approaching novel length, I better conclude. You’re probably going to be the only person who reads all of this (if I’m being optimistic), so I hope at least even if you disagree, this has helped somewhat to see the other side of things. I know there’s a lot of emotion and frustration on both sides of the issue with increasing amounts of ill-will toward each other as this continues but I think it’s important to avoid being polarized to a point where we consider one another enemies. I think we mostly all want the same thing, a return to normalcy, but have different perceptions on the type of danger we are being faced with and how best to address it, as a community.</p>

        <p>I'd say a good number of ppl agree, what we need is to convince state governors not to force the closure of businesses. Let the ones who want to take the risk attend the business, don't mandate the closure, which is the reason  many businesses are excessively suffering and end up closing. </p>
<p>And just make exceptions if the business clearly causes covid count to go up or if we see a legit spike</p>

<p>You need to grow up and understand that your decisions are selfish. If there weren’t a bunch of idiots like you whining about “freedom” cause you have to wear a piece of cloth over your face this shit coulda been much more under control.

        <p>Back in March, here in Ontario, Canada, we had shut down all "non-essential" business. Had to save lives and all that jazz. Funny how that didn't include McDonald's and Burger King though, eh? And all the other big-name brands. I don't think a single one of them had any of their stores shut down. </p>
<p>Sorry, was slightly tangential there, your comment just reminded me of the war on ma and pa shops.</p>

        <p>You underestimate the absolute smooth-brainedness of the general public.</p>
<p>True story:  I went to a Burger King drive-thru last month.  I get up to the window and hand the guy my credit card and... he leans out the window and holds out a small bucket.  Like one of the buckets you'd use at a salad bar or at a Subway prep station.  A little empty bucket for me to drop my card into.</p>
<p>So I did.  Then he leans back in the window and now the bucket is out of sight.  I can only assume he reached in, picked up my card, swiped it, and then put it back in the bucket.  Sure enough, here comes the bucket with my card in it, that I have to reach in for.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, he hands me a bag of food that they prepared there in the building, without using any kind of bucket.  Just a regular hand-off.</p>
<p>None of this made any sense.  It's all ridiculous, low-IQ security theater.  To these people, handing out Halloween candy is going to be Typhoid-Mary-Tier activity.</p>

        <p>Why? In Japan they wear a face mask normally during flu season or when someone is sick. Why is it nuts for parents to not want their kid spreading or catching something to the best of their power? You don't know if that kid is immune compromised or has some other medical issues. Those parents are doing a hell of a lot more for that kid than some random who can't even register enough common sense to think for themselves.</p>

        <p>Did I mention computer screen whatsoever? No I didn't. I talked about social distancing activities you do IN PERSON. People need to learn how to stop spreading COVID just like everyone is supposed to learn to cover their sneeze or cough into their elbow. Don't be so dense that you cant see that making no changes whatsoever is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Terrorists condition children as early 5 years old.  We are now doing the same.  Why? Because the government told us to.</p>

        <p>That's not even close to being the same situation. In a McDonald's drive thru, it's one person handing the bag to one person in the car. On Halloween, streets are crowded with people. To compare the two this way is completely disingenuous.</p>

        <p>This would be accurate if when you went to Macdonald's your neighbourhood all got into a car, picked up their orders and then swapped them all with each other on the bus. It makes no sense.</p>

        <p>&rt; But the question is how is it different than a drive-through restaurant?</p>
<p>Let's see, when you go to a drive through restaurant, you are presumably interacting with 1-2 people at most, who are all employed by a company that presumably wants to stay in business, and therefor has at least a minimum amount of safety measures in place.</p>
<p>Compare that to trick or treating, where you are putting your kids in front of what, 50-100 strangers or more, who may or may not think that covid is a hoax, and may or may not be practicing ANY sort of safety measures. Your kids may not die from the covid, but you're exposing yourself (and anyone you interact with) with each and every person that your kids interacted with.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have kids and want to just hand out candy, every time you open the door you are exposing yourself to likely many times more people than you would at a drive through restaurant.</p>
<p>So just to repeat -</p>
<p>Drive through restaurant: Exposing yourself to maybe 1-2 people</p>
<p>Trick or Treating: Exposing yourself to many orders of magnitude more people.</p>

        <p>Every individual contact with another person is a potential risk. Grabbing a fast food bag is still a risk, but unless you decide to go to 20 different McDonald's in the same night this is not the same thing. Let your kids dress up and throw a zoom party or do a candy hunt like Easter. Can we please collectively try to stop this spread until we can get a vaccine?</p>

        <p>No they do not. But Halloween is a significant magnitude greater contact between individuals and it involves interaction with young children that are generally incapable of following proper preventative measures. It's one holiday that can be modified. And frankly I don't like the idea of drive through continuing to work as a hand off anyway, why can't it be no contact placed in a case that an individual grabs the food from? We can be smarter than a virus.</p>

        <p>Nothing stopping individuals from protecting themselves. Airborne virus? Use N95 or KN95 masks. The CDC even says primary transmission mode is respiratory. Why do they say NOT to wear N95 grade masks? B/c they are for health care workers? What does that even mean? </p>

        <p>KN95 is manufactured in China whereas N95 is manufactured in the USA. Right now the KN95 is what we have available. Could it be that they want the N95 reserves for the healthcare workers? I’d rather they have our in-house masks than shipped in, no?</p>

        <p>The difference between us is that I have seen the data and research and come to the conclusion that a lot of those people who have died would sadly have passed within the year and that the general population is at a very small risk of death. Therefore, I don't see a justification to the whole past 7-8 months of basically ruining the quality of my life and that of billions of others plus tanking the entire economy that my generation will have to pay for. Not to mention all the deaths that these measures have and will cost in the future. What you call "deaths that didn't need to happen" is what I call Mortality Displacement and see it as those that would have died from another cause very soon in the future.</p>
<p>If you would like to do so, then do it on your own time, because I refuse to partake in this dystopia any longer. I don't see this as a fair trade to completely stopping my life for a year or more just to give some people in their 80s a few more months of low-quality life. I'm a young person who has a whole life ahead, but here I am being forced to spend a noticable portion my precious 20s locked inside or to cover my face. I have my limits, and I have been pushed beyond by the constant insulting, bullying, lying, gaslighting, dehumanizing efforts of those in favor of these restrictions.</p>
<p>They get no more empathy, compromises or negotiations from me as they have already strong-armed the entire world to spin at their whims for almost a whole year now.</p>

        <p>Youre civil but you're also kind of a sheep who is okay with destroying everyone's livelihood because of a virus that is MAYBE slightly worse than the flu. Also, stop citing 210,000 deaths as if people care. We all know that a lot of those deaths were people who were already close to death as is, these weren't super healthy people dropping from some crazy virus. </p>
<p>Also, 210,000 people is 0.06% of the United States population. So if this continues for another five months, itll have killed 0.1% of the population, or 1 in 1000. Considering how unhealthy Americans are and the fact that we over-report deaths, thats almost nothing</p>

        <p>If you could line up those 210,000 people you'd see that about 180,000 of them were near death anyway.  </p>
<p>If you could go back in time and delete Covid from the timeline, you'd return to find that most of those people were still dead.</p>

        <p>&rt;60% of participants have experienced severe side effects. I wouldn't call that promising. Moderna, who is at the forefront of the vaccine solution has already permanently harmed the military with the anthrax vaccine in the early 2000's just lost a lawsuit regarding that. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them. I seriously doubt you are looking at things clearly for a proper evaluation of our situation since you haven't noticed the blatant hypocrisy by the CDC and the WHO and the people promoting the mask up and stay at home nonsense.</p>

        <p>Yes there is risk. There is risk everywhere. But to lock up a healthy population to try and stop a virus is the most ridiculous thing to ever happen in my lifetime. If you are not comfortable going out then don’t. But don’t try and stop everyone else.  Quarantine is supposed to be for those people who might be sick already. Not for people who are not sick!! And a vaccine?  I cannot understand why everyone thinks a vaccine will ‘save’ us all. So you are saying all the healthy folks have to hide indoors until a vaccine becomes available??  That could take years, if you look at how long it’s taken for other vaccines to become available. Sorry but no. Just no. You should investigate how many studies were done prior to this pandemic. The studies were about what we should do should a pandemic hit. Not one of the studies said oh, you should lockdown. All of them concluded a lockdown of any sort was not viable. But then we know what happened. Now we have basically terrified millions of people and probably destroyed countless lives in the process. But hey.  That’s ok.</p>

        <p>I am very obviously not welcome here. I understand my opinion (which follows the advice of experts in virology to the best of my knowledge) is very inflammatory to this community. I recognize you probably come here to feel more secure with your worldview, and my alternate view makes you feel attacked. For that I am sorry. I think it's important to really engage with other views, but what I have seen here is not engagement but an attempt to bury what I have to say. It makes me incredibly sad.

<p>Anyways, I’ll upvote you for being polite and not a dick about it.</p>

        <p>It's unfortunate that people can't have these discussions without resorting to name calling or complete dismissiveness. While I understand other experts may not agree, science is about peer review and a common consensus on the data. If I am not mistaken, the majority of experts world wide recommend these precautions, and those communities that have followed them have fared significantly better in terms of percentage of deaths per population. Thank you for also being civil, it is appreciated. </p>
<p>Also, it's maddening to only be able to reply every 7 or whatever minutes. It makes it impossible for me to realistically respond to people. I realize reddit doesn't want people to be able to brigade a post with replies but there's got to be a better way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I had a similar issue a couple of weeks back on r/nyc. I feel you, waiting 8 minutes is frustrating and doesn’t help anything much imo. If it were up to me, I’d remove downvotes entirely, or at least display both upvotes and downvotes. </p>
<p>I’ll grant you that most medical experts seem to approve of the current measures, at least publicly, as I know there are a few in this sub that have kept quiet. But I haven’t seen any evidence that places with restrictions do any better. If they did, I would expect South Dakota to be off the charts. Or Sweden, Belarus, etc.</p>
<p>And I’m always happy to have a civil discussion about this as long as the other person is too. I’ve seen nastiness one both sides here and while I get it, I don’t approve of that.</p>

I am not trying to be harsh, there is many other subs on reddit that traffic in victimhood and shaming. You make valid points and I respect your opinion.

<p>“We have had viruses for many, many, many years and managed to live our lives normally with said viruses”. Not true.

<p>No i dont think every person is infected with covid, but some are. That’s the problem and the fact that people, parents, are wanting to have their kids go trick or treating is so irresponsible its unbelievable. </p>
<p>And for your “lord Fauci” argument, that’s actually the opposite. Hes stated that asymptomatic transmission is the DRIVING factor of current outbreaks https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-08-03-20-intl/h_5b6d32b4c95ac8a2b02c12c98b323242</p>

        <p>Even if what you say is true, you're unlikely to get infected in a very brief encounter.  Most of what I'm reading says you'd have to be in an infected person's direct airstream for ten to fifteen minutes to catch it.  A trick or treat stop in my neighborhood is 5 minutes or less.  It's not <em>impossible</em> but unless an infected person starts telling a ghost story I don't think the odds are above 10%.</p>

<p>Mind you she's an expert.  Now, what she says I'd that in order to receive an infectious dose you have to be around the infectious person for some length of time.  I misspoke in saying it's ten minutes, it look like five to ten minutes.  And being outside is pretty safe (I wouldn't do haunted houses, but then again I wasn't into them before) as only a small fraction come from short outdoor exposure.  Keep in mind that the Rose Garden event was not only not entirely outdoors and lasted several hours without social distance at all.  That's not holloween trick or treating.  Trick or treating would be more of an incidental exposure at worst.  As I said, it's <em>possible</em>, but it's just as possible that some kid dressed as a gremlin will put a flaming bag of poop on your front porch.</p>

        <p>Masks are only good if you are in a controlled and sterile environment and that you keep the masks sterile when not in use.  </p>
<p>Humans are social creatures and NO ONE has the right to tell people they are not allowed to see each other.  Just because some grumpy old pedo men at the CDC/WHO live crappy lives doesn’t mean they should force their views on us </p>
<p>And if a parent wants their kid to actually be a kid and not a mindless robot they should be allowed to go trick or treating.  You don’t want to mess with a child’s development stage.  That brings up major problems once they become an adult.</p>

        <p>Are you sure that every McDonalds is following protocols to a "T"? I see employees of multiple businesses all over the place not following the mandates properly. People wearing mask on their chins, under their nose, wearing the same mask for days the list goes on and on. So you're fooling yourself if you think corporations won't skirt protocols to make a profit. With them it's all about selling an image, unfortunately that is all you get .</p>

        <p>What cleaning? I don't know where you live, but here fast food chains still don't have indoor dining open. It's not because they give a shit about public safety, it's literally because they don't want to pay for extra staff to clean. Do you really think then that the grill staff are back there disinfecting?</p>
