    <strong>I don’t understand Vaccinated people.</strong>
    <p><p>After scrolling on Reddit, coming across just anything COVID related, and searching by controversial, the amount of hate and negativity that vaccinated people give to other vaccinated and unvaccinated people is absolute insanity.  They’re just being hateful to he hateful?? I don’t understand it, it feels these are the same people who say to spread peace, love, and positivity everywhere you go, but they turn around and say some shit like “ go ducking die” or “ I hope you catch covid and are on the verge of death, but you survive. But you become paralyzed because fuck you.” I’m starting to think these people have really issues man. It’s just a sad sight.</p></p>

        <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I think these are a very vocal, but small group of vaccinated people. Example: I'm fully vaccinated (Pfizer) and my wife has chosen not to be. In my family we believe in freedom of choice. I see absolutely nothing wrong with people who choose to either wait, or delay indefinitely taking a vaccine that uses new technology and was released in record time. Thus, I will never put an ounce of pressure on her to take the shot. Other than my wife, my entire extended family (we don't have kids) is vaccinated. They wouldn't dream of saying something to anyone who chooses not to take the shot. My friends consist of vaccinated and non-vaccinated people. We all sit around the dinner table together and the subject rarely comes up.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope I'm right about this. The way every aspect of Covid has been handled as been abhorrent.  Like everything else, it's being used to divide and conquer society.</p>
<p>P.S. Before I took the vaccine, I had an employee ask me, "Have you been vaccinated yet?" When I told him "no" he exclaimed, "WHY NOT!" I said, "Because I haven't CHOSEN to yet! I CHOOSE WHAT'S BEST FOR ME, NOT YOU!" The conversation stopped instantly...</p>

        <p>Yeah for sure, but there are also the same amount of people on this thread who are calling anyone vaccinated a “lib tard sheep” or whatever garbage the kids are saying these days. </p>
<p>On each side there are rational people who respect each others rights.</p>

        <p>What the actual hell is wrong with people? Some superiority complex? There are some that think just because they are vaccinated they’re a higher class citizen. It’s getting real dystopian</p>

        <p>I guess they are scared and ignorant. Probably a lot of sunk cost into a certain narrative too... Hard to back out from now. They'd never admit that they've been wrong or mistaken so they keep pushing and drag others into their flawed narrative as they are scared to be alone in that weird collective bubble of fear they reside in.
These are mostly herd mentality driven humans of mediocre intellect we're talking about. They tend to outsource their thinking to authority figures but fail to think rationally and independently.</p>
