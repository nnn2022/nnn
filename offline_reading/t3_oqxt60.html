    <strong>They are crazy - Don't ever let them tell you different</strong>
    <p><p>Watching people celebrate the arrest, assault and prosecution of anti lock down protestors - When these very same people doing said cheering - less than a year ago - Were taking part in and or encouraging other protests and advocating for not naming or showing the faces of participants - All while when infections and deaths were easily 10x what they are today. </p>
<p>They're all fucking crazy.</p></p>

        <p>Tell me about it. The outwardly aggressive reactions I’ve seen posted have really pushed me over my limit today. </p>
<p>I find it so hard to believe that these sanctimonious pricks are convinced the tens of thousands now turning up to the central protests are just a bunch of “extremist covidiots”. Do they really have no clue why there are so many ordinary people taking to the streets? Are they really not aware of how devastated people’s lives have become thanks to isolation? </p>
<p>Mainstream approved causes are the only ones that the average person is brave enough to associate themselves with, when all they are are inclusivity prizes the same as voting. </p>
<p>The same people who say eat the rich are now kissing their asses. </p>
<p>The fact of it is this is the calm before the storm and people are bored. The portrayed enemy who are apparently “prolonging covid” have been settled in the minds of the public. They’re vengeful and misguided.</p>
<p>I’m anticipating all the ACAB folks to suddenly change their tune and say “but look at this poor cop being assaulted, doesn’t matter if they incited the attack in the first place, anti-lockdowners are evil and must be stopped uwu” </p>
<p>It’s a fucking joke all of it.</p>
