    <strong>Two Laws To Keep Pinned In Your Text Clipboard To Share With And Educate Others</strong>
    <p><p>42 U.S. Code § 300aa–22, "Standards of responsibility" 
 &amp;,
42 U.S. Code § 247d–6d, "Targeted liability protections for pandemic and epidemic products and security countermeasures."</p>
<hr>
<p>Keep those they are important and everyone stops to take a person seriously when they see they dropped some law knowledge.</p>
<p>Those are two of the major laws protecting vaccine manufacturers from ever getting sued (I believe there is one more law about it though).</p>
<p>Effectively, no matter what happens to us, no matter what damages occur, no matter what reactions we have, and no matter how many people die - we cannot sue the vaccine manufacturers or the administrators of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Start with that ↑ in your arguments with the pro-mass-suiciders. Even if you're not in America, those laws still say a lot about the vaccines and I'm sure every country has been manipulated into having laws exactly like that too.</p></p>
