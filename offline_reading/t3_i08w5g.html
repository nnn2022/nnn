    <strong>Poll finds public massively overestimates Covid deaths</strong>
    <p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.kekstcnc.com/media/2793/kekstcnc_research_covid-19_opinion_tracker_wave-4.pdf">poll by Kekst CNC</a> has found that the public massively overestimate how many people have died from Covid. The UK people polled thought that 7% of the population have died from it, and the US people thought 9% of the population has died, i.e. about 30m.</p>
<p>Well done media and Governments. You really have done a good job of terrifying everyone to death.</p></p>

        <p>Do they not think they'd notice if 1 in every 10 people were dead in the entire US? Lol.</p>
<p>They probably wouldn't notice, doomers have the awareness of their surroundings akin to that of Helen Keller's.</p>

        <p>I don't know which is scarier. They're so stupid they actually think 9% of Americans have died from this. Or they're so stupid they don't understand how percentages work.</p>

        <p>I see a lot that are just smart enough to divide deaths by reported cases and arrive at a 9% number. And then claim that if you get Covid those are your chances of dying. But any additional thinking beyond that point is witchcraft and you should listen to "The Experts".</p>

        <p>I am so angry that I have to not read this sub most of the time.</p>
<p>If there are non-Orwellian historians in the future, I wonder what they will think of society own-goaling itself into some new twisted, absurd form. People are far, far stupider than I thought, and I already thought they were stupid.</p>
<p>I am a lonely person. I have suffered anxiety disorder and depression for decades. But I tell you, I have never felt lonelier than watching a bunch of half-wits and bad-faith actors succumb to, or produce, fearmongering. It is proof of the feeling I had as a child that I was not like other people. They are lacking some kind of cognitive ability that in myself I call "thinking critically about things around me". And it really does make you a different sub-species of person if you will. This is not humble-bragging see first sentence. Honestly, thinking for yourself in this world always comes with a social cost, if you hold yourself to what you conclude.</p>
<p>Yeah, if seven percent of populations were dead, we might have justification for the policies that are occurring right now. As it is my local government has destroyed the short non-winter season, and much else, to prevent what, a couple of hundred deaths of medicalized 90 year olds? (While the healthcare system's shutdown causes just as many somewhere else.) This is not rational. If my 83 yo grandpa were still alive, I know he'd be saying "what the fuck is wrong with you idiots" (verbatim) because elders really do have perspective that we lack. He knew he had to die. He would not have said "yeah go ahead and shut down society to protect me, an old man who is at death's door now." He would have said the opposite. </p>
<p>Realism is so hard to find now in people, in their ethics. Death is always with us. Stop worrying about the Flu++ and live your life.</p>
<p>True or false: in British Columbia, the same number of people died of drug overdoses in <em>June</em> as those who are said to have died there of Covid, <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p>The answer is true. What the FUCK???</p>

        <p>Your response really resonates with me. I am afraid we tend to live in a bit of a bubble and forget what the majority of the population are really like. Literacy and numeracy are luxuries most people don't have. For example, in a worldwide literacy study, most Americans could not locate a single piece of information in a piece of familiar copy or identify which candidate earned the fewest votes from a simple table identifying three candidates and the number of votes they received. The UK fares no better.</p>
<p>So there is that segment of the population that just don't have the skills to understand even moderately complex issues. Then there is another, more educated segment who simply lack any critical thinking skills. I have seen this with Brexit, climate change, physics and economics. They are content to adopt the mainstream view: whatever the Guardian or the New York Times tells them. They simply don't entertain any possibility that there might be another valid argument, or that the problem may be more nuanced than the MSM is projecting. That's not to say that the contrarian view is always right, of course, but to blindly follow the majority view is as flawed as being ignorant of the issues. I had a conversation recently with someone in a relatively senior position in one of the 'big four' consultancies who openly scoffed at the idea that we might have reached, or be approaching, herd immunity.</p>
<p>I hate what this pandemic has done to me; it has turned me into a misanthrope. I keep finding myself in angry rants and I have to pull myself back with some effort. I am having dreams in which I am violent or angry and am feeling depressed and unmotivated to do anything. Prior to this situation, I had a generally positive view of people, but that has all but vanished. I had suicidal thoughts for the first time yesterday. I am not going to top myself any time soon, but the fact that I had such a thought at all was a wake-up call for me. I truly dread to think of the impact of this collective stupidity on the world's mental health. </p>
<p>I am not sure if coming on these subs helps or hinders. It is nice to know there are some sane people left in the world, but at the same time it keeps it all front-of-mind. I wish you all well anyway.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reply. I am glad something resonated; to be honest I was just going to delete my comment because I felt awkward about the "I'm smart" part.</p>
<p>Um, I have this tendency to write or potentially write long comments on reddit. I know why I do it, but it doesn't really satisfy the need that I have. So I'm not going to post the three-paragraph reply that I spent probably 90 minutes on... lol. I have to stop myself (re: your 3rd last sentence). But... thanks!</p>

        <p>&rt;For example, in a worldwide literacy study, most Americans could not locate a single piece of information in a piece of familiar copy or identify which candidate earned the fewest votes from a simple table identifying three candidates and the number of votes they received. The UK fares no better.</p>
<p>Could you point me to that?  I would love to have it as a reference.</p>
<p>Your misanthrope comment is straight on.  My wife has been asking why I am seeming so angry.   I have to get a handle on it. I have always known that people are idiots, and that the IQ of a group or mob is one half the IQ of the average.  But it has never been so visibly, painfully obvious. </p>

        <p>Exactly. I’ve suffered from anxiety as well and some bad spells of depression. When I was my worst in college, I worried life would always just be miserable because I just felt awful and didn’t know how to change it. Still there was hope that something <em>could</em> change in my life.</p>
<p>Now I feel like my life has ended before it ever began. Apparently the government can revoke personal liberties on a dime and put us all under house arrest for months on end and destroy everything that makes life worth living. Worse than that, I’m stuck in a society with dumbasses who are either indifferent or beg for more tyranny for “safety.” Now we have people forcibly put on the dole with very few options of making a living because the economy was needlessly decimated. So what will we be left with? Even more people begging for the government to take care of them.</p>
<p>Every simple pleasure is gone in life and I seriously can’t see it getting better. I don’t want to be pessimistic, and I still have the teensiest, tiniest bit of hope that maybe things will be normal again someday... but I’m continually let down and everything keeps getting worse. There’s nowhere to even run to, as this is happening everywhere regardless of how few cases a county has.</p>
<p>This isn’t the life I want to live and frankly my resistance to the state doesn’t mean shit when apparently the vast majority of people are just useful idiots for the establishment. I’m not suicidal, so I’m just stuck here waiting to die I guess.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday I can look back on these posts and laugh at myself for seemingly being so dramatic. However, the future is extremely bleak as far as I can tell.</p>

        <p>I could've written almost every word you said. Main differences? My area seems to have a longer summer than yours, and while this sub makes me angry at times, it also gives me hope. After overhearing the shit news my mother-in-law watches, I almost have to come here. Like an antidote to a poison. Unfortunately, sometimes I take too much of that antidote, and I get sucked into spending all day on Reddit instead of actually trying to live life. If I can will myself, I'll probably log off in 10 minutes or so and go check my calabash.</p>

        <p>&rt; As cases rise again in some countries, people are becoming more focused on wanting their governments to prioritise limiting the spread of the virus even if the economy suffers.

        <p>This is quite enlightening. We tend to forget half the population has an IQ below 100. And for every “pretty bright” person you know, with say a 120 IQ, there are an equal number of people with an IQ of 80. </p>
<p>At an IQ of 80, things like operating a McDonald’s cash register, reading directions on a map, using a search engine, and filling out basic forms such as insurance or whatever are either impossible or as difficult to them as learning particle physics for an average person. </p>
<p>I guess this, together with people following a political agenda explains why it’s so easy to foment the media narrative. It’s comforting to keep that in mind as you cite the +99.7% survival rate or ask about how many tests were conducted when “cases” rise compared to previous dates, you get answers like “if the lockdown saves only one life it’s worth it” or “yeah, but still, why would media be talking about it so much if it wasn’t very bad.”</p>
<p>I don’t interact a whole lot with the low-ish IQ subset of people day-to-day, other than teachers, so it’s easy to get frustrated. </p>
<p>I have to hand it to the media. They seem to understand how dumb some people truly are, so for that, job well done—they know their customer base well.</p>

        <p>This sort of thing is actually nothing new. According to Gallup, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/259571/americans-greatly-overestimate-gay-population.aspx">as of 2019</a> the median American estimates 22% of the population are gay or lesbian. The median American woman estimates an incredible 30%. Only 8% of the population guessed (correctly) that the number was 5% or less. You can see similar results in the poll the OP cites, as well as some other polls too.</p>
<p>For whatever reason it seems that people are just really bad at guessing percentages. I suspect that the reasoning for this is that to the vast majority 20% sounds like a number that is significant but still very much in the minority (i.e. the number of gay and lesbians), and 9% sounds like a number that is small but not negligible (i.e. the number of COVID-19 deaths).</p>
<p>I've read that human senses and intuition works logarithmically rather than linearly, and percentages are a linear measure. I wonder if most people's estimates would be more accurate if they asked them on a logarithmic scale (i.e. powers of 10).</p>

        <p>Not to go all tin-foil hat, but I would suspect this effect is less an innate disability and more the result of selection bias/media.</p>
<p>In both of your examples, you don't read MSM reports of "straight married woman claims discrimination"  or "Thousands survive viral infections" . Dog bites man is not a headline.  Man bites Dog is a headline.  It gives a skewed sense of proportion if internalized as the norm.</p>

        <p>I'm sure that is a factor as well. I would also add another factor is that I'm sure if most of the respondents concentrated and thought about it for a while their estimates would be more accurate, but who wants to bother with that much work just to answer a poll? Instead of wondering "is what I see consistent with 1 out of 5 people being gay" or "1 out of 11 people having died in the last 5 months" just to answer a question from a pollster on the telephone my guess is they're much more likely to say the first number that comes to mind and move on.</p>
<p>Part of my point here is that these sort of polls make people look much dumber and misinformed than they actually are, and don't provide much insight into what people actually believe.</p>

<p>That I can well believe.   I simply ignore any headline that starts X% of American believe....    Who cares?</p>

        <p>If it really was 9% we would all know at least a couple people that have died from it. Some of us do (I don't) but the vast majority of us don't.</p>
