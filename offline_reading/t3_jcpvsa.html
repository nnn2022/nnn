        <p>Seat belts are still a choice, and one made only when driving. And should remain so - (in New Hampshire you CANNOT be ticketed for not wearing a seat belt). </p>
<p>In other states its more about the Police finding creative ways to milk drivers than about safety. </p>
<p>I wear a seat belt because there is a benefit to me. In a high speed accident, I dont want to crash through the windshield into outgoing traffic.  </p>
<p>Masks on the other hand are useless. </p>

        <p>Seatbelt laws are so that cops have more excuses to pull over black people and keep them out of their towns. Pants are so you don't get your ass beat at the grocery store for exposing your dick to a professional wrestler's five year old daughter. Masks are so that people who can't do math feel safe enough to go to TJ Maxx to buy all the surplus clothing that Chinese slaves made during the last fashion season.</p>

        <p>Seat belts are PROVEN to work and save lives. The science on masks is still iffy at best.</p>
<p>The virus (which is no worse than a cold/flu) is going to do its thing regardless. It will spread, masks or no masks.</p>

        <p>I don't breath through my junk. Seriously tho, I don't see why clothing is required by law, and other than underwear I don't think it is. It does have utilitarian value by keeping you warm, sun protection, etc which is why humans invented it to begin with.</p>

        <p>I hate it because it downplays the fact that masks really are much more aggravating than seatbelts, other clothes, and other safety gear(helmets/jackets/boots/etc) and plus it implies permanence to the need to wear them. Unlike all those other things, face masks cover the very place you breathe through, making them already way more uncomfortable in that regard. But that's not all. They look awful, your face is almost completely covered, and worst of all, unlike those other pieces of gear that you can take off when you're out of the car/boat, done with the temporary activity that requires it, etc., you'd have to wear the masks pretty much at all times in public, regardless of what activity, which really inhibits proper human interaction. People seem to casually mention the idea of having some kind of "normal" and even go back to having fun and doing the things "we love" again, yet no one admits that a LOT of what we love about the things we love (parties, gatherings, live sports, concerts, events, performing arts, etc.) have to do with the sight of people's faces and the expressions on them. These events will feel absolutely NOTHNG like they're supposed to when you can't see people smiling, let alone most of their faces. I absolutely hate how no one mentions any of this when they talk about masks just because it is more taboo. The best memories of my life really did involve the images of my fellow peer's faces. It adds so much to the dynamic and you don't even realize it until all of that is erased. So much that if that's what they tried to call "normal" I would demand putting all gatherings on hold till we can see each other for real again. Seems like a lot of people would think I'm mad insane for saying this but seeing masks is so repulsive to me that I'd much rather not even see others than just "see" them "in person" but in a face diaper. Seeing someone's full face is such an essential part of interaction, so much that we talk about seeing others "face to face" and say stuff like "I can't wait to see your face again!". Mask to mask interaction is not face to face interaction and at least to me it's not real interaction the way it's meant to be. It's an eighth-assed version of the real thing. Can't wait till all this fucking bullshit is over.</p>
