    <strong>I just learned that my ex (F-22) died shortly after getting the you-know-what.</strong>
    <p><p>Her mother contacted me at 3AM this morning, writing frantically that her daughter had passed away, that they "found her lifeless". My body is full of goosebumps just thinking about what I'm about to put into words..
Initially my ex didn't even want to get <em>the thing,</em> and we both agreed it was very risky back when we were talking. She decided to get it anyway to protect her younger sibling, and when I warned her of the risks, she simply said that she "understands, but has decided to believe this is all real". (Speaking of the alleged pandemic, the virus and the jabs being the solution)
We had a rather promising connection, but this came to be a very divisive topic and I'd often hold back from saying too much about my concerns in detail, but now I'd wish I had never shut up.</p>
<p>I just cannot process this just yet. She was out of my life, but good God I'd never want this on my worst enemy!
She was incredibly talented, full of life and good with children. I still have videos of her playing with a newborn child in her family, I can't play it and neither can I delete it.
I can not even begin to imagine the abysmal dread of experiencing such a horror as finding your own child lifeless, in her best age, with EVERYTHING going for her. She had a career in music, she was smart, and someone who will always be with me in some way. She taught me a lot.</p>
<p>I can't claim that she died "because" of the participation in this experiment, but something doesn't add up. She was very happy, healthy, vibrant and beautiful. She loved to dance, swim and ride the bike. I am admittedly writing this as my own therapy, and hopefully some of you can relate to- or find relevance in this wonderful family's (as well as my) dire situation today.
I am definitely in the process of denial right now.</p>
<p>I recall thinking to myself "My friends might actually get murdered" when the rollouts started, but I also had that other voice saying: "This is not some fucking movie." I was reluctant to think that way back then, that the world could truly be so corrupted and sinister, but now it's hard to think any other way of it.</p>
<p>I don't remember which particular brand she went with; I felt it was inappropriate to ask about her demise in further detail, as her mother had already gone out of her way to contact me, despite possible resentment, to inform me of this.
I try not to get too detailed, but this is very shocking and difficult to navigate through. Sickening.</p>
<p>To anyone out there going through something alike, feel free to reach out and share your story. It throws light upon the difficult, but important discussions, and it mends the soul. Sharing this has already helped me to significantly calm my breathing, settle my thoughts and tune my heart into balance.</p></p>

        <p>Oh man.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry for your loss. This sounds heartbreaking, and like you I would be suspecting the obvious.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is just the beginning for us all.</p>
<p>I can relate to wishing I'd of kept on arguing to a degree. I was incredibly outspoken in the beginning of this, and not so much now, some good friends tool the experiment... I feel bad for not having a proper talk with them before hands.</p>
<p>Other than that, I really have no words, your grief is palpable. I am so sorry for your heartbreak, and for her being gone, she sounds wonderful.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, it sounds like you did a lot to voice your concerns, and I appreciate that isn't always enough for the grieving self at such times.</p>
<p>Much love man.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much. It's surreal. I think the relationship would have failed sooner had I kept talking, but rather that than this ..
I am coming to terms with the fact that you can <strong>not</strong> make people believe something if they identify with other beliefs.
For the same reason, I didn't say much to her mother regarding the jabs, because they all believe in them, and seemingly made no connection. Just that they "don't know what happened". They don't need more trouble right now. I have cried and prayed for them, asking God to at least just give their spirits strength in these difficult times.</p>
<p>I was really touched by your attentive and compassionate message. Love you right back.</p>

        <p>“Always be yourself.”</p>
<p>It’s advice we often ignored as kids for fear of getting negative feedback.</p>
<p>But it’s the truth if you want to live a true life. When it comes to people and being able to successfully challenged their ‘beliefs’ as a Christian my mentality is: try. </p>
<p>Even if you think it’s hopeless, even if your ears get red with embarrassment, even if they’ll think you’re dumb: try.</p>
<p>If you lose the relationship you lose the relationship but being fearless and even trying to help those in need attracts excellence.</p>

        <p>Sometimes pushing the issues too much has the opposite effect and they shut down and refuse all information that disrupts their worldview (cognitive dissonance).  Look at how people responded to all the prizes and incentives for getting the jab, they resist the jab even more strongly.</p>

        <p>Good point. I doubt I could have said things more clearly than I did.. Told her on one of our last calls I was worried it might kill her, and it didn't fly. I sent numerous articles and interviews with medical professionals taking skeptical stands toward it, but it only made her frustrated with me.</p>

        <p>Indeed we are. Love is our resistance. Doesn't mean we can't throw a punch or kick a tyrant in the nuts. But love, understanding, family, procreation, all that stuff.. that is the best resistance to these unprecedented times of breakdown. Thanks for reaching out, much love!</p>

She tested positive for Covid and the hospitalgot extra $, since she had to go on a ventilator. The Dr even had the nerve to say "oh.. if it wasn't for the vaxxx, the Covid could have killed her."🤬  It's been 3 months since the open heart surgery and thankfully she is recovering well.</p>

        <p>I hate when they say that. I keep hearing story after story about doctors telling people "thank God you got the vaccine or it would have been worse". Like they have a super power that allows them to look into an alternate reality to see what would have happened. Most likely it's the other way around and the vax caused it.</p>

<p>See, I feel that this is the greatest mystery of what’s going on currently. So many otherwise intelligent people just lining up for a shot of snake oil that hasn’t been proven safe or effective. It bends my mind every single day.</p>

        <p>Here's my take, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>People first acquiesce to the milder things, distancing (as courtesy) masks, etc. We have been taught all our lives to follow order from authority, (which is why my kids certainly won't be left in Marxist institutions i.e. schools), and gradually they begin to identify with their beliefs; they build their entire worldviews upon the erroneous beliefs as foundation.
To tell someone who just built a whole palace that the ground beneath it is rotting, is so horrifying and unsettling that cognitive dissonance acts as a defense mechanism. And today the internet leaves us no shortage of propaganda to rationalize and spew nonsense.</p>
<p>This is why I don't like to denounce fellow humans to "sheep" or something like that.. They won't learn by you spitting in their face, but how to reach through to them is beyond me. 
As Yuri Besmenov put it: <strong>When a military boot crashes his balls then he will understand. But not before that.</strong></p>

<p>Intelligent people naturally gravitate towards academia, and of course don't want to be seen by others as <em>not</em> being intelligent.<br>
So, they say and do the things that the other "intelligent" people say and do. Because of course these are the people in academia, how could they be wrong?</p>

<p>Most "scientists" these days don't actually do any real science themselves, they read papers and follow orders. But they so desperately want to be in the smart people's club that even when shit doesn't make sense, they defend it.</p>
<p>Science today is a bastardization of what science should be. It is a dogma that cannot be questioned.</p>

I can't help but dwell on the fact that her mother and her practically were as one, that she raised her with pristine values, and now has to settle with the fact that her own offspring, has left this world this way.</p>

A few have made the connection but it’s really awkward to point it out, but on the other hand we might save a life by saying something. It’s not exactly what a grieving family wants to hear, ya know?</p>

<p>You deserve to not feel guilt in any way. This whole vaccine thing is a screwed up situation. Trying to convince people of what’s going on. contra to media and to social norms is a Herculean task and shouldn’t be a burden placed on mortal men. </p>

        <p>I really really appreciate it!</p>
<p>Regarding the messages, I second what Pieter said.
I have all the messages lying around on WhatsApp. I didn't delete anything on the off-chance that she'd come back. Half of them are in Spanish, too.
If people will seriously start demanding that I screenshot conversations with a deceased and her grieving mother to somehow constitute as evidence so they can somehow evaluate that I indeed did experience this, that's just a whole different issue and probably has nothing to do with my post anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

        <p>dont want to get too much detail but a young man i know (early 20s) literally just had a mild heart attack yesterday that is being attributed to dehydration and too much coffee added to a heavy physical workload.  Has been fully vaxxed for about a month and a half now and has never had heart issues before. I pray its just dehydration and that this is the end of it</p>

        <p>A friend of ours mother has had a heart attack out of the blue. Her heart beat was 180 and she had chest pains for seven hours. She was cleared and drove home then had a full on heart attack. She was apparently diagnosed with... bronchitis...? Which seems peculiar. She's in hospital now. She was clinically dead but I wouldnt put it past the vaccine causing this. She had no issues prior and didnt have a cold or other symptoms of bronchitis. Very weird. Also apparently 'has early stages of asthma'. If the vaccine is causing and effecting immune response you would expect to see a reaction like this from the vaccine</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that mate. Sometimes it's easy to just dismiss things with "I told you so", but for those who are really compassionate like yourself, that part that says "I wish I had done more, then things would have been different" gnaws on your mind for a long long time.</p>
<p>I mean... How does one deal with making peace with oneself at the cost of someone else's life? You didn't want to risk getting into a big fight and someone else died. That shit is heavy, and you'll be thinking of other things like "would I have traded places with her?" And things along those lines.</p>
<p>I can't give you any advise. I suppose you'll have to draw on your life experiences and learn how to cope with the loss.</p>

        <p>This fucking sucks to read and I'm terribly sorry for your loss. What pisses me off so much is that the world has gone crazy by pushing this stupid fucking vaccine.</p>
<p>I feel like we're in a bad episode of The Twilight Zone.  I still don't understand the need for a vaccine for a virus that is basically ineffectual to a better part of the population. Normal healthy people stand practically zero chance of dying, UNTIL they take the vaccine. </p>
<p>I work in a country that recently mandated that you must be vaccinated. They are literally forcing 100% of the population to get the vaccine. After August 1st, unvaccinated people won't be able to enter buildings, venues, restaurants, etc.   </p>
<p>Because I value my employment,  against my better judgement, I got vaccinated. I'm not going to lie when I say that I was seriously concerned for my safety prior to getting the vaccine and really seriously considered quitting my job and coming back to the US. In the end, that wasn't a very solvent or responsible decision because I have people that depend on me and my income. So I bit the bullet made sure I will was up to date and got the first shot.  </p>
<p>I've been through some pretty fucked up things in my life and some pretty serious events, and I can honestly say that I've never been as scared as I was on the day I got injected. As far as I can tell, luckily, I've had no side effects but when I hear stories like yours it makes me so afraid for each and every individual that gets the vaccine.</p>
<p>The pro vaccine people love to tout statistics and how the vaccine is safe.  Maybe they should explain that to the people that have serious side effects or the family members that have lost someone as a direct result from getting the stupid fucking vaccine.  </p>
<p>My deepest condolences to you and your friend's family. Hopefully her death won't be in vain and it prevents just one person who is at risk from taking the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Same here. My grandparents all took it, and although it statistically seems to be worse on middle-aged and young adults, I realize that it can be no surprise if they succumb before their time. </p>
<p>I am strengthened by your kind words, and I wish the very best for you and those near to you in these times!
It might be pseudo science to say this, but I heard that pine needle tea is possibly a good remedy to optimize resilience, whether you had the shot or not.
It's supposed to be loaded with bioavailable vitamin C. I might try to sell the idea to my family without contextualizing it to the shot.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your thoughts, I am gonna be ok, but I am just gutted about her siblings. She died for a needless cause with the best intentions, and despite our arguments I got nothing but love and respect for that beautiful soul.</p>

        <p>Young, active people don't just drop dead (assuming there aren't any suspicious circumstances).</p>
<p>Are they doing an autopsy? Only about 1 in 100,000 people aged below 35 die suddenly of natural causes. Usually it is heart related or more rarely bleeds on the brain or blood clots.</p>

        <p>I doubt any parent would skip autopsy in this case, although it sort of adds salt to the wound. I heard her mother say that they found her lifeless in her bed, no signs of anything. I am leaning toward it being a heart related issue.</p>

        <p>I'm going through a similar situation myself. This is part of the plan, after all if the elite can't inject you personally with their deadly concoction you must suffer somehow. What better way than watching loved one's perish. So freaking disgusting! I've put my all into spreading the word with all the articles and sites to back it up, a few listened but many of my so called friends dismissed me as crazy and went for the euthanasia anyway. As devastating as it's been to see the aftermath of their choices, I remind myself that this is what the evil want. If you are wise enough to avoid the shot you should feel good about yourself you passed the biggest test of your life! You provided the test answers but people didn't believe in you enough. They failed the test that's on them.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. The fact that r/NoNewNormal (which thousands of people are actively trying to get shut down) is one of the few places online that you can share your story makes it painfully clear the type of world we're living in. I lost a friend to the vaccine a few months ago, as well as two acquaintances. It seems that most people I know have a connection with someone who died after receiving a vaccine, whereas very few people personally know of someone who died from the virus itself. There's really no such thing as "conspiracy theories" with regards to all this. We all see it happening right in front of us. The difference is whether or not we choose to acknowledge reality.</p>

        <p>This is rough to read. I’m fortunate so far that all my friends and family that did get the vaccine have not had bad, adverse reactions (yet). When I’m around them, I often wonder if this will be the last time I get to spend time with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality of life is that no one gets out of this alive. Whether it's from a adverse reaction, an accident, old age, or disease. Embrace the time you have with each other. Tomorrow is not guaranteed to any of us.</p>

Glad to hear that. Even though I am admittedly very opinionated about these jabs, I actively wish only the best for those who join the experiment.</p>
<p>Very good point at the end. I try to see things levelheaded without being a nihilist.
In this particular case, I believe it's of utmost importance to stand up for oneself as we must reattain our human rights, and because these shots might reduce the population through killing off and infertilizing.
We have to stand up and fight, figuratively. What each must do as an individual is revealed to the person as they tune in with their heart in accordance to their reality.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry for your loss. That's so horrible. What an utter waste of life. :(</p>
<p>My bf is supposed to get his second dose today, but I've been trying to talk him out of it. He only got the first one because his mother booked him an appointment (which is ridiculous in itself cause he's an adult). And now she did the same for the second dose. I am so worried about him. I haven't slept properly in days. I understand the pressure he's under from his family, but like fuck what his mom thinks. His health is more important. I will never forgive his family if he gets it and something happens to him.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for letting me know about your situation! It hurts and warms my heart simultaneously.</p>
<p>This whole thing is incredibly divisive in families worldwide, and I am convinced that is partially the point. (Destroying the family even more)</p>
<p>One in my family just got both shots because of a job.... Yep, jab for a job. No kidding, I still can't believe it. It was even optional, but urged authoritatively as usual.
This person is very close to me, gave me my life, raised me. Now it's like: "well, let's see how much time X has left..!" Disturbing to say the least.</p>
<p>Now, I really wanted to say this though. The whole point of this craze is to poison, divide and frighten people. Try your best to support your bf, plant seeds if he is receptive, and try not to control nor resent his family, even if they are being stupid. They act in their ways because they believe that's what's right - and even though we both know it's ridiculous, they won't change. They won't care if you hold grudges for them ultimately, because most people are just too afraid to change their views since that consequently collapses most of their presuppositions about the world.</p>
<p>Stand up for yourself, and if that means demanding for your man to do the same, so be it.</p>

<p>OP you are a wise and loving person. I am so sad reading your story but also simultaneously encouraged that people like you (and me, and so many others) are awake and seeing through the BS. When I first started waking up it was so hard to be made fun of and criticized by people who were so clearly ignorant and mislead. It made me resentful and bitter. Now that I'm older and have had more time to observe and reflect, I have so much empathy for the people who believe the narrative. Even if I see it for what it is, they truly believe that they are participating in this experiment to protect and save lives... the irony! I also have realized very clearly that the one tool "they" are using to control us is fear. And there is only one thing that overcomes fear - love. I would even go as far as defining love as a complete lack of fear.</p>
<p>Be kind to yourself in the days ahead. I hope you are able to tell your friends story in a way that awakens people. And I hope you are able to find peace in your grief. As many others have affirmed, this was not your fault and there was nothing you could have done to change this.</p>
<p>My favorite part about reading your comments is your resounding message that as human beings, the best thing we have is each other! Not only have they used this whole "pandemic" to drive emotional division within our families, they have convinced us that we physically are the biggest threat to each other. And all of that is very clearly bullshit. Human beings are made to love, to touch, to create, all together.</p>
<p>Sending you a giant hug.</p>

        <p>Thanks for such a kind message! :) I'm happy to say that my bf ended up canceling his appointment!  I'm still worried that he'll change his mind and go through with it eventually, but at least I have more time to share more info with him about the shot, and more and more issues are starting to come up with the vaccines, so hopefully it'll be a good eye opener.</p>

        <p>I got my fingers crossed. If you do talk to him, he might be happy to know that the definition of 'vaccine' was <em>updated</em> in April 2020, that mRNA has never ever been successful in helping humans nor animals in any trials whatsoever, and that the only reason they're being rolled out without further testing (avr jab gets tested for 7yrs) is because we allegedly have a pandemic: Now, the definition of pandemic has also been changed. Had it not been changed, this would not be a pandemic, and this experiment would never be able to take place.</p>
<p>The best you can do is to ask him questions: "Did you know <strong><em>?" "What makes you think that </em></strong>?" Because the moment you start to simply tell him how things are, there's a chance you simultaneously drown his curiosity to know more, it happens a lot.</p>
<p>If he decides to get it, I'd suggest you ask him something along with: "What benefit could possibly outweigh the risk?"
Back that up with the fact that, statistically, this experiment singlehandedly has caused as many deaths and adverse effects in 1 year as every other jab combined in the last 10 years.
Also, this is not a road to freedom, it's actually the opposite. Conditional freedom as what we're seeing is a symptom of societal collapse just waiting to happen.
We have to free ourselves, and allowing patented mRNA strands to instruct ones cells while getting a digital ID a la China is NOT a good strategy.</p>
<p>I'm happy to talk to you, but it's scary how many people don't even see it.</p>

        <p>Sorry for your loss my moms cousin did the first dose 2 weeks ago and had allergic reaction her hand swelled and then she couldn't move both of them and did surgery which didn't fix it..now she cant pick anything with her hands and her blood has thickened. Doctors told her to not take the second dose and i was telling my friends and family to not take the vaccine and the were talking shit,there are many cases like this but dont get reported and the government tries so hard to make everyone get the vax they even give us from age 18-25 150€ if we take it. Also i have seen some videos about coins sticking to arms and my cousin and her boyfriend did this with the spoon and it did stick..</p>

        <p>The magnitude reaction is real. It's baffling. And equally, the ridicule and dispute is beyond disgusting. The whole point is to divide us while they poison us, if you ask me, a non expert..
Promise me that you don't EVER compromise. The war today is not bombs nor bullets.. it's ideological subversion, demoralization and undermining of the individual. Freedom can and must NOT be conditional, for thence it is not freedom at all. Don't allow anyone to make you a puppy, cause that is ultimately a worse fate than even dying.</p>

        <p>Taken to consideration. I will be very careful about it, if I do it. Doing so would also put the family in conflict, as they encouraged her to get it. With the best intentions of course.

        <p>Survivor's guilt is also a real thing.  If you feel you need therapy (Unfortunately, I don't think that these will be one-off events, especially as time goes by and the experiment continues to unfold) don't hesitate to seek it out.</p>

        <p>It’s sad and a shame but some people only learn the hard way. She said she understood the risks and still got it. That’s what I say to amuse the people urging me to get vaccinated. “But but what if covid kills you and you wished you got the vaccine!?” Is a sentence I’ve been told by a family member… I said “well, so be it. I have a less than 1% chance to die from it so I know the risk I’m taking.”</p>

        <p>I tried to caution all three of my adult children before the jab was widely available, but they each decided to get it for their own reasons.  I could only wait, with crossed fingers.  As a parent it was nerve-wracking; I can't imagine how I would have felt if one of them dropped dead.  So far no serious reactions in any of my children but my fingers are a bit sore from keeping them crossed... no one knows what the long-term effects might be.</p>

        <p>God bless you for being such a caring father. Many kids would give an arm for that. The world isn't fair, but it doesn't mean everything will go to Hell in a hand basket necessarily.
I hope you will never have to experience as mentioned above, but know that you are not alone, that you did everything as well as a caring father possibly can, and if your kids are strong, maybe they will be just fine. I don't think any medical intervention will conquer the soul of those who find their own strength. Hope I'm making sense, much love!</p>

        <p>My best friend for most of elementary school apparently died, aged 25. No warning, no illness, but within a week of the second shot she was dead. We hadn't talked much in years, we'd drifted apart over the years, but it still hit me hard. I hope it wasn't from the vaccines, because if it was, we're all going to lose a lot more of our loved ones before this is all over.</p>

        <p>My condolences. And I think the exact same. It's statistically difficult to argue that the <em>solution</em> seems more deadly than the <em>problem.</em>
I hate saying it, but I sense there are some highly motivated people with gnarly incentives who knew something like this would happen, technocrats for one.
It makes my blood boil to think that these jabs are only allowed on humans because it's a "health emergency"/pandemic, which it only is because the definition of the very word was changed in 2009.</p>

        <p>Thanks buddy. Time always heals, even when you somehow wish it wouldn't. Being a partial masochist at heart can sometimes lead to Stockholm Syndrome to the pain associated with grief.
I'm rambling, but what I am trying to say is that time is like a big, calm and collected embodiment of wisdom that embraces you when you are most bewildered/furious, ready to explode, and only when you do calm down, you can see that time was always on your side.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. This is so sad. Just know that you probably wouldn't have been able to get through to her nomatter what you said. Giving someone information doesn't seem to have an effect. People are making these decisions based on emotion, and not wanting to be rebellious or called a bad person. They are told that getting vaxxed is doing "the right thing". The pressure is too much for some to handle. </p>

<p>My ex's own doctor insisted that A: It was gonna protect her siblings, (which they don't) and B: It was safe.. Now, these doctors who say inaccurate nonsense as such probably mean well. But they are useful idiots in this realm, and that puts lives at risk.</p>

        <p>To anyone who may be worrying about their family/friends getting the shot: YOU ARE NOT AT FAULT. Just as you are not at fault for going about your normal lives and potentially being an "asymptomatic superspreader", you are not at fault for another person's medical decisions. Unless you are a parent forcing your child to get the shot, you are not responsible for another person's healthcare <em>choices</em> and so don't blame yourself.</p>
