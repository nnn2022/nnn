    <strong>A brief argument against masks.</strong>
    <p><p>A little over a year ago, on the 4th of March 2020, the UK Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) banned adverts by two companies selling facemasks as protection against the novel coronavirus.[1] In their statement, the ASA said “there was very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of clinical setting” and a spokesperson for Public Health England informed the ASA that they “had not recommend the use of face masks as a means of protection from coronavirus". The ASA went on to say “that the ad was misleading, irresponsible and likely to cause fear without justifiable reason.”[2] </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This act had precedent, as during the SARS outbreak in Australia in 2003 the NSW Fair Trading Minister warned against distributors exaggerating the health benefits of surgical masks, saying that “it is un-Australian to profiteer from people's fears and anxieties,” and referencing a Sydney University professor at the Department of Infection Diseases who warned that the masks needed to be changed every 15 or 20 minutes to be effective.[3] </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This understanding of the ineffectiveness of surgical masks as protection against respiratory-disease pandemics was widely spread in the pre COVID-19 world. The UK Government’s Influenza Pandemic Strategy, last updated in 2019, [4] states, “Although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks by the public in the community and household setting may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use in this setting. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good respiratory, hand, and home hygiene behaviour in order for them to achieve the intended benefit.”  </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In the World Health Organization’s 2019 pandemic response paper, despite conditionally recommending face-coverings they admit that “There is a moderate overall quality of evidence that face masks do not have a substantial effect on transmission of influenza.” and cite a meta-analysis study of Randomized Control Tests from 2009[5] which found that “there was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza." This was further backed up by a study published in the American CDC in May 2020[6] which analysed ten RCTs and found “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks". A further analysis in November 2020[7] compiled nine studies and found that “The pooled results of randomised trials did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks during seasonal influenza” and a 2020 Danish study[8], the largest ever mask RCT and the only one so far to focus specifically on public mask effectiveness against COVID-19, found “no significant difference” in infections rates between those wearing masks and those not. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Even back in 1920, Dr. Kellogg carried out a thorough investigation of the efficacy of Gauze Face Masks used during the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic and concluded that “Masks have not been demonstrated to have a degree of efficiency that would warrant their compulsory application for the checking of epidemics.” [9] </p>
<p>The lack of real-world studies proving the effectiveness of face-masks at reducing virus transmission has not changed in the last twelve months. On the contrary, the overwhelming number of studies and amount of evidence showing that masks have little to no effect is growing. But even outside the ivory towers and medical journals we now have plenty of real-world evidence that mask mandates are of little benefit: by simply comparing states and counties in the US where mask mandates were implemented with states and counties with no mask mandate, we find no difference in covid-19 rates: https://imgur.com/a/lFkL0yI </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Despite this, increasingly authoritarian world governments, who seem to have decided that spreading irresponsible fear and anxiety actually is justified, in cahoots with compliant citizens acting with misinformed sanctimony, continue to force this unscientific and ineffective measure upon unwilling citizens with punishments of disproportionate fines running into the thousands-of-pounds and social shaming and ostracism for those who do not comply. </p>
