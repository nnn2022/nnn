    <strong>A new normal? Self reliance and the nuclear family are considered racist while collectivism is inclusive. CRT taught to 7 year olds in Illinois..</strong>
    <p><p>Is it any wonder why the United States is middle of the pack when it comes to educating its youth?</p>
<p>Im convinced that the ramifications of CRT will further divide us as a nation. </p>
<p>Its not even an attempt to homogenize our population (which would be bad enough); its a methodology of stereotyping a particular group as perpetually "bad" rather than a true and honest exploration of societal norms of past times vs current times.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on and developing the innate talents and passions of the individual student as a road map to contentment, success and happiness what would our educational system rather endorse?</p>
<p>A shallow, vacuous ideology that projects itself to be anti- racist yet embraces discrimination in order to achieve equality.</p>
<p>Forced philosophical dogma is not a legitimate substitute for teaching mathematics, science, etc..Rather, it is a tool for lazy, unmotivated educators (not all, but enough) looking for a way to avoid culpability for their inability to connect, personal malaise, impatience with students or apathetic approach to their jobs.</p>
<p>(Pre-emptive strike: yes teachers, we understand your job is made harder by legions of disaffected or uncaring parents.  I get it.  But that argument is not germane to this topic, so let's not go there.)</p>
<p>Finally, CRT nourishes a culture of "excuse victimization" which is then weaponized at every opportunity.  Forgot your homework?  "I was sad this morning thinking about slavery".  Acting out in class? "I'm tired of learning things white people think I should know".  The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Until this country embraces fundamental and structural change in how our educational system is approached to allow true individual achievement/accomplishment, visceral programs like CRT will be created, promoted  and implemented as substitutes for actual pathways leading to long term success.</p>

        <p>"Teachers are instructed “to disrupt the Western nuclear family dynamic as the proper way to have a family” and instead to promote the “Black Village,” which is a “collective village that takes care of each other.”</p>
<p>TIL only black people have friends.</p>

        <p>But its not even collectivism in any sense- seriously. </p>
<p>Its super individualism, they dont agree on anything personally,  only agreement they have is Government is infallible, all knowing,  all loving. </p>
<p>Its just out of control narcissism underwritten by the State.</p>
<p>My grandparents from Great Britain were more collectivist than these hordes. The essence of collectivism is communal sharing- which is a longstanding Western tradition pegged by Christianity.</p>
