        <p>"But medical exemptions!" - various people on here</p>
<p>As I keep saying, they don't care about medical or religious exemptions for the masks or the vaccines. The precedent has now been set for those not to matter.</p>

        <p>as someone with a medical exemption, I can back this up and say that I don’t matter anymore. I am told to stay home or do curbside nearly everywhere. Until I found a gym far away from my house skirting these rules, I was told by every gym in a 30 min radius I could not be in the gym maskless. Restaurants deny me service, even though I’d only be wearing the mask to walk 10 ft and then sit down and take it off at my table. Even my friends, or so I thought they were, tell me I’m selfish for using the medical exemption where I can go without one, like to my grocery store. I do not matter anymore, I am told to stay home and waste away isolated, even though our state’s mandate includes a section on medical exemptions and how businesses cannot be fined or closed for letting those with them patronize maskless. God knows how much longer this will continue, am I supposed to sit inside alone, giving up my life, my youth? My mental health was already pretty bad before all this and staying home being unable to go anywhere would surely lead me to suicide. Hell even not staying home has made me consider it, I can’t take the panic attacks or feeling of the mask on my face when I’m out and try to wear it so I can live and go places. I do not matter. I didn’t ask for my trauma and it fucked me up far more than just not being able to wear a mask. Never did I think it’d destroy my entire life like this. I didn’t ask to have my life ripped away because some people are afraid or on a power trip. But here I am.  This is nearing the point of nonsensical word vomit, but it’s just so hard to put into words how it feels. Just last year it was “oh if you need any support we are here, here’s links to amazing counselors and groups and we are standing with you and your mental health is so important right now and always” and awareness groups and #metoo. Now it’s “shut up and stay home, you don’t get to endanger us with your unmasked face, screw your mental health and well-being”. It’s disgusting how people are so quick to throw people and causes out the window when something that makes them look even better comes along.</p>

        <p>Jesus I’m sorry society as a whole has disregarded you. There’s normal people out there still. I’m one of them, and I know how you feel. The depression is hard to fight off. If I saw you in person, I’d give you a big maskless hug. Hang in there, we need every single one of us who see through this BS.</p>

        <p>You never see a 6 month old wearing a mask.  Why?  Because they can't keep the mask on.  If a 6 month old could keep a mask on, doctors would advise against doing so bc of SIDS.  Bottom line, a 6 month old isn't going to keep a mask on their face.</p>
<p>Now, 6 month olds are allowed to travel anywhere, access any store, doctor's office, legit they can go anywhere without a mask.  A 6 month old's lack of development is the condition in this instance.  </p>
<p>Now, say a 6 year old disabled kid or autistic kid can't wear a mask.  The condition is their disability.  </p>
<p>The age doesn't matter.  6 months or 6 years, yet a 6 month old gets a pass and the 6 year old needs to be holed up at home for eternity?  </p>
<p>Nope.  </p>
<p>And for all the jerk offs saying not to put the disabled kid at risk by taking them out of the house - this is the definition of protecting by way of forcing your will on another.  Stop judging and worry about yourself.</p>

        <p>You’re not supposed to put them on anyone incapable of removing them on their own either, yet that seems to have fallen by the wayside too.  Can you imagine if you said last year that disabled people should “just stay home,” rather than public places being required to provide reasonable accommodations for them?   Now, it’s perfectly acceptable to say disabled people should just stay home on Reddit.  In fact, it’s the response every time one of these comes up.</p>
