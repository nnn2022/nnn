    <strong>What do you guys think when people try to compare face diapers to seat belts?</strong>
    <p><p>I've heard so many times people saying "The government makes you wear a seat belt and back when they started, people thought it was an infringement on their rights, but we laugh at those people now, and that's how it's going to be with the antimaskers in a few decades." (I also hate how the term antimasker is used as a bad thing. Being antimask is a good thing in my eyes.)</p>
<p>So obviously that's a horrible attempt to justify these dehumanizing things, but what would you say to that? There are obvious things to point out like people don't rat on people for not wearing a seatbelt, you don't need a seatbelt to enter a store, seatbelts don't restrict your breathing, etc. But for me, the main reason I am against muzzles is because I just think it's a crazy overreaction and super paranoid. When this first started with people wearing them of their own free will, I thought that was crazy, and I knew then that I was never in a million years going to be that paranoid. Then they started trying to force it, which is even crazier. </p>
<p>Anyway, what would you guys say to that when they try to compare them to seatbelts? I've heard them of course point out how "selfish" it is that people wear seatbelts to protect themselves but won't wear something when it "protects" someone else, well, by that logic, I guess hazmat suits would "protect" people, so are we now selfish for not wearing those? It would just be a MiNoR iNcOnVeNiEnCe as they like to say. I mean, really, if they're seriously crazy enough to wear a mask just because of the fact that the virus is out there, why don't they go all the way?</p></p>

        <p>I say that when you wear a seatbelt you are in a situation "of risk". You are in a car and you might have an accident.</p>
<p>Masks are different because if you arent sick, you arent at risk. If you don't have covid there is absolutely no need for you to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So I say wearing a mask all the time, in case you have covid, is like having a seatbelt on <em>all the time</em>, in case you happen to be in a car.</p>

        <p>Also if your passenger isn't wearing a seatbelt and you get in an accident they ping pong around inside the car causing injury to other occupants. Imagine a 170lb object bouncing around inside your car all over the place. </p>
<p>And driving is a privilige not a right so I'm fine with certain safety features being law.</p>

        <p>Every analogy they have come up with is stupid and compares apples to oranges. As a parent, I think the pants comparison is especially stupid. I‚Äôve been peed on a by pants-wearing potty training toddler and let me tell you, the fact they had pants on didn‚Äôt result in less urine getting on me!</p>

        <p>Yes, the clothing or pants comparison is obviously crazy. Every analogy they come up with is just crazy because there is no reason for muzzles anyway. I also just think there are a ton of germaphobes and squeamish people. Years ago, we were doing a lab in biology where we dissected a frog, and the teacher said she had masks and goggles available if it would make us more comfortable, but she wasn't going to make us wear them. I was fine with just gloves since I'm not squeamish, but the entire class went to get masks and goggles. I'm just not like that. I don't have kids, but I worked with toddlers for years and nearly every day I had to clean something because of kids pooping their pants or peeing their pants or getting snot all over their faces, or puking, or bleeding. Things like sickness are just inevitable and so is having to deal with not-so-pleasant things sometimes. But I've just noticed that there are so many squeamish people who freak out when it comes to stuff like that.</p>

        <p>Seat belts actually save lives, unlike masks. If masks save lives, where were they during all the flu seasons we've had? If it saves just one life, right?</p>
<p>If you choose not to wear a seatbelt, that's your choice. It sounds extreme, but the government should not have to tell you to wear one. And apparently, New Hampshire believes that.</p>

        <p>I don't breathe through my lap or my chest.  And I <strong>do</strong> need to breathe.  The mask interferes with that.  Plus I sometimes cough, burp, and even sneeze..... all normal things.  A seat belt doesn't inhibit those things, a mask does.  It's really hard to understand people who are wearing a mask;  it's really hard to detect a smile and it's really hard to engage with them.  Masks dehumanize us; people are fearful of each other.  Seat belts didn't cause any of those things.  But even without all of that, yes, I still disagree with the seat belt mandate.  But I would choose to wear one anyway, because of the <strong>MASSIVE</strong> amount of evidence that it's prudent to do so, unlike wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Me too. I'm fine with seatbelts, because we have such horrible drivers where I live, but it still should be a choice. My mom doesn't wear one. Do I think she should? Yes. But should it be her choice? Also yes.</p>

        <p>I would say that‚Äôs what vitamin c, d and zinc are for- they‚Äôre  the seatbelt . Germs do not cause disease. Toxicity or deficiency cause disease. Germ theory is a hoax. Seat belts are not.</p>

        <p>The seatbelt analogy sounds very sensible but unfortunately there's a major flaw. Consider what both a mask and seat belt are supposed to achieve, that is, protection against something. Covid in the case of a mask and injury in the case of a seat belt. </p>
<p>So far so good. But most people exposed to covid won't have an issue with it (over 99% are fine). In fact it's overwhelmingly those who are obese or have serious preexisting conditions, and the elderly who are at risk. If you are in a traffic accident, however, then the chance of injury/death is much higher. So we can predict those who are at risk of death for covid but anyone could be hurt in a traffic accident.</p>
<p>This means there is no danger of covid for most people when infected, but always a risk of a serious accident when driving. So why take a precaution against something that is of no danger to you? Wearing a mask for most people (and we can predict who very well) is like wearing a seatbelt when you are NOT in a car (i.e. no risk no protection required).</p>
<p>Of course the argument changes to "masks protect other people!" To which the correct response is "we do not wear a seat belt to protect other people, we wear it to protect ourselves". As evidenced by people wearing a seatbelt in the car when alone.</p>
