        <p>If only. I don't even say that jokingly.</p>
<p>All these morons. They really don't need to be passing on their genes to another generation. The only people getting this garbage are the same ones that brought our whole world to a screeching halt because they're nothing but scared idiots. Idiots who are more than willing to hand over their neighbors, their freedoms and their whole lives for some small meaningless sense of safety. We need less of these people, not more.</p>

        <p>The problem is, they are trying to get <strong>everyone</strong> in the world vaccinated. Most of us are either going to be forced to get the jab or forced out of society. I wouldn't be surprised if the government incarcerates anyone who doesn't take the jab. The leaked documents from the Canadian government state that those who refuse to oblige with their vaccination program will be taken to quarantine camps to be held indefinitely as "public health risks" until they are forced to take the vaccine, along with stripping them of their assets and property. People here take this way too lightly. Just telling the government "no" isn't good enough, because these monsters are coming for you.</p>

        <p>What I find very difficult to tolerate is the "shut up I'm watching the news" mentality when I try to educate people and try to lead them away from danger.</p>
<p>I was watching a <a href="https://odysee.com/@TruthHertz:2/onceweretheliving:9">video</a> that made me feel better about it. In it, the guy was like, "I'll tell you not to put your hand on a fire because you'll get burned, but if you want to touch the fire anyway, that's your business." And later, he was like, "Meh. More car spaces will be available, at least." (I'm paraphrasing)</p>
<p>I guess, later on, I'll be left with very rednecky militia types that I don't fit in with, or elite that I also don't fit in with.</p>
<p>So many people are very douchey, but I can't really fault them for that. I'm pretty douchey sometimes, too, and jerks do make the world interesting. And I do have loved ones that have gotten / will get both the swab and the vaccine, and the idea that they are going to die slowly and painfully is ... very hard for me. And by loved ones, I mean Youtubers like Blaire White, whom I have never met in real life. But she did reply to a message I posted on one of her videos.</p>

        <p>'<em>Unlikely</em>' is actually no different from stating "<em>it's possible</em>". If possible, where possible, it's possible I will avoid this. Possibly.</p>

        <p>Now put emphasis on the other words, "These vaccines are unlikely to COMPLETELY  sterilize a population." Or maybe, "These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilize a POPULATION."</p>

        <p>I'm too old to take any risks with my fertility. I don't smoke, I drink very little, I maintain my weight scrupulously in a narrow healthy range and stay fit, I take a mineral supplement, I do a lot of shit I wouldn't otherwise care about to try to keep my ovaries functioning for a couple extra years. I need hard, trustworthy evidence that the vaccine doesn't impact fertility <em>at all</em> in women over 35 before moving the vaccine from my "hell no, not under any circumstances" list to the "probably not but maybe with the right incentives" list.</p>

        <p>I once lost a government job I had trained for because I was pregnant and they told me I had to get a Hep A vaccine to work with children. The info sheet on the vax said "there is no evidence that Hep A vaccine is not safe for pregnancy". That was enough for me to dip out. Maybe they all say that, just to be on the safe side, but it was still enough for me to say hell nah.</p>
