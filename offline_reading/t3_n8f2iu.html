        <p>Maybe they could find the most arrogant assholes in existence and have them yell "shut the fuck up and get vaccinated" and that would change the hearts and minds of people. I for one find that type of thing very convincing!</p>

<p>Hmmm.... I'll let that roll around in my head while I go back and digest stories that use "only" in conjunction with the same number ranges and time frames they used to foment panic a year ago.</p>

        <p>What I find interesting in this article was the false assumption that the mRNA vaccines prevent transmission. My understanding was that they never claimed to do this, which was a big part of the explanations I’ve heard as to why vaccinated people wear masks</p>

        <p>They don't know how many people who Just Say No to experimental drugs have immunity. Natural immunity counts towards herd immunity, and is better than vaccine immunity for that purpose, because your body recognizes more parts of the virus, not just one very specific spike protein. You're better protected against mutations with natural immunity than from exposure to one isolated part of the virus.</p>
<p>A whole-virus vaccine made well could probably be on par with natural infection for that, but for some reason most companies rushed forward with the mRNA garbage which is much riskier <em>and</em> sets you up for needing boosters sooner instead of being effective against slight virus mutations on its own. Most inactivated or weakened whole virus vaccines for other diseases protect against reinfection roughly as well as recovery from the infection does. mRNA is not ready for prime time and shouldn't have been used.</p>
<p>I keep hearing that the normal Sinopharm vaccine isn't very effective, but it's so hard to get accurate data that I'm wondering if it's really any worse than the others, or if this is just propaganda and trickery to get countries to pick mRNA instead. The US in particular is using lots of PCR tricks to hide the mRNA vaccine failures, and what I'm <em>not</em> hearing about is a flood of side effects from Sinopharm.</p>

        <p>Have you come across any research on people who survived infection and got the vaccine? I tried to stave off getting pricked for my whole family- even my wife succumbed to the pressure at work due to the face-to-face nature of her work and the clientele just felt more comfortable knowing that she was vaccinated.  So now I’m trying to find studies on the effect of the mRNA shot on infection-induced immunity.  I can’t imagine it helps all that much if at all, just wondering if it is eroded.</p>

        <p>I blame not getting the jab, to impeaching Trump two times. 
They never cared the presidence that would set.
But it set that this independent would never meet their demands. 
Just like going after the right and bailing out the left. 
We have reached a point in this relationship where communication will not work and all we do if fight. 
It's time Americans figure out what side your on and fine that lane.</p>
