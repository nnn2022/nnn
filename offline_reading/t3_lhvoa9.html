    <strong>I finally know someone who died of Covid....er, I mean the Covid Vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>This post is not a joke and <strong><em>I am not making light of anyone dying</em></strong>. I am sharing this information to help others understand the potential risks of experimental vaccines like the mRNA Covid vaccines. </p>
<p>My story:  Despite trying to warn my aunt to proceed with caution when it comes to the experimental Covid Vax, she didn't listen to me and instead gathered up a group of her friends from church for a Covid Vax party in PA - all of them eager to get vaxxed because they've been scared into doing so my mainstream media. </p>
<p>Last week the group of 10 went for their 1st round of injections. Thankfully my aunt made it thru (although she felt terrible for a few days), but sadly, one of her friends did not.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm sorry to say that the poor woman <strong>died within just **3 HOURS** of getting her shot</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course the cause of death is 'unknown,' and I have to admit that she was over 70, so the narrative that 'she was just old' could apply here and we certainly can NOT say her death is directly related to the vaccine. (We can NEVER say a death is related to the vaccine, right???)</p>
<p>I wonder, will they classify the unfortunate woman's death as a 'covid' death? Or are we not doing the inflated death thing anymore now that President Trump is gone?</p>
<p>Please join me in saying a prayer for the woman who passed away - yet another unnecessary death in the Covid pLandemic world we live in. </p>

        <p>üôè  I'm in the same boat with my parents. I just pray they wake up or pull through.  Haven't gotten it yet, but they are "desperately" awaiting it. Stopped listening to me a awhile ago.  Stressful. Honestly,  how the F do you cope with family begging to be poisoned?</p>

<p>As i told my mom - just wait a bit. Wait and see what happens. Just bc u wait and see doesn't mean u can't get it later. 
Govt wants to peddle FOMO of vax.
Its really FOMO of life!
When it comes to vax the #StayHomeStaySafe message applies! :)</p>

        <p>‚ÄúHave to admit she was over 70.‚Äù Yep. End of story. Sorry for your loss, doubt the vaccine caused it. But if that brings you some sense of closure kore power to ya. Since we‚Äôre using anecdotes and correlation, both my grandparents over 80, one a cancer survivor, have survived both shots. So I know for sure it‚Äôs safe, lol ;)</p>

        <p>I'm happy to hear your grandparents made it thru ok. I hope the potential  <a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/covid-19-vaccine-destroy-immune-system/">Antibody Dependent Enhancement Concerns</a> don't become an issue for them. </p>
<p>Obviously the death I mentioned was not related to the vaccine because it's impossible that any death could be caused by the Covid vaccine, right?</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs highly unlikely at this juncture given the millions vaccinated that the vaccine directly causes death.  No direct link has been established yet, though I suppose autopsy findings can present a clearer picture of adverse reactions. I think the biggest risk with vaccine would be allergic reaction at this points People over 70 die every day and will continue to do so. Many will die within days or hours of getting vaccinated.  As with Covid itself, many died ‚Äúwith‚Äù it rather than ‚Äúfrom‚Äù it.</p>
