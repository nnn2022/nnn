        <p>I like to compare Gates/Musk to the good cop bad cop routine. Both of them are technocrats with the same end goal of changing humanity forever.</p>
<p>Except Gates is the "bad technocrat" and Musk is the "good technocrat"</p>
<p>They're propping up Musk as a good guy that's against the system when hes obviously part of the system. You don't become rich like him by being a "good guy"</p>
<p>Musk also wants to implant a chip in your brain to merge your consciousness with an AI. Hard pass for me.</p>

        <p>Pass or not, whatever dude. You’re under the presumption that we can just exist in this pre-2020 way of life plane forever, when change is inevitable. </p>
<p>Also, it’s foolish of you to assume everyone who’s rich like musk is “part of the system”. That’s stupid.</p>
<p>If you made a social media platform and sold it for half a billion dollars, you’re suddenly part of the system? What? </p>
<p>You make wise investment decisions, so..you’re part of the system?</p>

<p>You do realize you're in a sub that opposes a "new normal" and these technocrats are using covid as an excuse to shove their technocratic agenda down our throats.</p>
<p>We've been living like normal human beings for centuries, Why does humanity need to change so dramatically? Because these technocrats tell you it's inevitable?</p>
<p>And no, I have no intention of living in a world like that, I'll check out of this existence first.</p>

        <p>I joined this sub because I oppose tyranny. And that’s exactly what the Trojan horse ‘covid’ is being used for. Not because I’m willing to remain stagnant. </p>
<p>Perhaps the future is just closer than most of us realize? There’s breakthroughs all the time that most people never hear about. </p>
<p>&rt;We’ve been living like normal human beings for centuries, why does humanity need to change so dramatically? </p>
<p>What exactly is a ‘normal human being’? In my estimation, humans are highly ambitious. Always questioning, and always innovating. Upgrading our tools. Is there just a point in which you’re uncomfortable with the progression? </p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not advocating for any of this bullshit this year. What I am advocating for is a 2030 Mars missions, I’m advocating for AI Safety research, I’m advocating for better tools for everyone. </p>
<p>It’s like a platform update on your favorite platform of choice. Usually, you hate it after having been used to the old or ‘normal’ interface, but change is inevitable, and eventually you’ll adjust to it anyways. Usually there’s a few more things to tinker with here and there. </p>
<p>Stagnation is a great danger, so we should encourage innovation regardless.</p>
<p>As far as the change to our lives this year, again, that’s not what I’m advocating for whatsoever, and that’s why I’m here. </p>
<p>But years down the road, if someone can bring a safe, highly tested, and flawless brain interface to the market, I can only see it exponentially providing benefit to us.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if the pros outweigh the cons are up to you to decide, but we aren’t there yet.</p>

        <p>I understand wanting to use technology to improve human lives, but you have to understand the people that rule over us have no intention of using it to improve our lives. They want to use it to control them.</p>
<p>And that Musk character is not to be trusted. Just look into him and you'll find hes no better than Bill Gates. Hes just playing the role of the "good guy" right now.</p>

        <p>It’s not healthy to think everyone is out for you.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m not talking about people ruling and wanting to use technology to control us. I’m talking about the fundamental truth to being a human, and that technological growth is merely inevitable. </p>
<p>We should focus on how to take measured steps in making sure we can safely proceed in our technological growth. </p>
<p>Further, I’m not gonna sit here and argue with you whether or not musk is a good or bad guy. From what I’ve seen, he’s done a lot for us. He smoked weed on JRE and expressed concerns about technological growth. Who knows who people are behind closed doors, but I’m not going to assume musk is a bad guy because I haven’t seen data to fit that.</p>

        <p>How does smoking weed on JRE (another obvious pro pharma shill) and expressing concerns about technological growth do ANYTHING for us?</p>
<p>If anything that was just a publicity stunt. and seems to have worked wonderfully!</p>
<p>Like I said he's sticking to the role of "good technocrat" so of course he's going to give the impression that he's "concerned" about AI all the while pushing his technology that merges your consciousness with an AI...</p>
<p>Trust him at your own peril.</p>

        <p>Smoking weed doesn’t express anything, other than he seems like a down to earth guy. You glanced over the fact that I said he’s done a lot for us, because he has. Tesla is innovation, and so is SpaceX. You could say he started SpaceX to eventually launch mass satellite surveillance, but it’s a big stretch in my estimation. </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe musk is the big man in charge. I just don’t see evidence to support that.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying hes the man in charge. I'm just saying that according to my own research in the matter. I think the guy is playing a role. His role is to get people that are skeptical of technocracy on board with the agenda.</p>
<p>I've seen countless people that are very aware of the monster Gates is but somehow completely trust Musk. I just don't understand it.</p>
