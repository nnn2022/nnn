    <strong>Politics, the matrix, the maskers are not our enemy, acceptance and peace of our mind and soul</strong>
    <p><p>First off, I am not good at writing and English is not my native language. But I feel the need to share these as they have helped me waking up from this "nightmare". I don't expect you agree with all of my points here (or even none at all), but I'm grateful if this can be helpful to you, even just a little bit.</p>
<p>Politics are staged and are meant to further divide us. The maskers are not our enemy. We can't change the world. The virus SARS CoV2 doesn't even exist and germ theory is still a theory. We are truly living in The Matrix.</p>
<p>I do think bringing politics into our discussion is pointless. I came to realization that the top-politics are all staged. They are meant to further divide us, making us not aware of the real enemy that is the governments around the world. Slave owner will always try to keep their slaves under control and not rebelling. Yes, it's true that the red states opposes lockdown, but Trump still approve operation Warp Speed. So it doesn't matter. Drop the label in the headline. Judge the person by their actions, not their affiliation to a party. Don't identify which side you are on, because you are reinforcing the division. We, humans, are meant to live together. </p>
<p>The maskers are not our enemy. Don't put out hatred to them. I feel guilty of this by myself. Once you start hating them, you can't feel peace. They are just the same with us, just in different phase of life. We don't become an anti-masker in an instant. What we can do is to share seed of ideas to them, even if they don't agree with it that is fine. They will blossom, I'm sure of it, we just can't control when it will blossom. We can't change the world, but we can change ourselves.</p>
<p>SARS CoV2 is not even proven yet to be scientifically exists. Let alone proven to cause COVID-19. The "accepted fact" that a pathogenic little thing called virus, spread from human to human, and causes pandemic is still a theory (you can Google it yourself, you know they want it to be true when it has dedicated section of "Germ theory denialism" in Wikipedia). If you want to have a peace of mind, look up terrain theory, especially in Dr. Andrew Kaufman YouTube channel. Or to reinforce that Germ Theory is still a theory (and SARS CoV2 doesn't exist), look up Dr. Stefan Lanka (he won in court proving that measles virus doesn't exist, he also holds opinion that pathogenic viruses are not yet scientifically proven).</p>
<p>We are truly living in The Matrix. There is no real truth, because it's always changing. If you believe SARS CoV2 doesn't even exists, then the whole world is a stage. Almost every single countries has participated in it, even China. Because they're all in it. Politics are staged. History is written by the victors (or even actively rewritten). They have been planning this since long time. The modern medicine. The media. The education system. Appeal to authority doctrine. The germ theory.</p>
<p>I believe what we can do first is to make peace with our mind and soul. Whatever they have coming at us, it shouldn't affect our mind and soul. Because the true battlefield is in them.</p>
<p>Sorry if this feel patronizing or condescending, that is not my intention. I hope you can find peace in you. God bless.</p></p>

        <p>I love my form of government. I truly do. But our Declaration of Independence puts to words WHY we have a constitution. </p>
<p>Our Constitution is a legally binding agreement that The People wrote as The Supreme Law of the new nation; thus giving PERMISSION for government to exist; provided they operate within certain limits.</p>
<p>Our Declaration of Independence used to be special to us all. It was the biggest FUCK YOU ever written- before the bullets started flying in open warfare against (formerly great) Britain. Or England? Who gives a fuck, I’m talking about tyrants and their fucking friends on the ground. </p>
<p>We used to be graded on how well we memorized the Preamble. Remember that, anyone?</p>
<p>I agree, the maskers aren’t the enemy. But they are in the fucking way. Wake them up whenever you see the chance. Say something. You’ll find your style. Always be polite, but firmly confident in your stature and words. </p>
<p>Have a great Saturday. Thanks for watching my show that may launch soon.</p>
