    <strong>BC, Alberta announce new restrictions.</strong>
    <p><p>I knew Bonnie Henry only sounded nice on the surface. She's just like the rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://ca.yahoo.com/news/canada-covid19-coronavirus-daily-updates-october-26-145707559.html">https://ca.yahoo.com/news/canada-covid19-coronavirus-daily-updates-october-26-145707559.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia's provincial health officer, announced a new order on Monday to limit gatherings in private homes to no more than one household plus their “safe six.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She added that she is hoping that additional enforcement will not be necessary but the <em>order is enforceable by bylaw officers, police officers and environmental health officers.</em></p>
<p>It's optional, but will be enforced. Another idiocy in 2020. Up is down 2+2 = 5, Choice means no choice.</p>
<p>&rt;“It is now the expectation that people will wear a non-medical mask in public [indoor] spaces,” Dr. Henry said. “It’s not an order because this is something that I know we support as part of our mutual responsibilities to protect ourselves and to protect each others.”</p>
<p>Again the wording that "its not an order" and "its optional". It's crap. They are fully aware people who are fully brainwashed will enforce others.</p>
<p>Canadians and their stereotype that they are nice goes AGAINST actually rising up and going against the mandates. Can't we have one province that does something different, like Florida and South Dakota does in the US?</p>
<p>I'm starting to believe the only reason Canada hasn't locked down hard is because cases are lower than in most of the US states. Nothing to do with the leaders here being more sane or anything.</p>
<p>Also I find it really intriguing that its always six. Six feet, six people. Obsession with, six, six, six.</p></p>

        <p>I say this as a Canadian:</p>
<p>Wonder why the people of this country have gone along so supinely with all of the BS restrictions, to the extent of roaring their approval for them, and dog-piling those of us who dissent? Wonder why <em>thousands</em> gather to protest in Europe, or the US, but not here?</p>
<p>It's baked into the Canadian psyche, from even before Confederation in 1867. We were handed our "independence" on a silver platter by Mother England; we didn't have to fight for it. And it shows.</p>
<p>The United States fought a costly, bloody Revolutionary War to free itself from tyranny and to establish "government by the people, for the people". When the war was over, a certain subset of Americans (called Loyalists) picked up and... you guessed it... moved to what we now call Canada.</p>
<p>So in effect, the founders of Canada are people who said "<em>Hey, our friends and neighbours just fought a war to be free from tyranny; let's move north so we can live under tyranny again!!!"</em></p>
<p>A mindset of mediocrity, obedience, and conformity from day 1...</p>

        <p>Most of my fellow Canadians blow a gasket when I say what I said in my post to them in person. Want to know why?</p>
<p>Because the the greatest display of histrionics, outrage, and offense will be caused not by a lie, but by a statement the listener knows to be true, but doesn't want to admit is true.</p>

        <p>It was pretty obvious more restrictions were coming once they forced the province into an unnecessary election. That was fast!</p>

        <p>Canada has much darker reasoning for not enforcing massive lockdowns (although I would like to add some places do have some pretty insane lockdowns in Canada). First would be that Canada has had a very high level of complacence. And is terrifying how many post I see from my city's subreddit and how hard they destroy those who go against MSM. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Next I actually think Canada's main goal is to send people to "quarantine camps" and to force wide spread vaccination. Due to the illegal conflict if interest, many of those with the invested interest of phara products will see record profits.</p>

<p>Yep, totally noticed this too. Six people, six feet of distance, or you'll be 6 feet under. 666. </p>
<p>I think it's actually far worse than we realize. <a href="https://youtu.be/AzWLlfwfD4Y">Here's the Ontario premiere blatant dodging questions</a> regarding the forced detention centers that are <a href="https://youtu.be/THRAryXQAHE">being implemented in ontario and eventually across Canada</a>.</p>

        <p>Please get me the fuck out of here. I was skeptical about this shit from Day 1. I've already lost my job and all career prospects. My mental health is in shambles. I need treatments and checkups for my ovaries and that shits backlogged like crazy. I would do anything to leave this country and start a new. The quality of living is so piss poor here and everyone knows it but they're too pussy to go against the narrative or generally believe its for the "GREATER GOOD" (whatever the FUCK that is).  I'm so lowkey scared about how they're handling things here I don't want to be like Australia. Everyone around me is a god damn zombie, my friends, my family (minus my mom, who's managed to be the most rational one in my life). They drink the Kool-aid 24/7, I can't take these restrictions anymore I want to get on with my life.</p>
