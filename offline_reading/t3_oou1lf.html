        <p>The puzzle pieces line up with something different. Article says "white tongue... strep and staph infections as well as COVID-19." Sounds like his immune system shut down completely, because boy's system was simultaneously open to yeast, bacterial, and viral infections. Consider an immune disorder or childhood leukemia instead of Covid-19. It is most certainly infant Leukemia, something that according to the article was not tested for, probably because the fight was on to stop the child from succumbing to the presenting conditions.</p>

        <p>I guess STREP and STAPH infections in a FIVE YEAR OLD aren't considered underlying conditions. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for this boy and his family but this is certainly the rarest of situations where a young child has strep, staph and covid all at the same time.  </p>
<p>Strange that the symptoms of all three started at exactly the same time.</p>

        <p>God damn it, you've got to be kidding me. I scrolled through the article and they mention Covid like 50 times but it's not until somwhere deep in the article they mention that the doctors  'also diagnosed him with a strep and staph infection'.  Yeah, like that is just a minor detail. </p>
<p>This kid most likely died 'with covid' but because of a staphylococcal or streptococcal infection which, under the right circumstances, have very high mortality rate. Something Covid does not have in children. </p>
<p>I despise this feel porn.</p>
