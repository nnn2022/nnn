    <strong>The banana equivalent to Covid-19 is killing bananas.</strong>
    <p><p>Bananas are becoming extinct, ladies and gentlemen. Because a deadly fungus is destroying them. There is no cure. It's a doomsday scenario for bananas. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-pandemic-threatening-bananas.html">https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-pandemic-threatening-bananas.html</a></p>
<p>And no matter how this fungus affects the supply, the news can already be used to raise prices, and if there really is a supply shortage, that's when the real profiteering will start. Creating artificial deficit in order to maximize profits.</p>
<p>Seems like someone figured bananas were worth too little and too many were being grown.</p>
<p>Banana industry has been suffering from overproduction for years. When you produce too much of something, its price goes down. When the means of production are so developed that producing an individual banana requires less and less labour, the value of the banana goes down. It's the same with every product - when the labour costs go down, so does the value and so does the price. Take bread, for example. We all need it, it's a highly useful product. But it costs very little. Why? Because producing an individual loaf requires little labour. And so the price goes down. It's the law of value,described in the first volume of Das Kapital.</p>
<p>See how the money bags are using the word "pandemic" to simply cover up their financial schemes? It's exactly the same with the "covid" pandemic and with all the other "pandemics" in the last 20 years. It's a cover-up for the overpoduction crisis in all major industries.</p></p>

        <p>Read about Marek disease, it's literally nightmare fuel. Basically a leaky vaccine for a virus (just like the corona vaccine) affected birds caused the disease to go from bird herpes to super deadly, requiring every chicken to be vaccinated against it.</p>

        <p>this shipping of exotic fruits and nuts thousands of miles over the oceans ... is anyway  not sustainable and if we are serious about helping ourselves, the human species to find some humble place within the web of life on this planet ... we best would stop buying stuff what travelled more than 30 or 100 miles</p>
<p>while i agree with the overall notion of many who have followed global politics during the last three decades ... connected the dots ...</p>
<p>( some brain-sick rich ones instilling the idea of "overpopulation" followed by artificially creating a "public health" crisis so the real killer ... the vaccines could be administered with a majority begging for it ...all the way maximising the profits distributing the depopulating pharmaceutical stuff  ... mmh... actually its mostly the lockdown terror what makes probably most people allow themselves be injected in the hope to be given some more radius of movement ... also the killing via vaccines not happening instantly in most cases but only after several years of constant renewal of only-partially-working vaccines resulting in accumulation of chemical toxins in the body with simultaneously the immune system weakened by the constant introduction of lab cooked chemical cocktails ... something like a decade long weakening scheme paired with digital vaccine passports stylised to some form of obedience badge )</p>
<p>I would like to add here</p>
<p>... the economy captains ... the ones investing billions into these or that sectorsdo have a hard time adjusting to the humble approachas they are so used to money being infused and pulled out again quickly all over the globe in any sector</p>
<p>however ... the power is in the hands of the consumer ... the consumer decides what the industry is producing, not the investors</p>
<p>but then there is a certain awareness lag or a certain laziness with some fellow human beings when it comes to put the money where ones conscience is ... like ... although we have heard eventually about this or that problem, pesticides having adverse influence on most every part of the web of life, gmo crops being adverse to our own health and causing problems for the whole web of life, all products involving animal enslavement causing chain reactions of destruction and overuse ... soy being planted on burned down rainforest to feed industrial fattened male cows ( bulls ) and pigs ... although we know about how palm oil plantations are responsible for the destruction of the orang utans habitats</p>
<p>we at times are reluctant to consequently change our buying habits</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and that exactly what the industry captains are counting on</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>on the ones who have the power of the wallet, the power of spending money ... to not follow their conscience, not being true to what they know but give in to greenwashing lies made up in the marketing sections of multinational food producers</p>
<p>mmmh... how to get out of this dilemma ... that we actually have the power to steer product devellopment towards this direction where we would want it to go .. social, fair, sustainable, not hurting no animal nor the ecological balance ... but we are not using it consequently enough</p>
<p>one possible sollution I do see in the dissolving of political hierarchies ... to purge all our regional states and nation states constitutions of the feudal leftovers what are inbuilt in them ... most of all the "divide et impera" principle "divide to rule" ... what is applied in the political decision powers being distributed on three levels of law making and governance ... national - regional - local</p>
<p>instead of us coming together as one in the very physical reality where we live ... the neighbourhood, the local community, the village, the town, the city-district to create all the laws what we would want to obey or live with ...</p>
<p>we spend our days with electing other people to represent us in the national parliamentary assembly, in the regional parliamentary assembly, in the local communities council</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this electing other peoples to represent us ... is like shooting ourselves into our feet and asking others to carry us ... exaggerating here ... using unnecessary bloody imagination</p>
<p>but still ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the moment we elect others to make the law for us</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we are fucked</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we are at risk of others doublefacedness lying cheating corrupted mask-wearing</p>
<p>pun intended</p>
<p>dishonest behaviour poisening our whole life</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so how can I stop myself here ranting about this fucked up status quo ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>oh I know how ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I could once again mention how I think we could renew the regional states and nation states constitutions so that we finally do shift the political powers to the only one level what is real ... the local community</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:</p>
<p>----the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation statethe local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>after such a most helpful first step ... then the local sovereign communities having inherited some financial and material share of the abdicated regional and nation states ...</p>
<p>there could be a chance that some of the local sovereign communities would want for example to use these inherited wealth to buy agricultural land and forest land from private owner so that the full assembly of all permanent residents, all children, youth and adults who live here and now having the very same weighted voting power ... could then reserve for example 1000 square meter fertile land for everyone inhabitant</p>
<p>1000 square meters given as a loan for lifetime, no tax duty, no rent paying duty attached to it ... the only condition not to pollute the soil, the water and air</p>
<p>1000 square meters where one could build a house for oneself on it and grow ones own vegetables so that one would be self-sufficient and all social interactions with fellow human beings would be on a foundation of voluntary choices</p>
<p>no one demanding anything from anyone else, everyone free to choose at all times when one would connect to whom else in what motivation of exchanging what thoughts, words, feelings and or material goods and services</p>
