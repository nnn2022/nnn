    <strong>Why does the US have such an obsession with masking children?</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't really the international norm. The UK has a mask age of 11, most Australian states have a mask age of 12. Most of the schools in those countries have always been mask-free, even for older students. In fact, it cause some big outrage in the UK when they forced students 11 and older to wear masks for something like three weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, the CDC is insisting that children down to age 2 should mask even as adults take off their masks. And 2 year olds are at least nominally required to wear masks on an airplane. (I certainly hope airlines don't actually enforce masks on 2 year olds in practice.)  Half the time when I turn on CNN, they're talking about how you need to mask your 2-11 year old.</p>
<p>And is the CDC's masking guidance for unvaccinated people really aimed at anybody except parents of children 2-11? Yes, it nominally applies to all unvaccinated people (regardless of age), but I can't imagine that any adult who's unvaccinated seriously cares about following those guidelines.</p></p>

        <p>Liberals and doomers hate children. They dehumanize them by calling them crotch fruits. They whine about why they aren't allowed to bring their dogs everywhere yet children are allowed in public. It bothers them that people choose to have families instead of playing video games all day and becoming addicted to porn. Masks are a way to physically punish children for being children.</p>

        <p>This is my theory: Seeing facial expressions at a young age, especially from your family members, are very important for their emotional development. </p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but it was very strange for me, even at age 25 when I am nearly fully “developed”, when we ditched the mask and you could see people’s full faces after all those months. I can’t describe it well, but the masked interactions seemed wildly different; like less “personal”. Now imagine a child, at an age where your brain is the most “plastic” and impressionable. </p>
<p>For adults, the mask’s impact on our socioemotional processing wasn’t nearly as traumatizing because our psyche is much more established and resistant to change than that of a child. </p>
<p>For a child who’s 5, that’s 20% (and counting, unfortunately) of their life not seeing facial expressions from their peers, and those years are among the most formative at that. I would imagine that this will reflect on certain behaviors later in life.</p>
<p>TLDR: we’re creating a generation riddled with mental illness and socioemotional deficits.</p>

        <p>I go running a lot and I have recently seen adults masking their 4 and 5 year old children outside in the heat.  The adults were not masked and this was before the vaccine was available.  I couldn't figure it out.  I just wanted to tell them they were abusing those kids and indoctrinating them to be afraid of everything in life.</p>

        <p>The kids might have been deciding to wear masks on their own accord. (Especially if it was pre-vaccine.)  Kids that age probably have a hard time even remembering the pre-COVID days, so masks might seem normal to them.</p>
<p>Which, frankly, is worse to me than if the masks seemed abnormal to them.</p>

        <p>Seems to me children have always been scapegoats. When my oldest was 3, my husband had back surgery and we tried to visit him only to be chewed out by a nurse who basically said kids are dirty and carry viruses and that’s why they aren’t allowed. She said my kid needed to stay in the waiting area at the front of the hospital. Then she must have realized she fucked up because then she turned it around and started saying how hospitals are so germy you really don’t want your kids to be there. This same hospital, ever since that experience, has claimed its “flu season” therefore children under 14 cannot visit (only exception is babies, siblings of any age can visit new babies, all year long). Doesn’t matter what time of year it is, if you want to being your kids to visit their parent or grandparent, you are told “nope, it’s flu season. No kids allowed”.</p>

        <p>It's to make them used to doing things that hurt them and make no sense just because they were told to. Most large countries' people have been "better" trained to trust the government and generally be compliant and obedient than the USA, so our youth get targeted with more obedience training.</p>
