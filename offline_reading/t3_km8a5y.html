        <p>Insulting our intelligence and calling us dangerously ignorant isn’t working, they have to take it a step further and label us a hate group like we are the KKK or neonazis. I give it a few months before anyone who questions the holy ordained word of covid “science” and lockdowns is considered by the media to be a Ted Kazitsky esque extremist who is on the verge of domestic terrorism unless we lock them up. Can anyone say false flag?</p>

        <p>Yeah for all who don't know, r/AgainstHateSubreddits isn't really against "hate" subreddits, they're against anything right-leaning. I don't think I've ever seen r/Sino or r/GenZedong on there, but I see r/Conservative and r/DonaldTrump on there all the time. Most of the time, the linked thread on r/Conservative and r/donaldtrump isn't even hateful. It isn't about "hate" it's about thought policing.</p>

        <p>How does this sub hate science and medicine? It's perfectly normal to be skeptical of a rushed experimental mRNA vaccine. I had my flu shot in October. Most people here are probably not even anti-vaxx across the board. And it is the religious faith in masks that is unscientific. Not being skeptical of masks. How in the hell are shitty paper surgical masks and cloth masks supposed to stop aerosols? Virions piggyback on those aerosols. And Aerosols go right through the paper and cloth fabric. And even if N95s were effective against coronaviruses, there aren't enough of them for use by the general public.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses have been with us for all of human history. You're telling me that Dr. Fauci and the WHO didn't figure out that surgical and cloth masks worked until April 2020? After studying human coronaviruses for how many years? During the 2018 influenza epidemic nurses unions were arguing that wearing surgical masks in nursing homes was pointless as masks don't protect against influenza. And we had the common cold with us. And about 15% of common colds are caused by coronaviruses. If masks were so great against coronaviruses, we would have known long before recently surely?</p>

        <p>N95 masks are designed to catch 95% of particles from the air that pass through it. This includes bio aerosols like viruses.</p>

        <p>The issue is that the N95 supply is too limited for use by the general public. Hence why mask mandates don't work. Those shitty paper surgical masks and cloth masks are not going to stop aerosolized viruses. We prioritize N95s for health care workers. As we should. Since they are the ones who are coming into contact with COVID+ patients all day. And if they get sick, they can get other people in the hospital sick. A large percentage of the cases and an even larger percentage of COVID deaths are from nursing homes. And a growing percentage of cases and deaths are coming from hospitals. </p>
<p>And PPE is not used in hospitals and nursing homes often enough. In nursing homes, I see a lot of staff still using surgical masks instead of actual N95s. As surgical masks are relatively cheap and plentiful. And N95s are limited and expensive. When my dad went to the hospital during the summer for cancer treatment, all the staff around him were wearing surgical masks, not N95. The N95s were being reserved for the COVID ward. So if one of those nurses or doctors came into work with a cold, they could have infected him and others with the coronavirus. And there's probably a lot of pressure in hospitals and nursing homes to go into work sick because there isn't an endless supply of trained staff to take your place if you get sick.</p>

        <p>I dunno about that, N95 masks aren't that hard to come by these days, i definitely agree they were in short supply at the beginning of the outbreak though; but that mightve been due to China basically buying the entire worlds supply in December/January beginning of last year when they saw what was coming.</p>
<p>As for the other things, I feel like they could be problems with your national health service rather than anything specific. Are you American by any chance?</p>

        <p>Don't try to understand it. They are a militant group who get off on destroying any sub they even slightly disagree with. Trying to untangle the whole modern concept of 'hate' (without regard for the agenda that drives it) would be an impossible task. Just like reddit policies, it can be selectively enforced wherever required.</p>

        <p>I'd love to say I'm shocked by this but I'm really not...we don't follow hivemind, ergo we are 'hate'</p>
<p>What I will say (admittedly I only found and joined a few days ago) the only 'hate' I've seen thrown about on this sub is from those who come here and disagree... I've been insulted three times off the top of my head and if I check it's probably more</p>
<p>They <em>really</em> (much like their beloved lockdowns and 'New Normal) can't stay consistent can they?</p>
<p>On the one hand, <em>we are killing everybody!</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>'they are just a batshyt insane minority'</em></p>
<p>Well - which is it?!?</p>
<p>Of course, seems we are all Trump-worshipping, Q-Anon-following N@zis - I for one aren't even American, don't buy into the left/right paradigm, and Q-anon? I need some form of evidence please so nope, not that either 🤣</p>
<p>But hey, being concerned about cancer patients not getting their treatments, people (including children) dying alone, realising our children and future generations are absolutely screwed by this <em>already</em> makes me 'hateful'? Gotcha 🙄</p>

        <p>They basically just made up a bunch of smears and then plug their ears, close their eyes, repeat over and over until they work themselves into a frenzy.</p>
<p>It's how the left operates most of the time.</p>
<p>"People who disagree with us are racist bigots!"</p>
<p>Reading the arguments there, it's like reading random insane scribblings that have nothing to do with anything here. Agonizing.</p>

        <p>Yep totally...I honestly imagine them purple in the face, frothing rabidly at the mouth as they type</p>
<p>I did read (most) of the 'arguments' on the post but I gave up about 3/4 of the way through... it's painful to read and as you say, it's like the ramblings of madmen </p>

        <p>It span off from r/lockdownskepticism - that sub started in April, but it is heavily moderated and many of us felt unable to talk about political or agenda driven elements of what's going on, so this place started around May I think.</p>

<p>I don't know how I missed it all this time!</p>
<p>Previous to finding this sub, the only meaningful convo I ever had on Reddit about all this was on the Rh Negative sub, and it seems the person who posted there mostly has deleted their account since 😔</p>
<p>Up to now I've actively avoided <em>anything</em> covid-related as the hivemind mentality made me want to vomit... seems even on 'conspiracy' subs there are a <em>LOT</em> of defenders from the Church of Corona...</p>

        <p>I’d say we are more of a love sub. Murders, suicides, and ODs are all up this year. We are concerned about people in impoverished countries starving. We want people to have the opportunity to work for a living. And we want all kids to have the option for in person schooling. </p>
<p>They can label us whatever we want. The truth is our motivations stem from compassion.</p>

<p>Look at some of the hate crime laws in the western world.  In Canada, reciting actual crime stats from a government website is hate speech if it offends someone. </p>
