    <strong>All of us have to not comply with mandates if we want things to go back to normal.</strong>
    <p><p>I respect a private bussinesses right to enforce what ever rule they want. Such as refusing service to people who won't wear a mask.</p>
<p>They don't want to serve me fine then. They'll only lose money. If we get mass noncomplience we can make a difference.They may have to compromise or possibly go out of bussiness if they don't get enough customers. </p>
<p>Everyone has to play the game though. I hope more and more people get sick of all of this.</p></p>

        <p>Where I live, the cases and the deaths increased, so targeted closures were enacted and enough people changed their behavior and didn't gather without masks, and then the cases and deaths went down, so now kids can be in school and businesses have reopened.  I know it's frustrating to keep repeating that cycle, but now, people are starting to get vaccinated and are making plans for the summer when things will be more normal, at least for those of us who get the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Maybe because the recommendations come from scientists who have studied how the virus spreads and their advice works?  Targeted closures of high risk activities when there is a spike in a region and mask mandates help prevent the blunt tool of a full lockdown that we all want to avoid.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns don't work, they kill and destroy more than a virus ever could. Which is why they were never used before and considered complete bunk, until the CCP propagandized them to the world.</p>
<p>See: California. Hard lockdown since March. Masks since April. Did not prepare for any winter respiratory season. They are fucked.</p>
<p>Masks were never a thing, either, until they became politicized. They do not work, either. Evidence in the real world not in sterile labs or out of mathematical models hypothetically assuming shows that.</p>
<p>This is all a mass hysteria event followed by removing our rights as human beings (freedom of movement, to practice one's religion, to make a living, to get married, to have funerals, to BE HUMANS!). Public policy failure, thy name is lockdown.</p>

        <p>Masks have obviously always been worn in medical settings. They were worn by everyday people during the Spanish flu outbreak and there were people opposed to masks then too.  People from east Asian countries continued through the years to wear masks when they had colds or when they were in situations like flying on a plane or riding in a packed train.  In the U.S., people undergoing chemotherapy have been advised long before COVID to wear a mask in public to protect against getting sick.  Before COVID, there were not theories that it was harmful to wear a mask or that it somehow would weaken an immune system.</p>
<p>People do need to learn more about proper mask use, and not keep rewearing cloth masks without washing them or touching their face while wearing them.  People mock those who wear masks alone in their cars, but it's actually smart to put the mask on before leaving home or at least not take it on and off when you make multiple stops.</p>

        <p>And Dr. Fauci wrote a paper about masking in the 1918 pandemic, cloth masks being useless and suggesting they caused baterial pneumonia. Wouldn't shock me, even though in 1918 we knew about hygiene as well. They've become a talisman - 'my mask protects me and you!' nonsense. We know they don't. Maybe they cut transmission but if they do it is neligible. I feel if people wish to wear them, go ahead. Mandating them does nothing but cause problems. Interesting re: chemo as I've never known a chemo patient to wear a mask, and even whilst my father-in-law was undergoing delayed chemo this year (thank you, Newsom) before they were heavily mandated nobody suggested he wear them. Not even in the hospital!</p>
<p>Masks in a surgical setting are so you don't get spit and germs on people whilst you are performing surgery on them.</p>
<p>Masks are useless, and pretty gross. It is clear they do not do much of anything. Now, if we all wore N95s, sure - but cloth masks? Nope. It is a famous case of Do Something, Anything - and using them to blame people, NOT the government, for their terrible lockdown policies. 'You didn't mask up! It's YOUR fault you are under lockdown a year later, pleb!'</p>

        <p>Unless there is a different paper authored by Fauci than the one I have read, the paper did not attribute bacterial pneumonia to masks and didn't mention masks at all. As far as I can tell, that's false information spread on the internet. The paper explained how the damage caused by the flu led to deadly bacterial pneumonia and discussed how that should affect preparing for a pandemic flu, for example keeping antibiotics on hand.</p>

        <p>What I don't understand is why people just wear the mask without being asked to. The other day I went out bare-faced but kept a mask in my pocket as I expected to be confronted. Make them ask you to wear it. Make them enforce the rules. You're not going to get in trouble, the worst they can do is ask you to put it on or ask you to leave. The one time I wore a mask was to go to the doctor, and even then I didn't wear it until they forced me. I understand that there are some places where it's impossible to go without the mask, but how hard is it to just not wear the thing until you absolutely have to?! Why are people so willing to comply, do they actually like wearing it?!</p>

        <p>There is that one bar in Florida that started doing that policy and it got review-brigaded on Yelp. Yelp eventually had to remove most of the reviews and close off the reviews for that place for a while because of it. I reported many of those doomer reviews myself because most were clearly not people who were ever customers because they've been too long out of state</p>

        <p>&rt; I respect a private bussinesses right to enforce what ever rule they want. Such as refusing service to people who won't wear a mask. </p>
<p>they have no right to enforce physical harm on anyone and trying to deny service to people not wearing a slave muzzle is discrimination to the extreme.</p>
<p>also keep in mind, that the destruction of all smaller businesses is part of the agenda.</p>
<p>so the pedophile traitors want businesses to go bankrupt.</p>
<p>we should support the businesses, that respect our freedoms and i personally have never worn a slave muzzle since this nonsense started and i never will. i rather die!</p>
<p>of course draw a line, support the businesses, that respect your freedoms and shit on those, that don't. BUT don't excuse the criminal behavior of businesses in trying to mandate harm onto the public.</p>
<p>they are committing crimes trying to force those slave muzzles onto people. every business owner and every person working there following the criminal guidelines and trying to force others to put a slave muzzle on.</p>

        <p>Or we could end the plandemic. The virus is made in special machines called ribosomes and people carry it around and spray it in the air. If we stop the people who are doing this, no more plandemic! And then we'll prove the government's true colours, if they don't end the restrictions.</p>

        <p>You are telling me to wear a mask as a health young guy that takes vitamins daily, gets plenty of exercise, eats well, and most importantly - is not sick.</p>
<p>You want me to wear a mask not only indoors but outside too. All to placate your fears and paranoia for a virus that will not kill you unless you're an 80 year old with sepsis.</p>
<p>No, I do not sound ridiculous. Fucksake, I was watching footage of pilots in B17's getting blown out of the skies by nike missiles... Young guys doing this shit. No fear, no question - they just did it. You're afraid of a fucking flu. This is why  <strong>Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.</strong> Take a guess which phase we're in.</p>

        <p>We have sacrificed nine months of our life. As stated before, many people have sacrificed their jobs and businesses, some of sacrificed their sobriety, and others their lives entirely. The only ones that seemingly won’t sacrifice a thing are the hypochondriac shut-in’s that refuse to let life go on.</p>

        <p>Actually, respiratory viruses don't tend to transmit asymptomatically. If you are sick you can't spread it. Boom.</p>
<p>If masks worked we would see evidence of it.</p>
<p>Why do I, a young woman who had Covid and has a lung disease that makes my O2 intake lower than most people, have to wear a mask? I can barely breathe. It is hard for me. What about people with PTSD who have been silenced with rags? Abuse victims? Deaf people who can't lip read? People with autism? Fuck them all, amirite! MASKS FOREVER!</p>
