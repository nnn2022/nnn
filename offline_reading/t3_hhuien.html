    <strong>"New Normals" and self-fulfilling social prophecies – the power of new-media propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>I am moving what was my last sentence to the top: I am exhausted with all the futurists -- <em>every variety of futurist</em>, which I'll enumerate below -- and their attempts to manipulate me for their own benefit. I say fuck them all.</p>
<p>I think the creation of this sub with the name "NoNewNormal" is a small work of genius, because that phrase gets at the heart of the matter. Which is: why is there <em>such</em> overwhelming messaging in the media, for months now, about how topic X will "never be the same"? For now, I leave that as an open question, and address a broader point.</p>
<p>Understood broadly, almost every statement about the world (past, present, or future) made by someone with power is a form a propaganda. If that statement is accepted by the recipient as true, it moves them closer to a certain organized belief system or worldview. The power of low-cost internet-based media is astounding and unprecedented in its ability to serve up propaganda.</p>
<p>We seem to have gotten to the point where we really do, at some level, believe that certain people can predict the future. For some believers, it's scientific "experts" who are expressing ideas about the future that are well beyond their supposed domain -- that of repeatable experimental results. (Worse, even few of the soft sciences, those that relate more to "how to live", can even offer repeatable observations. Why listen to them about the future?) For others, it's American evangelical shysters telling their followers what's going to happen. For the money- and image-obsessed self-centered "pragmatists", it's celebrity rich people.</p>
<p>The new media is insidious with articles that, above all, want to "move" the reader by offering prediction as fact. Nothing in the text will say "this is a fact", obviously, but admit it: the subtext is always there. The subtext is felt <em>more</em> when it's a prediction that the reader has an emotional investment in, whether it's justification of current belief, or fear of departing from a current belief, or fear of <em>not</em> departing from a current belief. Etc.  </p>
<p>Subconsciously, I think we fall for it over and over again. We believe that certain sentiments about the future, after "receiving" those messages enough times, are already real. It doesn't matter how "critical a reader" we tell ourselves we are, because this stuff is getting deeply at our emotions. It's insidious, this effect, nobody can measure it, and few really understand how strongly it can affect the human psyche.</p>
<p>And it's happening to people in our societies at an unprecedented level. When the whole population is consuming this stuff -- these thoughts about the future that are presented as fact -- it has severe consequences on the collective psyche. People think the internet radicalizes us -- and so do I -- but they don't often or ever point to this dimension of it. The future is always already here.</p>
<p>If a nobody like me expresses a concern about the future, it's probably a "real", earnest expression of concern. But where did the concern come from? I for one have to admit that it likely came from reading years of incendiary predictions online. I have fairly recently admitted to myself that I have been propagandized into believing, for example, that the financial system will collapse sooner than later because <em>blah blah blah</em>. I am a very critical reader, but I still can't fight the collective weight of all the predictions I've read over the years that individually "seem to make a point", but collectively push that particular bit of futurism directly into my emotional make-up.</p>
<p>Futurism sucks and thanks to Twitter and other "platforms" (a term that came into use advisedly, don't you think?) almost everyone with any power or attention now is a futurist. Every act of futurism is an act of propaganda. Buzzfeed, Marketwatch, your favorite left or right opinion site. They're all the same in a certain way, telling you how the world will be. The people and institutions who are publishing it always have an agenda. Always. </p>
<p>Here is a fresh example of blatant propaganda, an extremist prediction somehow presented as if <em>already true</em>: "<a href="‘Travel will never, ever go back to the way it was,’ Airbnb CEO says">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/travel-will-never-ever-go-back-to-the-way-it-was-airbnb-ceo-says-2020-06-28</a>." Look at the words: "never, ever". Because of a virus just somewhat more dangerous than the flu? The language is so strong that you wonder what propagandistic purpose is being advanced. I leave the particulars of this futurist's agenda to the reader. (You'll note that this article be an example of a second-order prediction effect: this CEO runs a travel-related company, and you might think he wouldn't want to push this particular line of futurism because it seems like it would affect the company adversely. But his executive role is to predict the future, and so he's giving in someone <em>else's</em> prediction that travel in the future is going to be different. So he's showing how "prepared" his company is for the <em>predicted change</em> even though he himself <em>may</em> not have a direct interest in pushing the prediction. By this method, purely fanciful "predictions" become current belief and behavior. <em>Poof</em> The propaganda <em>worked</em>. This stuff is complicated but real.) </p>
<p>So I have no doubt that when enough of a society believes that some social/behavioral phenomenon will be true in the future, it is more likely to be true in the future. If enough people believe that "travel will be never, ever be the same", they have been propagandized into fearing, or in any case refraining from, traveling in the future.</p>
<p>In statistics and their use in science, you assume a null hypothesis: "nothing changed because of this". But this futurism, this propaganda, is always the opposite of the null hypothesis: it's the most extreme message that can be contrived. Whether it is intentional or not, this extremity damages us individually and as a society. We are letting a constant stream of futurism-as-"news" destroy us by keeping us in a constant state of uncertainty and vigilance. "Do I understand? Will I be able to survive and flourish the 'New Normal'?" (To be clear: the people in this sub <em>aren't</em>, or are trying not to -- that's kind of the point. But you know what I mean.)</p>
<p>NoNewNormal as a sub requests, as an ethical and psychological imperative actually, that we respect the null hypothesis. That we begin with it. Why have all the experts, all the scientists and their "rational" followers, all the rich people who either originate or echo the sentiments of the powerful, abandoned the null hypothesis over and over again regarding this pandemic? </p>
<p>Now look at the all the other pandemic-related subjects that have caught the attention of the false prophets who have powerful platforms. They are doing their best to write some future that benefits them in advance, they never have the interest of our society as a whole as their concern, and they ought to be shunned. </p>
<p>There are so many times that my best advice in this fucked-up society would be: "stop paying attention to people who don't mean you well, and just be present in your own local environment"--and when it comes to futurist bullshit, it's also what I think. Given the way we live now, it's easier said than done.</p></p>

        <p>I think you are making some terrific points here. Perhaps the other side of the coin is to ask the question as to why these predictions seem to fall on such fertile ground? I think that this may be because so many people are profoundly dissatisfied with their working lives at least, and perhaps life in general. I am starting to get the feeling that many people have welcomed this pandemic and the lockdown because at least they don't have to commute to the office and do their tedious 9-5. The idea of going back to the way life was is deeply unpalatable so any narrative that includes "things will never be the same" is seen as alluring despite the obvious, which is that it will be just like before, only a bit, or a lot,  more shit because the economy is broken.</p>

        <p>Some days ago I was going to reply, then left it.  </p>
<p>a) thank you, and b) you're absolutely right. I do wish people examined more often the many individual motivations that people have to "like" some of this stuff. </p>
<p>This essay was a real loose "way of looking at things", running up against tautologies and asking for simple retorts like "we have to think about the future so what do you suggest we do then", but I think there's a whole philosophy of the world in answer to that question. And it doesn't involve shoving extreme predictions at people for purposes of shock and control... cheers</p>
<p>But "travel will never be the same"... for example... I don't know who that's landing on. It's pure shock value driving that to the second-most popular article on the site at the time. Which, yeah, why posit agendas when you can say "eyeballs and money led to the piece", but power is about more than money.</p>

        <p>Excellent write up, OP.</p>
<p>Spot on.</p>
<p>It helps to soothe the mind to remember the majority of the population is 100 IQ or lower, and easily misdirected. There's not much intelligence being lost there, it's just frustrating AF when they double down in the presence of actual facts, reason, and logical consistency.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant.</p>

        <p>Ha. Yeah. And what I posted is also propaganda. I felt like I was close to triviality/tautology in various ways too. We need to imagine the future to exist just at an animal or slightly-above-animal level. But when we are doing so at a local, personal and community level, we are not engaging in futurology in the breathless modern mediated form.</p>
<p>I am also aware that the style of thought in this is so loose as to verge on the "conspiratorial" or paranoid. But I'd argue that the media environment we find ourselves in, here in 2020, makes truly independent thought about the world -- that part of the world that we <em>only know of through media</em> -- very difficult without examining motives in a very open-minded way. How can an intelligent person <em>not</em> look for the hidden? Look at the ridiculous things we know to be true of powerful organizations in modern times.</p>
<p>It's just a way to think about things, though, and I wanted to write something like that.</p>

        <p>It is theoretical that the corporations that run the world are deliberately attempting to transition society from post capitalism to a new form of economic structure. Obviously the world we live in is unsustainable in the long run, and I feel like extremely rich and powerful people/organizations would recognize this.</p>
<p>This is just a theory, but the overwhelming propaganda, which is a global phenomena, seems like it has an agenda which is unrelated to the virus. And the propaganda seems to be designed to destroy the service economy and keep people from congregating, and to do this for <em>an indefinite amount of time.</em></p>

        <p>Yes. They don’t want people to connect with each other and fight back. It’s kind of hard to make new friends with social distancing and masks. I even heard of hair salons in the UK that discourage people from talking to each other.</p>

        <p>Well written post OP. I believe that these “futurists” may have some inside information that they have to reveal to the general public. What they’re doing is predictive programming; priming people to accept the new normal. “Things are never going to be the same again,” because they won’t let them be.</p>
