    <strong>Covinfo Data Dump (July 24th 2021)</strong>
    <p><p>The following is a collection of useful/interesting data on the the Covid19 vaccines and potential alternative treatments:</p>
<p>Academic Articles:</p>
<p>Journal article from 2004 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2004/12/sars-vaccine-linked-liver-damage-ferret-study</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15755610/</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 shows evidence that sars-cov1 vax caused ADE when subjects were challenged with different strain:
https://www.nature.com/articles/news050110-3#ref-CR1</p>
<p>Journal article from 2012 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov vaccine (can't figure out if they're talking about cov1 or 2):
https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672.abstract</p>
<p>Article explaining how ADE works in Sar-cov1:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Article explaining the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Another article that speculates on the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920233/</p>
<p>Article from 2021 explains that there is evidence that covid19 is able to kill macrophages by using antibody dependent mechanisms:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432407v1 </p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186</p>
<p>Article on how the Covid19 spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096999612030406X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Japanese article on how the Pfizer vax is associated with brain hemorrhaging (lending credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-021-00326-7</p>
<p>Article on how AstraZeneca is associated with blood clots in the brain (lending more credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840</p>
<p>Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs):
https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell:
https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines</p>
<p>Article with evidence that spike proteins do end up circulating in the blood, when they're not supposed to, they're supposed to be anchored on the cell membranes:
https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075</p>
<p>More evidence that spike proteins do not stay on the cell membranes but end up circulating in the blood. This study aims to explain the blood clots caused by the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca adenovector vaccines, they claim that the DNA isn't properly spliced and the spike protiens end up in the blood causing thrombosis when the spikes attach to the ACE2 receptors of the endothelial cells:
https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1</p>
<p>Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Ivermectin in treating Covid19:

https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902</p>

<p>OpenVAERS is a site that allows you to easily read VAERS reports and breaks down the numbers. The reports seem to be a lot of people who have comorbidities or are old, but there are also some really eye opening cases where young people experience horrible side effects. Read for yourself and make up your own mind about what the vax is doing to your fellow Americans:
https://www.openvaers.com/openvaers</p>
<p>Analysis on the VAERS death data shows that in 86% of reports the vaccine cannot be ruled out as a causal factor in the death of the patient:

<p>Know your rights, the compromised U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has ruled that employers CAN require vaccination as a condition of employment (this ruling will have to be challenged in a court of law, so do not approach your employer with the false attitude of having the higher legal ground, they will likely dismiss you since the EEOC is backing tyranny):

<p>Pfizer are criminals who plead guilty to misinforming the public about side effects to their drugs and bribing doctors. They paid 2.3 billion in fines:

<p>And of course, J&amp;J is trying to use shady tactics to avoid paying those fines for their baby powder:

<p>Moderna has never been able to get a drug or vaccine approved by the FDA, they were chosen by Trump because thr CEO said they could get their experimental gene therapy vaccine made in the fastest time, no animal trials were done:

<p>Moderna executives sold tens of millions of dollars in stock in Sept, a couple months before deploying the vax to the public. Why would they sell off right before their big success? Did they know the product was garbage?:
