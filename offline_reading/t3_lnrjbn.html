    <strong>Royal Society - Let's pretend to be concerned about vaccine passports and have a phoney debate about whether we're going to introduce them or not</strong>

<p>&rt;<strong>Covid vaccine passports could discriminate, experts warn</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Covid-19 vaccine passports are "feasible" but not until we know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said.</p>
<p>&rt;And they have the potential to discriminate against the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons.</p>
<p>&rt;This must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report.</p>
<p>&rt;It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan.</p>
<p>&rt;The criteria include having a way of accommodating "changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants".</p>
<p>&rt;And a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws.</p>
<p>&rt;The 12 tests outlined by the Royal Society recommend that a vaccine passport should:</p>
<p>&rt;- meet benchmarks for Covid-19 immunity</p>
<p>&rt;- accommodate differences between vaccines in their efficacy, and changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants</p>
<p>&rt;- be internationally standardised</p>
<p>&rt;- have verifiable credentials (you can prove someone has been vaccinated)</p>
<p>&rt;- have defined uses</p>
<p>&rt;- be based on a platform of interoperable technologies (ie on different operating systems like Android or Apple, and on different devices like phones, tablets and offline)</p>
<p>&rt;- be secure for personal data</p>
<p>&rt;- be portable</p>
<p>&rt;- be affordable to individuals and governments</p>
<p>&rt;- meet legal standards</p>
<p>&rt;- meet ethical standards</p>
<p>&rt;- have conditions of use that are understood and accepted by the passport holders</p></p>
