    <strong>Anyone else enjoy Doomer Hate?</strong>
    <p><p>Depends on the day, how I’m feeling. Sometimes it gets under my skin how all these wackos cling to their totalitarian fetish which is ruining all of our lives. Other times, like now for some reason I can’t stop laughing. Filled with joy at how ridiculous these virtue signaling sycophants sound, because I just feel optimistic that what if we win? How will they backtrack? How quickly will they try to adapt to what’s considered “normal”? I’ve heard that the first half of 2021 is our last opportunity to take back our freedoms, and this golden window of opportunity still remains open. The joy will eventually sour into rage I’m sure, but for now I’ll enjoy it. If we win, mark my words, I will be relentless in mocking every single slogan and idea they used to justify this tyranny. There will be no remorse for those who wanted to take everything for us. Perhaps already the rage is showing through, it may be a mix of emotions. How do you react to Doomer Hate?</p></p>

        <p>I am more upset at the government and even moreso at the media for conditioning them that way.  </p>
<p>I don’t often visit the sites of major news outlets, nor do I watch cable tv.  Sweet merciful crap! - I visited a news site to find out about a missing hiker and I could not believe what that site had turned into.  You would think that there is no other news happening in the world beyond covid.  And the same with tv! My god! I watched it a few days ago and it almost felt like satire - I can’t believe what commercials have become! And some tv shows! It’s covid 24-7!</p>
<p>So, I can only imagine what could happen to someone’s mind if they were consuming that on a regular basis.  I’ve seen it happen to friends and loved-ones.  Covid worshipping zombies! Imagine if everyone turned off their tv and phones for a couple of days?</p>
<p>Anyways, my point is - yes, doomer mentality frustrates me to no end - but feeding into their desire for a fight is futile.  It has become more satisfying to ignore them.</p>

        <p>I feel a lot of pity for them and sometimes it's kinda sweet. It's like when you see an autistic person screaming for something that is not there. That kind of compassion. I don't feel angry anymore for them, just a lot of pity.</p>
