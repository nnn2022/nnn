    <strong>How many of us started on the other side?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m curious as to how many of us here actually started out on the other side. Meaning we took this very seriously at the beginning of last year, but slowly and gradually realized it was mostly bunk.</p>
<p>In late February 2020, I was already one of the guys saying “we need to stock up on supplies”, “we need to buy some masks”, etc. </p>
<p>But within a month or so, even though the media and reporting got worse and worse, my own research/digging didn’t bear any of it out. People weren’t dropping dead in the streets. The mortality rate was incredibly low. No one in my circles caught or succumbed to the virus. None of the numbers added up. </p>
<p>Then the mandates and restrictions got worse, for a virus that didn’t seem to warrant them. And I wound up here. How many others had a similar trip? Or were most of you skeptical from the start? Just curious. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>I started on the other side. I used to believe in masks and Lockdowns when this started. I thought it would be two weeks and then back to normal. It then turned into two months and three months... I  think many people who support the "New Normal" do it out of the sunk cost fallacy.</p>

        <p>they also do it because they dont have real responsibilities. Noone with bills to pay and a job to go to wants more lockdowns. Thats why celebs dont give a shit and are taking advantage of this to stroke their ego by telling us plebs to mask up and stay home while they get caught going to other countries having the time of their lives. Blows my mind how we just sit there and take that shit.</p>

        <p>I bought a ton of food and stuff at the beginning of the year. I was certain we were going to go into complete martial law. I was terrified that my parents would get seriously sick.</p>
<p>I never really trusted the masks, to be honest. The CDC doing a sudden 180° on that made me sure that it was a complete crock of shit. And then the lies kept piling up. Now I'm at the point where I have trouble trusting any of the data we're given.</p>

        <p>I trust what I experience and what I see for myself. And what I'm seeing, here in Florida, is that people aren't dropping dead and those I know who catch this recover and say it's just like the flu. I've hung out with people sans masks many times and I'm fine. Went to Fun Spot without a mask, albeit many others were in masks, and I'm fine. I trust natural remedies and other proven beneficial medicines. What I won't trust is what the govt says, media says, or billionaires with a motive says</p>

        <p>I don't believe I ever bought into it because I still had to drive to work everyday. I wasn't even that nervous or anything. I'm a calm, optimistic, extremely happy person. </p>
<p>I was given an "essential worker" note from my director to keep in my car. That was surreal. Driving along empty highways was surreal. I only bought (thin, cloth) masks because I hated the free blue ones at work. I had a full panic attack at the thought of wearing one over both my nose and mouth. I sobbed hysterically in my manager's office and I have never acted like that before. I don't have panic attacks. He told me to take it off my nose as much as I needed to. </p>
<p>I did grab a month's worth of groceries because I was nervous I'd have to quarantine for two weeks. I never thought I'd die. I'm 40 but was about 100lbs and very fit. I gained 20 fucking pounds from stress eating and drinking. </p>
<p>This pandemic turned me from a person who didn't think about the government into someone who doesn't trust a single word I see or hear from government or media. </p>
<p>It's a weird place to be.</p>

        <p>I never really started on the other side. I thought this was going to be like SARS and mainly hit Toronto (which was partially right, although a bit more cases came to the rest of Ontario than I thought). I laughed when my Mom gave me a mask and gloves in case I needed them. I laughed when I saw Dr. Vera Etches talking about the virus on the Ottawa news, since it just sounded all a little over-the-top. Some of my family members were on the pro-lockdown side and have now come over to "my" side. Now my Mom doesn't like masks after being forced to wear one at work for months.</p>

        <p>I will never blame anyone for being scared at the beginning of this. I wasn’t for lockdowns but I was certainly concerned about coronavirus. The place I work at took a break for a few weeks while we were all monitoring the situation but we went back soon enough. Around mid-May I’ve realized it’s bullshit.</p>

        <p>I was 8 months pregnant in March... I had a total break down at work when a friend got the last flight out of Spain and was describing what was happening there. Almost cried in front of a room full of seniors in high school. Had my baby in April, followed everything, including making my mom wear a mask during her watching my son while we were at the hospital. It all changed when we thought the baby was deaf and had to get testing done in Boston and my mom was my rock. I told her to take her mask off... we were not wearing them for our road trips. Never really looked back around my family and friends. I have to wear one at work and to be admitted to stores... but I have moved from being frozen in fear to my children need to have lives... and honesty so do I.</p>

        <p>I didn't leave the house for the first two weeks and wiped evything down that came in with Lysol wipes. A few weeks after that the Canadian government started the first steps of their disarmament. After that it became abundantly clear that their will never be a new normal.</p>

        <p>I only freaked the fuck out because all my decade-old knowledge about the intentions of the establishment and shit hitting the fan in 2020 came back to mind. I'd gotten complacent, allowed myself to forget. I bought a ton of food and supplies because I knew there was a high likelihood of mass, total lockdown. At least where I'm at, that hasn't come to fruition.</p>

        <p>And it probably won’t happen unless things get really bad but at that point the government will probably be non functional </p>
<p>People seem to watch way too many movies and base these sort of incidents on that and it real life.</p>

        <p>I was on board when the schools were closed for a few weeks with a strongly implied reopening date, and when it was allowing private businesses to require a face covering.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I pronto switched when it turned into the schools never reopening, masks are now required everywhere, companies are getting multi-million $ contracts for created scenarios, the small businesses were being slaughtered and every media company started each hour with a "Covid Report".</p>

        <p>I was on board at first and observed the first UK lockdown to the letter. Inconvenient but necessary and short-term as I understood it. Got furloughed from work and was told redundancy was likely not to be on the cards. Got made redundant at the end of May and was extremely put out by it. Wasn’t happy that it had been allowed to come to this but still didn’t quite believe it was anyone’s fault. Then:
-BLM protests being cheered on by “right-thinking people with no mention of the pandemic. 
-Sophie Raworth (newsreader) referring to this as the “new normal” on BBC News, demonstrating to me that we were expected to just accept this indefinitely. 
-Footage of Trafalgar Square protests in September with interviews with people there who made a lot of sense, concerned about their businesses and children and calmly explaining their stance made me realise that you don’t have to be a conspiracy nut to see the problems with these measures. Then the way they were attacked by police and told they deserved it by most media that bothered to report on it. 
-Sanctimonious trolling attempt from r/madlads (giving everyone a Wearing is Caring award) brought me here. Found out about a protest march in London in October, went along and realised I was among my people!</p>

        <p>I had been a libertarian for at least a decade before all of this started so I pretty well already didn’t trust anything the government or their MSM propaganda wing were saying. Hopefully this whole scam pushes some people slightly closer towards libertarianism (ignore the libertarian political party though, it has historically been a joke).</p>
