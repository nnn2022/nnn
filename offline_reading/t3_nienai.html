    <strong>Denied visiting my dying father</strong>
    <p><p>So my dad passed away back in October. Wasn't covid. He had a lot of health issues. He went to the hospital because he lost the ability to walk(bad arthritis and diabetes caused substantial swelling of the legs/feet) and was diagnosed with a lung infection instantly(don't remember what exactly) and then his organs all started to fail. Them he got diagnosed with cancer. All within a few days. 
Because covid we weren't allowed into the hospital. Only his girlfriend was allowed. My aunt managed to get through but she's a battle axe so I'm not surprised. I live 2hrs away and don't drive, so I got a ride with my sibling and tried to get in anyways. We got through the front door. The nurse working there was very nice(probably because we were visibly distraught and had flowers lol)
So we get up the the sector my dad is in. The nurses ask us our names and relation and blah blah blah. They say that they're not allowed to let anyone in but the spouse(girlfriend, who I may add is a major fucking BITCH). I'm pretty much like yeah whatever fuck it. But my sibling is pleading. Saying how it's not right my aunt and my dads gf can see him but his own children can't? They tell us we need to leave. So we stupidly do.</p>
<p>The lireral next fucking morning we get a call that it's bad, he doesn't have much time left, so we're allowed to come see him one last time. When we finally get into the room, my dad is a swollen mess. His legs are splitting and bleeding from being so inflamed. His eyes were rolling to the back of his head while he was moaning in distress. He kept sounding like he was calling out for help, raising his hand up in the air really abruptly. Eventually watched him take his take his last breath. </p>
<p>So wtf? What is the reasoning behind this? Why would you only let me see my dad when he's so fucked up that he can't even communicate. Why not the literal day before when I spoke to him on the phone and he was still there. I'll never forgive myself for not marching my ass past that reception desk and talking to my dad one last time.</p></p>

        <p>I’m so sorry that wasn’t not right. These people are pure evil. I’m always shocked at how little human compassion the branch covidians possess. The medical system is now a joke. Big hugs. I’m sorry you were not able to properly say good bye.</p>

        <p>I encourage anyone in a similar situation to defy the nurses and make your way in the room. You may face consequences but if the alternative is not being able to see a loved one alive one last time, isn't it worth it?</p>

        <p>Wow that's really heavy. I'm very sorry that happened to you. I wish you a really well emotional recovery from this. You didn't deserve to be treated like this from them. Your father deserved much better. Your entire family did.</p>
<p>Your dad is in a much better place rn. Hope he was at peace when he passed.</p>
