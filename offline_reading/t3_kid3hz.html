    <strong>Sars-Cov-2 infection rate?</strong>
    <p><p>Is there anywhere info about infection rate of sars-cov-2, meaning how many people[in percentages] get infected, given a representative sample of society. Let say you take a representative sample of 1000 people from society, meaning same composition of gender, age, race as in society and you then  expose them to virus, and note how many of them develop covid disease. Because everywhere where i look for that info i see only percentage of deaths. Seeing how poorly sars-cov-2 infect young people, one would expect that a threshold of herd immunity- roughly 60% immunity against covid is already achieved among population. If it's something even higher, then the point of mass vaccination seems pretty useless.</p></p>

        <p>They rarely talk about positivity rates, they just keep testing more and more people so they can keep reaching record new cases.  Right now they test about 2% of the population, so this nonsense has a long way to go.</p>

        <p>True hospitalization and death are hard enough, but thats where it gets really difficult, what is an infection, what is just a positive test.  Seroprevalence studies, which are more acurate, show close to 50% of the population in Japan was infected, so that seems important because they had fewer cases, I'd think it would be even higher in high case/death countries. On ships like the Diamond Princess and I think the Theodore there was at least 20% infected, but using PCR and timing of testing could skew true rates. A lot of studies show at least 20% all the way back in May(?) at least. Another issue I have with all this, especially vax, alot of the population was exposed, even if its not reached herd immunity yet</p>

        <p>&rt; 50% of the population</p>
<p>How many of these were asymptomatic and how many were symptomatic? Because even WHO told in june 2020 that asymptomatic carriers very rarely infect. This was common knowledge before COVID, especially for airborne/droplet diseases that asymptomatic carriers are rarely infecting others.</p>

        <p>Here's <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100k">this</a></p>
<p>It says about 5,500 infected and 100 dead per 100,000 people in the US</p>
<p>I found that link very easily by googling "covid infection rate per 100 000"</p>
