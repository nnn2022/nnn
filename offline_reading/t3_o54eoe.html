        <p>&rt;It's a "scarily fleeting" encounter between two people out shopping captured on CCTV that has health authorities in NSW worried.</p>
<p>&rt;The state's Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant described it as a "momentary" crossover at Bondi Junction Westfield. </p>
<p>&rt;The footage shows two people briefly walk past each other while out shopping â€“ both of them now infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr Chant suspects two other people were infected with COVID in the same fashion. </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that there's been three people that have been exposed on both June 12 and June 13," Dr Chant said.</p>
<p>&rt;"In one, we actually have CCTV footage of the encounter and it is basically a crossover of individuals. They are clearly facing each other but it is literally someone moving across from each other for a moment, close, but momentary. </p>
<p>&rt;"In two other cases, we haven't been able to, with CCTV footage, look at the exact same crossover point, but we know they were 20 metres [apart], signing in at different venues at the same time or in that area so we suspect they did cross over."</p>
<p>Why aren't people worried about this type of monitoring, this type of babysitting??  Why are we the only ones outraged??</p>

        <p>Of course no mention of how the individuals were identified and tested.. no commentary on the massive false positive rate of PCR ..</p>
