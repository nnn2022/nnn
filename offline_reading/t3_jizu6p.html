        <p>Nowhere? Airtravel is so unreliable. </p>
<p>I have one collegue who went to Colombia to profit off the cost of living while WFH. However, it's good only until the end of the year, he'll stop being canadian tax resident on Jan1, and the problems will start. He also spent about a month in Florida being stuck with little money on his way to Colombia, so I guess that situation costed him a few nerve cells. Also, it's not like Colombia has no COVID stuff, they are actually worse because their police has machine guns and no sense of humor.</p>
<p>I think it's too early to run. There are little to none no-covid-madness countries.</p>

        <p>Some countries just don't have many old people. If you are constantly in danger of getting cholera, it is very unlikely that you will die from flu or covid. Some countries don't really have a healthcare 'system', so there is nothing to 'overload'. Some countries have a different perception of death. People in the west are much more afraid of death than people in other countries.</p>

        <p>Thanks for making this comment. People are too centered around the values and problems of the industrialized world and have completely lost a sense of perspective.</p>
<p>If I was living in a developing country, I would be laughing my ass off at the rich Europeans and Americans scared shitless by a cough. As it is, I am a rich European and can only be ashamed of our selfishness.</p>

        <p>Honestly if trump wins I think I'm coming down there.  I remember four years ago when everyone was saying they'd come up here XD.  I have serious issues with the guy on many levels but he is the only one that has the audacity to bring some perspective on this or speak of being able to deal with it in a rational, positive way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our liberal government up here is arguably the most corrupt govt we've had in history.  Ontario had a provincial liberal government for 15 years that was also corrupt and is largely responsible for us having the largest sub-national debt in the world.</p>
<p>Seriously, I know Canadian news passes you guys by, but look at what I've mentioned.  Great entertainment.</p>
