    <strong>Being an "Essential Worker" is bullshit.</strong>
    <p><p>I work in a grocery store. I'm an "essential worker". While everyone else got a 2-4 month vacation, I was stuck in the middle of it. You're heroes! They cried, at first, and then the list got shorter. Actually, no, only doctors and nurses are heroes. Not teachers, not grocery store workers, and not your local trash pickup man. Oh, by the way, none of us get hazard pay. Why? Because there is NO HAZARD. It's just an excuse to work us to the bone. Our jobs got a lot harder, we took on a lot more, and for nothing. </p>
<p>Damn the antimaskers! They cry, while hoarding their +$600 unemployment. A bonus of what I make every two weeks working full time, overtime, while they sit on their asses. It's their fault! While they sit in offices and have zoom meetings. What, you want to treat yourself, after all of this hard work we've put you through? No, no haircuts, meals out, nail salons, pedicures...you're just a wage slave. </p>
<p>They're breaking the spirit of "essential workers". Blue collar jobs are essential to the economy and society. But they don't want us to have a voice, because they know we'd fight this tooth and nail.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed! Small businesses especially!! They worked so hard to get a business off the ground, fund it, employ hardworking people, and to have it killed by, effectively, a cold.</p>

        <p>Fucking hell.  Scamazon's control over every day life has become super apparent the last couple months.</p>
<p>Aside from all of the trucks everywhere, the dystopian commercials piss me off.  "It's like Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory."</p>
<p>What I heard is that they have the factories run brutally cold because the expensive robots can overheat and that takes precedence over human employees.</p>
<p>I also know one person who signed up for that and it sounded pretty shitty (she didn't last the day).</p>
<p>All hail corporate overlords though, better than getting sick.</p>

<p>While Amazon certainly isn't a saint, I can say as an employee this is not true. We have fans and that's it, and employees are allowed to turn those on and off as they please.</p>
<p>The only areas this may be true of are freezers, and there aren't any robots in those.</p>

        <p>I don't love them either and I do not like the thought of a world run by Amazon. I work for them because it's a job I can do and it's keeping me afloat.</p>
<p>They're really not different from any other warehouse job. The horror stories you hear have more to do with bad bosses than Amazon as a whole.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are essentially just privileged people having the working class grocery shop for them and deliver shit to them. </p>
<p>My boyfriend got a job preparing grocery pickup and delivery orders when his barbershop he worked at was closed. He realized like 50%+ of the employees were over the age of 60 because of the slightly better benefits and pay than any other retail work. Nothing like privileged assholes sitting home patting themselves on the back for “saving the elderly” while the elderly shop for and deliver your groceries for you.</p>

        <p>I assume he works for my company, considering the grocery pickup/benefits/pay. Not saying any names, as it might "spark" some issues for me, but does he also work under the strangely deity-ized ghost of Mr. Sam? </p>
<p>And yeah. Our grocery pickup is worked like crazy, so that privileged "I'M wOrKiNg FrOm HoMe" assholes can be high and mighty about the fact that they never leave the comfort of their house or car. I'm in my 20s, but so many of the people I work with are older and were pushed out of their well-paying jobs for the 'Rona.</p>

<p>Seriously. So many lazy people got to collect more money than I make in a regular work week for sitting on their asses and/or rioting in the streets, while I dutifully went to work and did my fucking job the entire time.</p>

        <p>Don't know why doctors are called "heroes." Isn't it them who pronounce every death as being from their great god scary virus, and also religiously push their new god onto others? (there are some good ones somewhere, but the corrupt ones are doing heaps of damage) As this scary virus hysteria continues, I find myself hating medical establishment more and more. What gives them the right to push their hideous religion unto others who would have none of their rabid doomer hysteria. The whole "medical" thing needs to be tipped upside down and given a good shaking: watch all the stolen money fall out!</p>

        <p>Very good point!! And there is the interview with the Epicenter Nurse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ</a> who indicates that "the system" was deliberately funneling low income people (with no relatives) into the "scary virus" wards. Once they caught the "scary virus", they put them on ventilators to ensure a nice high number of "scary virus" deaths. There must be a special place in hell for these Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele types! The much touted 200K "scary virus" deaths could also be blamed on "medical errors" as ventilators kill people with the "scary virus". Many better doctors say that there are treatment protocols where nobody needs to die, but the system seems to deny those treatments to those who might benefit. The whole thing is disgusting.</p>

<p>And now it seems like so many medical workers are all high on their “front line heroes” titles, I’m sure they’ve sprained their arms patting themselves on the back. They’ve turned into know it all snobs that think they’re better and smarter than everyone else.</p>

        <p>I completely understand you my dude and I wholeheartedly get everything you are saying! I am an "essential" worker too (every job that puts food on the table should be considered essential btw) and have been working home since March and the amount of work that I've had to do has gone up dramatically. I work in IT and support end-users with any issues that are going on so they will be able to perform their job tasks. I am thankful to have a job but I do agree that they are trying to make it more and more difficult for small business owners and even anyone that is trying to make a living</p>

        <p>This is my situation. I've worked at home since 2007, and can't understand the   need for grocery pickup. I <em>have</em> to get out, or go crazy, so why don't I shop my own groceries myself? I use the self check out, because all I see at the grocery are half as many workers running twice as fast to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>If they are going to halve the amount of essential workers, the stayathomes should be able to help out by carrying their weight by helping out and not being an extra burden.</p>
<p>I can't imagine staring at four walls all day after work is finished. I've been walking though cemeteries just to go somewhere. They closed our local park and only allow ten people in at a time- <em>in a 200 acre park</em></p>
<p>My husband is an essential leave the house worker- even he has to get out somewhere, or also go crazy, but they've shut everything down that would provide respite from the boredom of being a slave.</p>
<p>I'd think people would like the change of view, but I guess not.</p>

        <p>I'm an "essential worker" too, but we've been treated worse than ever since the pandemic started. Included having our jobs threatened if we're sick but don't come in to work. And all we work is parts for planes that are getting parked and not used.</p>
<p>It's pretty hilarious actually, HR gets to call people up from home and threaten their jobs if they don't come in to work. They would be the first to cry if they had to come in to work and someone was coughing in their office though.</p>

        <p>My husband works retail.  Back in March, he was scared to go to work, but he did so anyway.  And, funnily enough, among his network of coworkers and acquaintances working within the same strip mall, not a single worker died.  There was no "mass deaths" of "essential" workers.  And this was before the "all-powerful" masks.  And while he's decidedly anti-lockdown and knows what the IFR is, he's still pissed off that at the beginning the wealthy got to hide away at home while he had to work, because he knows that the wealthy viewed the virus as deadly to everyone and thus considered he and his coworkers to be expendable.</p>

        <p>Fellow retail worker here.  Sometimes I still get people thanking me, and while outwardly I just say "your welcome", inwardly I'm just like, thanks for what?  I'm just doing my job.  I'm here because I need money.  I didn't do enough college and never went anywhere with what I did so I ended up here.  I'm no more a hero than you or anyone else.</p>

        <p>"jobs got a lot harder" is so true. I can't imagine wearing a mask for 8 hours while dealing with paranoid/asshole customers who no longer see people as people... not that customers ever saw retail workers as people in the first place.</p>

        <p>Does anyone have any info on the US labor laws for people who wear a costume? I am not saying that a mask is as cumbersome as the Mickey Mouse head. Obviously, that head is at least 20 pounds and must be taken off every hour or else the worker would not be able to greet the children. But since I feel like I am wearing a costume, there should be labor laws on costume comfort.</p>

        <p>Essential worker here. In group homes for special needs folks... My workload has increased due to staffing shortages. I've worked numerous 24+ hour shifts. It's all good. There's nothing else to do and I'm making money... What's not good is the increase in aggression and self-harm from the clients who've had their lives interrupted by this. Sorry, no you can't visit your family. No, you can't have visitors. That one thing that gives your life meaning? Can't do that any more... All those rights we've been telling you you have? Nope... I've been attacked more in the last few months than in my entire 10+ year career </p>
<p>But I'm an unempathetic, murderous asshole though. At least according to the shut-ins who haven't been out of their houses long enough to notice the lack of dead bodies piling up in the streets</p>

        <p>I worked at a restaurant the entire time. During the shutdown takeout was INSANELY busy. Now that we’re open it still gets insanely busy plus having a dining room open we can barely keep up most of the time. We are worked to the bone for these stupid DoorDash orders we don’t see any tips from since they all go to the drivers. Fuck DoorDash Uber eats and the rest.</p>

        <p>We have a popular local restaurant in our store, and I agree, fuck Doordash. It's a franchise and the couple that runs it is old and takes days off or leaves early if they're overloaded. I've had so many of the drivers HARASS me over them not being there, telling me to demand they come back in. They're tired and overloaded and this is their business. Let them rest. I feel for you guys, you're in it just as deep as us.</p>

        <p>I'm sure you'll be happy to know I did. As did many of my coworkers. Totally sucks! The two week quarantine wasn't fun. :( But I got over it (so did my coworkers! Most even had less issues than I did), I had a scratchy throat and some congestion for a few days. I wear a mask at work, by the way! And it's the only place I go outside of the house. :) So, uh, how is asking me to recatch it justified by the fact that I'm an essential worker, the backbone of the country right now, for asking for better conditions and being tired of what we're dealing with?</p>
