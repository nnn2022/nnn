        <p>there you go !! see, it's possible to debate properly.. as you can see, I'll be employing socratic method.. people who are vaccinated loved human interactions too, that's why they want to get over this as soon as possible, together. they require community to play ball (look at new zealand, masks off after zero community case).. now those citizens, the leaders and scientists are the guys frantically telling people that the ship YOU are on is heading towards iceberg while everyone on it is being speculative about the vaccine. would that be a valid angle too ?</p>

        <p>It would be valid POV if it wasn't completely a fairy tale spun by the puppet masters and exactly what they want you to believe. I'm not heading towards iceberg because of covid, man. Cmon. You know the disease isn't even dangerous to people under 80. Average person who has died with covid is over the expected life expectancy.</p>
<p>What's not exceptional about these times is not another flu virus. There are millions of bugs and novel ones as well (not before identified) from time to time. I mean there are many many new big animal species indentified every year, so why not viruses or bacteria? The exceptional of current times is the boldness our tyrants are using to toss literally the whole world around. (and on the another side of the coin the absolute weakness of character of the common man). Use your perception, man.</p>

<p>oh no no no, we're not talking about the people that're dying. we're talking about life either back to the old way, or the new normal, not the NNN that you're afraid of, think New Zealand (something like that <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/new-zealand-welcomes-back-rugby-with-packed-stadiums-after-country-eradicates-coronavirus/">https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/new-zealand-welcomes-back-rugby-with-packed-stadiums-after-country-eradicates-coronavirus/</a> )  </p>
<p>&rt;and on the another side of the coin the absolute weakness of character of the common man). Use your perception, man.</p>
<p>again, perception.. know that it's possible pull through this one, is it not possible that perhaps refusing to mask up, or be vaccinated is a weakness of men ? time to think a bit, polio/ measles  is almost eradicated due to vaccine. we would still have that around of people refuse to be vaccinated back then. </p>
<p>no, covid may not kill you, but it still kills. covid may not be lethal to you, but it is to the economy. not only the states, the entire world is affected.</p>
<p>&rt;It would be valid POV if it wasn't completely a fairy tale spun by the puppet masters</p>
<p>i could say the exact same thing. if Q is real and he flooded the mistrust and misinformation of covid vaccine, wouldn't he (or someone like him) be a puppet master too ? how'd you differentiate someone like him to the puppet masters you're referring to ?</p>

        <p>Oh, the king regrets it? I am sure useless, privileged, unelected descendant of a French turncoat is not only qualified to talk about the issue, but also has the best interests of his loyal subjects in his heart. You can count covid deaths different ways, but Swedish overall mortality according to Euromomo is not remarkable and definitely lower than many of the locked down countries. Same with South Dakota - New York and California have worse mortality rates, as well as much more alarming socioeconomic situation. The anti-lockdown argument does not have to prove that mortality is lower for every non-locked country, it merely needs to say that lockdowns, on average, don't matter.</p>
<p>&rt;well, aren't you glad you're dealing with the weaker version instead of the actual thing ?</p>
<p>Acceptable losses? My point is not to religiously consider vaccines the divine blessing or the mark of Satan, but simply to think before doing something, not give the unlimited power and blind trust to people who don't deserve them and probably use inactivated vaccines.</p>

<p>More difficult in the sense that you have to be Tom Hanks or similar tier of celebrity/elite class to access your right of movement. If you are a peasant - tough luck.</p>

<p>we're not really talking about the effectiveness of lockdown are we ? you really want go through this ? </p>
<p>lol, you sure hate the king.. but here's another Swedish civil servant and physician specialising in infectious disease. Anders Tegnell, the current state epidemiologist of Sweden who had key roles in the Swedish response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/architect-swedens-strategy-regrets-not-imposing-tougher-lockdown/">REGRETS NOT LOCKING DOWN</a>. why is that so ? because.... <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249732">a 9-week lockdown in the first half of 2020 would have reduced infections and deaths by about 75% and 38%, respectively</a> . </p>
<p>&rt;but Swedish overall mortality according to Euromomo is not remarkable and definitely lower than many of the locked down countries</p>
<p>well ya, if you compare apple to oranges sure. like china, lockdown did a better than countries with no lockdown. so ?</p>
<p>do better comparison, similar ones... like how <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53498133">more than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic.</a> </p>
<p>so you see, with proper source and citation could empirically refute all your points.. which proves that you either pluck info from thin air or didn't even bother reading up before talking about a subject. in a way, even that "useless privileged" individual had more sense than you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293850/">lockdowns do work.</a> <em>This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob &rt; .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown.</em></p>

<p>&rt;If you are a peasant - tough luck.</p>

        <p>What country had a success with a 9-week lockdown? Because to me it looks like lockdowns without an end. What even would be the mechanism by which this lockdown with a definite end accomplishes its goal, if after it any viruses will spread anyway? To claim that this perfect lockdown from an abstract model world would have saved n number of hundreds of thousands of people is akin to claiming Trump's travel ban saved 2 million lives. Tegnell's suggestions are much more in line with the position of focused protection, where people that wish to isolate themselves are given the ability to do so, not the absurd curtain restriction of freedom, where industries and services have to function somehow anyway since people need to eat. No data coming from CCP is reliable, so bringing up China is pointless. Since different countries have different criteria of what is counted is covid death, indeed, comparing their covid death numbers is akin to apples and oranges. Lockdowns are supposed to save lives, yet lockdown intensity is not correlated at all with overall mortality, which is independent from these rather subjective criteria. Counter-examples are many: Argentina, Peru, Czechia, Spain, New York on the one end and Florida, Belarus, South Dakota, Sweden and various African countries on the other. "The border is currently closed to almost all travellers to help stop the spread of COVID-19.", says the site, so what is the point of attempting to fly at the moment into the country that can lock you down even if it has 0 official cases. And there may be a lot of papers with a lot of numbers, but they don't explain why were BLM protests (not only in US, but in Europe too) in 2020 not correlated with cases, or similar-scaled protest in Belarus, Russia (Krasnoyarsk), India, or multiple different events which were supposed to trigger scary outbrakes, none, absolutely none of which has ever manifested. These protests are why I am on this sub, they have changed my mind about the situation, what could possibly change it back?</p>

        <p>The main reason why I don't believe data from China is because it makes no sense. Why doesn't virus enter back into circulation when the lockdown is lifted? And why should I trust the country which has its own separate totalitarian internet? Weren't they having these videos of people falling down in the middle of the street? Should I trust them too? How could I have any proof that China is lying if I have no possible way to verify any of their information? I can ask the same question: how do you prove they are telling the truth? Defending a fascist regime with a red coat of paint is truly a thankless task.</p>
<p>&rt;mathematical modelling. i'd take your word that it won't work if you have something similar done at the same level.</p>
<p>It didn't work! What do I need to prove? Where did it work? How it could have even worked if the basic premise doesn't seem to be sound - if it was, any protests and other large gatherings would have led to statistically visible changes in mortality or at least cases numbers  - and they didn't.</p>
<p>&rt;i've linked source that explicitly show that lockdown lowers transmission.</p>
<p>The source takes two numbers, covid cases - which could easily be exaggerated, underestimated, manipulated in any way; and days in lockdown, which is a very shallow and superficial metric to begin with, Slovakia and Russia are rather close on this graph and no way this reflects the reality of the situation. Regardless of the foundings of any paper, when I look at huge protests and don't see any epidemiological changes, I can safely declare this case closed.</p>
<p>&rt;"You may be able to travel to New Zealand while the border is closed if we consider you have a critical purpose to travel."</p>
<p>Keep proving my point further.</p>
<p>&rt;it has if you've read up.</p>
<p>I was specifically talking about the correlation with events, much dreaded by media, seemingly. No correlation has ever manifested. Especially with BLM protests.</p>
<p>&rt;hence the masks and safety management measures like social distancing.</p>
<p>This is my main question: how much further? How long are you going to do this? If new variant keep coming, that supposedly evade vaccines, how long will you tolerate being masked? A year? Two years? Your whole life? How many booster shots will you agree too? Where do you draw the line? Do you draw the line? At what point are you going to say "Maybe the government is not being entirely selfless while mandating all this stuff."? If this situation repeats, perhaps in a year, you mask up again? For how long again? Wait for a vaccine for a year again? Don't test it again? Booster shots again? Is it a sustainable way to live? Is it even survivable?</p>

        <p>&rt;there're still cases.</p>
<p>Then what's the point? Flatten the curve? What's the endgame? Lockdown forever?</p>
<p>&rt;show me proof</p>
<p>Governments tell me outrageous things that don't correlate with my experience at all, don't correlate even with other things these governments are saying. They keep saying that horrible catastrophe is happening and for a while I even allowed that it just hadn't reached me yet (I am embarrassed by my gullibility now). They say that in order to prevent the catastrophe I need to embrace fascism. Multiple evidence against that. Yet I am supposed to show proof that PRC somehow completely controlled the virus in just 9 weeks, even though in Argentina, Peru similar drastic measures had the opposite effect, while the starting situation was arguably more advantageous for them.</p>
<p>&rt;because there are things that totalitarian internet can't hide.</p>
<p>How would you even know? PRC is not totalitarian enough? I guess only DPRK is totalitarian enough. When the things get casually censored in US and Europe, it is indeed lucky that there is still available information that does not align with the official narrative, which is certainly not thanks to the government, but to the people who say what they think and not what they are told to think. No, I can't show any proof. Am I just supposed to trust CCP on their word? Because that's what is effectively being argued.</p>
<p>&rt;proof that covid numbers are manipulated.</p>
<p>I didn't necessarily say they were manipulated. Merely that they could. And that the government has reasons to manipulate them. However, the Portuguese justice systems seems to think they were exaggerated. If some countries consider any death within 28 days of positive test a covid death, their death numbers actually reflect the testing intensity, not the virus mortality itself. Deaths from fall of a ladder, motorcycle accident, of people with late stage cancers, deaths without any autopsies or investigations, deaths that look kinda like covid deaths without any tests, or even with negative tests - all were counted in the same table.</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext</p>
<p>Yes the paper from The Lancet. The one who had its papers recalled. This one won't be, I suppose? And from June 1 of 2020, before any results from large-scale protests came in, before the seasonality effect became obvious. The evidence has since moved on.</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/</p>
<p>There is already an upward trend on these graphs at November 3, as flawed as they are (For example, summer 2020 has more cases than spring, yet less deaths). They also show decline beginning in the middle of January, when appr. 20-30 million people in USA were vaccinated. What, apart from seasonal factors could be the reason for that, the same reason that led to decline in the deaths in the summer? And will there be an increase in the next autumn-winter again?</p>
<p>&rt;your point is that it's close, i proved to you it's opened. the border closing is them saying that you CAN go in even if it's closed.</p>
<p>I didn't understand any of that, to be honest. This looks like some Orwellian talk, where closed border means open border. If it is closed, that proves my point. If it is open with mandatory isolation and tests, that is not very different from other countries that had these demands and got outbreaks anyway.</p>
<p>&rt;no need for mask, back to old norm, but if things start to go bad again, mask up. is it that difficult ?</p>
<p>Is it just mask up or full-blown lockdown up? For how long? Forever? What if this paradigm fails as it did in South America or Czechia? Lockdown harder? Will you yield your freedom of movement and your human rights to your government forever? Doesn't matter whether your consider such situation good or bad, but it is defined as totalitarianism: control over every aspect of people's lives - where they go, what they wear, who they meet and even what they say. If you say this isn't too many rights to suspend, well, there are not many rights still left either. Are people to be treated like children from now on?</p>

        <p>Basically this person is a Nazi. "Fall in line" so we can all get back to "normal". That is REALLY what he is saying. Not giving us any information pertaining to why we should be afraid of the virus itself (which feels like the flu to the majority of people who get it). Literally just telling us that we need to "obey daddy" so he can live comfortably. I'm sorry, but im not a child and I won't be treated like one either. If you choose to get your experimental vaccine, that is your choice. Me? I don't take candy from strangers. Move along.</p>

<p>&rt;Not giving us any information pertaining to why we should be afraid of the virus itself (which feels like the flu to the majority of people who get it).</p>
<p>there are tons ! TONS of information as to where you should be worried about the virus. what'd you mean no ? what do you not know ?</p>
<p>weren't you young once, and your parents didnt let you have the extra candy or ice cream serving because it's bad for you ? what makes you think that you know what's best for you NOW, and that the gov isn't trying to let you harm yourself "accidentally" (though now it feels like willfully can be used).</p>
<p>you claim to not have information. how'd you make an informed decision if you don't have info about a virus ? or that if your info came from dubious sources.</p>
<p>&rt;(which feels like the flu to the majority of people who get it)</p>
<p>you seen a flu like that ever ? you seen a flu does that to italy ? flu has been on going for the longest time ever. since when do you see "a flu" crippled Lombardy like that ?</p>
<p>&rt;Me? I don't take candy from strangers</p>
<p>you've been soaking fake information and reposting them sweetie.... without knowing the full story. THAT is taking candy. you're hooked to a metaphorical candy so bad you didn't even realise it.. just look at the delta variant post you had. how much do you know about it ? candy don't exist in the form of a vaccine. candy can be everything you find delicious (and floats your boat).</p>

        <p>And I haven't answered anything about what you said because, to be honest, I didn't really understand what you were trying to say or ask. You asked me "you seen a flu does that to Italy?" I'm not sure what you mean. That covid killed approximately 0.21333333333333% of the population in Italy? The flu definitely is a similar %, yes. Of course, as the CDC has already explained, "Not all Flu deaths are reported. However, all covid deaths are being reported." So who really knows the truth when they admit that nothing is really being handled how it should be.</p>

        <p>oh man... where'd you get 0.2133% ? weren't you just commending how i have access to google ? don't you have too ? at one point in time, Lombardy's covid fatal rate is 18.3% </p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30099-2/fulltext</p>
<p>NOT 0.213% italy back then was 10.6% at its worst. that's italy, and that's lombardy. where'd you get 0.213 ? USA ? even the states stands at roughly 2.1% mortality. and no, not all covid deaths are reported as well.. and why do people keep harping on the low mortality. think. if i told you that a tornado is coming to hit your town, and only 0.2% will die. what'll you do ? strap in and take all precaution right ? will you take the chance that your love one will die ? say the tornado come and you live, what about the damage it caused ? who will be paying for all the injured ? </p>

        <p>I have to say... I think the previous poster meant how many people died in Italy of (with) covid, not case mortality rate. Seeing that Lombardy has 10.8 million ppl and had 11 377 reported deaths, that makes a mortality rate of about 0.01%. Hardly a black plague is it?</p>

        <p>that's not how you calculate mortality rate but okay..... can you imagine me saying that the passing rate of US College programme is 35% because only 1 in 3 us citizen has a degree ? you don't include the people without covid mortality is when you contract and die </p>
<p>i mean, you're not the person living there and may not be able to empathise. tbf, I'm not a resident either but I'm sure I have more empathy than you. that's why you're not a policy maker.. one doesn't usually wait till X% before doing something about it. Sweden tried to take that route. look at where it got them. regrets for the life lost. how're you going to answer for the family of the 11k? and remember, it's 11k BEFORE the measure sets in. the lockdown helped reduce the figure. what's stopping it from reaching 110k or 1 million without any preventive measure ? before answer, recap that the mortality rate in italy was 10%. meaning 1 in 10 people who has it will die.</p>

        <p>people who eat fast food don't die from heart disease. people that die from heart disease MAY have a bad diet. it may be heredity. it may even be other complication that may or may not be prevented. BUT, covid can be prevented. covid can be avoided, the same for measles and polio. </p>
<p>you don't go, car accidents kills X number of people yearly. there shall be no cars allowed next year. NO you have laws for DUI, speed limit, license, seat belts etc. i dont know about your state, but where i live, we constant reminder about healthy living, eat right, healthy meals, free workout classes/ sessions. encouraged step tracker for vouchers etc. all these are preventive. so yes i do, i see plenty of preventive measure. </p>
<p>oh and the covid deaths you see ? that's the lowered version due to the lockdowns, vaccine and mask mandates. something you're fighting against.</p>

<p>your argument should have AT LEAST a proposition, confirmation, refutation and peroration. all you have is "Research chronic lyme disease".  so what if i did ? what's going to happen ?</p>
<p>you should go research X because my point is supported by X. in X you can see Y. therefore Y is fake/ unsupported because X shows it to be so. therefore my point of Z is valid.</p>

        <p>Tell that to my body. Tell that to my positive labwork. Tell that to my kids who are losing their momma because I can't get the antibiotics I need. So you all can believe that Covid long haulers exist but not Chronic lyme? </p>
<p>THIS is why I don't trust you people! I'm living this shit and you don't know the hell I've been through. I had Covid. I would take having Covid every day of my life over Lyme. Every. Single. Day. At least I would get the meds I needed and Covid feels like a picnic compared to Lyme. </p>
<p>Lyme has caused 7 different autoimmune disorders in my body. My bones are literally breaking down. Most of the time, I am covered in hives. I can't remember my own name some days. I have all of the symptoms of MS without having MS. I have lesions on my brain. Some days my legs will stop working, so I have to keep a wheelchair close by just in case. My husband sometimes has to feed, dress and bathe me. I have terrible nose bleeds. The fatigue is debilitating. I met disability requirements at age 30 and haven't even been able to use my 2 degrees to actually work. </p>
<p>Now, my heart has a tear in it. I have developed Tachycardia, pulmonary hypertension and Atrial fibrillation. I'm breaking down so fast that I won't live to see my youngest graduate. </p>
<p>All because the same assholes who chose to put more emphasis on Covid (aka..THE FLU) for a POLITICAL AGENDA, are telling me they don't want to recognize my illness because it's too expensive to treat. </p>
<p>So spout all your crap here you want. I can give you real life, no media needed. No fake studies. Real life scenarios! Our Healthcare is now political. And you are ok with it. You use Google, which is censored. You are ok with that. You probably watch only your large media corporations which are owned BY THE GOVERNMENT and HUGE CORPORATIONS. This is not even a conspiracy theory. You can easily verify this. </p>
<p>Imagine going to a Walmart and having the employees tell you that Target is better. Better prices, better quality. Would that happen??? NO! Same thing with the news. They are owned by the same corporations and government who are pushing agendas. And you are eating it up. You are allowing that crap to cloud your judgment that you are not even willing to look at the other side. </p>
<p>You say we all here are brainwashed. If we were, we wouldn't be here questioning the very basic questions. If you took the time to read through, there is a lot of legit information in this forum. Sure you have to weed through some extremists posts. But there is information here that PROVES our side. I still have yet to find anything proving the other side. </p>
<p>You want to put all your stock into something that killed 
0.050421708860760% of our planet. That's on you. But why don't you just TRY to look into how many died in 2020 of Cardiovascular disease or cancer. Those numbers make covid look like a allergy attack. And what was being given out as treats to those who get the vaccine? THINGS THAT CAUSE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND CANCER! They are not dumb. They know this. How can you not make the connection? </p>
<p>Let me ask you this....if they found the cure for cancer, do you think they would be handing it out for free and signing you up for million dollar lotteries to take it? </p>
<p>Wake up.</p>

LOL if they do suffer, they would have done TONS of things to get to that stage. cancer is A MUTATION, it's not contagious. covid IS contagious, and healthy people can get it, cancer is genetic, you don't pass cancer around. you don't pass cardiovascular disease around. there are things done about both of them, and that's encouraging lifestyle changes. something that doesn't quite catch on in america given how you're leading the world in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-is-the-most-obese-nation-in-the-world-just-ahead-of-mexico-2017-05-19">obesity rate</a> . </p>
<p>&rt;Let me ask you this....if they found the cure for cancer, do you think they would be handing it out for free and signing you up for million dollar lotteries to take it?</p>
<p>to be honest, your comparison is dumb. sorry. covid affects people around the epic centre, cancer doesn't. if you have cancer, you will RUSH to take the cure, covid too, but there's a minority of you that'd be too stubborn to do so. that's why that's why only 181 million shot went out. but still, it's the 11th country with highest vaccination rate, so that's something. i'm glad there're still smart thinking individuals out there. oh, before you want retort on this smart thinking individual portion on vaccination, READ THIS</p>

<p>"Getting a proper Lyme disease diagnosis remains challenging because testing is often inconclusive, potentially leaving those impacted to suffer for weeks, months, or years before being correctly treated."</p>
<p>https://www.insider.com/celebrities-that-opened-up-about-lyme-disease-2018-11</p>
<p>"Despite some skepticism in the medical community, chronic Lyme disease is a growing epidemic in the U.S. This stems partly from the shortcomings of many of the officially recommended Lyme disease tests, which leave too many patients with untreated infections that then become persistent and debilitating."</p>
<p>https://igenex.com/tick-talk/what-are-the-symptoms-of-chronic-lyme-disease/</p>
<p>"Untreated or undertreated Lyme can cause some people to develop severe symptoms that are hard to resolve. This condition may be referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) or chronic Lyme disease (CLD)."</p>
<p>https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/lyme-disease/chronic-lyme-disease/</p>
<p>"What Causes Chronic Lyme Disease?
The CDC says 10% to 20% of people treated for Lyme disease develop ongoing symptoms. These can include fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and thinking problems. The symptoms can last more than 6 months.
No one knows what causes chronic Lyme disease. One theory is the infection damages tissues or alters the immune system."</p>
<p>https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/features/chronic-lyme-disease</p>
<p>"For some people, the symptoms of Lyme disease never go away after treatment. Now we have clues about why this happens, supporting the idea that "chronic Lyme" really does exist"</p>

<p>"Chronic Lyme disease is a nightmare. Here’s why it’s so hard to detect and treat. Tens of thousands of Americans may have it. But few are getting the expert help they need."
https://www.popsci.com/health/chronic-lyme-disease-treatment/</p>
<p>“In some cases, this is a debilitating disease that prevents people from having a normal life,” he continues. “And to make matters worse, some people in the medical profession don’t believe in chronic Lyme.”</p>

<p>https://www.globallymealliance.org/news/rob-thomas-marisols-14-year-lyme-disease-battle-like-weird-alien-inhabited-wife</p>
<p>“Most spirochetal infections of humans can be chronic and in the absence of treatment can persist indefinitely.” (Columbia University Medical School Scientific Conferences, October 23, 2009; National Harbor, Maryland. – columbia-lyme.org.)</p>
<p>https://fiveelementhealing.net/in-depth-healing-strategies-for-lyme-disease-new/#lyme-disease:-chronic-or-not</p>
<p>"However, in some cases, the infection can become severe or prolonged—what Hadid and many other people call “chronic Lyme.” </p>
<p>https://www.health.com/condition/lyme-disease/lyme-disease-symptoms-bella-hadid</p>
<p>"The most disturbing part of this issue is not how little the general public knows about Chronic Lyme Disease, but how much the general public thinks they know about it. With the CDC recently admitting that the number of people contracting Lyme is actually ten times what had previously been reported, making that number 300,000 cases or more annually, one thing is clear, Lyme is the fastest growing epidemic in the United States and possibly the world."</p>

        <p>It's the very REASON I don't trust the CDC anymore. When I learned who they are and how corrupt they are, I'm not trusting anything they say or do. </p>
<p>I've lived many years with this and it's ruined my life. All because THEIR protocol for treating Lyme is 2 weeks of antibiotics. Well...it's not enough. Every western blot test, every different lab test, every spinal tap...comes up positive for Lyme, still, 17 years later. But they won't allow my drs to give me the long course of antibiotics that are needed to get better. </p>
<p>Why haven't they developed a vaccination for Lyme disease, which is a world wide epidemic?? Look into that and see what you find. Look into Bartonella, babesia, epstein barr virus. </p>
<p>Then we can talk covid and this new vaccination. </p>
<p>Until then, I have nothing left to say. Because you have NO clue what millions of us are going through because of these people. Keep your eyes closed to it, but just remember..</p>
<p>Closed minds should come with closed mouths. </p>

        <p>&rt;You want to put all your stock into something that killed 0.050421708860760% of our planet. </p>
<p>wait, what makes you think that cancer research and treatment stopped just because of covid ? it didn't. your legs didn't stop walking just cause your hands carrying something. they can operate independent of each other.</p>
<p>second, where'd you get this number from ? covid affected AT LEAST 187 millions WITH lockdown, masks, and safe distancing measures on, what makes you think that it won't affect more, at least twice more without all those measures ? and at its peak, Lombardy faced a casualty rate of 18.3%. </p>
<p>18.3% who got covid DIED. how cruel do you have to be ?</p>

        <p>I've even inserted the link for you to refer to....</p>
<p>holysheet your math. lady, if say for example i tell you that there's a tornado coming to your town/ county, do you go "nah, that tornado will only kill 0.000001% of the entire world population, i don't need to do anything about it. at most it'll displace 0.00000001% of the entire world's household. I'll just let it be"</p>
<p>NO why ? because that's bad logic. you look at the people it has/ will affect. calculate according to how it'll affect you base in your geographical location, population size, and state's guidelines</p>

        <p>I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  Taking the prospect of travel away brought me in for the vaccine.  So far haven’t had any side effects at all other than the dull ache you get from every vaccine in existence.
I have been very skeptical about the impact of the pandemic from the beginning and was very much thinking that the virus was intentionally made and released in the beginning.</p>
<p>Now that we have the Delta variant and the black fungus associated with it, I’m thinking that anything could realistically happen if it gets out of hand. After all I’ve heard reports that this new variant spreads more easily.</p>
