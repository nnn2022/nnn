        <p>This has absolutely nothing to do with Liberty or Freedom. To make the argument about that is to miss the point entirely. It suggests that the COVID-19 is about Not-Liberty or Not-Freedom, when plainly it is about power. There is no POWER in Liberty or Freedom. (Put down the Gadsen flag, friend.) If you want to stop a coordinated power-grab, you cannot make Freedom, an inherently personal "ethic", the goal. You have to make it of a quality similar to what you're fighting against. What would that look like? Dunno, exactly, but something big. A state, a movement, based on Truth, for example. You could say "We, as an enormous population of aggrieved individuals, agree to come together under the banner of Truth and to extinguish those who use their power and money to serve Lies." It would have Power where individual liberty does not. Liberty leads to fracture. QED. It keeps failing. We have to figure out something bigger and better.</p>
<p>edit: Even a caged rabbit pines for freedom. We must do better.</p>
