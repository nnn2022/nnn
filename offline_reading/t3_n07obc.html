    <strong>Why does Reddit love the government and pharmaceutical company's now?</strong>
    <p><p>Before covid, most people were very right to be skeptical of government and politicians, along with pharmaceutical companies. Why would anyone blindly trust the people sending us overseas to die in pointless wars, the same governments who in the past approved Agent Orange, leaded gas, asbestos and a plethora of addictive drugs from pharmaceutical companies. The same companies that markup life saving insulin drugs by 800% are now above criticism and fervently defended by simple minded fools willing to take anything given to them like candy. Why do so many Redditors seem to think that our blind trust and obedience in these institutions is "following the science", or that doing everything they tell us to will get any of our lost freedoms back, and not just allow them to keep taking more in an effort to consolidate more power and control.</p>
<p>These are the people and groups we need to have blind faith and trust in? We aren't allowed to question the motives of these multi-national corporations or the bought and sold puppet politicians doing their bidding for them? How could anyone who claims to be smart or a believer in science and the truth be so misguided and gullible?</p></p>

        <p>He's actually the most hardcore government hating, GMBD, Libertarian Anarchist I know.  He literally used to hold "Libertarian Meetups".  He used to spend most of his day posting about how government sucks, and how it must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago he posted himself getting the vaccine.  </p>
<p>When I confronted him about this obvious conflict of interest he replied, "a broken clock can be right twice a day."</p>
<p>As if that was some sort of an argument.</p>

        <p>These people were never really thinking for themselves to begin with, but I think the thing that most emboldened this new breed of boot lickers was their absolute disdain for Donald trump. </p>
<p>He truly gave some people a real comic-book villain, someone they could despise and hate and wish death on without actually having to address the conflict between their banner of “tolerance” and their more aggressive instincts. To them, he was everything they were against, evil incarnate. </p>
<p>So when he started to make his opinion of this pandemic clear, a huge portion of people flipped the “orange man bad” switch in their heads and started to take the opposite stance on principle. </p>
<p>It was kind of the perfect storm for those calling themselves Democrats, because they could leverage simultaneously the social pressure of “protecting the population” in a pandemic, a public stance of “anti-racism” (how brave), and a fervent hatred of what is probably one of the most polarizing public figures alive. </p>
<p>You’ve heard some of the things people say. “500,000 dead because Donald downplayed this virus”. They saw him as the government at the time, and believe it or not, they think of voting him out as a revolution. They really believe they saved the country by replacing 45. Now the kids can rebel against the establishment by supporting the establishment, how’s that for Orwellian :\</p>

        <p>The thing that annoys me is Trump was trying to avoid the *virus craze * we now have.  He was trying to avoid working people into a frenzy.  A president cannot stop a virus anymore than he can stop any other disease.   I still don’t understand how they think they can hold him responsible for deaths caused by a disease because he didn’t want to terrorize people.</p>

        <p>Agree. </p>
<p>My (tangentially) related problem with Trump is that he thought the swamp was multi-term senators, house members and judges. He should have started by cleansing every bureau of any hires made/appointed during the Obama admin- that's where you end up with a death by a thousand cuts and bizarro, knee-jerk policy decisions that have no accountability. </p>
<p>In short.. he tried to cut the tip off the iceberg, and now we're here.</p>

        <p>Not just the Obama hires but also the Bush and Clinton hires.  And Bush 41.  And if I'm being honest, the Reagan hires (like Fauci!) should have been got rid of too.</p>
<p>Basically just replace the whole government.  It's the only way to be sure at this point.</p>

        <p>A lot happened last year. Between this race riots and a presidential election... They were all tied together whether people realize it or not. There has been a massive amount of propaganda and manipulation at a level no one has ever seen in our lifetime I believe. People weren't prepared for it and a lot of people are unable to think clearly and identify what is happening around them and to them.</p>
<p>I am in the US and I think for people here we have never had a government like what we are experiencing right now. Most people don't seem to be able to accept that their government does not have their best interests at heart. The people that see this are shamed and called a variety of names and written off as idiots. There is a lot at stake here for people who disagree and point out the abuse that is being inflicted on the general population.</p>
<p>I honestly think that most people are going against their gut instinct. I think a lot of them know something is very wrong here but they don't want to be uncomfortable and they don't want to be part of the real true resistance. It's too painful, it's depressing, it's a constant challenge, you risk everything. It's just easier to go along with what you're being told to do and support. The vast majority of people are cowards and prefer to keep their head in the sand and just hope this is going to go away on its own with no fight.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you, they racialize virtually everything. And it always sounds so dumb to me. The connections don't even make sense and people just accept it. What do you think is coming next as far as restrictions? I know we are about to be bombarded with  going from where a mask, stay in your house, get your vaccine or you're selfish Etc to if you're eating a burger and getting on a plane to go on vacation you don't care about your children's future or some crap like this.</p>

        <p>You don’t think that those pharmaceutical companies would possibly pay people (trolls, shills what ever you want to call them) to go on social media platforms and speak highly about their products do you?
Also if one takes a look at the propaganda / fear porn being spewed constantly by the media along with the censorship it really shouldn’t come as a surprise as to why so many people have their heads buried in the sand.</p>

        <p>I've never seen the type of propaganda like for this vaccine. It's REALLY bad. It might be worse than the push to try to make everyone hate Trump. Which is kind of ironic since the vaccine push started with Trump.</p>

        <p>The psychological workings of the vaccine propaganda become really obvious if whenever you see it you just mentally adjust the message to be something about entering a new war or the importance of being loyal to The Party.</p>
