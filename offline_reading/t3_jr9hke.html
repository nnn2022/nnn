    <strong>This shit</strong>
    <p><p>So I don’t know if this is allowed here so please redirect if not. This is long, so TLDR at bottom, on mobile, etc etc. anyway:</p>
<p>So I’m still in high school, and due to not wearing a mask (mental and physical health reasons, and common sense lol), I was forced into remote learning even though I don’t thrive in that model at all. But, there are things I have to do in person. There’s two people involved besides me. We’ll call them L And E. </p>
<p>So E is a teacher I see in person every week, and I see L every two weeks. This story starts with one of the meetings with L. </p>
<p>I walked into the room where L was and sat at the table, not in a mask. L knows about my reasons, so I thought we were chill. But then, I get up from the table and L instantly yells “MASK ON!” </p>
<p>“But I was just sitting at the table without one, the same distance from you as I am now...?”</p>
<p>“We’re following restaurant rules here. Put it on!”</p>
<p>“But L I have this medical exemption card right here that—“</p>
<p>“I see that. Now put it on. School policy.”</p>
<p>I put it on, but almost immediately sat at the table and took it back off. The next day I requested she talk to her supervisor, because she pulled the school policy card but I wanted to hear from someone higher than her if she was really in her rights to do that. She countered that she’d demanded E (who is a new teacher and who has not forced me to wear a mask whatsoever) to force me to wear one or she’d report E. </p>
<p>Tuesday came, and I went to see E. Straightaway she told me she wasn’t going to make me wear a mask whatsoever despite what L had threatened. So that was good. The day after that, L was overruled by her supervisor who told her she couldn’t make me wear one. You’d think that would be the end, but nope. L complained to her supervisor’s supervisor. That lady sent L a very very rigid medical exemption form that I’d have to complete. The problem? There’s only three approved reasons for exemption: asthma, autism, or other intellectual disorders. None of those apply to me and the district knows that. So I’m fucked and have to wear one.</p>
<p>TLDR: fought with my school district to try to exercise  my basic rights. Was denied and forced into wearing a mask.</p></p>

        <p>The beauty is you will always have the choice at the end of the day. Obviously at some point you make that choice based on how much resistance there is, but regardless it will, and always be your decision.</p>
<p>You can humor that energy by wearing it below your nose, or around your chin etc. But in all honesty, you are subservient to no man, and when tyranny becomes law, revolution becomes duty (not my words).</p>

        <p>it is allowed- They do not have the right to go against your medical condition.  Do it anyway and get your parents involved.  Also, contact your doctor and inform him or her.  The more people you get to call the school, the better.  Also, call the principal and give your doctor's name and number and then tell you principal that you're calling your doctor next to report the problem and that you've already contacted your parents.  </p>
<p>This is one of those times that you need to go over everyone's head and get everyone involved.   Schools don't like that kind of attention.  They will buckle.</p>
