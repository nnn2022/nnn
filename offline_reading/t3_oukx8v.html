    <strong>All the insane conspiracy theorists are ruining our genuinely good arguments</strong>
    <p><p>I'm talking about the people getting 666 out of vaccine numbers and talking about the devil and fucking microchips and mind control and whatever the fuck, Reddit obviously jerks off to that and uses it to further the vaccination argument, if you look at the sheep on the main page of reddit, all they talk about is debunked theories and whatnot of some insane vaccine conspiracy when in reality the majority of the people are against fucking authoritarianism, mandatory vaccines, lockdowns, companies not taking responsibility, suppression of alternatives, segregation and seperation of peope and things like that. You'll never see a post about that, it's another disgusting attempt to brand all unvaccinated people as insane mentally retarded conspiracy theorists so people wouldn't be associated with them and would just go with the trend and get vaccinated. Keep in mind that social media represents a small slither of the world, you aren't alone.</p></p>

        <p>So for those of us who have followed eschatology for decades we're supposed to just ignore the evidence at this point?</p>
<p>You have to understand many of us have not trusted the US government for decades and we knew from our studies that something like this was going to take place in regards to the orwellian reaction not only by the governments but by our society...</p>
<p>Personally I hope that we're wrong... But I'd rather be prepared than passive.</p>

        <p>The only problem with eschatology is that people have predicted the end times for about 2000 years.  Jesus even said<br>
&rt;Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom” (MATHEW 16:27–28).  </p>
<p>Problem is, the world continues to refuse to end.   But someone or other predicts it with regularity every few years.</p>

        <p>But at that point you look at the technological possibilities that were not happening in the past...</p>
<p>For at least 60 years we've always said hey this is coming up because only now can people be tracked easily...</p>
<p>If I'm wrong what does it hurt?</p>
<p>I might mention things here but I rarely do in my real life...
 it's 2021 if you haven't figured something out by now that's not my problem...
I stopped screaming from rooftops 20 years ago...</p>

<p>Well, only yourself. And that's fine by me.  Not to be cold, but I feel everyone should be allowed to make their own mistakes. So long as it doesn't impact others.   I don't have all the answers, I could be wrong.</p>
<p>But over history there have been a lot of people who have sold their belongings, donated to causes, fought and died in wars,  made poor financial decisions, and cut off family and friends because "the end is near".   This causes them some harm.</p>

        <p>How is it making a mistake?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like you have an example in your life and therefore your projecting.</p>
<p>I don't believe her things with my adult children I don't with my own spouse I stopped ringing up stuff and Sunday school decades ago cuz most of those people aren't listening...</p>
<p>And if I'm wrong as long as I've done what I need to do do my job to the best of my ability, pay my taxes, invest where I can whether it be in prep items etc...</p>
<p>I have not planned the way that I should have... Which would be purchasing land building A self-sustaining place to live...</p>
<p>So I will just hum along and do the best I can with what I have but you're not going to change my belief based upon people you've seen take it to the nth degree...</p>
<p>That's like saying that homeschooling doesn't work just because you know that one "weird"  family that did it poorly...</p>

        <p>Whoa.  Settle. </p>
<p>First of all, I thought I made it plain.  You do you.  I'm not trying to change your mind on anything.  I was answering a question "what does it hurt?".</p>
<p>Can we agree that holding a false belief can cause you to make a bad decision?   If you believe (and it turns out to be false) that kerosene and gasoline are interchangeable you might put the wrong one in your car and it won't run.  That's harmful.  It was caused by a false belief.</p>
<p>Now let's stretch that a bit. If you believe that the world will end in 5 years, you might pass up an investment opportunity that would not mature for 10 years.  Because, well why? The world will end before that.   If you believe that we will be given incorruptible bodies in 5 years, you might put off that trip to the doctor.</p>
<p>Or to my mind, the most dangerous, if you believe that events have been foretold by scripture and are immutable, you might not fight back against the forces bringing us down.  Why fight it, it's inevitable.  After the battle, Satan will walk freely on the earth for 1000 years.  Nothing we can do.  So why do anything?</p>

        <p>Right? If one doesn't believe the Bible, they are free to do so...just don't force us to stop talking about it!</p>
<p>Also, we never had the tech capabilities in the past to do what is happening now. What tech would enable the MOTB, social credit scores, MESH network grids, geofencing, central bank digital currencies, digital IDs and vaxxports? </p>
<p>People will always be in denial but we won't be coerced into joining their ranks.</p>

        <p>It's called a Motte and Bailey.</p>
<p>I have had the thought some of the more radical "conspiracy theories" were created by the establishment just to discredit the real arguments.  No one I know talks about microchips being injected; I've never met a flat earther.  These kinds of things.</p>
<p>If you want an interesting conspiracy, Qanon and these wild "conspiracy theories" which are obviously total nonsense were created by the establishment to discredit the real conspiracy theories, which are actually happening.</p>

        <p>Bingo. No one here follows QAnon, to suggest that is just a BLATANTLY OBVIOUS defamation campaign. We are just tired of government overreach, and want to go back to our normal lives. How do you honestly get QAnon from that? Lmfao. Lunatics trying to ruin our reputation.</p>

        <p>Correct. It's blatantly obvious to someone who sincerely wants truth that most of these fringe theories are solely entertainment fantasy. Hear it in things like the Nashville bombing was motivated by Reptilian alien theories and 5G immediately makes me believe they're covering something up.</p>

        <p>Very true. I'm personally not anti Vax, im anti covid vaccine. Never got a flu shot, never got the flu. I had covid, and didn't even know I had it until my roommate tested positive at work. I'm young and healthy. The more they push the vaccine the further they push me away from taking any of that shit</p>

        <p>Sure 1 month old shill account with two posts in the sub including this one, tell us more about what makes "us" look bad. </p>
<p>Microchips hidden in  the syringe is a red herring. </p>
<p>Vaccine passports leading to the mark of the beast is a rather obvious conclusion. The things don't do jack and yet here they are, literally going mad for people refusing it and and excluding people from society as predicted in a 2000 year old scroll. </p>
<p>Don't be surprised when it comes to some sort of on body vaccine passport for "security". Yes that may be a chip.</p>
<p>But you already know this.</p>

        <p>I disagree. </p>
<p>Not because I agree with the conspiracy theories, but I don't think it ruins the arguments. </p>
<p>When people point to the most extreme in a group, it's a tactic used to dismiss something they don't want to admit to. They'd find a new reason to dismiss us without them.</p>

        <p>People need to stick to the real hard facts when discussing these vaccines. There's enough real data to support that the vaccines are dangerous and don't work, we all need to just stick to the facts. That's how you win an argument, you don't start talking crazy ass shit like "being magnetic" or "Satan in the vaccines" </p>
<p>Start saving articles and scientific journals to back up your arguments as well, nobody wants to hear bullshit numbers that can't be backed up.</p>

        <p>It's water under the bridge tbh, just keep putting out correct and sane information to counteract the unhinged. An alternative is suppression and censorship of these people and then you might as well work public sector</p>

<p>I am sure that we are just imagining it up in a flight of fancy and that it's just a coincidence that a 2,000 year old book describes what we are seeing today. You are free to be atheist or whatever you are, but you have no right to make those of us who are not talk about how Biblical prophecy is unfolding before our eyes.</p>
