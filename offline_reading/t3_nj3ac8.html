    <strong>Just a story about etiquette, compliance, and cowardice.</strong>
    <p><p>At the dog park with my two chihuahua mixes. There's two fenced-off areas:  posted signs are for over and under 30 lbs. For the most part, this is voluntarily adhered to, the exceptions mostly being very old dogs in the small dog area. People are fine with that because they're low energy and no danger.</p>
<p>Enter Jersey Shore couple and their two 40 lb husky mix "toddlers". The dogs proceed to chase, nip, and terrorize every dog present, working as a team to herd them toward one fence. A few people actually pick up their dog. Some leave almost immediately.</p>
<p>I go up to the couple and tell them their dogs are too large for this area, and the aggressiveness makes it worse. The morons try to equate size with age, and that their dogs are allowed. I try to recruit one of the people holding her dog in her arms for support, but she can't even speak. I do not relent, and argue that it's not age, but size.</p>
<p>Eventually, Guido and his bipedal cunt leave the park altogether, knowing that the Chads on the big dog side wouldn't tolerate their shit either.</p>
<p>The point is, most people will not defend themselves or the things they care about. You have to be willing to stand on your own.</p></p>
