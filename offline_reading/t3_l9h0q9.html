        <p>No this guys music is fucking trash, the fact that he’s the go too rapper for people who aren’t fans of rap should tell you he makes shit music. Imagine holding a rock band up as great when all theres fans constantly say “i usually hate rock music but this is REAL Rock” lol fuck off.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying it's "real rap" and that garbage on the radio isn't. I can understand what he's saying and resonate with it. That's what I and a few others who have started following him despite not like rap are getting out of it.  There are people who don't like 'country', but they hear someone like Aaron Lewis and go "Holy shit, I get what this guy's saying".</p>

        <p>Its rap for the audience of people who dont typically listen to rap. he has quiet a few songs like this and they always do really well among people who land on the right of the political spectrum. Tom is basically what would happen if Ben Shaprio or Tucker Carlson started rapping about their social views instead of talking about it on their youtube/cable news shows. he realizes theres a massive untapped audience of people out there who dont like rap at all but would love a rapper who raps about normal right wing dog whistle social views. For the longest time people were asking why there was never a right-wing Jon Stewart. Well, its because nobody was ever able to fill that void and do it well. Hell, even the left cant fill his shoes. What im getting at here is that Tom is basically the right-wing version of rap that people never knew they wanted until they heard it. hes filling that same void and snatching up that large audience that a right wing jon stewart would have filled. I'll be fully transparent and say that i dont agree with much of what tom says and that i think 90% of it is either starwmen arguments or just rightwing dog whistle talking points. however, theres no denying hes good at what he does. he knows the audience hes trying to reach and hes capitalizing on it. my super Qanon obsessed, storm the capital, overturn the election parents absolutely love this song and Marjorie Taylor Green is saying how awesome this song is on twitter so theres no denying what audience this song is meant for. at the end of the day though, hes gotten really successful lately with it so you have to give him kudos. well, i guess you dont have to but i do. just because i dont agree with his stuff doesnt mean that its wrong that hes doing it or that hes not good at it. he found a choir to preach to in a format that said choir doesnt typically pay much attention to so its really no surprise his career has taken off like it has.</p>

        <p>Tom Macdonald is a racist POS and his music is lowest common denominator conservative bait. Dude is legit one of the corniest least talented guys in the game, and the fact his entire fan base is comprised of “i usually hate rap but” should tell you all you need to know about this piece of trash</p>

        <p>Hes not racist.</p>
<p>You can't just label me racist 'cause I'm related to people
Who did some terrible shit way back before I was alive
My parents brought me up to treat everyone as an equal
I refuse to feel ashamed 'cause of my pretty blue eyes</p>

        <p>Oh shit pack it up guys racist guy says he’s
not racist case closed... Toms actions speak far louder than words and his work to undermine the blm movement is fucking disgusting. Attempts at fostering a victim mentality in straight white men and creating false equivalency’s between him being told to shut the fuck up on twitter and black people being second class citizens in their own country. he’s fucking trash. just look at his fan base of “i’m not racist i know a black guy” bradleys</p>
