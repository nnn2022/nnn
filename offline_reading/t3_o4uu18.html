        <p>For a year, every single media and social media source banned and shamed anyone who suggested that covid might have been a leak from the coronavirus lab in Wuhan. Anyone that talked about it, even high up scientists or academics were censored and insulted. </p>
<p>Then one day, suddenly as if it was a coordinated strategy, the US government out of the blue said that it might have been a leak. And just like that, it became acceptable to talk about and all the previous year's worth of censorship and bullying was memory holed. </p>
<p>Now come on. How can that seem normal to anyone? How does that not set off every red flag detector and bullshit detector in every human? Suddenly dangerous misinformation went to being a reasonable theory overnight? How does that not sound like an oligarchic tecnocratic dictatorship to everyone? The government and its media arm are literally telling you what is acceptable to think and changing it overnight without warning. How can anyone defend this and not think that there's something very weird going on?</p>

        <p>Just like how any questions or concerns about the vaccine are at best labeled hesitant and at worst dangerous misinformation, maybe admitting to the lab leak is a way to guage the publics reaction to a sudden change in narrative, so that IF it comes out in a year there are side effects, people will just accept it. Plus they can't do anything anyway as the pharma companies admitted from the start they would not be liable.</p>

        <p>I'm not really concerned about later side effects, because that'd be unusual, but we've already had the Astra-Zeneca suspended for certain age groups, after it was insisted the vaccine was safe, as though 'safe' isn't a relative term in medicine. I got antibotics today and they came with a list of alarming possible side-effects, when did people forget this is usual? Judging a treatment overall worthwhile doesn't mean there are never negative consequences, and people refusing to acknowledge that just strengthens the real anti-vaxx narrative.</p>

        <p>the issue is that it's the opposite way.</p>
<p>people here aren't [overall] claiming the vaccine [mrna gene therapy, according to the 'professionals' own words]</p>
<p>is 100% bad.</p>
<p>but people on the other side are claiming it's 100% GOOD. asking about adverse effects on other subs can often get you banned. asking on fb gets you 'fact checked', or removed. it's crazy.</p>

        <p>Agreed, it's more misleading claims about safety the issue than the reverse, and it's not fair for 'a few people on the net' to be compared to the influence of government claims, either.</p>

        <p>We have reasons to know what to expect based on existing knowledge of biology, and trials: otherwise it's like 'it's a novel virus, nobody has any idea what will happen'. The specific method of controlled exposure to the 'virus' (the spike protein) is new, but it still functions much like existing vaccines, and side-effects from those usually show up quickly.</p>

        <p>Except other vaccines use proteins that aren't harmful in themselves. The spike protein is. And the vaccine literally makes your own body produce a bunch of them. It's insane.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone who is ok with getting the vaccines is so delusional to say that it's impossible to have side effects. If anyone says that, I'd strongly disagree with them.</p>
<p>It is a risk-benefit tradeoff like any medicine. Personally I think the risk is miniscule. Same as any vaccine and the numbers right now back that up. Adverse events occur but are very rare. I am as concerned as I would be taking Tylenol or an antibiotic, which I did have a bad allergic reaction to penicillin. Another "safe treatment". Didn't kill me though. </p>
<p>No I think most would just say anti-vaxxers blow the risks way out of proportion, not that there are "no risks"</p>

<p>Anytime someone asks the question on Social Media for example, they almost immediately get shut down for spreading misinformation.  Because that's exactly how you get blowing the risks way out of proportion, by not being completely transparent.</p>

<p>You don't think that pharma and the government blew the risks of COVID out of proportion? Why apply such different standards? (unless you inherently trust regulatorily-captured bureaucrats and pharma, but inherently distrust clinicians who are trying to keep their patients alive.)</p>

        <p>Well adverse effects aren't beibg properly recorded, and the CDC is not even collecting data on breakthrough infections unless you end up in hospital or dead. So you might be going through the risk of getting the gene therapy for no reason.</p>

        <p>True, which is why you should really be skeptical of the general integrity and emotional stability of people who refuse to even acknowledge that it's weird and dangerous. They don't need to believe anything specific or be on the same page, I'm only talking about people who insist this is totally normal and that there isn't a possibility of conspiracy/abuse of power. </p>
<p>If someone can't be honest with themselves, if they can't care about the truth enough to consider the most comforting and gratifying scenario might not be the case, if they cannot find it in themselves to question authority, what else can't they do?</p>

        <p>Well said. Since this is all happening in the dark we cannot agree on the specific ways that we have been lied to but those who think for themselves have to acknowledge the whole story is fishy and things have not been adding up since March 2020 last year.</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about the pandemics I'm talking about 9/11, the USS Liberty, the 2020 election, the coverage of every police killing that touches the news. I think there is a plan that is very important to very powerful people, I think it has been a plan for a very long time (imo hundreds of years but even if it's only been 5 years that doesn't change much), I think that plan involves things we would never even guess that it could involve.</p>

        <p>Often "God is dead" is quoted by edgy atheists. However, the tone Nietzsche is one that is somber and somewhat foreboding. By God (aka organized religion) being dead, people have less to bond over. Moral compasses are askew, and people are without purpose. </p>
<p>Btw, I say this as someone who is highly critical of modern religion. I myself have no (dogmatic) religious beliefs or affiliations. I just know how important it is for people to have purpose in life, and I know many find it through religion.</p>

        <p>Okay but what about all the countries with universal healthcare instead of for profit systems that are also pushing for it? Here in Canada, they also have vaccine lotteries. Side note, I've already had my first dose and I feel perfectly fine, and I'm about to get my second dose.</p>

        <p>The incentives exist to get people who are hesitant to get vaccinated because they're afraid of possible side-effects to get the vaccine(s). This is required to achieve herd immunity and protect those who are unable to get the vaccine(s) because of serious health complications.</p>
<p>The lotteries are just a method of distributing the doses in a mostly unbiased way, that way you <em>don't</em> get the rich vaccinated first and in theory it's independent of that, although corruption always finds a way.</p>
<p>Also in other countries people are trying really hard to get vaccines and there are huge waiting lists to get them, so it's really just an American thing to require such vast incentives.</p>

        <p>I was pretty awake to the occulted info before this. I came at Covid with a distrust for government, but my hypothesis was wrong at first. I thought they were hiding the severity. I've always heard, "If something is truely serious and life threatening, the government will hide it. And the stuff you shouldn't be worried about they will hype up". They were telling people to travel, even go to China. They refused tests. How they found the 1st outbreak in the US was the doctors in Washington State disobeyed the CDC and tested someone despite the CDC not giving permission. I was doing the opposite of what they told me. I continued to wear the N95's when they said not to. I still think they were trying to get it to spread and giving people bad advice. They had to have known cloth masks spread germs. And everyone brushed it off  as not a big deal until it was time for the government and media to switch on the propaganda. Then all the people I tried to warn sudden cared. I'm still quite bitter about that. It makes me mad that the people who stared at me for wearing a mask (and in some cases talked shit) would now tell on me for not wearing one. I don't get too mad at myself at being extra careful then because we had very little info. But you would think a year is enough to see what is really going on.</p>

        <p>Well, let's see. You and your kind deliberately seek out a sub you don't agree with in order to come here and harass us, insist that the negative effects of lockdown, vaccines, and masks are nonexistent (a list of effects that includes suicide, depression, poverty, cancer, and more) while having the unmitigated gall to say that <em>we're</em> the selfish ones because we don't think that saving one year of an 80-year-old's life is worth sacrificing literally everything, including said suicide and cancer victims.</p>
<p>I mean, you <em>could</em> just leave us alone. We're suffering enough in this oppressive society. But no, you have to come here and harass us.</p>
<p>And you pretend that your harassment is "questioning and reasoning," trying to gaslight us and pretend that you're not a harasser. Give me a freaking break.</p>
<p>Yep, all of that sounds pretty soulless to me. Now bugger off.</p>

        <p>I have to give respect to this sub for not straight up banning people with different opinions. This sub is better than most at that.</p>
<p>I am also suffering in an oppressive society, but where my opinions differ is just that I believe in vaccination. I will vaccinate and I am completely aware that I might have complications and possibly die from it. It sometimes happen with vaccines. But I am also aware that 4 million people have died so far from covid. So if we vaccinate and lose a couple of thousand people to the vaccine, that's still miles better than letting the covid run free.</p>
<p>So now tell me who lacks a soul.</p>

        <p>They have done a great job categorizing all questioning of any reported and established narrative as “conspiracy.” </p>
<p>This is antithetical to the scientifically minded individual and process. A way of thinking that is supposed to constantly weigh all inputs, new and old alike, against what is understood with the operating principle being that of an open mind, ready to analyze anything related to the understanding of whatever the topic is at hand. </p>
<p>Luckily for humanity, this type of censorship always backfires. Sometimes history demonstrates it takes longer than other times, but suppressing even moderately popular opinions/ideas/people has the opposite effect.</p>

        <p>Go home bot tired of seeing all vaccination threads trying to control the narrative. I hope it's out of the bag for people on the fence. Don't do it. You guys are the nail in the vaccine coffin for me. If these things need let out then I think it's already over or the antagonist is scrambling to control thought. Maybe some of the covid equals black plague have taken a look themselves</p>

        <p>Right! It’s a pandemic! Pandemics are horrible, and definitely not right, and we should work together to stop it ASAP so we can get back to normal. Wear masks where required, social distance, and get the vaccine when it’s available</p>

        <p>Not my "interpretation" but what Paul is, in fact, telling the Corinthians:</p>
<p>Paul is instructing you that you to ignore (become foolish to) empirical evidence (a.k.a. <em>reality</em>) and instead just trust in God and his ways. Back in high school the priest teaching us this made a point to emphasize that earthly logic and the instruction contained within of the Bible are inherently contradictory.</p>
<p>By citing this, you're asserting it's better to blindly follow Magic Sky Man's instructions without incorporating earthly knowledge, logic, and reasoning that doesn't perfectly overlap with God's message (or whatever deity you subjugate yourself to).</p>
<p>Tldr: it's not the edgy "trust your gut like the guy in the picture" message you thought it was; you're actually encouraging anti-intellectualism.</p>
