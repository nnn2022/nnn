    <strong>"Just the flu"</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone notice how people are freaking out over anyone who compares this to the flu, saying how dare we and it's a different virus and how ignorant we are?</p>
<p>That may be true (guys, it <em>isn't</em> the flu, it's not an influenza virus) but in the same breath these people compare it to the 1918 pandemic, swearing up and down that when the second wave comes it'll mutate and millions will die.</p>
<p>I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WASN'T JUST THE FLU, YOU JUST COMPARED IT TO THE FLU lol this is is ridiculous</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn't be surprised if, in the end, when we aren't overcounting Covid deaths and undercounting Covid cases, that this virus ends up being more like getting a coronavirus cold than a pandemic flu in terms of both true IFR and "long-term effects"</p>
<p>We don't actually study colds all that much (compared to, say, the flu), especially because colds mostly severely affect people who are already dying of something else. We've essentially decided to label a bunch of respiratory symptoms, caused by a variety of very different viruses (rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and other viruses), as "the cold". A "cold" can be a relatively asymptomatic disease, or it can develop into deadly pneumonia.</p>
<p>Because it's been so broadly studied, examined, and scrutinized, we probably already know more about this "novel" virus that we "don't know anything about" than we know about most cold viruses. When the dust settles, I think we'll find out that this virus was indeed not much like the flu at all, but rather like the coronaviruses we've already been living with.</p>
<p>Interesting, but unrelated: HCoV-NL63 is believed to have come from bats also</p>

        <p>It's strange indeed how you can already find so much information about this "novel" virus compared to others which have been around forever. What makes SARS-CoV-2 so special, other than it being used as a tool by politicians to gain power, and rich people to gain wealth?</p>

        <p>Media panic. And politicians who like to overreact to everything. (See: war on drugs, war on terror, now: war on coronavirus?)</p>
<p>I truly think that politicians are just pandering. Things will be better when the public hysteria calms down. We'll get back to true normal soon. I wouldn't be surprised if those same pandering politicians institute a UBI and other measures to increase wealth equality and undo some of the damage, once public opinion turns against lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Hcov-oc42 had a 8% CFR in a sample of 110 nursing home residents, so yea, it's probably about as bad as a cold.  The paper is online, there was a suspected SARS (the original one) outbreak in a Canadian nursing home but it turned out to be a cold virus.</p>

        <p>Hmmmm I wonder if Hcov-oc42 is kept in check currently by herd immunity. Oh well! No way to know that! Lockdown until we have a vaccine for Hcov-oc42! Herd immunity is a dangerous strategy! We can't just allow Hcov-oc42 to run rampant and not do anything about it!</p>
<p>But actually: that is fascinating. Do you have a link to that paper?</p>

        <p>Sorry, Hcov-oc43, got the number wrong.  Here is the paper:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18382647/</p>
<p>&rt;Results: Ninety-five of 142 residents (67%) and 53 of 160 staff members (33%) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection. Symptomatic residents experienced cough (66%), fever (21%) and pneumonia (12%). Eight residents died, six with pneumonia. No staff members developed pneumonia. Findings on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for SARS-CoV at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positives, but this was confounded by concurrent identification of antibody to N protein on serology. Subsequent testing by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed HCoV-OC43 infection. Convalescent serology ruled out SARS. Notably, sera demonstrated cross-reactivity against nucleocapsid peptide sequences common to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV.</p>
<p>&rt;Conclusions: These findings underscore the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting serological tests for SARS-CoV.</p>

        <p>Eye opening for sure. The only reason it was investigated too was that it was 2003. Imagine how many times this exact situation has happened since then, with normally circulating coronaviruses, and no one even knows.</p>

        <p>"Overcount" is a bit of a shorthand simplification. </p>
<p>Covid deaths have been regularly counted (internationally) based on anyone who dies with a positive covid test, even if the person was severely immunocompromised or had a preexisting condition. We don't normally count deaths from other diseases this way. </p>
<p>For example, by this logic, no one has ever died "of AIDS". They died of the flu / pneumonia / cold that gets them because of their severely immunocompromised state. We don't normally count those as deaths from "the cold" when it happens. They're clearly deaths from AIDS. </p>
<p>These diseases (cold, flu), which we do not lockdown or panic over, would look a lot scarier if we did count each case where someone died WITH the disease rather than OF the disease. </p>
<p>The CDC has said that only 6% of Covid deaths had only Covid as a contributing factor. And there was a study published that said that if the CDC had used their same guidelines prior to March 2020 to count Covid deaths, the death count would have been 16 fold lower.</p>

        <p>This doesn’t always work.  I’m in the same position as the sister-in-law here.  Fear turns reason off in a lot of people.  And too many people I know substitute someone else’s judgment (often times the loudest thing they’re hearing) for their own, which leads to “everyone says X, how can you say differently?”</p>
<p>I don’t know how to reach these people.  I wish I did, but I’ve stopped trying for the moment to ease tensions.  But, back to the initial point, data isn’t a miracle cure.</p>

        <p>I had a friend tell me the story of one of their friends who got it and was pissed that people were comparing it to the flu, keep in mind, he wasn't hospitalized or anything like that. He just felt horrible enough to say "anyone that compares this to flu can suck my dick".</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I've had sinus infections where I had to sleep in a winter hat, two sweat shirts, and wrapped in a comforter because of the chills. Being sick sucks and is never fun, especially when a fever is involved... But it's hard to get an objective comparison since most people don't get the flu very often and when they usually do "it's the worst I've ever felt" is often said. </p>
<p>All we have to be objective are the numbers and by the numbers, this isn't much different than the flu.</p>

        <p>I always wondered about that: if having it makes you reassess everything. Every video that plays on YouTube, Facebook, etc. about those who've had it and survived, they beg their viewers to mask up. And I'm watching, confused, going, "But you're ok. You got the dreaded Covid. And you survived. But you still want me to be scared with my mask on?" Nope. If anything, their survival makes me less scared of getting it.</p>

        <p>Seriously. That almost happened to me and no one gave a shit. I literally almost died, saw my oxygen drop before passing out from blood loss. Turns out the exact thing that happened to me (forced c section) is way too common. The medical industry is so corrupt and literally kills people. Like 30% of births end up being c sections. Which kills people or seriously injures them. If the world decided that was unacceptable like they did with the corona virus there would be immediate changes. Instead no one cares, doctor didn't even get fired and when I tell people they sometimes act like I'm crazy. Then 2 years later they act like a cold is the end of the world, though they don't care women get cut open against their will. They expect me to care about something that might kill someone but they don't care about what almost killed me, that my rights were violated. Some hospitals pressure women into c sections to get paid more, it's a serious issue. Not to mention all the other malpractice that happens. No one's demanding we train doctors better or do anything to improve that. It really makes the people demanding laws for corona virus look like hypocrites.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that happened to you. C sections are up in Canada as well, not due to money, but I suspect, scheduling convenience with the dr's schedule. It's really sad that so many babies are induced. The whole birthing experience has been diminished by the medical industry. Look up Ina May Gaskin.</p>
