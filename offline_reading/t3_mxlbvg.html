    <strong>They can’t arrest us all, time to prove it. Fight back by occupying the local jails, and refusing to leave until everyone complicit quite and agrees to be replaced by freedom loving people.</strong>
    <p><p>Personally, I think we need to take the “they can’t arrest us all” mantra and put it to the test.  Everyone needs to go to the police departments and overrun them peacefully, and refuse to leave until the police agree to quit and be replaced.  They’re paid with YOUR taxes, the buildings, all their equipment, and their vehicles, belong to WE THE PEOPLE.  Take them back.
What are they going to do?  Arrest 600 people?  600 people that want to be arrested?  The entire system will collapse in a day.</p>
<p>Everyone at the moment is going to protests, and playing roulette, taking the chance of the cops singling people out.  Don’t give them the chance. </p>
<p>Go as a group, everyone refuse to leave until every single person there accomplishes their goal.  </p>
<p>Encourage more to come.  Start handing out food and supplies to those occupying.</p></p>

        <p>That would be stupid. Theyd just baton, teargas and pepperspray everyone until they leave, then arrest 10 or so people and throw the book at them to make an example. You know, like the Jan 6 capital riot. </p>
<p>Nothing would be accomplished. </p>
<p>You want to change the police, change the laws and politicians that govern them.</p>

        <p>Change the laws? How do you propose we do that? They've made it abundantly clear they will even go as far as ignore the Constitution! What makes you think they even care about you?</p>

        <p>They dont care about anyone and I never claimed they did. </p>
<p>There are tons of social justice leftist laws on the books and they got there by people demonstrating, running media campaigns and pressuring their state representatives. </p>
<p>Newsom is CA is opening things back up because he is a cunthair away from being kicked out of office because of petitioners and political campaigners. </p>
<p>Florida and Texas are open because many people voiced their displeasure at mandates at townhalls and demonstrations. </p>
<p>None of these things magically happened. Smart and organized people got together and made them happen thru legal channels. </p>
<p>Illegal political action is for people who are either dumb, have the backing of the establishment, or are trained and prepared to escalate to full spectrum violence. </p>
<p>If you read US history the constitution has been trampled on numerous times. Majority of the time the problem gets fixed thru legal channels.</p>
