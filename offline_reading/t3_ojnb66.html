    <strong>Have they actually lost their minds?</strong>
    <p><p>Listen I'm not really as extreme as most people on here... I don't believe in the vaccine and I believe there's more going on here than meets the eye....that's usually where our similarities in opinion end.</p>
<p>But for a moment, can I delve into how my mind is starting to perceive this...</p>
<p>In Ontario, Canada where I live the daily "case counts" have plummeted along with deaths in recent weeks.  Maybe we are reaching some level of immunity, who knows (honestly I have trouble believing any sort of reporting on it all at this stage).  We are reopening and things are finally looking up after months of lockdowns and stay at home orders....</p>
<p>Also, it's become well known and reported in mainstream media that vaccinated individuals can get and pass on the virus SO the "you have to get vaccinated to protect people who cant" argument is gone.</p>
<p>Yet still, people whom I value their opinion...intelligent people... continue pressure me into vaccination.  Most recently a friend I was talking with about visiting asked me if I got it yet.  Told me he would be more comfy if I did.  I asked the normal question of why, considering he is vaccinated....why he would feel more comfy... he mentioned the delta variant and eventually said he's actually more worried about me (after saying he might cancel our hangout if I wasn't vaccinated)....THIS IS A PERSON WHO BEFORE VACCINATION SPENT TIME WITH ME WHEN DAILY NUMBERS WERE IN YHE THOUSANDS!!!</p>
<p>So I see this and....what else can I derive?  Is the vaccination making people mad?  Or are they simply doubling down on their delusion because they've already crossed the point of no return?</p>
<p>Something that also gets ignored is that for the vaccine to protect me I actually need to be exposed to the virus...  as a front line worker at the peak of this pandemic visiting countless businesses I was never exposed to it.... now, as numbers dwindle, the chance is considerably less.  So first you need to look at the probability I would be exposed, then the probability I would catch it, and then finally, my 99.8 or whatever chance to survive.  Wtf we vaccinating for again?</p></p>

        <p>I am sorry this is happening to you. I also get the impression that people who have had a shot seem to be losing their minds a little. </p>
<p>Many people in my life do and say the same shit. I have friends tell me regularly they’re frustrated we can’t hang out indoors bc I don’t have the shot and I remind them that we hung out indoors all last year prior to the shots and with worse cases, and that it’s technically not against the rules in Ontario- it’s just whatever their comfort level is. </p>
<p>So other than visiting my parents and staying the night, I see 0 friends indoors.</p>

        <p>If they don’t want to be your friend or family member then that’s up to them. My own mum keeps saying well that will encourage more to have the jab to anything I say and I just reply, “ I won’t be having it” she’s had it but she still speaks to me. I refuse to argue with people about it, as it’s a waste of time and energy. Countless people died from the Spanish flu jabs cut history tells you otherwise. The same with the African jabs and women not being able to have kid there and here.</p>
