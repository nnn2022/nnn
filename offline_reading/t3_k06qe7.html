<title>Danish study finds no significant effect for mask wearers - it's a good read to get a better understanding, I've been saying for months how can they work when a virus particle is so small the naked eye cant see it but you can see the holes in masks...</title>

        <p>A simple demonstration with a vape wearing a mask shows the vape aerosols go straight through the mask, and around the mask, pushing a significant amount of it up towards the eyes upon exhale.</p>
<p>This demonstration shows exactly how ineffective standard issue cloth masks are, which, are predominantly being used by people everywhere.</p>
<p>So in other words, completely useless.</p>

        <p>First it was transmission by objects, then by droplets.. and now WHO is almost ready to admit that aerosols are the primary transmission.</p>
<p>And people just refuse to realize what that means for regular masks...</p>

        <p>It might actually mean that wearing a regular mask is WORSE because it makes you breathe heavier to get the same amount of air, thereby making it so that you will take in a larger viral load.</p>
<p>What we really need to do? Encourage people to take C vitamin, D vitamin, Zinc, and other supplements.</p>
<p>The data shows that the vast majority of the people who are dying while being elderly are ALSO lacking in several known to boost immunity vitamins and minerals.</p>

        <p>Of course, anyone who has had to wear PPE for industrial purposes can easily realize this. When I was doing renovation of flooded houses, we had to wear <em>at minimum</em> an N95 mask, because a regular dust mask was not enough to filter much of anything out. We used plastic ones and were advised to seal them against our skin with vaseline to keep the air out around the edges. The smallest particles we were dealing with were mold spores, which are hundreds of times larger than viruses. And almost all of us still got sick eventually.</p>

        <p>I've read the summary and findings -- sadly it's not strong enough to be conclusive. I am not saying it's not true -- I think it is, but opposers can find excuses.</p>
<p>But, no problem, let's repeat the study with another 6000 people, and see... Why isn't it being repeated!?</p>

        <p>there have been enough studies over the decades about face diapers showing they are just a talisman outside of clinical environments and not all that  effective within them</p>
<p>of course those studies are focused on influenza, not the common cold corona, so the corona culters dismiss them all.</p>

        <p>I'd like to quote a few lines from the study as a counter-argument to your implied claim that face masks are ineffective. Firstly:<br>
".. the 95% CIs are compatible with a possible 46% reduction to 23% increase in infection among mask wearers."</p>
<p>So it seems as if even though the protective benefit is small, it may exist. Secondly, the additional benefit of face masks is to protect others from the wearer as 'source control', which the authors didn't cover:</p>
<p>"The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a  recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections,  because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of  SARS-CoV-2 infection."  </p>
<p>Finally, I'd invite you to read the commentary on the original article, which clarify and discuss problems with interpreting these findings. (Scroll to the end of the article - <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</a>)</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, there is a 93% chance that face mask wearing reduces the risk SARS-Cov-2 infection by at least 5%."</p>
<p>"Study subjects were not required to wear masks at home. Their family  members/visitors were neither taxed to wear masks in public nor were  they tested for asymptomatic Covid, which is often spread in homes.  Accordingly, it is plausible, if not likely, that some study subjects  caught Covid in their own homes. "</p>
<p>" This study received 90,000 tweets by 60,000 users within 4 days of  publication. The majority of these tweets championed the study as  evidence of the impotence of masks in the control of the COVID-19  pandemic. The authors of the study would agree that this is a gross  misinterpretation of the research, which further points to the fact that  the wording of the conclusion should have been chosen slightly more  judiciously. "</p>
<p>" Although masks were provided and recommended to participants, masking  was not commonplace in Denmark at the time, and 14% of participants  reported experiencing social harms due to masking. Only 46% of  participants reported wearing a mask as recommended, and overreporting  of adherence, as has been seen in previous prevention studies for  stigmatizing interventions, likely occurred."  </p>
<p>There are several other works that assess the benefit of face masks, and the overall conclusion that I've drawn is that it is the socially responsible thing to do.<br>
