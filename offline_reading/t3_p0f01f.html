    <p><p>How terrible of a parent do you have to be to smother your child (physically and psychologically) in this way. Just goes to show that many people are slaves at heart and that slavery is also instilled in their kids from a very young age.</p></p>

        <p>Its crazy to me that any time you try to say masking toddlers is wrong people lose their minds. It’s not normal!! It will never be normal!! It’s wrong and it’s abuse.</p>

        <p>My daughter is 3 and she has cancer. We've been to a lot of doctors and hospitals this year but have never put a mask on her. She just started radiation last week and the staff suddenly gave us a hard time about her not wearing a mask. It makes zero sense because she literally can't go under anesthesia if she has so much as the sniffles. I asked them, why? She's not sick. She obviously can't be here if she's sick. "It's our policy." They handed her a mask and I refused to help her put it on, until the nurses kind of reluctantly brought us back to the room. Then a few minutes later another nurse came back with a handful of more masks "maybe she'll like these, they have fun designs!" Those went directly in the trash. The next 2 days they didn't say anything and we continue to keep her maskless. If they try to do it again I plan to inform them that cancer isn't contagious.</p>

        <p>WOW that makes me so angry to hear they’re even pushing masks on 3 year olds with cancer!!!! I think you have bigger issues to deal with than worrying about her getting covid. Jesus Christ! Good for you for standing up to that!</p>

        <p>No see, it’s most likely not the parents forcing their kid’s to wear masks in the cases you mention. The parents likely accept that it’s safe not wear one while their kids are already conditioned to be scared and refuse to take theirs off. Their parents simply don’t have the balls to say otherwise. This is what terrifies me the most.</p>
<p>My daughter spent a period thinking masks were cool. I shut that shit down real fuxking quick.</p>

        <p>This was my son in the spring. He started kindergarten and they were pushing masks hard, I wasn’t really wearing one. We went to Target one day and he was terrified that I wasn’t wearing a mask and all but demanded he gets to wear one. We sat in the car &amp; had a loooong talk.</p>

        <p>Man this hits home.  My son became so accustomed to wearing them in school that he thought he needed them everywhere. Like this virus was going to drop out of the sky on a family walk and get him. </p>
<p>We went to a small graduation ceremony in the spring and mask mandates had finally stopped. He was terrified not to wear one. We let him make his own decision, he chose to wear one. No one else in the crowd did. </p>
<p>He’s stopped wearing them since then except for doctors appointments. He has realized he’s fine and healthy. I’m sure as hell not scaring him. I hope they don’t indoctrinate the fear back into him when school starts next month.</p>

        <p>That's my stance. I see parents slap their children hard across the face if they try to remove their masks but those same parents aren't vaccinated allegedly or wearing theirs. So hypocritical and fucked up to excuse child abuse. The worser part yet is other parents cheer them on whereas in other situation they'd get 911 called on them.</p>

        <p>I have two autistic sons that fall into that lower age range where kids could wear masks. When I take them into stores some of the dirtiest looks and comments about masking up my children. I like to set a good example for my boys so I don't tell these people to go fuck themselves and die in a fire but I do have to say my son's have autism so they won't wear a mask. </p>
<p>I'm absolutely sick to death of the sheep being so brainwashed and in love with their enslavement. The <em>"oppress me harder Daddy!"</em> mentality is actually fucking real and it is mind-boggling.</p>

        <p>I was actually out in the damn Gulf of Mexico last night, off coast of Florida.  On a speedboat with maybe 20 other people.  Out in the open, no enclosed spaces at all.  Great outdoors, right?  Nevertheless, there was one brainwashed couple WEARING MASKS.  On an open boat, out over open water.</p>
<p>I simply ignored the fact that they were there, and looked right past them.  Why even be a part of society if you are that at risk, or have that much fear???</p>

        <p>Took my 8 year old son a few weeks after the mask mandate in Michigan. Literal panic attack the first time we went into the store without one. He never wore one with me, my baby momma is nuts. Luckily she is against the Vax. Her family actually has vaccine (not the covid one) accidents with almost every family member.</p>

        <p>Yes. My daughter is 4 and of the 8 kids in her class  2 wear masks to daycare. It’s not required in Texas. The other day her friend told her “my
Mom said if you don’t wear a mask you could get the virus and die.” The other day at a restaurant I saw a kid cry because he didn’t want to take his mask off to eat. I really worry about what this is doing to kids so young making them wear masks for 17 months and having them hear their parents say “if someone doesn’t wear a mask they could die.”</p>

        <p>I tried going in with my four year old (no mask) and they would allow it. I Karen'd it up and spoke to the manager, they offered a shield to her. I said wtf no she won't and can't! We can go get the items you need they said told them I'm not spending my money here. Fucking gross, grown ass men saying no your 4 year old in the cart is disgusting and needs to cover her breathing holes. Don't know how they sleep at night</p>

        <p>Last year the Costco near me had police at the entrance and we saying only one person could come in per membership. I happened to go the day they started this and the cop was literally telling mothers to leave their kids in the car with the windows down (this was in the Fall so at least the temperatures weren't too hot.</p>
<p>People were livid and leaving because they refused to leave their kids. If two adults came but only one had the membership, only one could enter, but of the second adult purchased a membership, then they could come right in. </p>
<p>It was an absolute clown show and that was the last time I went to Costco. My membership was up the following month so I didn't renew</p>
