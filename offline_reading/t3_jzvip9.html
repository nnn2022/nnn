    <strong>PA's Wolf: "The virus is what's doing this. It's not me."</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mcall.com/coronavirus/mc-nws-coronavirus-mea-20201123-byqksxh26rdxjjdvxc7fmyfvlu-story.html%3foutputType=amp</p>
<p>PA's idiot in the capital Tom Wolf decreed new and confusing "restrictions" today that aren't a total shutdown of our economy.  Thankfully he realizes the economy is "fragile".  However, I'm sure when cases rise, he and the gentleman serving as health secretary or whatever will be back with the overreach.</p>
<p>What got me from his statement was this line: "The virus is what's doing this.  It's not me.  It's not the administration.  It's not the government".  </p>
<p>Um, yes, Tom, it <em>is</em> you; it <em>is</em> the government that is to blame for every person out of work, every business shuttered, every industry ruined.  It shouldn't be possible, but it is your actions that caused it.  What a cowardly and creepy statement.  It's as if he's more concerned that government be viewed in a good light than in doing anything useful.</p></p>
