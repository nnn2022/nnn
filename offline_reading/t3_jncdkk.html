    <strong>A small study in grocery stores found workers still tested positive even with masks, plexiglass, and sanitizing everything</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/researchers-show-extent-of-covid-19-spread-in-a-grocery-store-1.5169995">Researchers show the </a><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/researchers-show-extent-of-covid-19-spread-in-a-grocery-store-1.5169995">extent of Covid-19 spread in a grocery store</a></p>
<p>This short report claims that grocery store workers were more likely to test positive for Covid-19 if they were working in close contact with customers, regardless of having masks on and sanitizing everything (most places in my area are bleaching the checkout lane, touchpad, and changing gloves between customers).</p>
<p>The article also touches on hairstylists who tested positive and quarantined but not before cutting more than 139 customers' hair.</p>
<p>I found this refreshing to read because the Canadian media has only recently started to pump the brakes on the paranoia and have started to recognize some flaws within lockdowns and how governments and society have handled this situation. They recently also published a piece on how depression and anxiety were skyrocketing, along with an increase in opioid deaths (thought to coincide with when they started handing out free money).</p></p>

        <p>That's one of the nonsensical things that gets me about all of the precautions and mandates.</p>
<p>I wear a mask to go to the store - I have to, no choice.  I don't pick up items to read labels as I usually do because putting items back is frowned upon. But the person behind the plexiglass touches all of my items, hands me my receipt and change if I use cash so there's cross contamination right there.</p>
<p>The alternative is to order for delivery but then someone else is picking all of my items so I can't avoid having someone else touch all of my stuff.  And of course the shelves are stocked by someone who touches them.  Packed and shipped to the store by someone who touches them. On and on.</p>
<p>My god, we should all be dead by now!</p>
<p>But wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from others, cancel Thanksgiving. For your safety.</p>
<p>It's so freaking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>We have a state mask mandate but many don't abide by it. </p>
<p>I voted yesterday and was forced to wear a mask and felt it important enough to stand my ground and vote so I gave into their little game (I feel they are hoping it will turn people off from coming to vote... Fuck that !)
So anyway it's the very first time I've worn a mask and I had it on for over an hour. Almost passed out more than once. It took me hours to feel back to normal after taking it off and I was so emotionally and physically drained I came home and passed out for a nap. Now I know most people probably can wear one and that doesn't happen but goddamn it was literally awful for me.</p>
<p>Not to mention a sign that said "Please do not shake hands or engage in personal greetings while at our business"
This "business" was a court house, mind. Not a <em>business</em>.  So that was creepy. And as I saw several people with babies definitely born sometime this year I realize many infants have literally never seen a strangers face in public and I wanted to cry.</p>

        <p>I didn't wear a mask today to go vote and no one said a word to me. There's one small sign at the entrance that says "masks are required" but f*ck that. I'm not playing their silly little game.</p>

        <p>I didn't wear my mask when I voted today either (in a state with a mask mandate). I was the only one there not wearing a mask. They had the signs on the door about masks required but it was for the church, where my polling place was. </p>
<p>It felt so good not to wear that mask! and no one said anything to me!</p>

        <p>Plexiglass, my ass. Plexiglass (probably) works! But the worker cannot hear me when I'm in the mask and behind plexiglass. I always have to repeat the same phrase turning over plexiglass, and I cannot hear worker. They have to build a wall with mic like in banks. Science!</p>
<p>By the way degrading plastics revealed as source of greenhouse gases. What are we going to do with all that plexiglass and masks trash?</p>

        <p>You mean all of this security theater does <em>nothing</em>?  I'm shocked!</p>
<p>Sadly, some favorite local, small businesses have had to invest a lot of money into "safety" measures like putting up plexiglass everywhere and limiting the amount of customers in the store at once.  All just so people "feel" safe.</p>

        <p>Being safe at work because you have to be, and then not being safe because you are free outside of work is why they still test positive. If your not safe outside of work then you can still become positive and not know if you get near someone who has it without protection.</p>

        <p>That could be the case. I play ball when I legally have to at this point, but relish all opportunities of real normalcy. </p>
<p>In my area, our public health officials have suggested that workers are following the laws in public, but are getting relaxed in more private settings like break rooms and smoking in the parking lot. </p>
<p>However, I don't think that's the case in this particular study because it was early on with the paranoia so people were far more scared and not as burned out. I would have also expected the researchers to do some thorough contact tracing and to rule out the study if they had found too many examples of people without credible stories.</p>

        <p>The other side of the coin is that the mask doesn’t protect you from COVID. It was suppose to protect us from spreading droplets with COVID in them but the virus can still get through it and if somehow it gets to us we can still catch it. When we remove our masks to go outside for a second it can be airborne from someone else. </p>
<p>If we touch a door or shopping cart with our bare and then touch our face we can easily get it that way too. If the cashier or person handles cash and then doesn’t wash their hands right after they can catch it off of cash as well. They should be cleaning their hands or gloves if worn right after they touch the cash especially since they handle so much of it all day. Not wearing gloves and just washing our hands has given us a false sense of security just because everything looks clean doesn’t mean that it is. If it’s not done properly this virus can live there and get right on our hands. Then we transfer it to our nose and mouth or eyes.</p>
