    <strong>Death from pneumonia should ONLY be counted as a COVID death. Hell China doesn't even count you as a case if you're not displaying symptoms.</strong>
    <p><p>We live in a more authoritative state than China. Remember, the road to hellp is often painted with good intentions and through history, oppressive regimes always began with the guise of keeping you safe.</p>
<p>The figures are manipulated and for all those who are still blinded by this never-ending COVID matrix, ask yourself the questions. How many times have the goalposts been shifted? When do you expect a return to normality? After the vulnerable have been vaccinated? Nope, goalposts shifted to over 50s. </p>
<p>Then they'll shift again and you'll continue to lap up this manipulated tyranny whilst the same corporations and politicians you've been screaming out against most of your life make a profit off your misery leaving your fellow family members and neighbours less off whilst you report them to the same police you wanted to defund for following basic human nature.</p></p>
