        <p>Ugh. I hate that I still smile at people and then right afterward think, what’s the point. It is so depressing going out, seeing people skittish. It is dehumanizing to constantly send people the message that may be “diseased”. I really hate this.</p>

<p>If anyone glares, give 'em a big smile and a compliment - it works! Some of these covid-enthusiasts are just lonely people who need some loving kindness.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, they have passed draconian laws where they won't let you in without a mask. In Texas, things were starting to go (very slowly) back to the old normal. But now they've been set back because judges and mayors whined to Abbott and he's too spineless to stop their shit. So now it's masks required in all businesses. It's seriously depressing and feels this dystopian nightmare will never end.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid you can get kicked out of any business because of this stupid shit. The irony is that I don't even go anywhere anymore. Not because I am afraid of this nothingburger mental virus, but because I hate seeing the dystopia everywhere and I'm afraid of how these people are and I'm sick of being reminded I now live in a dystopian hellhole. Between seeing people with masks everywhere, the stupid six feet garbage, and the Covid mongering signs I see in every damn business, I have given up on going anywhere. I have already been harassed for not "social distancing" (I hate that Orwellian bs term) and not wearing a mask. And looking at social media, I see that the vast majority in this city are all loyal members of the Covid cult. I want nothing to do with this shit and it gives me tons of anger and anxiety every time I think about, let alone see it.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel, but try going out again, things are improving. Tonight there was a classic car show in my town and there were tons of people hanging out, chatting with the owners and having a good time. I only saw two masks on some very old people and no "social distancing". The checkout lady at the grocery store had her mask hanging down under her chin and about half the people there were mask-free.</p>
<p>Don't put too much stock in social media, it's all so fake. There might be people in your area who agree with you and who would be happy to see you resisting. It might help them be brave also.</p>

        <p>It's just too difficult these days, and I realized for the first time in my life just going about trying to do normal things gives me tremendous amounts of anxiety. It's not just all the horrid social media. Every where I go, I see people wearing masks. The grocery stores finally stopped mandating them a couple of weeks ago, but now they passed a law to mandate them again, so I basically won't go anywhere now because I refuse to play that stupid game by wearing the most obvious symbol of acceptance of this bullshit. Just putting one on makes me feel like I'm suffocating and that my humanity is being stripped away. </p>
<p>Every time I go out, I am reminded of how dystopian everything has become in the last few months. I keep thinking about the last normal day I had, back in March. I went shopping and then stopped by a restaurant to pick up dinner. It was packed, and no one had ever heard the term social distancing yet, and no one would have ever imagined putting on a mask unless they happened to have a career in  the medical profession. I keep remember what life was like not so long ago, and it's utterly depressing. I know I torture myself too much by watching MSM, going on social media, and reading bullshit media articles. But even if I stopped doing that, just stepping outside and trying to go anywhere I'm reminded that I'm stuck in this Orwellian nightmare. TV...full of Covid coverage and every ad has something to do with Covid. Turn on the radio in the car to hear some music...DJs mention Covid and so does every damn commercial break. Go into any restaurant, cafe, doctor's office, shop, store, or any damn public place that's open...Covid. Alarmist signs about how dangerous and deadly Covid is, laundry list of "guidelines" posted in every single public building. Stupid social distancing signs and reminders on the intercom in grocery stores. People are all wearing masks, hell, even morons driving alone in their cars or out jogging/biking (by the way, it's been 90+ degrees here every day for a while now) wear the ugly damn things.</p>
<p>That, combined with how angry I become whenever I think about how pretty much everything they say about Covid is a lie, how every piece of news and article I see looks like it comes from The Onion, and how everyone has just accepted it as the truth and become so brainwashed it truly can be called nothing short of mass psychosis. It's all extremely stress-inducing and just makes my anxiety go through the roof.</p>

        <p>We're under sustained psychological attack, and it's horrible, but please don't surrender, don't let these bastards get away with it. You're already resisting by commenting online - you're fighting back and that's pretty epic. </p>
<p>When I go out mask-free I get a serious adrenaline rush, but nothing has happened so far. I'm scared, but I force myself to do it anyway. When it's over, I feel weirdly elated to have gotten away with it. </p>

        <p>I never thought I'd see the day when not wearing a mask has become a revolutionary act. This is really how deep we're in this mess. I really hope one day this whole thing will just be a really bad dream and no one will ever speak of it again. I never want to hear the world "coronavirus" or "Covid" or "social distancing" or "masks" or "pandemic" ever again.</p>

        <p>All the major cities, yes. Because mayors and county judges in the big Texas cities tend to be virtue-signaling Democrats. Also, the place seems to be turning into California 2.0. It seems like it will never end, because each time the slightest amount of progress is made on the road back to the old normal, the media, social media idiots, and liberal politicians all come out and regress everything again.</p>

        <p>That's what I do: give 'em a big smile. Before the mask mandates, I couldn't help but scowl at anyone wearing a mask, but ever since my state made it mandatory, I've been smiling at everyone. I smile at the people who defy the mandate because I feel a sense of solidarity, and I smile at the people who obey the mandate because I want them to see my unmasked smile.</p>

<p>Seriously though, I've been blown away how easy it's been to get people to comply with this, with zero evidence. No matter who I ask. No matter how much I ask. Just the same points parroted back to me.</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask unless the specific location absolutely insists (doctors offices for example). I do go out wearing a single fingerless glove on my right hand. It's to help with a totally unrelated life-long medical condition. These days I just hope that people see it, think it's weird that I'm wearing only one glove, and a fingerless one at that, and leave me alone.</p>

        <p>It's horrifying how they were programmed.  Remember back when CDC and media and their  Lord Fauci himself were all saying don't wear masks? But then in April they did a full 180 and now everyone just accepts it and acts like it's good and protects and "cuz it's science!" None of these people would have ever given a thought about wearing a mask just several months ago. But now they act like they've always thought masks were a great idea.</p>

        <p>Not to mention, they’re basically ineffective, even if worn perfectly. Which I guarantee you nobody is doing. If I have to, I wrap this super light chiffon scarf around my face. That lightweight fabric is like gauze. It’s not blocking shit. But the optics of wearing it, that’s enough for people.</p>
<p>And that’s all you really need to know, isn’t it? If this was <em>really</em> about health. And <em>really</em> about curbing a virus, the type of mask <em>would</em> matter. But nobody cares. As long as you have some dipshit cloth over your face. Damn, as long as it’s not visible mesh, and even then...</p>
<p>I give the benefit of the doubt, because I’ve never trusted the government. But how so many people could hear them say, “no masks are ineffective” and then 2 months later...when by all metrics were basically out of the minimal surge we had...masks are becoming mandatory? And people just buy it? It scares me. 100% those are the same people who the government could say all LGBT people need to be avoided and rounded up, and they’d comply. “For the good of everyone”</p>

        <p>Well said, the most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly and easily so many were programmed into accepting the most inane bullshit ever. And now these people ridicule and shame anyone who doesn't comply with their horrific programming. Unbelievable. But yeah, now I know how the Nazis were able to do what they did. It's deeply lessened my view of and faith in the vast majority of people.</p>

        <p>Back in early march when they were starting to arbitrarily tell certain businesses to close, I started saying, "this is exactly how something like kristallnacht was able to happen."</p>
<p>God it's so frustrating. All this paranoia about "nazis" because a few losers want to play dress up and walk around with tiki torches. As though when the mythical nazis return, they'll look exactly like the ones 80 years ago. Well idiots were all so busy looking for them, they completely missed the true evil festering right under our noses.</p>
