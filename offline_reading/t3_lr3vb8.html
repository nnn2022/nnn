    <strong>Can you help me understand something quickly :)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Can a store implement an arbitrary policy and demand shoppers adhere to it?</strong> </p>
<p>I live in British Columbia where medical exemptions allow you to not wear a face mask. But Costco has implemented this "policy" where if you claim a medical exemption, they still require a plastic face shield. </p>
<p>According to the government order regarding face masks, "operators" such as Costco are not prohibited from making additional requirements (to face masks). But is anything additional not simply a frivolous store policy? </p>
<p>The Order actually only calls for cloth or medical face <em>masks</em>, not shields, so plastic face shields do not actually comply with the Order. For example, if Walmart said you can't wear masks, you have to wear a shield, that wouldn't comply with the Order, and Walmart could actually be fined for noncompliance. </p>
<p>So, can Costco actually make someone wear a face shield? i.e., if they call the police, can law enforcement make someone follow this store policy? (It technically has nothing to do with the mask mandate).</p>
<p>In my opinion this policy may as well be a pink shirt policy. "You can't shop here unless you wear a pink shirt." Can a store actually legally enforce such a made up policy?</p>
<p>And, is Costco violating the BC Human Rights Act by enforcing plastic face shields?</p></p>

        <p>Costco is different than a Safeway or Walmart because itâ€™s membership based.</p>

        <p>So you're saying, if someone is a member then they have to follow the face shield thing, or whatever other policy, is that right?</p>

        <p>They can and do enforce arbitrary policies, like you have to be a member to shop there. It's a publicly traded company, but don't be confused by that, they are operating a business on privately owned land, they have the right to refuse service, and set the rules. They don't have the right to decline service to a protected group, so they can't lock you out for being old, or gay.</p>
