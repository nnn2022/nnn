    <strong>Why you should care about NOT having a vaccine passport</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a computer engineer and have always closely followed privacy issues, and the vaccination passport is a very scary prospect for our privacy and freedom, maybe in more ways than you would think on the surface. I have been seeing some misconceptions in comments about ways to cheat the system, but they are way ahead of you on those. Unfortunately it is something that was probably going to happen someday regardless of a virus or not, particularly after the Chinese implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System">social credit</a>. The vaccine is used just as an excuse at this point. Personally I wouldn't even mind the later after waiting some time for long-term data, but the tracking that comes with a passport is unacceptable, and that is what we should be fighting.</p>
<p>Something I think should be clear is that there are two different, separate issues here, and they are both valid. The first is not wanting to take the vaccine. This is a valid standpoint, but basically solely an ethics question and a separate debate. The second is not wanting to present identification when entering all/a lot/some businesses, and this is the one I will talk about. The media/politicians will try to lump both together, but they are very distinct issues.</p>
<p>Technically the only thing you need to know is that you will have a bar code/QR code/ID number (doesn't even matter if it's on your phone or on a paper), and the place that you are entering has a digital scanner (a human checking papers is too easy to fool (and slow), so they are way ahead on that. To be able to admit you, your code has to be checked against a server-stored token, to prove your passport is legitimate. Whenever a request is performed against the server, it follows a log will be produced of that identification request. Something like <strong>"Mr John Smith, at Walmart SW LA, 03/03/2021, 3:15pm, does he have a vaccine/negative test/etc.?"</strong>, to which the server replies <strong>"yes/no"</strong>.</p>
<p>Now all kinds of web servers produce some sort of log, maliciously or not, but you will never be able to tell whether the system you are using does it or not. And given that a chain of web servers interact with each other on modern architectures, and logging is a default on modern (or old for that matter) programs, it's a given someone will do it. My objective with this post is to clear some confusion around what you could do to cheat the system, or to counter some arguments software agencies and health officials have been propagating. I'm not targeting any system in particular, but I'm attacking the system architecture that is being proposed, using the arguments I would use if someone pitched me a new system and I played the devil's advocate.</p>
<p>So looking at some of the misconceptions/workarounds I have seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"I'll use a paper one": Irrelevant. As long as the code is read by a machine, that machine will have to consult a server, to where your ID is sent. This is not a "disable your location services" kind of system, the tracking is done by the scanning party. No scanner? Maybe the clerk just types a number on his phone, same thing from a privacy standpoint, your ID is sent somewhere out of your control. Given that the trend is to replace human agents with machines (ticket control, store assistants, etc) I hardly believe we will see a new human-based job appearing. It will be like scanning your ticket at the train station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I'll get a fake passport": Could work only if the store/gate agent/whatever didn't have a digital scanner, and only looked at papers (knowing that this is cumbersome, and they know there will be cheaters, this will not be the case). If the verification is done on the server side nothing short of hacking that server would help you, and even then your "life log" could have already been backed up somewhere. "Things on the internet last forever" is true, in the sense that even if you delete something, you have no way of knowing if someone has saved a copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I'll share my passport with my friends to confuse them": The owner's photo might be stored on their server, and that will appear on their scanner, thus showing you are not the owner to a nearby agent/AI face recognition system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system">not sci-fi</a>, and at this point in time, the system could evolve into being just a camera on their end that could check you are indeed vaccinated and hence track you, no need to even have a paper).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I'll get my doctor friend to forge an exemption": Sure, you can escape the vaccine, but you still have to present your "exempt" passport, hence you are tracked just as anyone else. Same logic for negative tests, or for someone who was already infected. You are still an ID being associated with places. Should the purpose of the system be to track you, then it doesn't matter whether you have a vaccine or not, just that you comply with mandatory identification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The scanner does not contact any server, my QR code has a verifiable signed token that the scanner reads locally": Theoretically fine, but how can you be sure the scanner does what the government/ID provider tells you it does? Maybe it just stores your credentials locally for in-store tracking (the same way a store card would), but do you want that to be legally mandated? Maybe it shares them with some related companies for marketing. The point is if you do not know what the other party is doing, you do not participate. The best way for your nudes not to leak on the internet is not sharing them in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The passport does not have my name associated": You know bitcoin? It's paraded as the private currency. It's not controlled by any government. Yet, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/authorities-track-bitcoin-transactions-dark-web-drug-dealer-arrested/">the police has been able to arrest people</a> by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_attack">inference attacks</a>. These sort of attacks are very powerful, it is detective work but on a digital scale. Maybe to the passport you are just "John Doe", but you are the John Doe that checks-in every day to workplace X, that goes every week to Starbucks Y at a small town, that goes every month to state Z. It's not hard for law enforcement to then go around and find out who you are if they know your routine. You have nothing to hide? Until you are in the wrong place at the wrong time again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The government would not do such a thing, they care only about health": Lets suppose it is so. There is still a system that is capable of logging your whereabouts. And no system in the world is perfectly safe. Lets say it gets hacked. Now your life data is somewhere on the dark web being sold to the highest bidder. Maybe some house thiefs noticed that today you checked-in at a shop 1000 miles away from your workplace. The data is anonymized? Lets go back to the inference attacks. If the police is able to do it, so are hackers. And a database of life itself surely is a prime target for attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I really trust my friend's hacking skills": No system is perfect, so hacking it will be possible. But it's only a matter of time until your exploit gets fixed, so it will always be a game of cat and mouse. It's much easier for data to be stolen from the server as in the point above, since that attack only needs temporary access to the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We are already tracked everywhere": Sure. Visa tracks you. Mastercard as well. Facebook. Google. Your phone provider. But each has their own system. The police can request data from each one of them, which is a bureaucratic process. Banking in particular has old systems. And it's not all put together neatly in a system built from the ground up, where a simple query can show everything a given person has done throughout his life. And all of the former are opt-in too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Vaccination passports already exist": Come on, you are really telling me you have always shown a vaccination passport to buy groceries, to go to the cinema or for interstate travel? Might have been so to go to 4 or 5 African countries, nothing more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I have nothing to hide": Until whatever you did that was legal and allowed is not anymore. Royalty and even landowners in general had nothing to hide in Russia until 1917. Plus you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time and be accused of something you did not do. Maybe you checked in to to a restaurant and a supermarket the same day as a suspect, and the police wrongly put 2 and 2 together. And if they tell you it is private, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55541001">it's a matter of time until someone decides it is not</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's still soon to know implementations of the passport, and how often or where it will be used (international travel vs buying groceries). But knowing how a system is designed, and regardless of the "privacy level" they are parading, there will always be a lot of flaws on the concept itself. And forcing people to abdicate their privacy in every aspect of daily life, for whatever reason, is just appalling and downright unethical.</p>
<p>We need to shift the focus away from this being about the vaccine, and focusing on it being about tracking. Could have happened just as well after 9/11 if the tech was there. I know most people will cave in when they are told that they will not get a job without the passport, or won't be able to buy food. Unless we are aware of the ramifications of such a system, and go outside to protest or boycott it. Because once it's accepted it is not going anywhere. And remember, a vaccination tracking system is, first of all, a tracking system.</p></p>

<p>You honestly think that it'll end there?</p>
<p>Eventually, they'll probably disallow inter-state travel, maybe even travel outside of cities. You'll need to scan your health passport at what were once toll booths or other stations they set up. Maybe military checkpoints as was stated in the Canadian government leaks.</p>

        <p>There will eventually be checkpoints. If you are not in compliance you are a white nationalist(regardless of your race) then you are detained and will probably go to prison.  This is how they will get dissidents opposed to their great reset. The writing is on the wall at this point. Eventually a few brave souls rebel( they will be called terrorists) just listen to the fbi director about domestic terrorists. The global elite are using this virus for their endgame. Serfdom and slavery for the sheep and death and imprisonment for us. Some of us will fight and hide. This is a huge country with vast spaces. But be prepared to be labeled a terrorist and criminal with all that entails.</p>

        <p>One thing that covid and all these lockdowns has shown me, as a Canadian where I’m literally the only person I know who is against this; I’ve never even MET someone that doesn’t wear the mask—- it’s made me realize that even if everything goes back to normal tomorrow and it all ends; this isn’t a culture I want to live in long term or raise my future kids in.  (I’m 24M).  </p>
<p>Not an easy conclusion to come to, but with hearing about Texas opening, I realized that even if Canada does eventually go back to normal, I’m so disappointed and even disgusted with my fellow citizens that I realized I have no home here anyway.  I actually tried going to the states about a month ago on this volunteer farm trip (was gonna do WOOFING If you’ve heard of it), and was denied entry at the airport customs border.  Literally tried going to Texas (just based on what I’ve heard of Texas I thought they’d be the best) just to escape this shit.   But no luck.  Now I’m thinking about either Brazil or potentially Sweden.  I’ve got Irish citizenship so I can work in the EU.  Idk.  Anyone else have similar ideas?  I guess what I’m saying is I’ve lost faith in my country and I want to find a country to live in that’s actually got based people.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do either.</p>
<p>One good thing about the Canadian govt is that they are very incompetent in general, and aren't as dangerous an entity as the U.S govt. You may have more <em>legal</em> rights in the U.S, but their government is massively larger, and so I think their freedoms are actually at greater risk.</p>

<p>If other countries implement them, then yes, Canada will fall into line. The fact that Canada has implemented this insanity of Canadians requiring a covid test on arrival back to Canada and being forced to stay at a prison for $2000 worries me greatly. Today I read of a Canadian couple who arrived back in Vancouver, refused the covid test and then were locked in a room for over 2 hours where they were bullied and threatened to take their drivers license away for 2 years. </p>
<p>I mean, what the actual fuck. How in the hell are they getting away with this behavior? So I don’t trust Canada one iota anymore, with anything, but especially anything related to covid.</p>

        <p>&rt; do you think vaccine passports will be implemented here?</p>
<p>Without a doubt. This has all been decided long ago.</p>
<p>This is an old article, but even as articles like that were being published, people were being accused of being conspiracy theorists for discussing it: https://outline.com/EXyfeE</p>
<p>Even the ID2020 site says it's been in the works since 2016.</p>
<p>The idea of a vaccine passport is nothing new. This was just the perfect excuse to push the agenda forward.</p>
<p>Thanks to people's blind obedience and unquestioning submission, the psychopaths at the helm have no qualms targeting the tiny amount of people that object.</p>
<p>Way more people need to find the fucking balls to just say no. If this guy can, anyone can.  https://newtube.app/user/NoNewAbnormal/LMfub8e</p>

        <p>Also cdn, we do have an election semi soon. do you think if someone started campaigning now against all this draconian stuff and instead said we will stand against tyranny people would vote for it but more importantly donate money? Cause you need like 100k to run for pm right ? </p>
<p>I really don't think as many people are for it as are just afraid to speak up... Squeaky wheel gets the grease tho. </p>

<p>Your media is controlled by the people who pay for it (the government). </p>
<p>They will slander, insult and ridicule anyone who goes against the government narrative, especially if that person is running for office in Canada.</p>

        <p>I'm just seeing this now and wondering if you've furthered your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>As an Irish citizen, I would recommend the EU but not Ireland itself. As the saying goes: 'When America sneezes, Ireland gets the flu'.</p>
<p>Every EU state has it's problems but most seem inane compared to the US and Canada. For example: The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Spain are relatively independent-thinking - but that leads to it's own problems. IMO, you're better off travelling to any non-major city and finding a little space for yourself. Avoid Madrid but consider Granada, as a random example.</p>

        <p>Im totally against vaccine passports on principal, but it seems they already have everything they could possibly need to know about you unfortunately. </p>
<p>Here's a recent personal example </p>
<p>Did you know that you can't even buy a last minute international ticket without getting pulled over at the airport for questioning? Happened to me recently, I saw a good deal and wanted to fly next day to another continent. CBP pulled me aside and knew absolutely everything about my life, they got some details wrong so I realized it was all based on some sort of digital database that wasn't super up to date (didn't account for some changed life plans etc). And here's the thing, I never posted online anywhere about some of this stuff, and the only way they would know is from friends/family social media posts or, for one detail, personal messages. On one little detail there's no way anyone would have posted about it online, it was a private matter but they somehow knew. They say it's for "safety" and I'm sure it is, but there's a way bigger security issue here.</p>
<p>I guess I'm wondering why they would implement these passports if they already have everything on lock it seems. This was within the past few months.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that we are already widely tracked. Facebook for example is infamous for inferring some very specific details.</p>
<p>But I can still go to a local coffee shop or restaurant, take no phone, pay with money and, short of face ID cameras becoming widespread, no one will know I was there. Making a passport mandatory, however, greatly simplifies their work and just seals the deal in absolute life tracking. I am sure my local barber would not care about such a thing, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/lifestyle/hair-salons-reopen-with-new-virus-rules-in-austria/vi-BB1dvn0i">but if passport scanning is made mandatory to admit patrons, with fines and police enforcement</a>, he will have to cave.</p>

        <p>I see. So the concern is more around requiring it for everyday things, not just travel. So far at least in the US I've only seen talks around using it for travel so I was confused by some of the elements in your post, although really appreciate you breaking things down and clarifying.</p>
<p>What do you think the goal/objective would be for the US government to track things at that level though? Really just "public health"/"safety? Isn't it an obvious personal security risk for not much gain?</p>

<p>Well <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/28/green-pass-how-are-vaccine-passports-working-in-israel">Israel infamously is using it to segregate people already</a>. EU in general has been vague, the US even more so, but it's best we become aware of what it can be sooner than late.</p>
<p>&rt; What do you think the goal/objective would be for the US government to track things at that level though? Really just "public health"/"safety? Isn't it an obvious personal security risk for not much gain?</p>
<p>I cannot speak for what the US government or big corporations want to do with it, but China does use tracking systems to control society, limiting the rights of everyone who is a "criminal", ranging from murderers to activists whose crime is criticizing the government. We cannot say what the system will be used for besides vaccinations, but once it's in place then the possibilities are limitless. We can even assume the government is the good guy and only cares about health, but such a system is a hotbed for exploitation from criminals too (imagine thieves being able to know when someone is away from home). The fact that the media parades this as a very safe and private system is worrying though. I doubt many people understand the personal risk implications of it if the media does not talk about them.</p>

        <p>It's not really that surprising to me because Israel has a population that they want to desperately track. This is their excuse to have a complete police state to rid them of the "Palestinian scourge". Now they track them all in real time.</p>
<p>Interesting that this was the same thing the Germans did (with less technology of course).</p>

It's not hard for law enforcement to then go around and find out who you are if they know your routine. You have nothing to hide? Until you are in the wrong place at the wrong time again.</p>
<p>I would say this point applies. Your identity could still be found out if, for some reason, you are "flagged" for investigation (you were in the wrong place at the wrong time), by investigating your routine.</p>
<p>Now if you did something that you really want to be anonymous, lets say go to a motel to meet your lover every Friday then yes, you can use the fake passport just for that, and it's unlikely it would come back to you. The more you use a passport the less anonymous it becomes. The main difference from fake IDs is that your presence at a place was not logged into a database, just checked by a human.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on everything except that this "isn't about a vaccine". The vaccine (and its ramifications) are very much tied in with this tracking system. Without the vaccine, there is no tracking system, or at least, no excuse <em>for</em> said tracking system. </p>
<p>I also think the people who say they will bribe their doctors or fake documents for the vaccine are full of themselves. Hell, all of the doctors I've interacted with are all for the masks, vaccines, and the new normal. I think most of them are being paid quite handsomely to endorse this stuff. Sure, a few might be able to get away with falsifying vaccine records, but as you say with regards to the tracking system, it likely won't last forever. Something will give eventually.</p>

        <p>I believe this would have happened after 9/11 if smartphones and the internet were just as widespread back then as they are now (store scanners can be any camera smartphone and any store will have one laying around, plus an internet connection, both of which were rare in 2001). The vaccine is just an excuse in regards to tracking. A "vaccine passport" and an "I-am-exempt-from-the-vaccine passport" are exactly the same tracking-wise.</p>

        <p>Very interesting points but you're missing the main purpose of the system.</p>
<p>It's a PERMISSION system not a tracking system.</p>
<p>And the elites will ALWAYS get green because they'll have the special server flag set. No testing or vaccines required for them. The fact that the rest of us will need to be injected with whatever the government wants, to get permission to, basically, exist, is appalling. And it's unlikely to stop there. If these systems get in place for long periods of time, there's no telling what radical demands will be placed on the users. They could force you to do literally anything with attempted suicide being the only way out.</p>

        <p>&rt; "I'll get my doctor friend to forge an exemption": Sure, you can escape the vaccine, but you still have to present your "exempt" passport, hence you are tracked just as anyone else. Same logic for negative tests, or for someone who was already infected. You are still an ID being associated with places. Should the purpose of the system be to track you, then it doesn't matter whether you have a vaccine or not, just that you comply with mandatory identification.</p>
<p>This point applies. You do not have the vaccine, but your whereabouts will be tracked regardless. That is why I say the vaccine is just an excuse, and this could have happened after 9/11 as well. The point is that your every move will be logged. The only workaround is if you went to the hospital every day to get a new passport. And that will not work anymore if the passport becomes biometric based (face ID).</p>

        <p>That is not my point. Yes, you will "have a vaccine" for all intents and purposes. Yes, they will grant you a passport. That is not the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that then you will go about your daily life, going to the restaurant and having that passport scanned. Going to work and having that passport scanned. Everything you do will be stored in a server, regardless of whether you have a vaccine, a fake passport or a medical exemption. The system will track you and that is my whole point with the post.

        <p>100% agreed, this is a much easier system to implement than cameras as done in China to track every person. Or maybe this is just getting people warmed up to the idea of full tracking via camera. </p>
<p>Don’t also forget during your doctors visit they can say vax no longer working and you need more. Or you have not met your 5 exercises a week you are banned from this set of restaurants. </p>
<p>Allows the govt to normalize creating classes of citizens. Once the govt gets power they will only push harder</p>

<p>When I go to a restaurant now with my roommate, I always give fake information (Fox Mulder and Dana Scully with the phone number for the state's FBI building for those X-Files fans).  I will always resist, but that was not the point I was making.  I will always give as much false information as I can.</p>

        <p>We can agree that during bootstrapping the system can be easily forged, it's the implications of the daily use that moved me to post this. If we only focus on dodging the system now but accept the passport thinking that a fake vaccine is enough they will have gotten their way with it (tracking people) regardless.</p>

        <p>If you manage to get a new fake passport each time you visit a store then by all means, it will be very hard to track who you are.</p>
<p>If you use the same fake passport everywhere then it is still possible to infer who you are.</p>
<p>If the passport becomes biometric, only changing your face for each store visit would help you then.</p>

        <p>Yes, for sure, but the idea is not to evade tracking completely. That would raise suspicion. In an authoritarian state you kind of accept this, and plan for the worst case scenario, your fake IDs are a last resource. Something you use to escape, or to at least hide yourself from vigilance in specific situations. </p>
<p>It is not too much different from the usage of fake documents by criminals, and it makes sense, as in a authoritarian state everyone is considered potentially a criminal by the State.</p>

        <p>As a fellow computer engineer, I do completely agree with all you said.
Any data possible will be sucked up, abused and stored.</p>
<p>What I fear is the ability to delete you. You can of course get your passport invalidated and stoped at the border or your credit card blocked, but with covid passport one server (as a design not a machine) will control your entire life.
Even if you assume no malicious actions, think about how unprofessional and fucked up governments and bureaucrats are.</p>

        <p>I talk about those too. You cannot just throw "encryption" at something and be done with it. Those approaches still have a lot of problems. Is the owner of the keys trustworthy? Even if so, identity can still be found via inference or side-channel attacks.</p>

        <p>I’d think you could get a huge amount of privacy and security for a large amount of the population with the private key stores on Apple/Android. The keys are reasonably secure. </p>
<p>I mean I guess you could issue people some kind of token or app to do it as well. Open source the app, have it vettted by the privacy/security community. Something along the lines of the axolotl ratchet protocol signal uses.</p>
<p>I’m opposed to the idea but I believe it could be done with privacy in mind. It’s incredibly unlikely it’ll be implemented thar way though.</p>

        <p>Even then you have to trust something blindly, because the system cannot be fully open-source. You would have to open-source whatever is inside the scanners (assuming they are just smartphones it will never happen Apple-wise), down to the CPU if you want to be really sure, and even then it's prone to zero-day attacks. Even iPhones are not uncrackable.</p>
<p>Then there is the whole question of, even if the system is publicly verified and audited, how can anyone really be sure that it's that exact system that they are using in practice and not another one? There are hardware enclaves to try and solve that, but then you will have to trust their manufacturer. Given Intel's <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/minix-intels-hidden-in-chip-operating-system/">track record in hardware dependability</a>, I will wager they are not to be trusted.</p>

        <p>You seem to be looking for something with 100% perfect security. It’s simply not possible. Everything including security outside of technology is built to essentially “good enough” standards.  Anything can be broken into and/or subverted with enough resources.  </p>

        <p>&rt; You seem to be looking for something with 100% perfect security. It’s simply not possible.</p>
<p>What would be a good trust base for such a system? Having in mind that, being mandatory for hundreds of millions in the least, should be held up to the highest standards. To me, there are just too many variables to account for the system to be viable, the ethical side of it a significant one. And having seen how things work out in real life, it will not be nowhere near as safe as its security model describes.</p>
<p>Currently I can still go to the restaurant without a phone and pay with cash, same for groceries or even going to the cinema. A system like what is being implemented in Israel just closes that (significant) gap.</p>

        <p>If you carry your phone, then yes, the tracking can be even more precise than what OP describes with the ID scanners.</p>
<p>However, as he points out, they are not required and you can "opt-out" at any point, even temporarily, by not taking it with you. You'd still be able to go about your day.</p>
<p>The darker side of the vaccination passport scenario assumes that you will be discriminated against or even barred from entering normal places and part-taking in normal activities. Including your job, shopping for good, traveling.</p>

<p>Indeed, it's been around for a long time. This is not what OP is talking about. You just have to look at the wiki page to see the difference:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Certificate_of_Vaccination_or_Prophylaxis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Certificate_of_Vaccination_or_Prophylaxis</a></p>
<p>Study the scans of the pages, and notice that there are no IDs, besides maybe a scribbled name. There are no barcodes, QR codes. Despite being called a "passport" in the article, it really isn't. It doesn't <em>identify</em> you like a normal national password would. Although, as OP points out, in a very few rare cases, it has <em>authorized</em> you to enter certain countries.</p>
<p>OP's scenario assumes that the new covid passport will be all digital. Most likely on your phone, but a QR code on a piece of paper does the same job. You've maybe seen them on concert tickets or airline tickets. Same thing. It identifies you by matching the scanned ID number to a database that already has all your other information. And at that point, it also adds a record of the fact that it was scanned.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, you might object that this is harmless. However, there have already been interesting cases where random innocent bystanders have been pulled in by a police drag-net approach. My favorite was a cyclist in NY who was questioned because he happened to cycle past a shop where a robbery was taking place. How did the police know? They subpoenaed Google Android &amp; Maps for <em>all the phones in the area at the time</em>.</p>
<p>OP's scenario might be dystopian. However, technically, it is by no means far-fetched. In fact, all the technology needed is already implemented cheap and in daily use today.</p>
