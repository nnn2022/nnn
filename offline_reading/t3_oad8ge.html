        <p>Broadband Counter-Electronics Weapon project is to “develop a more compact and lightweight long-range counter-electronic vehicle/vessel stopping system to support long range non-lethal vehicle/vessel stopping missions,” according to the Navy research announcement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Wants A Better Microwave Weapon. Will The Police Also Use It?</p>
<p>The U.S. military wants a more powerful non-lethal microwave weapon to knock out the engines of cars and boats.</p>
<p>This device could also be used by U.S. law enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office has already developed a microwave weapon – the Radio Frequency Vehicle Stopper – for disabling vehicles and ships. The device works by using high-powered microwave (HPM) pulses that knock out the engine’s electronic control unit, causing the engine to stall. Rather than firing bullets into a car or boat engine – and risk killing the occupants – these radio-frequency weapons are a non-lethal way to stop vehicles from crashing through checkpoints, or boats that refuse to stop and be boarded.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether the Radio Frequency Vehicle Stopper has already been deployed. “The Coast Guard does not employ Radio Frequency Vessel Stoppers during law enforcement or other operations,” the U.S. Coast Guard told me, while the Navy could not confirm any deployments at press time.</p>
<p>What is clear that the military isn’t satisfied with current technology. Existing radio-frequency vehicle stoppers “have known range and overall system size and weight limitations,” said the Navy, which wants a device that is smaller, lighter, requires less power and cooling, and is cheaper to manufacture.
Current HPM vehicle-stoppers are bigger than 160 cubic feet, weigh 1,000 pounds and cost about $1 million, according to the Navy. The new BCEW system should be around 3 cubic feet, weigh just 50 to 100 pounds, and cost only $50,000 to $100,000.
