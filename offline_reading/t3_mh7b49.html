        <p>I think an interesting trend in Michigan coronavirus cases is the age group that it is affecting: </p>
<p>&rt;COVID-19 cases in Michigan among kids ages 10 to 19 have risen 133% in the last four weeks, faster than any other age group as the state confronts another spike in virus cases.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's also the first time during the pandemic that this age group has led in confirmed and probable cases in Michigan, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/03/26/michigan-has-a-new-leader-in-the-surge-of-covid-cases-kids/4750748001/">https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/03/26/michigan-has-a-new-leader-in-the-surge-of-covid-cases-kids/4750748001/</a></p>
<p>This is coinciding with many public schools reopening full time (instead of virtual or 2 day/week in-class periods), which only goes to show that the best way to reduce the number of cases is to remain in lockdown. However you see the importance of preventing new cases, that is up to your interpretation.</p>
<p>I don't know why everyone is so against Whitmer, people here are calling her power hungry when she's been trying to reopen the state. Even with cases going up, she hasn't planned to do anything to shutdown the state again. So these people are not only ignoring the story but are instantly complaining about Whitmer without caring what she is planning on doing. Many of these people also turn a blind eye to the fact that a dozen or so men were plotting to kidnap her.</p>
