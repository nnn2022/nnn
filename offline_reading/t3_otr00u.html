        <p>It's hard to keep seeing that the most effective ways to have these people see the truth for what it is, is to have them first handed experience the horrific life altering side effects of this  experimental "clot shot"   :(</p>
<p>I truly wish that the majority would/will be able to break through their brainwashing before it severely negatively affects their health... May the others who currently have their blindfolds on tight be able to come to the realizations of the truth - before their physical selves are too far damaged.</p>

        <p>You are too kind with these people. </p>
<p>They preface their stories of pain and suffering with, "but you should totally get the vaccine". That is evil. They have extreme side effects but PUSH this onto others. Trials starting with 5 year old kids now or something. Vile people all around</p>

        <p>Yes their actions and words and intents are/may come across as evil, but I still try to remain onto some hope that at least some of the brainwashed will still come around. I may draw the line at calling a person a fully lost cause maybe a little later than others will on this sub. But I know that with some people it takes longer than expected to break thru their many years of indoctrination, to be able to see the truths for what they are. </p>
<p>If it makes me too naive, that's fair. But I will continue to be "too kind" to some of which appear so utterly lost. Every person who is able to rip the blindfold of ignorance off of them, even if it takes them longer than normal, is worthy of compassion in my eyes. I still try to anchor the faith that there are many on the other side who may still be worth saving.</p>

        <p>I check out that subreddit at least once a day. A lot of women having menstruation problems. I wonder what the hell that is about.</p>

        <p>I've read through a bunch of posts like this recently, in various places. People have posted screen caps of posts similar to these that are making the rounds on social media, as well. More and more with each day that passes. A part of me feels sorry for these people. The stories of what people are going through are really sad. A part of me feels bad. The other part of me is like, fucking told yall about this. Tried to warn you. All you had to do was wait, give it some time to see what happens. You didn't want to fucking listen.</p>
<p>These people are going to be dealing with this shit for the rest of their days. Probably get worse for some of them. We'll have a better idea of how much worse in a couple of months, this fall and winter when it's peak flu season. I think it's going to be a shit show. We fucking warned them.</p>
