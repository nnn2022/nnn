    <strong>Anyone have weird symptoms for weeks? Possibly from vaccine shedding?</strong>
    <p><p>I know this may seem crazy, but I just wanted to see if anyone else is in the same boat. I've hung out with a few vaxxed people in the past few weeks, and I've also been having really weird symptoms. For about two to three weeks now, I've felt really lightheaded, dizzy at times, fatigued, had on and off diarrhea and heartburn, and haven't felt able to get a full breath (and when I do force it, there's a sharp pain in the middle of my chest). I went to urgent care and they did exam, labs, nerve test, and EKG that all looked fine. I had a slight fever of 99. I didn't get tested for COVID, but maybe it's possible I have that or just some symptoms of that? Or maybe it's just anxiety? I really don't know. I feel like it's pretty unlikely the symptoms are from shedding, as that hasn't even been proven or studied much yet, but I just wanted to check and see. Any ideas??</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same way too. My oxygen level was at 97, low fever of 100.5, when I tested negative for covid. Recently, a bunch of people at work were vaccinated. Correlation? Causation?</p>
<p>Edit: Or, I’m pregnant. Whoopee!</p>

        <p>The urgent care doctor said that too! I checked yesterday and got a negative. I'm on the mini pill and still breastfeeding my 2 year old around the clock so it's unlikely. But I'll check again today.</p>

        <p>Haha! Yup I'm definitely female. The mini pill has the same pill all month, so no placebo week. I haven't even gotten by period since I was pregnant with my son. Could be hormonal though. I'm seeing my naturopath tomorrow to see what she says. I'm starting to think adrenal fatigue could be a possibility. All the symptoms seem to line up.</p>

        <p>Id recommend using formula for a little while just to be safe. The entire reason I'm on here is because a vaxxed person made me violently ill. I have 3 day periods and I bled for 2 weeks. Cramps for 2 weeks. Chest and stomach pain. I felt like i was "wrung out"  I tested negative for covid. I social distance and use masks. Dont really come into contact with people for my job and take my breaks alone. I know who made me sick. And the censorship around this really woke me up.</p>

        <p>Why formula?  Nothing better than mothers breast milk?</p>
<p>Op eat healthy, take some good vitamins (not the sugar crap filled vitamins found at gnc) and keep on breast feeding your child.  It's not easy to keep up with the demand of breastfed children and it can take a toll on your system.  My wife is breastfeeding our second now at 20 months old and there are days where she has similar symptoms. It goes away.</p>

        <p>Yep, I haven’t been feeling well since the 2nd weekend of March when I was around multiple people vaccinated. I had a period that got super heavy and I only had a break for a week, then it started again and lasted 3 weeks. 2 weeks of bleeding, people at my dads job got vaccinated and he also went to a big event, my bleeding got worse and heavier after this despite it slowing down.  And I’m on birth control and don’t get periods, the only thing that made it stop was a calcium supplement. </p>
<p>Easter came around and I was exposed again, slowly getting worse and worse. This is the weekend I started bleeding heavy the 2nd time. Wasnt able to tolerate food without severe pain, then the severe diarrhea and colon inflammation, 1 instance of vomiting. Started and lasted for 2 1/2 -3 weeks. I thought I had C. diff! Again this got worse after my dad went to the event, and I asked him if he was feeling ok or if there was something wrong with his stomach, because I felt he brought a stomach virus home because my condition worsened for no reason. I’m still struggling to eat and I’m still having problems.</p>

        <p>Wow, that sounds awful!! I'm so sorry you're experiencing all of that. I had C. Diff after giving birth from being put on antibiotics, and it was awful. Thankfully I haven't had my period since I was pregnant with my son, but I do worry about having those crazy menstrual symptoms. So many people have shared about this! I had PMDD and crazy periods in the past, so I can only imagine how it could be worse. I really pray you start feeling better soon!! Thank you for sharing!</p>

        <p>Oh for crying out loud, the shedding story is bonkers.</p>
<p>One point about rejecting the 'new normal' is to stop succumbing to media-induced health anxiety (social media is still <em>media</em> btw).</p>
<p>You're young, you're fine. Congrats on the kid! You'll both be fine even if you catch the Wuhan Cough.</p>

        <p>I am a massage therapist and get sick after massaging newly vaccinated people (headache, burning eyes, sore throat and ears, sinus drain, fatigue, nausea).  My symptoms last a few days, and by the time I start to feel better I seem to get another dose and the cycle starts over.  Has anyone found a way to counter the effect.  It seems that the usual immune boosters have no effect.  If I have been tracking right, after two weeks the shedding seems to slow down and my allergic response doesn't get triggered.</p>

        <p>I find it hard to believe you weren't tested for the rona at the urgent care. The fear at urgent care, we'd and doc offices is even more real and they want to make sure if you step foot in there that you're not a rona zombie carrier.</p>
