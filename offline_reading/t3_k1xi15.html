    <strong>COVID shaming</strong>
    <p><p>Getting really sick of people shaming politicians or other prominent people when they contract COVID. Like it's some kind of karma because they didn't do it "the right way so now they get to pay for it". So what's that say for you when you get COVID? You're an idiot? Just saw a damn post about the governor of WY getting COVID and everyone is there condemning him and calling him an idiot because he believes in personal responsibility rather than a sweeping mandate on masks. Not to mention the old tired "drunk driving" analogy. ðŸ¤¦ When Trump got it the damn world around was laughing and cheering. What, so if their guys got it then... What? Just sick of the politicization of this fucking case of the sniffles.</p></p>

        <p>It's becoming a crime to be sick. We are going backwards to a modern day version of the witch trials are repeating themselves among the little people. The Trump positive test thing really laid out in the open how empathetic these good people really are. So it's not alright for anyone else to get the virus but people you don't agree with? Then if someone you know gets sick then all of a sudden the world needs to stop? Not how the real world works. Never in my life have I seen paranoia and projection create such a monster. I also despise the drunk driving comparison, do I need to even explain this one because anyone with 2 functioning brain cells knows why it's just plain dumb.</p>

        <p>A family member of mine currently has it and I would never say he's an idiot. My governor shares the same idea as WY's governor. People hate her but what I don't understand is, you're free to wear a mask or not. So if you want to, then wear it. If you're extra concerned about the people in your city not wearing one then stay home. These people are paranoid and are okay with locking themselves down, but there's some of us who can't afford to lock down or just don't want to live in fear. I've spent this year pretty much doing things as I normally would but following mask mandates in stores I shop at and we have one of the worst infection rates in the nation. 
The drunk driving analogy and the seatbelt analogy are like nails on a chalkboard for me. It's such a cop-out of a rebuttal and it doesn't even measure up to the same thing.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's becoming a crime to be sick.</p>
<p>You should see the comments in my city sub about medical exemptions for masks. People saying no one has a genuine exemption, and if they really are that sick they shouldn't be outside in the first place. People getting angry at anyone who says they have an exemption "oh they're lying anti-maskers, don't give them an easy out."</p>
<p>I've started hyperventilating with masks, but I'm afraid to claim exemption because of comments like that combined with the public posting of photos and shaming of strangers. I just need groceries.</p>

        <p>It's not a 'case of the sniffles' for a good portion of society like my 69 year old father and mother who died from this virus.</p>
<p>Time to wake the blip up: This virus is real and it is FATAL to a good portion of people over 60 years of age and with minor pre-existing conditions (usually both) for some reason that we do not quite understand.</p>
<p>There is evidence of vitamin and mineral depletion in some people who are having to go on ventilators but there are also cases like that of the bodybuilder who literally had CoVid-19 eat him away while on the ventilator where people were healthy before this and nearly died or actually died.</p>

        <p>For most people, it is mild.  For some older and unfortunate few, it is very lethal.  I am sorry about your dad.</p>
<p>I also just want to point out that bodybuilders aren't usually very healthy people.  They do a lot of extreme dieting with bulk and cut cycles and often use performance enhancing substances that are not great for them.  One guy I know has labs that show that his kidneys are being damaged from his diet, use of things like pre-workout, and a lot of other things.</p>

        <p>And my friend died at 49 in the hospital with the flu. Thatâ€™s what happens. People get sick. They die. My mom died in her 40â€™s from a slew of things. There is and always will be things fatal to older or weaker people. Wake up to the reality of nature.</p>
