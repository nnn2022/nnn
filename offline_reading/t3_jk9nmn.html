    <strong>If you are on here complaining about the new normal and you're not going to protests or helping in the resistance you need to nut up or shut up.</strong>
    <p><p>I know I sound a bit like an asshole by saying that but seriously, if you're posting about how shit the laws in your country are and how it'll never be back to normal and you're not doing anything about it you need to shut your mouth. </p>
<p>We have to understand we are the minority, we need to be louder, more dedicated and hard working than the general population if we're going to fix this. That means protesting, volunteering your skills to the resistance, speaking your mind to friends and family and NOT COMPLYING to the new rules.</p>
<p>Ideas are fine but ACTION is what creates change.</p>
<p>Stay strong u/nonewnormal</p></p>

        <p>Yes exactly!</p>
<p>I do want to be careful though, for all those who are reading this I think the whole "silence is violence" thing from BLM is moronic and I don't want to go down that road. HOWEVER if someone is complaining then I think it should be backed up by action.</p>

        <p>“I don’t want to go down that road”, as you go down that road. I bet there’s a lot of stuff you believe in but don’t actively protest. People can do what they want. You’re not the leader. You’re a fake MD, a liar, and you’re trying to get everyone to agree with you or else they’re wrong. You just said that essentially your post is moronic since your post literally translates to silence is violence.</p>

        <p>I would love to go to a local protest but reddit censors events like that. Besides people here are sheep and would never even think of protesting.</p>

        <p>Not sure where to look though. I don't have Facebook or Twitter and they would never post any protests on Nextdoor.</p>

        <p>Don't be so aggressive, and let people choose. I don't wear a mask when 95% of the people do here in my region. I'm doing my part. Tell people who you are close to or live with to change their minds.</p>
<p>Being an activist requires some significant sacrifices, which many people here will not agree.</p>
<p>We have families, and people who care for us, and they are often on a different level even if they do agree with being anti-lockdown.</p>
<p>Of course if it gets way worse and for example I feel suicidal nothing is going to stop me because it'll be based on emotions and screw my family's feelings. I don't want to stoop to that level.</p>
<p>How far should it be taken if they don't listen to peaceful protests? Riots? Get guns and randomly kill everyone that disagrees with you? I think that's actually one of the signs of the end times, where masses just clash with one another and everything implodes. Zero gain, all losses.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely going down the silence is violence road. Saying you don’t want to go down that road doesn’t make you magically be not going down that road. </p>
<p>This post also assumes that everyone is in the same place with their NNN journey. They aren’t. Some people come here just as they are starting to question the narrative. I’d say this is militant and unwelcoming to those people.</p>
<p>Purity spirals always backfire so let’s not.</p>
