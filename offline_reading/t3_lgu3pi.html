    <strong>Have you changed your view about covid 19 during the last year?</strong>
    <p><p>I personally do not believe in the existence of a new virus that didn't exist before 2020 and that either is man made nor lab created. </p>
<p>What I do think based on common sense and statistics (since ain't a virologist or an academic by any means)</p>
<p>What I think of covid is basically that is a rebrand of all respiratorie illnesses, flu, cold, bronquitis, pneumonia etc. 
To support my thought is a 98% of decrease in those diseases starting march 2020, not only in places where they had had strong restrictions but also in the ones that didn't (such a Sweden, Florida, Texas and so on). And this was certainly planned, since I dont believe in coincidences when it comes to power and control. </p>
<p>Most people in this sub believes that covid exist but is blown out of proportion to enforce Draconian restrictions, most people believe that this wasn't planned and it was more like power taking advantage of the situation. </p>
<p>Is there people in this sub who have changed your view about covid 19 during the past year? </p>
<p>Would you mind sharing your experience about it?</p></p>

        <p>I'm genuinely on the fence about those questions, I know the virus hasn't been purified/isolated (I don't need help finding articles that say it has lol) and even if it has it does not meet Koch's postulates which is enough for me tbh. But if the virus did exist, I know for a fact it's blown out of proportion, has an IFR of 0.5% and anything under the sun is marked as a corona death</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to push you, but what you wrote it makes more sense that you don't believe the virus exist.</p>
<p>Could it be that you want to believe that the virus exist just because otherwise you would feel even more lost and that would make you question your believes in authority = you would questions other conspiracy theories?</p>

        <p>Well there is no way to know whether or not it's been rebranded. If it has than it exists. It's literal "gas lighting". Like putting a different engine in the shell of a competing car brand. Unless someone looks under the hood, which is unlikely, they wouldn't know the difference since the emblem is (insert brand) on the hood and the car runs.</p>
<p>Even if they did look under the hood would they know what they're looking at? A mechanic would but your average person with no knowledge of cars?</p>
<p>Extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>So now we see people are definitely getting sick but from what is debatable. I think it's safe to say over 90% of the public know nothing of virology and sadly it seems you can apply that to the "experts" considering how many of their predictions have missed the mark, and that's putting it nicely.</p>
<p><em>"I confused cause at the first comment you said you thought is overblown which implies existence."</em></p>
<p>Yes this is possible. Say someone smells something burning and starts screaming : "FIRE! FIRE"</p>
<p>Everyone in the vicinity can smell it too but start trying to investigate whether something is actually on fire or if it's something that is only smoldering or if it's just burnt food. When they discover what it actually is,it turns out to be something over cooked and there is no threat. Whomever yelled "FIRE" was being an alarmist and his assessment was overblown. I <em>think</em> this is what u/Harryisamazing is saying.</p>
<p>The authorities declared people were getting sick from a novel virus. They determined everyone was at extreme risk yet here we are still living, a good chunk of us not wearing masks or openly or unconsciously violating social distancing and other arbitrary rules and are still very much alive.</p>
<p>I think a growing number of people are fatigued with these measures and their starting to see that despite them violating "protocol" they're still alive. They also believe, albeit naively, this will end at some point since most people listen to the MSM unquestionably.</p>

        <p>No. I've always thought SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with an aggregate case fatality rate of 1% (far lower among the young and healthy), and government is an abusive parasite that takes what it can get. Grand conspiracies give the elite too much credit, but opportunistic conspiracies are how they maintain status.</p>

        <p>I took this very seriously in the beginning. I was hopeful but very worried for the potential for this to be a life altering pandemic that could affect my loved ones. As it marched on I changed my opinion in light of the evidence that came out. I'm embarrassed at how hard I locked down but id rather admit to that than to dig my heels in, double down and refuse to admit when I'm wrong. I think there is substantial evidence to accept that covid is real, I'm not buying some of the conspiracy stuff being discussed here, I think this is just a really simple case of mass hysteria, which has happened many times throughout history. Social media is the single largest factor in driving this forward, and it is the first of what will be many dramatic moral panics that will grip us and be driven by sassy Twitter people dictating the moral direction of... shoot, the world. I hope we use the space force to nuke Twitter, reddit and Facebook. That's the only way we are gonna prevent this from continuing.</p>

        <p>(Not the whole picture, but) I don’t think anyone is ready to have the 5G conversation. There’s been way too much propaganda making fun of it, when in reality it’s fairly straightforward if you understand basic quantum theory and the science behind the spirit.</p>

        <p>it's a great question and for a long time I thought yes, but there seems to be more questions being raised lately about nobody actually being able to scientifically isolate the Covid virus in a lab and if that is true then it certainly makes you wonder, right?</p>

        <p>For me is more than the isolation/purifying thing (that btw apply to other viruses as well) for me is more like all other respiratorie illness have disappeared since covid. Also yes of course when you get into how they generated the sequence of the virus with a software, and same goes to doubtful PCR tests.  Yes it makes you wonder.</p>

        <p>Mm interesting</p>
<p>just to play devils advocate:</p>
<p>Did everybody had same symptoms?</p>
<p>How do you know that many of the people around you had it wasn't the usual diseases of every year, perhaps some variations as every year?</p>
<p>Regarding the taste and smell most respiratorie illnesses can have that outcome as well?</p>
<p>What was the take of your father and grandfather on covid where they scared? Was it during flu season?</p>
<p>I give you my personal experience, I rarely get sick, I might feel down for a day or somethin, yes many times runny nose or allergy. But about 5 years ago I got a really bad flu, like Damm sick for 3/4 days, I understood then that the flu can kill you, if 5 years ago when I got that flu I would have heard that there's a new deadly virus that had those flu symptoms I would have thought that I've got that new virus because I never felt like that before. </p>
<p>Also have in mind that even I felt bad sick during 3/4 days I didn't go to a hospital, because is a usual situacion for some people. </p>
<p>Another interesting thing to point out is that when I got sick like that I was in a very humid room with humidity smell and talking to other people they also tell me that they got really bad flu exposed to humidity.</p>

        <p>I don't know if I totally agree or just partly. I'm positive that cold and flu cases are being counted as covid. I know first hand that the testing has false positives. I know the actual effects are pretty much the same as the cold. </p>
<p>Hey anyone remember the videos of people just walking down the street in china and suddenly falling over in spasms? What happened to the Covid that caused that?</p>

        <p>I was mildly peeved until the symptom list came out and realized that I'd already had it and was mildly irritated but otherwise fine. I didn't even really feel that sick, just had symptoms.</p>
<p>Otherwise not really, I lived through H1N1, H2N5, H3N2, and likely SARS in the last 15 years. Only H1N1 was bad enough to leave me bed ridden.</p>

        <p>No, I was sceptical from Day 1 and became even more sceptical when footage suddenly started leaking from China of people dropping dead in the street. Nothing ever leaks from China, but suddenly, the Great Firewall of China became partially permeable for only C19 videos of people dropping dead in the street.</p>

        <p>I did not. My mom started showing symptoms of covid in late 2020's.  We went to the hospital and they diagnosed both my mom and dad for covid. Thankfully my dad didn't get affected that much but my mom had to stay in the hospital for a week. Once she recovered she still got asthma as a result of her lungs getting badly injured. It was a very stressful experience. She is fine now though.</p>
