    <strong>How far are you willing to go?</strong>
    <p><p>I literally am ready to go homeless, and even go outside of society and cities, which I have done in the past so I even know what that mean, how many of you are willing to give up everything they have just to escape the mandatory vaccination?</p>
<p>This is all if it happens but you know, it's happening already, just curious to see what people think, just imagine you lost, you have no way out, you can't win, would you try your luck and drop everything you have worked for, together with modern lifestyle, guaranteed food etc.?</p></p>

        <p>We are literally registered anti-vaxxers. No lie. </p>
<p>My kids have never had their shots because I believe it is immoral to inject brand new babies with that many drugs. I know people of vaccine injured children and refused to take that risk with my own. Yes, my kids attend public school. Yes, I had to fill out municipal forms acknowledging their status. Yes I received all my vaccines as a child.</p>
<p>When they are fully grown and if they choose to receive vaccines, they are absolutely welcome to get the shots they feel would protect them because their body will be able to better handle it, but I don't think my kids will vaccinate themselves unless they need it for travel.</p>
<p>I don't want the shots - ever. They were also made using aborted fetal cells and as Roman Catholics, I ain't down with that. So not only do we have a moral objection, we have a religious one too. If push comes to shove, I will find a doctor who will write us all notes that we are medically exempt also.</p>

        <p>I've been mentally preparing to go homeless ever since I read about the mark of the beast in the bible. I truly believe we're living in the last generation. In the final days.</p>
<p>I don't think the vaccine is the mark of the beast of the book of Revelation. I think the vaccine is just a way to psychologically prepare the world for it. A way to mentally condition society into accepting something that is not in their best interest. I think the mark is a digital microchip that will most likely be introduced in the very near future.</p>
<p>A huge portion of the global population does not have a smartphone because of poverty and accessibility, so the global elites cannot track everyone due to this reason. Their solution, a cheap to manufacture, implantable microchip to verify vaccine status that can be given to everyone in the world without having to give everyone a smartphone, which can get pretty expensive. The chip would cost very little to make and would be available to everyone. At first, they'll say, "we're going to use this to verify vaccination status because paper vaccination records can be forged", then they'll say, "if you're not vaccinated you won't be able to travel, enter public places, or buy or sell anything."</p>
<p>After that, they'll introduce a central bank digital currency that can be stored on the chip and life as we know it will completely change.</p>
<p>So I'm ready to be a hobo if I have to.</p>
