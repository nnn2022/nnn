    <strong>I had a crazy thought whilst sat for the dentist</strong>
    <p><p>What if their plan is to release a deadly variant  soon and the vaccinated survive. In turn they get to keep the sheep “people who comply” and the unvaccinated (us) are wiped out. </p>
<p>Is that why they are keen on vaccinating children so that they can move the human race forward when mass depopulation begins?</p>
<p>I keep thinking if the vaccines kill people, people would revolt but if the deadly variant they release wipe us out they can say we told you so and get away with it.</p>
<p>There’s a thought?</p></p>

        <p>The sheep?  You mean the people who were happy to stay at home and eat fast food instead of working and producing?  The people who are happy being unhealthy and a drain on the medical infrastructure?  The people who can't think critically and are content to do something harmful to themselves and others just because they're told to?  People who are fighting to stay on unemployment instead of working now?</p>
<p>Kinda hard to stay rich and powerful when the people aren't working to make you that way.  Sheep are only good for 3 things:  wool, meat and sacrifice.  I don't see any wool, and we aren't eating them. That just leaves one thing remaining.  Too baaaaad, guys.</p>

        <p>Not entirely unemployed - Don’t forget, a lot of “front line” working people are vaccinated and people who also work in supermarkets, hotels, airports etc roles that obviously won’t make them rich but will contribute to a capitalist society and make the rich richer. They also don’t ask questions cause they’re too busy living pay cheque by pay cheque and their job is too important to lose </p>
<p>However the people who challenge the rules such as us are the ones they might want gone.</p>

        <p>Per person, yes.  However, there are other industries that need people healthy enough and willing to work.  Let's not forget employee illness is a major drain on any company.</p>
<p>One way big pharma is compensating is convincing people they're in worse health than they really are, and they need maintenance medication.  Look at the hypertension guidelines.  They keep lowering the threshold for what is considered high blood pressure.  What was normal 20 years ago is now either pre-hypertension (another new creation) or stage 1 hypertension.</p>
<p>Many docs are pushing the drugs and only mention diet and exercise in passing, or say they won't be enough.  That plays into people's desire for easy fixes.</p>

        <p>yep I've been saying this exact same thing for a few months now (not trying to 1 up you lol). It doesnt make sense for them to kill off or make those taking the vaccine infertile. Theyre already lining up for it with all these talks about variants and potential deadly mutations if you dont get vaxxed. </p>
<p>This current vaccine apparently doesnt even have a small dose of covid 19 in , but is making lots of people ill, so clearly theyre body is fighting something.. it could easily be a small dose of the deadly strain theyre gonna release when every1 is vaxxed 🤷  </p>
<p>Having said all of that, I still wont be bullied or blackmailed into getting it, they can have my life but not my soul</p>

<p>We’re already seeing the harm the vaccine is doing to young people. It’s way more likely that the spike protein that everyone who gets jabbed will have will be able to get infected, not someone who hasn’t been injected. You might convince some idiots like this though so good luck to you.</p>

<p>Australia with their borders locked has suddenly got the delta variant in from who?</p>
<p>who knows but it is very suspicious that the euros is allowing 60,000 fans and Ibiza has reopened for all the young people to enjoy? The warning signs are out for a difficult winter</p>

<p>I dominate everything on this planet, and I will create and destroy at will. I will slowly kill your grandparents, parents, and your children in front of you. I will do this any way I please; through economics, food manipulation and shortages, vaccines, et cetera. I want you to watch your communities, friends, and family deteriorate physically and mentally. I don't care whether sheep or wolf take the vaccine because whomever is left over will be dominated through other means. We've studied the human mind for decades and our projections show you will fight back eventually. I hope it's the strongest of the bunch because it's not fun fighting a cripple. In the end I will watch your spirit die, and you will comply.</p>

        <p>Yes, we do have the lowest uptake of the vaccines, but maybe that's why it's starting to become noticeable, as the numbers are slowly rising.. unlike the countries that have been vaccinating for more than 6 months... Also, because the vaccine uptake is still low, this new variant gives them a reason to push the vaccines further..</p>

        <p>Ive read a true depopulation plan is not the virus or any virus, but sterilization. Sure people are dying from the 'vaccines' but those numbers are insignificant to the whole population.</p>
<p>I mean, we here know its a gene therapy, not a vaccine. What could they possibly want to change about human dna? ... The ability to have kids. Hence why they are pushing it on young people and children. Hence why they were pushing it on pregnant women (who then had misscarriages).</p>
<p>On adults it seems to have somewhat immediate effect, and children... well, thats next generation already fucked up, as well. Its still quite fast depopulation, and sheeple will never connect the dots about this and their infertility. And now vaccinated children deffinitely wont... and that wont even be their fault anymore. </p>
<p>And so goverment will achieve their goal, without being accused of “letting people“ or worse.</p>
<p>Food for thought. To me it makes sense.</p>

The ones who refuse a vaccine who are still pumping out kids are going to be the ones who are teaching their kids to not trust everything the media says. Why would they want that? </p>
<p>Also the population everywhere outside asia/africa is going down anyway, or at least it would be if it wasnt for immigration. If fertility and children being born was what they wanted to tackle it would make sense only of they did this on africa.. so giving africa a different type of vaccine to rest of world to make them less fertile. africa the only place where population is still dramatically rising.</p>

        <p>Possible - however I think it would be a % of people sterilised (based on the batch number they got) the issue for them is that if too many people find fault in the vaccine they can lose trust in the govt and that could be it for them. I recon they’re treading lightly by only doing a % sterilisation based on the batch numbers.</p>
<p>However if all of a sudden a very deadly version was planted in public areas when things started “unlocking” - that could wipe the rest clean. The government could get out very easily by saying we told you so and risk of social unrest would be set aside.</p>

        <p>I agree, it would. However I dont think they want to risk themselves. If they release a truly deadly virus, they'd have to quarantine themselves in order to not get it and save their lives. The lives of the 'elites'. I dont think they wanna risk that. I also dont think they want to loose their freedoms - which they strictly would have to, in order to make sure they survive this deadly virus. Its easier for them to operate with lies and false (and commonly dangerous) variants, then to put themselves at an actual risk.</p>

        <p>Unless they actually get a version of the vaccine that protects them from it? You recon ? </p>
<p>Could all these political powers on the TV actually be getting it?</p>

        <p>I dont think they are able to. There was a video from a virologist explaining why there hasnt been vaccine for common cold (which belongs to corona virus family). She practically said that they tried for years to make one, but it always ends up with immunity system of tested animals attacking its own body and killing them. They know why this happens (i dont remember the terminology), but not how to prevent this. So if they release a deadly corona, they cant <em>actually</em> vaccinate against it. If they release a deadly virus of different type, who knows what other problems they'd have with it. Because of herd immunity, they'd have to use a new virus and that always leaves them vulnerable. And they wont be testing new vaccines on themselves. 
No, i think they want to take a path of control, even if it takes a bit longer. Sterilization, destroying of middle class, transfering the funds to elites, introduction of cryptocurrencies that will give them total control of how you are spending it, giving them also the power to shut your funds down, if you dont listen. Total control. Its fucked up. Thats why my 'saving konto' is a jar in my kitchen.</p>

        <p>That means the elites have to inject themselves with something - and no way they are putting themselves into the risk of blood clots, myocarditis, blindness, neurological impairments and autoimmune reactions. Or are they going to hide in some isolated facilities for how long exactly? Virus is a bad weapon, since you can't control it and it mutates and spreads unpredictably. Vaccine, on the other hand...</p>
