    <strong>Why has the gov’t never cared this much about saving our lives from any other condition?</strong>
    <p><p>When the government is begging you to spend their money you have to wonder what exactly is going on.</p>
<p>First: I am  by no means anti-vaxx and I rushed out and got the Moderna version as soon as it became available. I thought people were being paranoid and ridiculous, but I also thought that it was 100% their right to make that choice for themselves. I couldn’t see things escalating to this level mainly because I couldn’t see the government taking any kind of active interest in ordinary citizens health when they had never once taken an interest in it before. </p>
<p>Yet here we are, and something about all of this feels really, really off to me. I don’t regret taking the vaccine, and I’m going to refrain for speculating about there being something nefarious behind this whole vaccine push, but I’d really like to know what everybody else is thinking. Because none of this adds up in any manner that makes any kind of sense to me. And here’s the things that jump way out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why is our leadership so gravely concerned about the fact that even one American might contract, and die from this ONE disease when they don’t seem to have much concern about anything else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are they willing to spare absolutely no expense, employ every possible bit of manpower to make sure an unvaccinated person does not die of this disease (a disease they would arguably hold responsibility in contracting due to the personal choice they made)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is there such a heated, angry, emotional response coming from all the people leading the charge for this? It might be somewhat understandable if they were regular people on the street. But they’re not. The people who are screaming about how they are trying to save every American life and throwing their hands up in exasperation that so many Americans are senselessly turning down the free and easy offer to have their lives saved are people who should know better than anyone just how life and death this situation clearly is NOT. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to circle back for a second (sorry, couldn’t resist) why is it that this drug can be subsidized so the American public can get it for free but that has never been available in the past for any other nor is it available in the present for any other drug? It’s a little bit of a slap in the face to sit back and watch the tens upon tens of millions of Americans struggled under the exorbitant cost of every single thing related to healthcare when they’re flaunting the fact that this vaccine is fully paid for, and it seems like the vast majority of people don’t really want this particular intervention. Why do you suddenly want to make health decisions for all of the American people when you’ve never wanted to make health decisions for anybody, about anything? You don’t decide who will agree to chemotherapy and launch a crusade against those who choose to reject it in favor of alternative health regimes, no treatment whatsoever, or relying on God to perform a miracle and engaging the power of prayer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And about that government money. Where has THAT money been all my life? All of our lives, actually, because you haven’t stepped in and offered any form of health-related assistance to anybody for anything. So one would think the unprecedented step to foot the entire bill for the entire country to protect against ONE thing would only happen in a true life or death, extinction of humanity type of threat. Which this is not. And you know that better than anyone. It’s your own statistics that determines how little risk of death there was with this virus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the health of your entire citizenry is apparently of grave concern to you may I offer up a few suggestions? How about subsidizing something else for us, you know We the People. How about covering the cost for antibiotics? Or maybe ultrasounds, CT scans and MRIs. Those sure do cost a lot, way more than it costs to maintain and run the machines. And you’d be saving so many lives, and reducing the stress and financial burden that affects an enormous amount of pregnant women. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But you don’t care about those things. Now wanna tell me why you care SO MUCH about this?</p></p>

        <p>That said I do agree.. the people who are in what you call government don't generally show any signs of caring about the common folk..</p>
<p>They do tend to make policies that benefit their donors more than their constituents. Only have never shown to really care about the health of the citizens</p>
<p>Especially with GOP lawmakers (who secretly believe that universal healthcare would be good)) constantly railing against it because that's what their donors in the big insurance companies pay them to do..</p>
<p>They're perfectly willing to destroy the environment and pollute your water supply so some Big oil company can make an extra buck because the big oil companies paid the GOP to do so.. not because they have some actual fundamental belief in oil but because they werr paid by big oil</p>
<p>I mean it comes out that they get advice from Democrat staffers so they obviously fundamentally believe in Democrat values they just vote against them because they're corrupt..</p>
<p>But yes both sides do it.. and they've shown that they don't generally care about the American people so when they individually promote those things you do have to question them..</p>

        <p>I just took care of a 40-ish year old mother of 3 yesterday who died with her kids around her. It wasn't some respiratory virus that killed her. It was something all of us have access to. Something that is subsidized for commercial reasons. There are ads for it everywhere. You can buy a lethal dose of it for $20 in most places in America. She died of alcoholism. She drank a bottle of vodka a day for a year straight until her skin started looking a little funny. Then she felt a little funny. Then her stomach started hurting. Then everything hurt. Then she stopped waking up. 40 years old. She sought treatment, insurance wouldn't cover it. The country wouldnt take her into their rehab. When she contacted state resources they threatened to take the kids so she dropped that inquiry immediately. </p>
<p>So don't fucking tell me this is about saving lives.</p>

        <p>Agree! How many people have relapsed into drinking, drugs, and/or ended up homeless due to losing their jobs because the government made it illegal to work during lockdowns and companies failed as a result, as is happening right now in Victoria, Australia? How many people have died already from lockdowns and social isolation, or had their lives completely destroyed?</p>

        <p>The craziest thing is the public health policies made health worse. The medical community knew last year that covid did not spread almost at all outdoors--yet they advised governments to force people indoors and criminalize being outdoors, especially at parks and other wilderness areas that were the safest to be during a pandemic.</p>

        <p>No offense, but, where I’m standing, there simply is no pandemic. There was a lot of chemtrail spraying prior to Covid and it seems now more respiratory problems as a result. But Covid? Nah, I don’t think so. Let the government come clean about the increased spraying of chem trails and why and what it is, total transparency, because having them rain chemicals down on us surely will have an effect, but what?</p>

        <p>People don’t want to listen to these facts. 93k Americans die every year to alcohol related incidents. Another 280k for diabetes. And yet the government is fucking scared of a covid flu from ages of 1-40 that have killed 7k Americans in the last year. That’s not even a full half a percent.

        <p>Like most people, you aren’t getting the point. The point is. There have been more deaths every year for far longer than covid for alcohol and diabetes. Don’t you think the government should focus on those instead of a virus that does not compare in deaths per year? No okay.

        <p>I get where your going with that but you can be vaccinated and if that’s not enough for you then you can wear an N95 mask.. and if that’s not enough for you then most stores still offer curb contactless delivery.</p>
<p>If you aren’t obese , over 60 or have other issues the chances of having symptoms beyond loss of smell and taste and sore throat are very very minimal. </p>
<p>7 kids on my sons summer basketball team caught covid. All but 3 gave it to at least one parent, that’s 11 people that got covid and only a handful even had symptoms... the symptoms were headaches, sore throat and loss of taste.. </p>
<p>It really is becoming more of an issue of people not being upset about possibly getting covid from someone else... they are angry because they want other people to be forced to do the things that they chose for themselves. “ I’m vaccinated and it’s not fair if someone else doesn’t want to be.. I want the government to force them, shame them and make their lives difficult until they comply and do the thing that I happily did” </p>
<p>It’s more of some loyalty to a culture than a worry over getting sick.. I think it’s possible the media and politicians are using this issue to divide the population and pit us against each other. Tactic as old as time itself.</p>

        <p>It's all a circus. Politicians care about public image so only issues in the media count. The media cares about sensationalism and outrage as it drives views. Scientists are influenced by media and politics. All groups are bought and paid for by big money interest groups including pharma. The whole thing is a positive feedback loop that gets stronger and stronger. </p>
<p>The solution is recognizing the bullshit and mass disobedience. It only has power if we let it have power.</p>

        <p>I agree with all your points, OP. Good post!  My personal opinion is that the vaccines weren't created to cure Covid. Covid was created to push the vaccines.  I think there's more to them than we're being led to believe. Not to scare you, as you did get vaxxed, but in lieu of your points, it's the only thing that makes sense to me.  </p>
<p>Maybe they're wanting to get people used to vaccines and they plan on rolling out something more sinister down the road (check out ID2020). Maybe it's about control. I honestly have no idea. All I do know is the government has never cared if people are healthy, and big pharma makes more money when people aren't.  Now they're wanting to give out FREE vaccines to every man, woman, and child (and even pets!) on the planet.  It's highly suspicious.</p>

        <p>You should feel uncomfortable. That’s the first step that will get your started to start seeking the truth. 
The plans the  elites have for us all are not good but you can do your best to prepare &amp; protect yourself and your family.
I sometimes do wonder if it would just be best to go ahead and take the shot and hope it kills me quickly so I won’t be around when the poop really starts hitting the fan.</p>

        <p>No one is going to just start dropping dead and you also have to consider that many were given saline or repurposed Flu shots that were unused in 2020 so to gain confidence and not have too many adverse effects or deaths. </p>
<p>What you may see is that many will start having seizures, extreme migraines, or other complications but the longer it takes for this to start from their last shot date, the less likely it's going to be that it'll be linked to the shot.</p>

        <p>I meant someone I know. I think some older celebrities of the B or C list or someone you might say is a former celebrity ended up dying within a week of getting the shot. My memory is so vague on this. I can't recall who.</p>

        <p>Was Lisa Shaw the news presenter? That was so sad! And the press weren’t allowed to say she died following getting vaccinated. They had to say some weird phrase like “she died after a short illness”. Just unreal the censorship now.</p>

        <p>There is a history of vaccines dating back to the late 18th century. Look up old books from archive.org and trace the timeline yourself.

<p>But is there any chance you could give a summary if the middle link you posted (True Healing Arts) because I’m really interested in finding out more and it’s driving me nuts that my phone won’t download it. I got the other two no problem, but I’m going to have to wait until I get in front of a computer about 12 hours from now before I can get it (at least I’m hoping that will allow me to get it) and it’s driving me nuts that I can’t even looks at the table of contents or the introduction — any part of it, really.</p>

        <p>RT Trall is a mid 19th century physician who gives a very interesting lecture at the smithsonian institute on the nature and efficacy of all “medications.” Certainly one of the most revealing documents I’ve ever read concerning healing, as it contains perhaps the most important and elusive truth... that there is no external solution—no elixir or drug—that will “make” you healthy.</p>

        <p>yep, thank the pharma lobby &amp; big food companies for lobbying against any kind of regulations. the FDA bans hardly anything compared to Europe; Europe bans over 2000 substances in food/cosmetic products.

<p>Granted. We should just be eating "real" food and not processed crap, but in this modern day and age people either do not care or honestly don't have the time to completely avoid the pre-packaged stuff (Some of which I would barely call food).</p>

I have a background in food legislation + nutrition in general thanks to the college classes I’ve taken, that’s why I feel able to talk about it.

        <p>Not really. People aren't choosing to eat food that contains carcinogens, unless they know about them. I'm against laws that ban unhealthy but safe and sanitary food (such as the law that limits soda sizes in NYC.). I'm also against bans on tobacco because consumers understand the risk. Addives that consumers don't know is in a product or don't know what they are is an entirely different matter.</p>

        <p>Basically, but I don't know of any ingredients that need to be banned personally. Maybe foods with added trans-fatty-acids's should have a warning label, but I think it's reasonable to use it in some foods. It's just not a freedom issue to make sure food is made of safe ingredients and processed safely.</p>

        <p>It would be good to have food transparency... Highly processed foods can impact our health, mental health, cognitive capacity and display "addictive" effects. The majority of people have nooooooooooooooo idea of this. Additionally, the more harmful a food is, the cheaper it seems to be. Its more about accessibility and education + informed consent.</p>

        <p>Except that yes, you did see that, there were lawsuits and even serious legislation aimed at curbing the risks and putting more liability on food providers.
There has been huge pushes worldwide for fast food companies to clean up their act, mc donalds has changed alot in the past 10+ years.</p>
<p>And excuse me for stating the obvious here, but shutting down the entire health system in response to incidents of medical malpractice is definitely going to cause more lives than it would save, by magnitudes of millions.</p>

You seemed to imply that shutting down the medical systems for malpractices was equivalent to shutting down borders and taking quarantine measures to fight the infection rates of COVID 19.
Or did I get that wrong?</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's what I said you said, and I'm disagreeing.
You're using false equivalence; a pandemic crisis response is always going to be more disruptive to every individual that an isolated malpractice event that doesn't involve anyone except the involved parties.</p>
<p>Shutting down the medical system in response to a malpractice event is ludicrous in the first place.</p>

        <p>Except, the world isn't "shut down" it's under quarantine controls.
This isn't a "nasty flu", this is basically the SARS virus x100.</p>
<p>False. Equivalent.</p>
<p>Here in WA, where us poor silly sheeple did the right things and wore masks when asked to, socially distanced, stayed at home, and supported the govt when they opted for hard border restrictions and quick, sharp responses to active threats, we barely have any changes.</p>
<p>I don't have to wear a mask everywhere, everything I had before is still here, I can drive anywhere I want to, business is booming here, why?
Because when it comes time to respond, we do, quickly and without nonsense arguments or patience for whingers and conspiracy nutjobs.</p>
<p>We lockdown quickly and for short periods, and then hey presto, we're in the clear because the appropriate measures were applied consistently and rapidly.
Life goes back to normal for us while other places spiral out of control because of idiots thinking they know better than people who's entire profession is public health, immunology, virology, and pandemic/crisis response.</p>

<p>The rest of your comment has no merit. You’re willing to bend over and surrender your liberties because of what the “experts” say. The same people who told us that masks weren’t effective and were caught later just straight up lying yo the public.That’s not some “conspiracy.” </p>
<p>I’m not willing to surrender any of my liberties or rights because I’ve opened a history book and know I’ll never get them back peacefully. </p>
<p>Remember the “patriot” act that was supposed to be a “temporary” response to 9/11? Well it’s been 20 fucking years and that is still kicking around granting the government all kinds of unconstitutional powers. Some of us have foresight…. Expect there to be random variants when the government finds it convenient to consolidate power.</p>

        <p>This is because a) if one person dies from medical malpractice, the individual doctor is punished, not the whole medical system. By and large, doctors are extremely beneficial. Also, b) if one person eats fast food, only they suffer. They can't spread obesity to others, whereas Covid can be spread to, say, a vulnerable  nursing home by even a single unvaccinated person.</p>
<p>I'm completely against mandatory vaccination, so overall I agree with your point. But this is flawed logic.</p>

        <p>YES! Most people in the sub would probably be huge fans of Milton Friedman, an economist who strongly advocated for minimal government interference.</p>
<p>Friedman would call this the "neighborhood effect" and say that it's one of the rare times when government probably <em>does</em> need to get involved - not to mandate a vaccine, but to strongly push it and make it available to all who want it.</p>

        <p>Because people were brainwashed into believing that democrats want to fix shit. They had all the power during the Obama years and they couldn't even fix the immigration laws. I think the left vs right is just a huge charade at this point. None of those politicians give a shit. Even on simple issues they can't agree on. Even when it comes to people they don't want to help people. The Dems only care about rewarding people who made shit life choices with all the welfare and pointing fingers at republicans while republicans can't get their heads out of their own asses. Trump had some good policies but Congress has all the power. After looking at what went down the last 5 years I lost faith in both parties. </p>
<p>The whole country seems to be this left vs right thing now and I don't like the way it is. Social media has helped grow this cancer. Both parties are bought by the rich and powerful. Legislation has become such a joke lately I really can't understand how people still fall for that crap. We have CNN, Fox news and OAN shoving things down peoples throat and they just eat it up. People need to start waking up.

        <p>Republicans never did shit to stop destructive immigration. The globalists or whatever you want to call them get what they want, and it doesn't matter how many Democrats or Republicans are around. Trump seems to be the only one who produced some interference unless he was used as part of a grand scheme to intensify things after he's gone. </p>
<p>This is why 9/11 happened under a Republican, and when a Democrat got into office, there still wasn't anything done about it.</p>

        <p>This has been true only recently.  Back in the 90's and 00's, there were both dems and repubs that both did shady shit - but opposite type of stuff than you would expect from someone in their party.  But I agree that underneath, it's one party.  They just do the red vs. blue thing to make us think there's a choice.</p>

        <p>I've been seeing people start to compare COVID to the post-911 terrorism scare and I think they are spot on:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSM-produced fear porn.</li>
<li>Tribal division between the skeptics and the true believers.</li>
<li>Security (Hygeine) theatre.</li>
<li>Trillions of dollars disappearing from government balance sheets without proper explanation.</li>
<li>Erosion of civil liberties justified by the 'crisis'. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think the only significant difference is that this is all now happening on a MUCH larger scale. </p>
<p>To answer your question: they obviously don't care about us, but those with power and influence are making sure to take advantage of the crisis to achieve their own goals.</p>

        <p>We never even recovered financially from 2008. 11 straight years of them pumping brought us to a brand new financial crisis that was culminating right before covid hit. Instead of a financial collapse, covid showed up and then they could spend whatever they wanted. And they did. And then some. And still more to come.</p>

        <p>Remember 'dirty bombs'? They were a media invention which they said the terrorists possessed. They even made docudramas about dirty bombs' going off in major cities and yet I'm doubtful if even the best terrorists had heard of them and they certainly didn't have the ability to make them but the media kept talking them up. 20 years later and everyone's forgotten what a dirty bomb is.</p>

        <p>To be honest though - Trump was all about the vaccine.  Bragged every day about how fast he's getting it out and still tells everyone to get it.  Not sure he's really on the people's side.</p>

        <p>No, many trumpers didn't like his stance from the beginning and were quite confused by it.  Before he was president he made several vaccine-skeptical tweets, saying that kids should never get all their vaccines at once b/c they could be dangerous.  I think he also linked it to autism.</p>

        <p>There was a violent rebellion that succeeded. The female protagonist volunteered for the Hunger Games (24 youth fight to the death until only one is left) to save her little sister. In the end her sister ends up being killed by the government. She ends up living happily ever after with the guy that always liked her. The book really emphasizes how she thought he was some master manipulator to protect her. However, he was just being candid after he was chosen to go to the Hunger Games. You're probably going to die, you might as well tell the world which girl you like, and of course she's going to hear it.</p>

        <p>Silver is the most electrically conductive element in nature, indispensable for sophisticated electronics, solar panels, etc.</p>
<p>Gold and silver are money because they have been selected in a free market repeatedly as the unit of exchange due to their durability, fungibility, divisibility, scarcity, and utility as commodities. Ammo also works well for this purpose, yes.</p>

        <p>But if a CME hits the earth and ALL electronics are fried, it's going to be a LONG time before we get back to the point of needing it for those uses.  So when shit hits the fan, what's really going to be valuable is food, water, tools, and ammo.  After things settle down and people can somewhat start to rebuild society, then precious metals will make a return.  But we could be talking about years or even decades.</p>

        <p>The US' hesitation to move away from the gold standard is essentially what caused/helped fuel a giant recession. And no, fiat currency isn't "pretend" - a lot of what values the different currencies in the world is mostly taxes and debt. Although I'm no economist.</p>

        <p>Not the sole reason, but I think that's why they had to do it now, as opposed to down the road.  Also, the vaccines just give more of an excuse if they start leading to more deaths/problems.  I think this fall, Delta variant (or probably just cold/flu season with reduced immunity due to vaccines) will call for another huge round of stimulus and then basically UBI and stimmies for life.</p>

        <p>The government is spending OUR money. </p>
<p>FTFY. </p>
<p>Great post, and the snark isn’t directed at you. But it hit me when I heard a radio ad in the store from the Health Dept. </p>
<p>Our money subsidizes giant pharma companies, to make an experimental drug, that they are advertising with tax money, and will now pay “volunteer groups” (soon gov groups) to go door to door, and the kicker is if there’s is ever any compensation for the injured it will come from a government pay out since big pharma has no liability. </p>
<p>It’s all a big grift.</p>

        <p>My most innocuous answer is: They're simply trying to get people used to free 'healthcare' and free payments/handouts. Then once these things are gone the majority of the NPCs/unthinkers will demand they come back.</p>

        <p>'First: I am  by no means anti-vaxx and I rushed out and got the Moderna version '   why oh why is this sooo important to state when one speaks about the current dangerous serums?  you know what?  It's smart to be antivaxxer because the whole virology institute is based on fraudulent science since the 1880's . Look at the history of the jabs. and it is troubled, flawed corrupted industry.  First, i have been anti-pharma since 1985 and still going strong!</p>

        <p>Never been an antivaxxer until I noticed things like how you describe.  It seems so strange.  How did we get from ‘two weeks to slow the spread’, ‘don’t overwhelm the hospitals’, to ‘NOBODY CAN GET COVID EVER!’?  And in the face of studies that progressively showed less mortality/morbidity than originally feared?  I was planning on getting the jab but just before it became available I got COVID, very mild symptoms thankfully.  So now I have immunity.  The fact that the vaccines are still being strongly pushed for those of us who have immunity though recovering from covid makes even less sense and adds to the insanity of the messaging coming from big government, big tech, big pharma.  Never been a conspiracy theorist and still am not.  Im just thinking for myself and using common sense.</p>

        <p>Honest answer to 1. is that many folks see this as a deadly infectious disease, so stopping the spread of it in all the ways possible = fewer lives lost. And they see it as exponential, such that stopping the circulation of it in one instance means huge benefits down the line.</p>
<p>I don't agree with this for all sorts of reasons- which is why I'm on NNN -  but I've talked to people who read widely on this, and to them almost anything is justifiable if it stops the spread. They truly believe that the only thing that keeps Sars Cov 2 from being 1918 influenza is strict control from above, and the urgency of spread outweighs the concerns about any other health condition.</p>
<p>Does every policy-maker sincerely believe this? Definitely not. But if you're in that frame of mind, you're desperate for the govt to do something to stop the contagion.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree. I've just talked with enough people who are sure that there is to know that a large segment of our population truly feels that this - containment at all costs -  is the smartest and most ethical approach. I don't mean the preachy doomer types, either.</p>

        <p>At the very least it has to do with the erosion of our rights and an increased amount of control. At the very worst it has to do with a massive genocide. Somewhere in the middle lies the idea of population control via sterility.. May the force be with us!</p>

<p>I have a homework assignment for you:   Watch "World News Tonight with David Muir on ABC" (or the equivalent shows on NBC &amp; CBS - Norah O'Donnell or Lester Holt).   You can watch it on mute, because it's all just lies and propaganda.   Or watch it with the sound on, with the understanding of what it truly is, and marvel at the propaganda/hypnosis techniques they've perfected over the decades.....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>But the most important thing is to pay attention to the commercials.</strong>   A typical evening "news" program will have about 15 commercials, and 10-12 of them will be from pharmaceutical companies.    </p>

        <p>Well said.

<p>One of the most disturbing things is that all of this is being done in the name of health and science, but if physicians are being actively censored, and anyone who talks about adverse effects silenced, then whose expertise is really being used to make these draconian policies? It's really just one party rule at that point, and what "the Party" says is true is automatically deemed true by the media, and the science is shaped to fit it, and anyone who says differently, even if they are a medical doctor or scientist, is automatically deemed wrong and misguided, no matter how good their evidence is.</p>

        <p>"Why is our leadership so gravely concerned about the fact that even oneAmerican might contract, and die from this ONE disease when they don’tseem to have much concern about anything else?"</p>
<p>Exactly. As one important example, why is it not even being DISCUSSED how there is a trade off in health between locking down to prevent the spread of the virus, and those very lockdowns causing significant stress due to destroying the economy and causing resulting higher rates of suicide and depression? If I heard right, there was an increase of around 30% of suicides in 2020.</p>
<p>Also, if there are adverse effects, isn't it important to keep a very close watch on exactly how many there are to make sure the medical intervention is still worth the "cure"? In the past, vaccines that resulted in showed adverse effects were pulled off the market quickly, at even a few deaths. Now, apparently, thousands of deaths are ok and no one can even sue the vaccine company for malpractice. Why are adverse effects being hidden and censored by the government media? Why are physicians who talk about how their patients are having adverse effects being censored and fired?</p>

        <p>It may be to get more support for govt health care which = complete access to everyone’s health records and easier to make people -disappear-…. </p>
<p>A, people will think, as you do, “why didn’t they pay for my insulin?? Or chemotherapy??” Then demand it. </p>
<p>B, people will not realize they are actually paying for it through taxes </p>
<p>C, the people who do realize this will be screaming about inflation, as we have. The goal then I think would be to convince us that there will be no inflation if we agree to a government health care plan which would appear to level things out. People who are already in favor of full government health care (are also less likely to realize that we would STILL pay for it) would be taunting us saying that we caused inflation by not allowing govt healthcare earlier.</p>

        <p>Can’t wait until they offer me $3000 to stop eating fast food.  Maybe I’ll also get walking vouchers each week.  With this newfound Health campaign of theirs.
At this point, they are starting to look desperate as hell and it isn’t a good look.  They aren’t getting a date with me, lol.
All I know is I’m tired of people acting like we have years of data on efficacy of these vaccines. We have months of data on certain things and people act as if it is miraculously proven.  That anyone that hasn’t taken it denies Science.  Meanwhile, I have a Masters in Physical Chemistry you dumb /$/$s.   I view it all as some sick experiment of theirs, to see just how much they can get people to go along with.  Who knows the destination.</p>

        <p>Just wanted to give an update; the <em>very</em> same day, mere hours after replying to your post, my mother (who I live with) confronted me about not being vaccinated. I was so happy I had just read your post and your points were still fresh in my head. I think it really helped me counter her guilt trips. She's left it alone (for now at least) so thanks for your help. </p>
<p>Also, side note- this the first time I have ever interacted with the sub (besides year-long lurking) and I was promptly banned from r/offmychest (a <em>completely</em> unrelated sub for the record). That has never happened to me and I am blown away by their obviousness!</p>

        <p>Public opinion. It all boils down to this. Public opinion decides who gets power and who doesn't. They are not scared of people dying, they're scared of people thinking they are not serving their needs.</p>
<p>Problem is, they don't know what the people's needs are. And it becomes much harder to understand people's needs in times of fear like this.</p>

        <p>This is a mass distribution of wealth plan. I don’t believe it’s a mass extinction plan. I do think millions will die from the vaccine and millions more will have their life expectancy shortened from permanent damage and I don’t think they give a rats ass. Governments around the world are in on it they are confiscating wealth in the form of these slush fund bills worth Trillions and its to “Build Back Better” because after all trust is lost in Governments around the world, with millions dead and or permanently injured from the vaccine we will become 1 corrupt world government with total control- we “will have nothing and like it”</p>

        <p>Since you asked... </p>
<p>The reason the government has never cared much about your health is because the government has,  for most of the last hundred years,  been controlled  or intimidated by people who preach loudly on the evils of socialism anytime anyone tries to fix our corrupt and broken medical payment system. And people believe them.</p>
<p>But even the Antisocialists and the Capitalists always conceded that some limits on gathering  could make a huge difference, especially when there is no vaccine. And they gladly pay for the vaccine because it protects them too.</p>

        <p>From a scientist's perspective, I forget the general knowledge and the gaps in it the regular person has.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Taxes. That is the pessimistic view. We're borrowing all this money future generations will have to pay. More alive and replicating means more money. Or, 600k dying is much worse than the wars America has fought in.  And it was completely unnecessary. People just had to wear a mask and they couldn't even do that. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't need to understand how mutations work in viruses. Letting it run rampant in a population will inevitably lead to new strains. The Delta Variant is ripping through the country of unvavcinated people (believe 99.2% and those that are compromised either by chemotherapy, immune suppressed from medicine or disease). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see it as even if you don't agree with them politically, they don't want more people to die. Or, they don't think people should be free to potentially give rise to a variant that can evade our vaccines. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They don't want unnecessary deaths. Despite the memes, they are pro life. Again, they don't care on your politics. They don't want you to get sick. Not everyone is asymptomatic. Even those that don't die and aren't asymptomatic don't say covid was fun. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a global problem. The drug companies have signed agreements even to share technologies to help produce more vaccine. I forget the labs helping to produce more of the moderna vaccine, but they are rivals but it is for the good of mankind. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am chronically ill. I pay a lot for health care. There are about 1/2million people with my exact condition in America. If they paid for everyone's problems we'd be living in a society that boomers are most afraid of - a socialist one. </p>
<p>600k deaths in a bit over 1.5 years from one disease. Compare when America first detected it to other countries. The big difference is individualism - in collectivist societies they put on the masks. Americans wanted to live life and not be forced indoors - the vaccine is your magic pill. It is a health crisis that goes beyond America. The free cost to the public is to make the idea of "being a sheep" less. But frankly, anyone that won't wear a mask or get the vaccine because it may make them look weak or look like a sheep is a thin skinned bitch. </p>
<ol>
<li>I'd love if Someone Else covered my yearly MRI or my $650 monthly premium or my medicine.  It would take much of my stress away. But I'm also a hard working American. I can cover the costs. From the moment I got sick, I realized I had to be better. The past two decades were like memories of pure light. I'm proud that I don't get handouts. Others may not be so lucky, but I had a family that taught me about the path of least resistance. I always chose the difficult path. I got my various degrees in sciences instead of useless college degrees. I have no student loan debt, I live responsibly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trying to get at - Government shouldn't be micro managing everyone's problems. To tie in with  the themes I laid out - it is a global problem. This is much bigger than myself. I wish just me wearing a mask (I'm immune compromised btw) was enough, but it isn't. If 1.5+ years into it people still don't understand why everyone unvaccinated needed their masks - just think of this.</p>
<p>The reason it spread when all mask mandates were lifted for the vaccinated is because the unvaccinated broke the social contract. As long as people are unvaccinated, we'll just keep spreading. Fun fact, lots of court cases from the 1900s have made it okay to mandate vaccines. Be exciting how people would react if these were approved and not just for emergency use.</p>
<p>Anyways. Lots of typos, I wrote it up on my phone. Night. Mobile auto changes my numbering but pretend they align with your questions.</p>

        <p>Reasons the government doesn't want us dead: we pay them very good to lead us.
If we don't die there' a bigger chance we get them re-elected.</p>
<p>Why does the governemtn care about every single case? They don't. But they wanna spare as much lives as possible. And to do that you must act as if you cared for every single life.
Acting as if you care about every life gets you re-elected.</p>
<p>Why is there such a negative response against anti vaxxers? Cause they don't just Harm themselves. Vaccinated ppl have a lesser chance to die from covid but they can still die from it (consider your body to have Tiny soldiers in it. A vaccine learn them tactics on how to beat the virus but sometimes a very slim chance the virus can still win)
Secondly most anti vaxxers try hard to get other ppl to become anti vax. And most anti vaxxers make sure their kids become anti vaxxers. A bunch of dead kids is badto get you re-elected.</p>
<p>You're right why can the US make other medications cheaper? I don't know that's been talking point for years with Obama care and universal healthcare. As a European I'm so glad that I can go to any hospital I want get the best treatment and pay next to nothing for it. In my country we also have employers paying for the yearly flu vaccine (without employers it would cost about 20 euro)</p>
<p>That money has been put into other stuff. Military is one of the major costs of the avg us tax payer. There are many things payed with taxes for instance infrastructure. You should figure out where your tax dollars are beeing spend on and vote for the person that you think will spend the tax dollars the best. With taxing big corporations you might even get free healthcare without an increase in your personal taxes.</p>
<p>And your last point yes. Fucking make it happen the government works for the people not the other way around.</p>

        <p>The simplest answer is always correct. Coverup and money. Someone fucked up and it turned into a scramble to make sure asses were covered. It was essentially accidental bioterrorism. And while this wasn't the one it very well could have been. This could have been 1918 all over again. But look at the average age of people who died. 76. So now when the lab leak theory comes to fruitation they'll be able to say 'well we can make vaccines so the research can continue' and everyone will move on and the money will continue to flow. I would love to believe the depopulation thing but look up the effects of what microplastics are doing to kids born today. It's decreasing sperm count and fertility by an alarming amount and no one gives a shit. You want the real depopulation plan it's right there. Governments have subsidized oil gas and plastic forever now knowing exactly what's going on. This is proven stuff that no one is even remotely concerned about. I'm not here to slam anyone but people worried about vaccines sucking down soda, bottled water, and wrapping shit in plastic wrap are clueless. Do I think the vaccinates are entirely safe, not really. I think the amount of side effects are alarming at the very least. Will I be getting one, probably not cause I had covid and no one in the world can convince me natural immunity isn't the best possible outcome.</p>

        <p>Every time a new variant comes out we ask if the vaccines are still effective against them. As long as covid still circulates, it continues to mutate and evolve, creating new variants. Eventually it could evolve to where the vaccine is no longer effective and then we have to do the whole lockdown song and dance again until a new vaccine can be developed against the specific variant. The government would really like for this to not happen.</p>

        <p>For your sake I’m going to refrain from speculating about anything nefarious too, but it’s pretty clear this is all about control and that’s pretty nefarious in an of itself. Look how quickly everything escalated from 2 weeks to stop to spread to talk of banning those who don’t want to take part in a large medical experiment from basic access like travel, healthcare and the grocery store (already happening in other countries). You are 100% correct in that if this were really about health and best interests were in mind then insulin prices for diabetic kids would not have skyrocketed into the unaffordable range. And to those shouting that the vaccine is the answer and works so well yet also claiming the unvaccinated are killing the vaccinated I have a bridge to sell you. It seems you are waking up to the agenda, perhaps you got the placebo dose.</p>

        <p>I love this post. Questioning everything the govt does is good and everyone should be doing it. If scientists had come up to me at the start of the pandemic and told me that it would be a great idea to take infected patients out of hospitals and put them into care homes I'd have laughed and told them to pass me the bong. But they did it. And not just one country but EVERY wrstern nation. And I can still recall the days in the 'before times' when politicians used to constantly tell us they had no money for more hospitals and nurses but all of a sudden huge amounts of money have magically appeared from nowhere to pay for everyone's furlough during the past 18 months but not quite enough to pay for er... more hospitals and nurses! </p>
<p>Keep questioning everything and I guarantee you will soon start figuring it out. I'm saying no more on the matter. Good luck 👍</p>

        <p>It's ironic for me as an American, a nation filled full of the most egotistical SoB's that never really cared for others by majority all of a sudden cares for others wellbeing let alone universal healthcare, the irony is lost on these people and I see right through their fragile egos and facade. The politicians are no better that selectively enforce rules for the public and yet don't follow the rules themselves.</p>

        <p>The answer to all of this is because it has shown how powerless and incompetent they are. Politicians are used to being in control of things. Coronavirus showed them how little control they actually have and how bad leaders they are. The vaccine offers them a way out of this uncontrollable madness that exposes their incompetence</p>

        <p>Interesting way to phrase your questions. 
Health aid and money has been available for anything I’ve required my entire life. Whether that be for an MRI or an operation, vaccine, dental surgery, or whatever. I’m guessing that this debate will depend on where you live. So in response to that, my country has always had our utmost health in mind. Your government may have had some in fighting on your coverage but that’s not to say no one cares. 
Anytime someone is walking around with a machine gun, the government cares! They stop the mass murderer. When a virus has the potential to destroy lives, you’re damned right they care! Their jobs are to research and save you for free - but what happened then? Selfishness. It’s sad really. Everyone thinks they’re specialized and know more than the other. Thankless herds following a cult/a person they call a leader who lead them to mistruth and hatred of science and their fellow brothers.</p>

        <p>Can you please provide me statistics of how many of those 650,000 Americans would be dead in the next year regardless of COVID because they were terribly sick people on death's door and being kept alive with no real quality of life? If we are going to compare the deaths from COVID to armed conflict can we at least appropriately compare demographics. Like let's count the amount of 18-40 years without any comorbidites that have died vs the amount of that same demographic that have died in combat.</p>

        <p>It's a highly contagious potentially lethal virual?
Quarantine responses are what you would expect from governments during a pandemic.</p>
<p>And while other responses to medical health and public safety issues haven't been quite so disruptive, i think you'll find billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of manhours spent on a whole range of things from road safety, obesity, heart and lung disease, and cancer, to name a few.</p>
<p>It just hasn't caused a massive impact on your day to day lives, or indeed everyones, as is the case with the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Edit* clarifying that there are many more instances in which the public sector has taken an interest in the general well-being of the people, not just those examples I've given.</p>

        <p>The original reason fluoride is in the water was because in the 1930s people couldn’t keep their teeth in their head. This was government sanctioned.</p>
<p>Most poor and elderly housing is government subsidized. Food banks and programs are government subsidized.</p>
<p>Healthcare is government subsidized, as well as farms that grow food -also distribution.</p>
<p>Schools are tax funded, colleges too, as well as grants and other programs.</p>
<p>Most vaccines, medicine and research  for new technology that cures modern ailments is subsidized- including the new cure for HIV and supplements for aids , and any new cancer research.</p>
<p>The real answer to your question is why wouldn’t the government be involved in vaccinations and also health codes for Covid- they are doing the absolute bare minimum in that regard as most states have left it to private businesses at this point and the federal government has almost pulled out entirely. </p>
<p>The government invests a lot in programs that are run privately- meaning our taxes go to healthcare and then private companies decide how it’s managed. You’re focusing on the wrong person or thing, and this may be why not enough people are getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Dear Straw Man Argument Maker:</p>
<p>First look up the straw man fallacy. Second, read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, then read Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, then Unsafe at Any Speed by Ralph Nader.</p>
<p>Since I know you don’t actually want any answers to your questions, and will not read an actual book, I’ll give you the TL/DR on those: author spotlights health crisis to which the government ultimately responds saving lives.</p>

<p>You can tell who is probably NOT part of it by who is not going along with the vaccines, which so far looks like North Korea and a few scattered African countries, who then had their leaders assassinated, probably as punishment.</p>

        <p>Yikes, I never thought anybody would think that (not upset just confused and definitely kind of freaked out). I googled dragnet but wound up giving up because I truly didn’t realize this kind of thing was not only going on, it was pretty much happening everywhere and way often than we might thing. Is that a fair assessment because if understood it all correctly then this is depressing.</p>
<p>I guess I jump out as having a lot of red flags (new account, stupid screenname). I’m a real person (not even sure if there would be any way to tell from this
nifty screen name but I’m a 30-ish female from the oil’ US of A.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the sign up to my regular Reddit and for some extremely stupid reason I was hoping it might download it with the app because of my Apple ID. When that didn’t happen I just said F’it and took the random generated name as my new perm one. I’m guessing there might be a way to get the password reset on my longtime Reddit but it was kind of nice to start anew. </p>
<p>I’ve seen people call out someone as a being a shill or a bot and 9 times out of 10 I’ve checked out their post history and agreed. I’ve also watched those same people give do unnecessary over explaining which like what people will take away from this.</p>
<p>I don’t know, I’m long-winded as fuck and I’m trying not to do it. I ran too long in my vaccine thread also but posting and reading Reddit is one of my main sources of enjoyment nowadays so I sort of allow myself to do it here, since it’s the only place I’ve got where the people understand me and Wheee I can come to remind myself the whole world has not gone crazy.</p>

        <p>I'll answer your questions as best as possible, but I know most people won't care or will justify away any reasonable answer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This particular disease isn't like any other you're thinking about. Sure, tons of people die from things like cancer, diabetes etc. But those are not contagious. They are genetically inherited, or developed from life style choices. Covid is a viral infection, and we haven't had a huge viral disease since polio, which as you know has been eradicated in developed nations. Viral diseases are very contagious, due to their airborne transmittance. It's not about ONE American contracting it, because that ONE American will lead to a dozen contracting it from him, which only grows exponentially until it is a crisis with millions being infected. You can argue something like "the common flu strains kill/transmit more people on average", but people aren't socially distancing, wearing masks, staying inside etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who are trying to save unvaccinated lives aren't government workers. I don't know who this generic "they" are that you are referring to, but if you're talking about the government, they aren't the ones trying to save you. It's hospital workers, doctors and nurses who are just going in for their 8 hours during this shit show who would get fired if they denounced any unvaccinated person who is sick. They HAVE to treat you, it is their job. Just because it's "your personal choice that led to you contracting this disease" doesn't mean they won't put in every effort to save you. That's like saying "i tried to commit suicide and failed, why is the hospital trying to save me"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a fundamental disparity in understanding this disease. Antivaxx, conspiracy people etc. all are under the impression that this is a "personal choice". Except its not. Not everyone can get the vaccine. Most notably, cancer patients who are immunocompromised. There are also a significant portion of the population allergic to vaccines. Your "personal choice" is potentially harming the most vulnerable population to this disease. And if you have a family member, friend, child, anyone close to you who is immunocompromised or unable to get the vaccine, you would be furious at the ineptitude of science deniers who know nothing about science and are trying to create a political conspiracy about the government tracking you like they don't already know everything about you from your driver's license and phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like this one because you're almost there. First, I'll highlight that this vaccine and a drug are significantly different things. A drug (say ibuprofen) enters your stomach, is digested, and enters your blood stream where it binds to certain receptors that cause the effect. This vaccine is a strand of mRNA (think DNA basepairs like ATGC except it uses AUGC) that is injected. It goes through your blood, into the ribosome of your cells (specific transport vesicles allow the mRNA to get to the ribosome) and translates (think mRNA as like an instruction manual for your body to create a certain protein) it into a protein (antibody) that fights the disease. Now maybe, instead of criticizing the facade of the government's "free vaccine handout" you should recognize that this has been possible the whole time and the government/big pharmaceutical companies are absolute fucking criminals that make millions off of the deaths of its citizens. Like instead of thinking "oh the government is completely subsidizing this vaccine, covid must be serious" you all think "the government made this free for a reason, they want to track us or microchip us, or oppress us." It's just such a complete distrust in the government that makes you guys go all conspiracy when they start acting differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So to your logic, if the government wants to take a matter seriously and protect its people, it should at least be an extinction level threat? What if they just don't want millions of Americans to die because it would shut down the economy more than it already did? What if they don't want the enemies of the US to know how vulnerable we are to a bioterrorist attack? What if the US doesnt want to become the laughing stock of developed countries again because every other developed nation has subsidized this vaccine and regularly criticize us for not having subsidized Healthcare? There's a million different reasons why they would foot the bill for this. Also, the polio vaccine was subsidized by the federal government in 1955 as well. </p>

<li>Nothing to say here. You're on the money. MRI and CT instruments basically pay themselves off (completely, like cost of maintenance for a year, cost of use and cost of operation) with like 6 patients. American healthcare is criminal.</li>

        <p>If you drink all the kool-aid the media gives you, it all sounds reasonable right? There's no ulterior motive to any of this, and the government only acts with the best of intentions in everything they do. No one is ever paid off or threatened into doing the wrong thing by criminals in that "Happy Valley" world. But for many of us, our gut instinct tells us that something is off. If yours doesn't, well, so be it.</p>
<p>But if it's all just fine and the government is perfectly acting with the best of intentions, why are normal standards of informed consent being ignored? Why are people not allowed to sue vaccine companies for malpractice if they basically poison thousands of people? Why are people being censored and fired if they don't go along with an EXPERIMENTAL vaccine and say that MAYBE we should be careful?</p>
<p>If there's nothing to hide, why is there so much effort put into silencing anyone who doesn't get on the bandwagon, and treat them like they're horrible people, including medical professionals who are acting out of concern for the patients they see having adverse effects?</p>
<p>Doesn't ANY of this bother you, or do you have zero curiosity or ability to consider the counter arguments of this?</p>
<p>Just a few examples of the censorship: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpViJcdJFkcEXPOSED - The Persecution of Canadian Physicians by Organized Medicine During the Pandemic</p>

        <p>Your "gut" means nothing. Your "gut" isn't unveiling some huge government conspiracy to control or oppress you. Nothing I said came from the media, it came from a science-based higher education, which I'm sure you think is some neoliberal indoctrination anyway.</p>
<p>In my post, I literally talk about how criminal our government is, I'm sure you didn't even read it though.</p>
<p>I dont have curiosity, because I was educated in an institution on this topic. That's great that you can find a 2 hour YouTube video to fit your bias and confirm your thoughts, but the doctors who are covid deniers and got punished absolutely deserve to be scrutinized. The main doctor in that video has a Ph.D in math and sports medicine, while the other doctor got fired for being a covid denier. A completely, biased, one sided video. You might as well be watching CNN.</p>
