        <p>I don’t think it is. I think that sure, there are people out there that buy all in to this trash because it’s what they want to hear. It’s not their fault their life sucks. It’s because they’re a victim. </p>
<p>But for the most part, I think people realize that all of this is ridiculous. They just don’t want to have to think so they follow their leaders. Leaders who don’t give one shit about them, but instead want power. Others realize it’s ridiculous, but they don’t like what the other side has been doing to some extent, so they end up convincing themselves it’s the lesser of 2 evils, and that this will get us back to a sense of “normalcy”. </p>
<p>Then theres the fact that one side of the political spectrum gets their ideologies written into law. Thought policing and censorship legislation. Which you can’t fight or speak out against or you’re a racist. Or a bigot. And so on. So they’re not willing to risk their jobs, businesses, families safety, or their reputation to stand up for what’s right. Some just don’t realize how far it’s gone. But I think the majority of people haven’t gone insane. They just don’t know what to do, and don’t know how to fight it.</p>

        <p>No, it's most certainly mass hysteria my friend. Look at this shining example the state conveniently never teaches you:</p>
<p>"The Seattle windshield pitting epidemic is a phenomenon which affected Bellingham, Seattle, and other communities of Washington state in April, 1954; it is considered an example of a mass delusion.[1] It was characterized by widespread observation of previously unnoticed windshield holes, pits and dings, leading residents to believe that a common causative agent was at work. It was originally thought to be the work of vandals but the rate of pitting was so great that residents began to attribute it to everything from sand flea eggs to nuclear bomb testing.</p>
<p>Originating in Bellingham in March, police initially believed the work to be vandals using BB guns. However the pitting was soon observed in the nearby towns of Sedro Woolley and Mount Vernon and by mid-April, appeared to have spread to the town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island.</p>
<p>Within a week, the news and the so-called "pitting epidemic" had reached metropolitan Seattle. As the newspapers began to feature the story, more and more reports of pitting were called in. Motorists began stopping police cars to report damage. Car lots and parking garages reported particularly severe attacks.</p>
<p>Several hypotheses for the widespread damage were postulated:</p>
<p>Some thought that a new million-watt radio transmitter at nearby Jim Creek Naval Radio Station was producing waves that caused physical oscillations in glass;
Some believed it to be the work of cosmic rays;
Some reported seeing glass bubbles form right before their eyes, believing it to be the work of sand fleas.
By April 15, close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as affected. Mayor Allan Pomeroy contacted Washington Governor Arthur B. Langlie, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking for assistance.[2]</p>
<p>Finally, Sergeant Max Allison of the Seattle police crime laboratory stated that the pitting reports consisted of "5 per cent hoodlum-ism, and 95 per cent public hysteria." By April 17, the pitting suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>The "Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic" as it is called has become a textbook case of collective delusion (not "mass hysteria" as reported).[3] Although natural windshield pitting had been going on for some time, it was only when the media called public attention to it that people actually looked at their windshields and saw damage they had never noticed before."</p>

        <p>Why not both?</p>
<p>Similar to your story, the extreme media coverage of covid has caused people to pay extra attention to certain cold-like symptoms, and even seek out medical advice, testing, when they normally would have shrugged it off with a hot tea. So yeah, a form of delusion.</p>
<p>However, many people are also acting out hysterically. Screaming at and even attacking people who don't share their belief in the mask. Resorting to name-calling and worse towards people who don't act according to their beliefs ("just stay at home", "keep distance", etc.).</p>

        <p>You're correct, my response was more to people with the "That's absolutely not what's happening" argument, etc.</p>

        <p>Smoking isn't banned, living near factories isn't banned, we aren't forced to live our lives to do everything to avoid cancer but we are forced against our will to avoid a diesese which has around a 0.05% death rate that is comparable to the seasonal influenza. People are killing themselves in lockdowns at an alarmingly higher rate, children are losing their futures and the joys of childhood, I really don't want to see the effects lockdown has on preschoolers socially and all, the vaccine isn't readily available and there are still plenty founded doubts over the safety of it which you may or may not want to acknowledge.</p>

        <p>Still comparing the severity of the virus to cancer? So you’re not debating wether or not the virus is bad, just government intervention? I’d argue it’s the government’s job to keep people safe from pandemics. Over 425k people have died, far more than those who died by the flu (for last year 300k for rona and 22k for flu). By making it a percentage you’re covering up the sheer number of people who have died.</p>
<p>As for the second part I can attest firsthand that my grades suffered from lockdown. I also suffered mentally. The thing is, the lockdown was a last minute scramble bc the US didn’t take action quick enough like Korea for example and the government completely mishandled it. New Zealand is already having parties again! I’d love to see people again and have things return to normal, it’s just that it’s been completely mishandled and people refuse to comply with guidelines to reopen safely that world governments have suggested.</p>
<p>All the things you put up there are bad, it’s just that you’re comparing drug use and long term health issues to a disease that you can spread without possibly knowing it to people who could be really hurt by it (the toddlers in your example or the immunocompromised)</p>

        <p>I would urge you to look into that 425k number, the demographics specifically. Let me know if you would expect them all to be here today even if there was no Covid-19. Excess deaths is also probably the better statistic to look into as well, however, excess deaths are also inflated due to the lockdown policies (so look at countries that didn’t have any or minimal lockdowns).</p>

<p>Are you comparing this nation to an island in the middle of nowhere with more sheep than humans?</p>
<p>No population density to speak of, no borders with any other nation, not the center of commerce for anything?</p>
<p>Bet you were pissed at Trump when he stopped flights from China and called him a xenophobe like all the other trained seals did, but said fuck all when NZ closed down the entire country to travel of any kind from anywhere.</p>

        <p>Okay, but that doesn’t change that cancer, the thing the guy above was arguing about, isn’t contagious so you can’t really compare it to the virus. I am also not making any claims about Covid being the worst contagious disease, there were plenty worse throughout history (I can think of the Spanish flu and the plague). But wouldn’t you say that although a stab wound is worse than a splinter they’re both still bad?</p>

        <p>I’m guessing they’re arguing that since most educators are women, pushing to open schools when they’re “unsafe” shows that we don’t care as much about women, and is therefore sexist.  However, one could argue that keeping schools closed is also sexist because more women are “stuck home” with their kids and can’t go to work, meaning they’re losing their livelihoods. Their claim of racism is similar. It can be argued on both sides. The whole thing is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>It’s just pitting sides against another. A fuckton of people thrive on the extreme division of people that exists right now. I don’t think pushing to open schools is rooted in any of that, it’s a dumb thing to say. I think that Twitter post is just to help further a divide and/or sow discontent in certain groups, which it does. I don’t think(and hope) that most people agree with that Twitter post, and if they do, well, to each their own I guess, even if they are wrong.</p>

        <p>For real! I know it's anecdotal, there are 8 on my team, 9 if you count our instructional lead. 3 women, 6 men. As I'm thinking about it, I'd say my school is pretty darn evenly split between men and women teachers.</p>

        <p>I went to school a long time ago but it seemed evenly split.  Maybe there are more women at the younger grades predominantly that skew the numbers or something.  Actually somebody just mentioned this to me IRL today now that I think of it so maybe it's shifted.</p>

        <p>Funny, it’s the same in Canada except it’s natives that are separated out. </p>
<p>What pisses me off about those ethnicity/race fields on forms is that they never have all the options, and most don’t even have “other”. I’m mixed and I end up having to choose one or the other. If I have to declare my race at least be thorough and let me choose between all the options...</p>

        <p>Mostly because Caucasian means from central east Eurasia. </p>
<p>It's northwest of what is typically Aryan, and east of slavic European, and North of Arab &amp; Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>Caucasian, &amp; Aryan are used almost interchangeable today because of racism, when they were intended to depict culture. </p>
<p>"White" which only came about to contrast "black" neither of which depicted cultures and still don't. </p>
<p>Hispanic means "from Spain" culturally but typically doesn't mean Spanish. </p>
<p>African American does not mean black, but is used as a cultural identification that is imposed on black Americans. If you are black you may not even have any ancestry to Africa (could be Australian) and if your several generations departed from your ancestors you are culturally American. </p>
<p>I myself am a pale skinned (in no way confused as black) African American. I occasionally get confused with Arab, but am predominantly of Mediterranean decent cultural Christian. I'm also about 1/32 American native. These designations only exist to make sure that racism stays alive. </p>
<p>An equitable system would be to state what county your parents are from for a possible nationalistic reason. Otherwise "citizen or non citizen with a listed county of origin" should be the only two options.</p>

        <p>Exactly! The schools in CPS are NOT safe and have ALMOST NONE of the safety precautions promised installed in the buildings. There has already been multiple outbreaks in staff and students since going back to class and teachers NEED the protection. Education is essential, but not at the cost of our teachers lives</p>

        <p>I assume it’s because there is a larger population of women teachers than men.  Ergo, woman are forced to face more perceived danger or make uncomfortable career choices = misogyny. s/</p>
<p>It’s complete and utter hogwash though because guess who was forced out of their careers to educate children- woman. Guess who makes up a large portion of the essential services these people rely on? Woman. How is that not misogyny by completely turning your back on them?(Including yours truly).</p>

        <p>This is the new way of thinking. If you don’t like something, all you have to do is call it sexist or racist (or homophobic) and then everyone else will also not like that thing. It’s magic!</p>
<p>Attempts like this are just an extension of cancel culture really. I’m pretty sure they can’t cancel the entire concept of school though.</p>

        <p>Teachers unions are the reason kids are becoming more and more fucking stupid as time goes on. In honesty, and position of authority shoudnt be allowed a union. All it does is allow shitty teachers to continue ruining kids educations. Couple this with so many kids falling behind in all learning, this is going to be the stupidest and more brainwash-able generation yet.</p>

        <p>Pick one? Pick both. How dare those racists demand black and Hispanic children be properly educated. This is an outrage. As a Chicago teacher I must insist these children be performing community service farm labour. We are facing a cotton shortage and only a bigot would deprive these kids of such a valuable opportunity to contribute to our nation's prosperity. As a socially minded Chicago teacher individual I must also insist that members of the Judaic-American community take a shower with 2000 of their fellow Judaic-Americans for public hygiene promotion. As a Chicago teacher I must also insist that those Judaic-American individuals died as a result of Allied bombing of German railway lines and never happened. The European community is in unanimous agreement that the events I just described never happened and were good. Please ignore the bodies of our Judaic-American fellow citizens that our evil communist allies found when they unjustly invaded these fun summer camps we created that don't exist. It is a tragedy what happened to these Judaic-American citizens in a sincere effort to contain a public health crisis. As a Chicago teacher I must insist that if you tell me to teach math to niggers and spics then you are a white supremacist racist. Please disregard this message.</p>

        <p>I'm guessing that, since it's coming from the Chicago teachers union, it's because so many teachers are female and non-white, whereas if more teachers were male and white there may be less of a push to repoen??? I have no clue how this could connect to kids, though.</p>

        <p>I'm a teacher and have been teaching face to face students (though students have the option to learn virtually so my classes are split) since September, and everything's been fine. Literally no teacher has caught COVID at school. It's pathetic watching teachers in other states melt down over the possibility of doing what teachers in much of the country have been doing throughout the fall and winter so far.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this the whole time. Public schools in my city have been closed since March. My area is predominantly hispanic and low income to middle class in Southern California.. not rich at all. However private schools were opened quickly for those who afford it of course. I believe this was purposely done to dumb down the kids. They were already struggling in the poorest scoring schools and this has set them back years! This will hurt them later as adults... no
One seems to give a damn. Including our governor. 😞</p>

        <p>Sounds like you need to be educated on the danger of covid for children.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the age-specific infection fatality rate was extremely low among children and young adults, measuring 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at 25. I know math isn't your strong suit but the flu is actually more dangerous for children. So if you care for their health donate to a free flu vaccine charity.  Try and not turn into a school shooter! You sound and act just like one.</p>

        <p>Pick one? You mean how poorer neighborhoods, which usually have higher populations of POC, don't have access to the same level of support and learning materials as rich neighborhoods?</p>
<p>Or how we try to open urban schools back up first because these parents can't afford to keep their kids at home and miss work?</p>
<p>Fucking entitled white people post garbage like this.</p>

        <p>You're free to answer the question too if you'd like.  This sub strives to be non-partisan btw and many of us are far from your stereotype.</p>
<p>I can help you with an argument too.  Perhaps the Chicago teachers' union is more concerned with maintaining their membership into the WFH class than they are about the "isms" they claim to care about and are just using those words as a way of trying to silence any potential critics.</p>
