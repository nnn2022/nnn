    <strong>Immunization passport + periodic vaccine = Population growth control ?</strong>
    <p><p>As immunization passports are being rolled out (initially linking to a ZH article but these aren't accepted by Reddit), we may wonder if this system of control is the end goal or if it's a tool to achieve the end goal.</p>
<p>As SarS-CoV-2 mutates, it's likely that the first Covid vaccine won't be the last one you'll need. The immunization passport won't only be required for you to travel but also for you to access the freedoms we gave up with the lockdowns. Coerced vaccination will be the new normal.</p>
<p>However, could coerced vaccination not only create a system of control but also serve the UN's Population Growth Control goal from the sustainable development roadmap called Agenda 21? There are precedents to support this hypothesis. For instance, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010514104342/http://sedac.ciesin.org/china/policy/acca21/218-1.html">UN report published in 1997</a> established that China, the USA, and India have been working on a contraceptive vaccine to help with Population Growth Control. The page had been removed but it was accessible from the <a href="https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/china/social.htm">official United Nations website</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover:</p>
<p>- Health authorities don't know what could be the effect of the vaccines on fertility</p>
<p>- Former GSK Chief Scientist has warned that these vaccines could cause infertility</p>
<p>- A scientist working for GAVI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=105&amp;v=IMAkFKprzRQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">referred to sterilization instead of immunization</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, immunization <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=961&amp;v=1LCcaYoaZWg&amp;feature=youtu.be">has been touted as a tool to achieve 14 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>. It's quite unclear to me how that would be the case although I could see how population reduction would help in achieving those goals faster.</p>

        <p>Medicine isn't being used to control expensive populations: wage suppression is. Forty years ago one apprentice salary could support a house, car, and family. Now it can't afford a studio flat. The difference in spending power - which would have enabled dozens of millions to have families - was pocketed by less than a thousand people. How often have you heard, "I would love kids, but I can't afford it?" That's why.</p>
