    <strong>Where can we find out what we can legally get away with/disobey in reference to lockdowns/mask mandates and things of that nature?</strong>
    <p><p>I know most people know the basics of their rights (USA) but a lot of us don’t know what rules and mandate are actually against the constitution and our rights. I want to be able to tactfully argue my point and want to know what can be legally disobeyed when it comes to unlawful mandates. I know this can vary from state to state, but I think it’s information we all need to know.</p></p>

        <p>Would also want to know this. There have been a couple of videos on this sub today doing just that and cops didn’t have a leg to stand on. One was from the UK too which is encouraging. I feel as if the Americans have their constitutional rights to fall back on and we are finally coming to terms with the shortfalls of having an unwritten constitution here.</p>

        <p>I think this is something everyone should know and be curious about. So many people comply because they don’t know their rights. We all need to educate ourselves so we can fight the tyranny together.</p>

        <p>It’s true! I’ve heard that in the states at least it’s been impossible to actually prosecute anyone under the corona measures because they’ve been thrown out of court for being unconstitutional. It’s a little bit more nuanced in Britain but there’s hundreds of years’ worth of legal precedents to work around if you are to be prosecuted.</p>

        <p>In the UK they have zero right to enforce anything or even stop you, not wearing a mask isn't a crime and you do not have to stop or identify yourself to a policeman unless they are charging you with a crime. In any case, just saying 'I am exempt' is enough, they cannot legally do anything after that and it even says so on the gov.uk website about mask exemptions.  They are not allowed to ask for written evidence of exemption or even ask why you are exempt. I have never worn one in the UK and use public transport and go in shops all the time, been asked about it 3 times, once I just ignored them (had headphones in was walking through a train station) and the other times just saying I was exempt was enough. My friend is bolder than me and just says no outright if they ask him to wear one, they can't do shit about it.</p>

        <p>In the USA prohibiting peaceful gatherings is illegal. (It violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the justice system in the USA has a..convoluted relationship to the Constitution. In other words, government doesn't follow the law.</p>
