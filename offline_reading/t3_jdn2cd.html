    <strong>[Question/Serious] Have you experienced either gaslighting or emotional tactics related to lockdown and COVID19?</strong>
    <p><p>With either emotional methods, manipulation or gaslighting I mean intentionally/consciously or unconsciously/automatically either guilting someone or coming with unfair emotional criticism for your lockdown skepticism views. Often using emotional arguments and playing with your emotions, and sometimes leaning to social control. (I'm sorry if I use the wrong terms here. English not my 1st language).</p>
<p>Some pro-lockdown people actually believes they've good intention and aren't aware of what they're doing can be wrong or incorrect. So, it's not always bad indented. Some people are just guilting others, are very pro-lockdown and use emotional tactics because they believes it's for the greater good. E.g. saying "If you love me, don't do X" or "People are dying because of the virus. If you goes out, you're putting people in serious danger".</p>
<p>Example on maybe clear emotional strategy: "It may kill your grandma" and "It's selfish not being careful".  Example on perhaps more subtle: "If I was you, I wouldn't go outside. The virus is very dangerous" and "I'm afraid what's going to happen to us. Why can't you wait till the vaccine comes?". Other examples on using emotions are "Have you remembered wearing you mask for your own safety?" and "I can't stand close to you. I'm afraid you spreading the virus and I dies". How subtle or clear the message is depends from person to person. It may either come from friends, fams, strangers, neighbors, coworkers or classmates.</p></p>

        <p>I've said from the start near enough that this whole thing is like an emotionally abusive relationship. The government being the perpetrators and the public being the victims. 
After the gaslighting and manipulating comes the victim shaming and blaming from those members of the public who are still deeply manipulated and gaslit.</p>

        <p>True. I've get bingoed a lot. I've written a list over what I get to hear a lot in the comment section and question description. I just asked if you've heard the same phrases too and which one you've heard the most. :)</p>
<p>These ones I've heard the most are "Have you remembered wearing a mask?" and "Being careful is important, so you don't put anyone in danger".</p>

        <p>Yes, I got the following statements from a friend the other day (paraphrased): </p>
<p>"If you want to stay safe and alive, you have to wear a mask." </p>
<p>"I can't see my stepmother in the hospital, so I don't feel sorry for someone who can't wear a mask." (this was in relation to a guy I was talking about on FB, not me)</p>
<p>While I feel sorry that she can't see her stepmother in the hospital, it's the same stupid government blocking her from doing that as it is making people wear masks etc. So she should be mad at the government, not people who don't wear masks.</p>

        <p>Not sure what's the right term is, but I've experienced these emotional phrases like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>"Be careful and take care. If you goes to the club with your college friends, you may get COVID19 and spread it".</strong> Mate said they didn't want me to go and I said they didn't need to go with me. I could take the bus alone. Suddenly they walked with me to the door and when my party was over, we met again and they walked home with me. Confusing. They don't want me to go and "support" me at the same time they don't "support" me. Why do they walk with me if they don't support my decisions? They know I will be unmasked on the club. They think me going there is stupid. They don't like me not wearing the mask. I'm confused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I don't want to get sick and asymptomatic people may spread the virus making me very sick, so please stay away from me. Better safe than sorry"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Don't visit your grandmother after being to the club. It may be consequences"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"It's not just a flu. It's dangerous and just look at the news. 20 y/o sporty girl without any underlying condition is permanently disabled with chronic fatigue syndrome because of the virus".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Have you remembered wearing you mask?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Don't forget wearing your mask. Take care".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"You don't need to wash your groceries, but I will wash mine. I know with quitting, bad luck happen and we gets sick".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We trust you. It's just that I need to be 100% sure you're informed and doing it well".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Are you sure you've enough masks? If not, I can walk with you in the pharmacy store".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm in college. I think people are nagging too much. Sometimes they acts confusing and unusual. They weren't like that before COVID19. A virus really change people.</p>
