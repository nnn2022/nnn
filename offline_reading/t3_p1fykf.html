    <strong>A pandemic of the elderly and people with comorbidities -- CDC statistics show half of COVID-attributed deaths match life expectancy for that age group</strong>
    <p><p>Let's consider the statistics of the 606,000 death count in the US. </p>
<p>Numbers below are from the CDC about leading causes of death in 2019. More people died from heart disease that year than have died from COVID in the 19 months of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Number of deaths for leading causes of death </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heart disease: 659,041 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancer: 599,601 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accidents (unintentional injuries): 173,040 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 156,979 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 150,005 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease: 121,499 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diabetes: 87,647 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 51,565 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influenza and pneumonia: 49,783 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intentional self-harm (suicide): 47,511 </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Next set of statistics is the breakdown of covid deaths by age group. Below is the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths in the U.S. as of August 4, 2021, by age*
Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/ </p>
<p>Total deaths from COVID-19: 606,389 </p>
<p>Number of deaths for... </p>
<p>0-17 years: 349 </p>
<p>18-29 years: 2,519 </p>
<p>30-39 years: 7,218 </p>
<p>40-49 years: 19,163 </p>
<p>50-64 years: 96,997 </p>
<p>65-74 years: 135,308 </p>
<p>75-84 years: 165,721 </p>
<p>85 years and older: 179,114 </p>
<p>CDC reports life expectancy in the United States as: <strong>78.7 years</strong>
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm </p>
<p>That means almost 344,835 of those COVID deaths (or if we account for the 75 to 78.7 age range, roughly half of total COVID deaths) happened in age groups expected to die any time or already past life expectancy. </p>
<p>There were only 29,249 deaths under the age of 50. That's fewer than the amount of people who died in 2019 from influenze/flu (and fewer than the number of suicides that year, too). </p>
<p>Furthermore, 206,762 people died from respiratory diseases in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm), which as the data shows, is more than a third of the amount of the deaths attributed to the COVID-19 respiratory disease over 19 months. Taking that into consideration, we're looking at roughly 400,000 (399,627) more deaths than expected from respiratory deaths from January 2020 to August 2021 (there were 345,323 COVID-attributed deaths in 2020, so that estimate is high). However, that's also roughly equivalent to the approximately 344,835 people who died at an expected time for their age group from COVID-attributed causes. </p>
<p>This means that COVID deaths that exceed the expected amount of deaths for age or respiratory illness is somewhere around 54,700. (This number doesn't account for overlap between those groups, but also doesn't account for other causes that cause mortality in both groups, so this is a rough estimate.)</p>
<p>54,700 = closer to the actual pandemic deaths</p>
<p>Also per the CDC, in 2020, approximately 3,358,814 deaths occurred in the United States. Since the "COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 375,000 deaths in the United States during 2020," (per CDC) that would be about 10% of deaths attributed to the pandemic. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm </p>
<p>Note that the CDC cites the "pandemic" causing deaths, rather than the COVID-19 virus. A small but important distinction: </p>
<p>"...[deaths that could] potentially could be indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., deaths from other causes occurring in the context of health care shortages or overburdened health care systems)." Source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm </p>
<p>That means that in 2020: 2,983,814 people died from causes other than COVID-19. Looking at that alone, you'd say covid caused 11.16% of deaths (375,000 out of 3,358,814). </p>
<p>However, when you factor in expected deaths by age and expected respiratory disease fatalities, that percentage drops to 1.6% (54,700 out of 3,358,814). </p>
<p>Of that 1.6%, we can further question the legitimacy of those even being COVID deaths because the CDC revealed they did not have a way to distinguish coronavirus from influenza when they changed the PCR requirements: </p>
<p>"CDC encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season." https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html </p>
<p>We can also question what is known as a COVID death. There isn't a clear consensus on this, but we can see that COVID doesn't need to be the cause of death for the death to count as a COVID death: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a) "tabulating deaths is tricky. Some states count probable deaths for cases where there weren’t test results available, but where the deceased had symptoms of the disease.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b) "All deaths of patients with a linkage to COVID-19 are now classified as “COVID-19 deaths regardless of cause or underlying health issues that could have contributed to loss of life.” - Dr. Deborah Birx - Head of White House's Coronavirus Task Force. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, CDC data shows that only 6% of COVID-attributed deaths are ONLY attributed to COVID. Of the other approx 94% of deaths, they had an average of 4 underlying conditions or comorbidities: </p>
<p>"Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of deaths that mention one or more of the conditions indicated is shown for all deaths involving COVID-19 and by age groups. For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death." Source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm?fbclid=IwAR1D1OLolIkotF4PdP-IpuonKrREOtKFYxEPpgzWdYrYATeQbkzkeuuQoCA#Comorbidities </p>
<p>That means that of the 606,000 COVID-attributed deaths, <strong>only 36,360 were only attributed to COVID.</strong> That's even lower than the estimated 54,700 above.</p>
<p>Has COVID-19 only been solely responsible for the death of 36,360 people? That would be fewer deaths than influenze and pneumonia usually cause a year.</p>
<p>For additional implication and context of what this all means, compare to the CDC number on the increase in suicide deaths from 2020: </p>
<p>"According to the Centers for Disease Control, over 93,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2020. That’s an all-time high, and the steepest year-over-year increase in thirty years. By way of comparison just over 72,000 Americans died of overdoses in 2019."  https://www.thewashingtongazette.com/2021/07/harvesting-sickening-fruit-of-lockdowns.html</p>
<p>That equals a 21,000 increase of deaths by suicide, which arguably can be attributed to lockdowns ("There was a 22.3 percent spike in ER trips for potential suicides by children aged 12 to 17 in summer 2020 compared to 2019, according to findings published in the CDC's "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report." That trend seemed to continue into this recently completed academic year as visits were up by 39.1 percent this winter, compared to the previous winter, the report said." https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youth-suicide-attempts-soared-during-pandemic-cdc-report-says-n1270463). That increase in deaths alone is more than COVID fatalities for any age groups below age 50 for the entire pandemic.  </p>
<p>All this data indicates that we're in a pandemic of age and of comorbidities, not of young healthy people.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find any errors in my calculations so I can correct. Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>When you look at the causes of death by age bracket, also published by the CDC, COVID doesn't present any greater risk than ANY of the top 10 causes of death for those over 65 either.</p>
<p>If your Gran isn't worried about dying from cancer this year... shes at no more risk than dying from covid.</p>
