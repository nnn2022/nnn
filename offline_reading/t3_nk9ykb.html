<title>I've been against the Covid vax entirely but now they've come out with an Mrna shot potentially to treat Multiple Sclerosis. As someone who has this I'm way more incentivized to get it than the covid vax obviously. I'm still hesitant since these things are so new tho. Your guys' thoughts?</title>

        <p>My thoughts? China has been using mRNA for a long time now to artificially enhance some people by altering their genetics (sounds pretty ridiculous, but its real). Right now you can see this in action in china because a couple of their basketball players have had this treatment as children and are fucking HUGE compared to the other pro chinese players. And yes I saw this IN PERSON when i visited china in 2015. I asked someone I had met there named Di Han and he told me that they had their genetics altered. Little did I know mRNA was gonna be a huge part of my life 5 years later.</p>

        <p>Wait a bit and see how the Mrna shot takers are doing in a year or so.
I was in a medical trial when I was a child for an asthma medication. They do not prescribe this medication to children and adolescents because it stunts growth. I'm 5'3 so it's not like anything terrible but I'm 5+ inches shorter than the rest of my family, I think I was likely meant to grow taller. Anyway I'd advise wait and see. I understand your interest, definitely.</p>

        <p>Well isn't that funny. Using it to TREAT ms...</p>
<p>But it's not a covid TREATMENT... It's a vaccine. 🙄</p>
<p>I'm not anti science like people say I am. I just don't want an experimental TREATMENT for something I don't even have.</p>
<p>But hey, it could be a good thing for MS and cancer but I think more research is needed. I hope I'm wrong and it turns out to be wonderful, and OP, I hope for your sake we make some headway.</p>

        <p>I think I posted this frantically because it had my thoughts racing about the mRNA vaccine as a whole. I see now though the risk/reward like some have said here are way more understandable in my case rather than getting an experimental shot for a cold.

        <p>MS is a tough break. The decision to participate in an experimental treatment for a condition as serious as MS depends on several factors, the potential side effects and how progressed your condition is being the big ones off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Having said that, the article raises some red flags with me. From my understanding, the only way to stop the immune system from attacking healthy cells is to kill the cell lines that "learned" to attack those healthy cells.</p>
<p>They don't explain how they can differentiate between good immune cell lines and bad ones.</p>

        <p>Right. I'm not very progressed at all rn. 25 and I only realized last year when I went partially blind in one eye for a bit and had my brain scanned. </p>
<p>In the article they say it works in the opposite effect of the normal vax in a way. The mRNA tells your body to create cells that are like myelin which is what my immune system attacks, teaching it to tolerate those cells more. Kinda like when people get allergy shots. </p>
<p>Definitely gonna wait but I'm hopeful. Initially when I saw this it made me question why I was against the covid vax so much but I think I was just shocked and now I see how they're pretty different.</p>

<p>Allergy shots do not work this way.</p>
<p>Since your disease is in the early stages, take the time to dig deep into the research to truly understand what is going on so you can differentiate the click bait from the real stuff.</p>

        <p>Once it's approved by the FDA, it's likely good. Personally, I like to wait a year or two after a drug has been out there before taking it.</p>

        <p>I've studied biology for 3 years and this is my thought: mRNA vaccines at indeed a new technology, but it is based on a lot of older, already existing technologies. In most other vaccines, some of the virus' proteins are injected into your body so your immune system can react to it and create immunity. The only difference with the mRNA vaccines is that instead of het proteins itself, protein like structures are injected which can help to create the viral proteins which your immune system can respond to. It actually is just the old system, but in a more efficient way.</p>
<p>I get that it is scary and I read a lot of comments about it being used to change genetics, but that just isn't the case. The mRNA Will not even enter the cell's nucleus (the place where all the genetic information is kept). </p>
<p>Of course you can decide yourself, but I'd recommend you to get the vaccine if you need it. Even if it uses mRNA.</p>

        <p>Unless you can get the purity 99.99%+, your shots will contain mRNA that doesnt code for the protein of choice.</p>
<p>Who knows what those misformed proteins [that your body makes from the misformed mRNA code] could do, what they have affinity for, where they go, and how they could potentially cause auto immune responses, especially if the misformed proteins are closer to something actually found in the mody.</p>

        <p>Yup that's what's scary. MS is already an autoimmune disease I don't need more lol. Plus I've thought a lot about how my affliction could have been caused by a vaccine from childhood.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting, really interesting since So much is still unknown about MS. Also enjoyed the comments. I agree with the “wait and see” approach - if your MS is not progressing or has stabilized for the time being, why not continue w your current regime and keep an eye on all the mRNA data in the meantime. Here’s to your health!</p>

        <p>This is a completely different situation, where the reward may outweigh the risk and it wouldn't be mandated. That being said, I have psoriasis, which I got from a TDAP vaccine, and I refuse to take biologics to treat it. I choose diet and lifestyle to keep it under control. MS is a completely different story though.</p>
