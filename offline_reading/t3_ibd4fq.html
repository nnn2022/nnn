    <strong>Sweden's All Cause Death Rate was no higher this year than any other year.</strong>

<p>Seasonal All Cause Deaths 1991-2020, <strong>season starting August.</strong></p>

<p>For context, Sweden didn't lock down. (As u/Tagrent pointed out, "Sweden did ban gatherings over 50 people that is still in effect." I wouldn't call that a <em>lockdown</em> though.)</p>
<p>They had 84,294 confirmed cases.  5,783 deaths. And that literally made no difference to their total number of annual deaths.</p>
<p>Is COVID even real?</p>
<p>I'm legitimately asking the question: Does it even exist? I know it technically "<em>exists</em>", but does it actually increase the overall death rate above normal levels? Does it even exist <strong>as a threat</strong>?</p>
<p>Lockdowns really don't do anything, do they... (Other than destroy the economy and destroy people's will to live).</p></p>

        <p>Covid deaths replaced the flu deaths that were going to happen. The flu vaccines are useless but people don't to admit that. Year over year death rates looking back at this wont show as much of a spike as people think. But we'll be on to the next manufactured crisis to help people forget.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say flu vaccines are useless but some years they are only 30-40% effective because of the guesswork involved in predicting the next season's most common flu stains.</p>

        <p>&rt; 30-40% effective</p>
<p>2018-2019 saw effectiveness drop to 9% for one strain. We'll never know how bad 2019-2020 would have been now. Experts were saying it was going to be the worst yet. And then the flu magically disappeared.</p>
<p>But even 30-40% is more or less useless and then makes the whole practice of vaccinating questionable.</p>

        <p>The problem with flu vaccines is the lead times for manufacture . They include 3 or 4 particular strains which are determined about 8 months in advance based on what the scientists predict will be the common flu strains the next flu season. However the flu virus mutates pretty quickly and sometimes scientists just get their predictions wrong *cough Ferguson*.</p>
<p>Having said that, 30-40% might still be useful for some at risk groups to give them a better chance of making it through another flu season. Even within a flu vaccine for a given year it might give good effectiveness against some of the strains it is meant to protect against but be inefffective against one of them. That's probably better than nothing.</p>

        <p>Covid, quite literally, only kills the dying. Take a one year period and compare to the last 5-10 years in any country and you'll find that nowhere has had a record year of deaths. Nowhere. </p>
<p>No, it's not a threat. If it was killing children in their millions, it would be. But 93-year-olds? It's sad but the human race will cope without them.</p>

        <p>And if you look at www.euromomo.eu, you see how much worse some countries got hit where they did not have significant flu seasons or excess mortality in recent years.</p>
<p>I think we're dealing with a combination of a bad "flu" (using that as a catch-all term for all the seasonal respiratory bugs out there) and an extreme harvesting effect.</p>

        <p>Yep, your point about it only killing old/sick people is very pertinent. Example - Australia where I live:</p>
<p>"Av mortality age for women = 85.2. Life expectancy = 84.9. Av mortality age for men = 81.1. Life expectancy = 80.7. Thus it is a statement of fact to say that in Australia, #covid19 is having no measurable effect on mortality "</p>

        <p>Sweden did ban gatherings over 50 people that is still in effect. It is better than new cases close everything down for a month. Then open up and new cases appear again and everything closes down again. No mandates to wear masks either. I don't get this mask fanaticism.</p>

        <p>I agree it is not a lockdown. But people have different opinions on what a lock down is. I think it is when the whole population is put in house arrest others when "non-essential business" are closed whatever that means. I think there is a difference between being able to go out for a walk while not being able to go to a restaurant than not being allowed to go out at all unless you have have a paper that tells why as in France.</p>

        <p>This is crass way to say it, but many people who died of covid 19 wouldve died anyway. Many people at nursing homes were already at the brink of death. People who already had 3+ comorbidities could just as easily have had a stroke or heart attack or whatever. </p>

        <p>&rt;Is COVID even real?</p>
<p>This is interesting on a number of levels, especially since the media went out of their way to smear people going anywhere near this line of thought as some kind of lunatic/wackjob.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> "covid"? "It" is <em>not</em> any tangible "thing". it's literally a made-up word covering a broad set of flu-like symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 is to "COVID-19" what HIV is to "AIDS". You can say "you have flu-like symptoms, caused by influenza virus", or you can say "you have flu-like symptoms, caused by coronavirus". Whether or not you actually care about any academic or technical differences between the viruses is up to you. But it certainly doesn't sound as scary when put that way, now does it?</p>
<p>Logically, the question should be, does SARS-CoV-2 indeed cause the flu-like symptoms being called covid?</p>
<p>The way that is normally determined is by a process known as "Koch's postulates". With its predecessor, SARS, the virus was said to be properly purified/isolated, said to specifically have fulfilled Koch's postulates. </p>
<p>In the case of this "novel" coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, however, scientists have spoken out on the fact that it has not fulfilled Koch's postulates. Which you'd <em>think</em> should be a major issue.</p>
<p>Moving past the Koch's postulates thing, the testing in general is problematic for other reasons too. The inventor of the rt-PCR test himself has spoken out about how the test is not fit for this purpose. That barely scratches the surface of the issues with testing, but I think it's the most critical thing.</p>

        <p>I seem to recall a brief controversy in the press conferences on the decision to go FDA EUA and procure PCR as a diagnostic. I also recall Dr. Birx saying something about PCR as 'gold standard' (circular referencing lol). This fizzled quickly. I've only seen a few mainstream articles hinting at PCR accuracy issues, and only recently. None has mentioned it being incapable of detecting functional viruses, which concerns me since that's not only a major limitation, but these 'features' are supporting many of the fear mongering headlines, and sustaining a casedemic for eternity if needed.</p>
<p>Is the whole world using RT-qPCR?</p>

        <p>PCR <em>is</em> the gold standard in the sense that everyone seems to be using some implementation or another of it. </p>
<p>Most people probably assume that the test actually tests for a virus and a "positive" means you "have the rona".</p>

        <p>The obsession with "testing" should be a huge red flag.</p>
<p>Before covid, a doctor would diagnose based on your symptoms and a test was only appropriate under specific circumstances to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Now it's just test everyone and if "positive", assume they're "infected" and contagious based on nothing of actual substance, even though the test doesn't actually prove much of anything at all.</p>

        <p>I gave up the generalization that covid-19 deaths even replaced or preceeded what would be another cause for all of these. A lot of folks pass with multiple pneumonia-like illnesses at the same time. I think a lot of them were already occurring or about to, and covid-19 was just the only notifiable disease.</p>

<p>I think we're splitting hairs here. Given the level of <em>extreme</em>  overreaction to COVID all around the world and <a href="https://kyil-extra.com/melbourne-police-state/">complete government fascism</a>, you'd expect Sweden's death rate to be something like <em>double</em> the normal annual deathrate.

        <p>In Sweden?</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>The death count as reported by SCB is true. There's absolutely no way that you could "hide" deaths, because Sweden is not some kind of third-world country that relies on paper records and censuses to keep track of the size of the population. Deaths and births are reported to the central registry the next business day, so you can see the actual population day by day, and this data goes back decades.</p>

        <p>I shared this and the Facebook SAHM SJW said that we need to look at the coming months to compare properly. She compared April and May to prior years while completing ignoring the low death counts in December to February this year compared to last year. I agree that it will be good to look at the deaths going forward but it doesn't look extreme like we thought in March.</p>

        <p>&rt; we need to look at the coming months to compare properly.</p>
<p>No we don't. As long as you compare full years, it doesn't matter if you do the cutoff at Jan 1st, or Aug 1st, if you do calendar years or seasons.</p>
<p>If you had data up until May 2021, and you put the cutoff at May 1st, you'd "split" the corona deaths between two seasons, which would be some kind of dishonest cherrypicking, but in the end it's all a wash anyway.</p>

        <p>It exists because the tests say it does. Where did the PCR test come from, and so fast? Apparently they haven't even isolated the virus such that the test can prove itself. By all accounts of doctors I know who work clinically with covid patients, the test is a sh!t show.</p>

        <p>Good question. Only certain key jurisdictions like NY and NJ have reported EXCESS all-cause deaths up to this point. Every other state does not have any significant excess deaths. Some jurisdictions can have large population of people living by artificial means which the CV response itself could disrupt. The response has caused an increase in suicides and overweight people too.</p>

        <p>This is a fantastic graph, but the maker forgot every other season...</p>
<p>The conclusion is still correct, it shows the trend very well, but any opponent worth their salt will immediately point this out and accuse you of cherrypicking if you use this graph.</p>
<p>&rt; For context, Sweden didn't lock down at all.</p>
<p>Still not true. Sweden implemented the least amount of restrictions in Europe, and most of it was recommendations.</p>
<p>&rt; Does it even exist as a threat?</p>
<p>There is a small amount of people who died from covid-19, and who died significantly ahead of their time. That sucks, but healthy kids and young adults die from the flu every year, and no-one gave a shit before this.</p>
<p>So yes, it's a threat, but it's not different from earlier threats that we completely ignored, so the response to this one is hysterical, ridiculous, and completely disproportional.</p>

<p>Yep agree. My rebuttal would be: Given the level of <em>extreme</em> overreaction to COVID all around the world and <a href="https://kyil-extra.com/melbourne-police-state/">complete government fascism</a> in many "civilised" 1st-world countries, you'd expect Sweden's death rate to be something like <em>double</em> the normal annual deathrate. The fact the deathrate right now is <em>lower than the 20-year average</em> and not way higher than it is simultaneously eye-opening and horrifying.</p>

        <p>Sweden did sort of a lockdown, it was just volontarely and not forced.They used carrots instead of sticks.</p>
<p>For example during april there was the highest number of people ever (twice as high as 2019) staying home getting paid to take care of their sick children. This is not because children were sicker, its because the guidelines says that you should stay at home of you have the slightest symtoms. Similarly the government made it so that you get paid more If you stay at home when youre sick than before. Riskgroups gets paid If they stay at home etc.</p>
