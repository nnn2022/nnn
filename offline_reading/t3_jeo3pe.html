<p><strong>The person fighting this agenda?</strong></p>

<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist but when the CEOs of the largest corporate companies (Mastercard, Apple, Barclays plus 1000 others) met in January to announce a "Great Reset" they meant business. In January, whilst we thought we were about to experience the next black death, these people were plotting the plan for the future on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visit their website, youtube and read the book, The Great Reset and then try to tell me to put on my tin foil hat. After you've read what's available, you will be wearing yours too! Prince Charles, our future King supports this initiative. There is no old normal. They tell you this themselves. Just another german fanatic (WEF Founder) with some sort of agenda for a socialist utopia without firing a bullet this time.</p>
<p>The pandemic is real however, it's now being politicized to further agendas.</p>
<p>Below is an article from Prince Charles after he's just recovered from the  "deadly" Coronavirus. Instead of counting his lucky stars for being alive, he's instead pushing for a "Great Reset"</p>

<p>Here is a video of Prince Charles (future king of the UK) pushing the Great Reset agenda plus a feature from the official Royal Family channel.</p>

<p>Here is a speech from Boris at his party conference the other day. And then below is an extract from the COVID19: The Great Reset.</p>
<p><strong>Boris Conference Speech:</strong> <em>After all, we have been through, it isn’t enough just to go back to normal. We have lost too much. History teaches us that things of this magnitude –  wars, famines, plagues, events that affect the vast bulk of humanity, as this virus has – they do not just come and go. They can be the trigger for economic and social change</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COVID 19 Great Reset Book:</strong> <em>“Many of us are pondering when things will return to normal. The short response is: never. Nothing will ever return to the “broken” sense of normalcy that prevailed prior to the crisis because the coronavirus pandemic marks a fundamental inflection point in our global trajectory. ”</em></p>
<p>Looks like there is no going back to normal after all. We're being reconditioned to accept more top-down authoritarian rule in the name of saving the environment at a cost of basic natural animal instinct.</p>
<p><strong>Now it seems to me these Elites aren't going to let a good crisis go to waste now are they?</strong></p></p>

        <p>Yeah ... my hope is that they’re overplaying their hand. </p>
<p>This is part of a long push towards socialism and globalization - those people seize upon any opportunity to further their agenda, and covid is a great one. </p>
<p>But I think, in their enthusiasm to acclimate people to severe government control for the greater good, they pushed it too long and angered too many. </p>
<p>The optimal play here (which they would have chosen if they were smarter) was: </p>
<ul>
<li>everything as happened until lockdowns started </li>
<li>severe lockdowns as happened for a maximum of 6-8 weeks</li>
<li>hardcore push for testing as happened </li>
<li>a concerted shift in <strong>media</strong> from cases to deaths and switching from a tone of fear to one of success </li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, a brief fear-driven period of acclimating people to being told whether they can work, where they can go, and who they can see, followed by a universal message of success: impose the punishment and then as soon as people have started getting used to it and accepting it, withdraw it while touting how much good they’ve done. </p>
<p>But, in true greedy socialist fashion, they’ve bungled it. They got people to accept and adapt to the punishment - but let it drag on until people started becoming angry and hurt and dissenting. They failed to deliver the <strong>necessary</strong> reward to get people to believe that government control over every aspect of life is good. </p>
<p>I’ve been scared of this socialist agenda for some time, but it just occurred to me while reading your post that I think they blew it. Too much punishment, too little reward is likely to have the opposite effect on many: a newfound resentment of big government. </p>
<p>At least, I hope that is the case. If not, we collectively deserve what we get.</p>

        <p>Man, I watch movies from the 1940s-1970s and it seems like Utopia. You can just live your life, free from any kind of surveillance, you had full freedom to basically do anything you wanted, go anywhere, all under a peaceful auspice of genuine social cohesion.</p>

        <p>Excellent post.</p>
<p>They would have looked so much better had they only done a 1-2 month lockdown that ended when the summer began, then returned us back to normal (like a "tough love" government). Since they pushed this thing for 6+ months and counting, people began to naturally "question" them to the point where conspiracy theories are now objective facts, their scheme is falling apart, their intentions are out in the open.</p>

<p>And right now it comes down to this election which determines if you're right or not</p>

        <p>I'm of the opinion they are angering populations by design so the people will actually revolt against their Governments and the whole system in general.</p>
<p>I think the end game is to get the majority of people (especially in western countries) to become so disillusioned with the current order of the society that they live in (economy, governments, religion etc) that they will eventually demand a complete new system as things get more dire as time moves on. </p>
<p>I expect major chaos, collapsed economies, wide spread poverty and general disgust for the way things are in the majority of countries from 2021 onwards.</p>
<p>What this will eventually do is create a global power vaccum which will allow a new global order to come in and offer global solutions as people become desperate. Order out of chaos.</p>
<p>What lead me to this conclusion is that this whole Covid narrative has been too blatant and obvious from the start. Even the most docile of sheep will eventually realise they lost everything due to their Governments being corrupt and lying to them.</p>

<p>Interesting - definitely has some plausibility. It’s impossible to tell which way things will go, regardless of their intentions, for the same reason that central planning fails: the world is simply too complex and diverse. </p>

<p>Well, if that’s their goal all that is left to see if enough individuals play along. I’m optimistic they won’t - but only if the pushback we’re starting to see now continues growing. If we allow this course to continue much longer (as is happening in Europe with their new lockdowns), then it is likely you will be correct.</p>

<p>This. They build plans, but will people on edge and pissed the fuck off accept it?</p>
<p>Two things happened in the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Canadian fishermen fed up with certain racial favouritism resorted to arson against fellow Canadians who are held up as a sacred cow based on ancient treaties people increasingly give zero fucks about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frenchmen witnessed a beheading in their capital, and instead of the usual rethoric, we're seeing riots and reprisal killings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See where all this shit is going? Imagine what will happen if even 20% of all the schizoposts are real.</p>

        <p>Correct you are, however, the below mentions state capitalism which is similar to what China has in place presently. It's not all-out socialism but it's definitely under the umbrella.</p>

        <p>One world government is not coming. WEF wants you think they are all powerful, but actually this emperor has no clothes. Great Reset will ruin the economy of all these countries and make them weak. Weak countries will inevitably get absorbed by more powerful countries. </p>
<p>It was exactly this way with the previous communist revolution. First they win, but they can't win everywhere - some countries stayed capitalist. Then during 70 years of iron curtain communists slowly ruined the economy of countries where they ruled, and instead of building the world government they lost all government. But hey, Soviet Union had the whole globe on it's coat of arms, there weren't planning to stop at the Berlin wall, they wanted to go all the way, they just couldn't.</p>

Every leader has their own agenda and no one is going to give up the power they have to fall behind one person. The WEF isn’t as powerful as they seem.

        <p>I have to agree. As bleak as this all seems, you have to keep in mind the absolutely gigantic logistics of running such a vast system where the entire world is under one government.</p>
<p>For example, China has went through numerous periods of division and splintering of empires. And China has MANY MORE reasons to stick together than the entire world does. Chinese share the same language, culture, and genetics yet those guys STILL go through periods of division. Think of how many cultures now have to "stick together" with each other, think about Palestine having to be buddy buddies with Israel after all the shit that was done to them. Imagine India having to be buddy buddies with Pakistan after all of the conflict they've went through. It's insane, that shit'll never work. Most likely they'll be able to only get the countries that wanna go through this, which would be most of europe and unfortunately America if Biden wins, but even then, the differences will show and the split will happen eventually.</p>
<p>I predict that what'll happen is that Western Europe will go through it's communist revolution, and stay that way for decades until it's economy falls apart.</p>

        <p>People who have bred are at a stark psychological disadvantage in these times. Their natural instinct and inclination to preserve their lineage causes them to deny any evidence of catastrophic social collapse. The people with families love to tout themselves as the "tough guys" who will "do anything to protect their children" but the reality of that means that they will be the easiest to control because they will always lay down and accept tyranny, in order to allow their children to live just a little longer, even if that life is one of bondage and slavery.</p>

        <p>That’s not true at all. My husband and I have kids and we will exit society altogether before we participate in any of this new normal bullshit. And our motivation is magnified by having kids. </p>
<p>People sustained themselves for hundreds and thousands of years without anything society offers these days and we can do it too. You don’t need money if you have enough skills and lasting or renewable resources to survive, so they can take all our money and we will still resist. We already homeschool, are armed to the teeth, and we have not had our kids wear masks once even though they are mandated here. </p>
<p>We will go it alone and die in a shower of bullets before we accept this new normal for our kids to live in. Kids have and always will live through hard things. I’d rather have them live through the hard times of fighting for our freedom than live through the tyranny of a new normal.</p>

        <p>We have friends and family with kids who are on the same page. They already get together with kids their own age to play without restrictions. So they’ll have a community, it just won’t be under the tyranny of an authoritarian communist society. They’ll learn the value of freedom and fighting for it, and how to take care of themselves and be self sufficient. Would a life where your every thought and action is monitored and regulated and restricted be a life worth living? Wouldn’t freedom in a smaller community be better? </p>
<p>And keep in mind, this is the disaster plan. Should things revert to the old normal there will be no need for this.</p>

        <p>Yes, we’ve worked together to form our plans and make sure we have enough skills and resources among us, and have land to go to. The hope would be that things will eventually return to normal, but we would be ok until then or even if it doesn’t happen. We’ve got 7 families making 31 individuals that are in and set to go. We also have other families who aren’t totally set yet but considering similar plans.</p>

        <p>We’re not religious at all. We are, however, people coming from generations upon generations of farming and ranching. First in either of our families to not be farmers or ranchers, but we grew up doing the work and still help so we know how. My family has been in America since the mid-1600s and has farmed since then, and I presume before then too. Add with that generations being poor and needing to provide things like clothing, blankets, barns, home remedies, etc. for themselves and passing those skills through the generations and we’re able to be pretty self sufficient.</p>

        <p>It is, but I would encourage people to get to know others who are likeminded that might be outside of where you normally spend your time. If you get to know some people in rural communities you’ll more than likely find other groups with similar plans. Our group would be more than willing to have people join us who don’t have those skills yet but are willing to learn, and we have enough land to accommodate many more. There is strength in numbers so I can’t imagine many groups like ours turning anyone down who is willing to work and learn. </p>
<p>People always shit on farmers and people in rural communities, but we are the ones who have the skills needed to resist. And most of us are pretty kind and accepting of anyone who treats us with respect and decency too. I live in a city now and it still really rubs me the wrong way how people who claim to be so accepting and progressive are usually very much the opposite. The people we choose to spend our time with are all in more rural areas still.</p>

        <p>That's admirable to say on the internet but entirely different in practice and reality. When someone sticks a gun in your kid's face or rapes your daughter in front of you, 99% of people will bend the knee and accept whatever terms will prevent their child from being tortured or killed. I don't know you or anything about you but this has been true of people far tougher than most of us, for all of history.</p>
<p>Children are the ultimate Achilles heel in this social structure because they are one of the only things we are still biologically hardwired to protect. By forcing or manipulating children to comply, you force adults to comply. School shootings are used to justify gun control. Child/teenage suicides are used to force the denial of biological reality and acceptance of "gender transitioning" and HRT. The same can be said of the acceptance of homosexuality. There is an argument for more censorship based on how "misinformation" and "conspiracy theory" can affect children's minds and world view.</p>
<p>Whether you or I are for or against any of the aforementioned issues is not the point. The point is that children are prime currency for social engineers because they are malleable and vulnerable. By controlling the minds and desires of children, you inevitably capture the parental desire for bonding and catharsis with the child.</p>
<p>If you think I'm wrong, just wait until oblivious parents start demanding that the state remove children from homes due to "Covid denial" or some other such nonsense "for the greater good."</p>

        <p>My children will never be removed from us. We will never be in a position like the one you’ve brought up. As I said, we have land. On that land are places to hide that will never be found. If they somehow are found they would be impossible to enter for an outsider and impossible for anyone to be extracted alive. This has all been planned for. Unless an entire army were to arrive, which would never happen for just a few children who are not in the public school system or in a location we have to our name (land specifically held by non parents), we will be more armed and prepared than anyone who could show up to take them. Even if an army did show up I still like our odds. </p>
<p>We’ve already prepared for the Covid denial excuse for removal of children, but mine will be unable to be located and very very safe. I think you are greatly underestimating the level of preparedness and survival skill set and resources some people have. When you have hunters and ex military on your side you can be very, very good at hiding, covering your tracks, and being on the offense the moment a threat is identified. It wouldn’t under any circumstances be worth the massive amount of effort and resources the government would need to take our kids.</p>

        <p>You're familiar with David Koresh and the Branch Dividians, yes? You sound naive or worse, mentally unstable but either way, I wish you luck and admire your commitment to the idealism of resistance. Like everything in life, it is much easier said than done.</p>

        <p>I am. And they were in a house out in the open which is not at all safe. Additionally, it was a cult and there was no reason to cut off like that. If we cut ourselves off it will be for safety and it won’t be in such a stupid location. People hid during the Holocaust - it’s not always cult behavior to hide from the government. And it’s not cult behavior to defend your family from harm even when the government are the ones trying to harm them. I’ll go to any lengths and I feel good about my plans and chances. And nothing lasts forever so even if all this were to happen I don’t think it would likely last until the end of time. Just have to wait it out until enough people are done playing along. </p>
<p>And of course it wouldn’t be easy. But people have done harder things than this forever. Life is hard and people are too soft these days so no one is willing to even try until they realize what they’ve gotten us into. </p>
<p>Also didn’t the branch Dividians set their own home on fire? Our place is not flammable or destructible, but it does only allow for one person to enter at a time and they’d have to make it a great way by themselves single file. Lots of opportunity to stop anyone who doesn’t know their way around as well as everyone else. We’d never take ourselves out that would be madness but no one else will be able to either.</p>

        <p>Good luck and God speed. I agree with your points for sure, I just don't think it wise or practical to assume any of us are immune to the web that is being spun. There is essentially a "social vortex" attempting to trap everyone in this matrix of control by making it unnecessarily and prohibitively impractical to exist without being "on the grid."

        <p>I feel that’s true. I want kids so badly and this was supposed to be the year. But I know once I have that little baby, I’m putty in their hands. I wouldn’t risk my kid’s life for anything, and I’d be reluctant to risk my own life and leave them parentless, especially when my family and friends (the pool of potential guardians) are all drones now.</p>

        <p>People with no families are the easiest to control because the state becomes your family. If people are 'doing anything to protect your children' - they are well aware that they are being terrorized. If you have no children, you might join the government because that would be your only chance to belong somewhere.</p>

        <p>Yea...right. If I tell you "take this vaccine or I'll take your children into custody to protect them from you" or "integrate yourself into a digital world currency system or you and your family will essentially become illegal immigrants in your own country, unable to participate in the banking system, get a drivers license, be legally employed or have access to housing" 99% of people with children are signing up, no questions asked.</p>
<p>They can swear up and down that they won't comply but when push comes to shove, this is simply more evidence of the deep-seated cognitive dissonance that is programmed in us by attempting to breed in a social matrix where we, in reality, have very little control over how our children are raised.</p>

        <p>I'll take the vaccine. The vaccine is waaaaaaaaaay way less big of a deal than everyone thinks. No, it won't be effective. No, it won't have microchips in it. No one will even make any serious money from it. It is a complete distraction. Amazon already made more money from delivering stuff during quarantine. Google already colleced a lot of data since everyone stayed home and used devices. Bill Gates made more money on the growth of MSFT stock during COVID and no vaccine profits will come any close to that.</p>
<p>Microchips are useless. There is one in your passport, and they still didn't put any data into it. Jeez, they didn't install any devices in the airport to scan this chip  until like, last year. The passport chip is a thing for more than a decade already. Actually, if you look at the COVID death curve, you'll realize that the government still has no idea when someone dies. Deaths are cyclical here, Sunday is the deadliest day of the week, because apparently some deaths that happen during the week are filed on Sunday. You really think these people can track your thoughts, when they have no idea who died in hospitals that they manage? </p>
<p>Money was always controlled by the government. Paper money is more controlled by the government than digital money. Nowadays, drug dealers prefer digital money. </p>
<p>It's not that doom and gloom.</p>

        <p>It's related in the sense that it undermines the freedom of bodily autonomy and creates a paradigm of manufacturing compliance. It doesn't need to have a microchip. It could just kill a lot of people, give them cancers, alter their DNA in some destructive way. Any number of things. It's about removing or interfering with various aspects of personal choice until there's nothing left of you but an obedient shell of a human being.</p>

        <p>I'm no genius, but the general public are fucking stupid. They will accept the technocracy. </p>
<p>I know idiots with advanced degrees in STEM who call me a conspiracy theorist, think that all vaccines should be mandatory, and who would be happy to have cybernetic implants in their bodies, or have their consciousness transferred to machine bodies. </p>
<p>I'm not saying these technologies have no merit in any conceivable scenario. I'm saying the people pushing them, and their reason for doing so, makes them decidedly against our interests, and these idiots think we're crazy for saying that.</p>

        <p>The hard evidence is the pirbright 2015 gates sponsored coronavirus patent, event 201 in october '19, and lockstep in '11.
For starters, there's a lot more.</p>
<p>The ugly "reset" (for a worldwide tyranny) has been in the works for a very long time.
World Economic Forum...one of the ringleaders.</p>

        <p>I do agree, way too many coincidences have occurred since the start of all this madness. How do you think the virus started? Do you think it's real? Or engineered? To get all governments to obey by a virus that isn't real would be one huge feat.</p>
<p>Absolutely agree with worldwide tyranny being endorsed across the political spectrum. It's in the Rockefellers Sustainable future guide, it's on the back of the dollar bill and numerous presidents haven't exactly shied away from what their real intentions are in terms of an NWO.</p>
<p>I do worry we're trying to follow China into state-sponsored capitalism. As the population grows, the state needs to grow its control. In fact, I think China has a large role to play in the NWO than we're lead to believe.</p>

        <p>The origin doesn't matter if it's even real. All that remains is to not wear masks, refuse any injections or invasive tests, live life as normally as possible, and tell others. Here's the links.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>...btw, the the virus has not been isolated. </p>
<p>The CDC document is titled, “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is dated July 13, 2020.</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</p>
<p>Buried deep in the document, on page 39, in a section titled, “Performance Characteristics,” we have this: “Since <strong>no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</strong>, assays [diagnostic tests] designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA…”</p>
<p>the test gets 80% false positives. these are the "cases".</p>
<p>They're testing with up to 45 PCR cycles. 25 is normal. 45 is overamplification. <strong>The inventor of PCR, Kary Mulis, said don't use the PCR test for diagnostics</strong>. He died in August 2019.</p>

<p>link to Lockstep 2011 agenda pdf
https://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf</p>
<p>7500 people die every day...they just say some have it..hospitals and docs get paid to do this.</p>
<p>Soros and others are paying governments around the world to lockdown. This is also confirmed, in Argentina and Belarus, by whistleblowers.</p>

<p>The inability to actually physically meet with other people due to Covid-19 measures only increases the schism / polarization between those who have awakened to the oligarchic agenda and those who still are asleep. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must not give up. A mass awakening is not entirely impossible, but it will require the dedication of people like to any me.

        <p>The first option seems more plausible to those that haven't got an inch of fight left as it seems I along with a few others are in the minority on this. If enough people lost the majority of their livelihoods and it came to a point where people couldn't feed their children, the narrative would fluctuate.

        <p>What do you mean believe? There is a great reset at play, if you follow the links watch top ranking elites speaking about this agenda, you can’t even deny it. Where did I mention anywhere about masks? That’s just everyone’s favourite buzz phrase when they can’t intellectually deny what’s actually happening. </p>
<p>First page of the great reset book states “this is a great opportunity to reset the global economy” - so there you have it. In pure black and white. A great opportunity that they sure as hell will not want to let slip. Governments can enforce what they want in the name of keeping you safe. And then it’s down to the government to tell you when life can resume. Problem, when’s that going to happen?</p>
<p>Being against the new normal doesn’t make you any less of a human after all who is right and who is wrong? I wasn’t any less of a human when I was told not to wear a mask at the beginning of the pandemic so what’s the different 6 months down the line? I’ve already potentially killed thousands!</p>
<p>If you think the mask will continue to save lives then continue wear it. In fact hell, I endorse everyone in this sub to wear a mask it isn't gonna stop the new normal though is it!</p>
