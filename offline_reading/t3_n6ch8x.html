<li>Masks work. Have you worn one and blown on your hand and felt how little air comes through? It’s obvious it’s preventing circulation of air. That’s some basic experimentation you can do, but there’s a lot more research in how effective they are. Everyone agrees they are not 100% effective which is why there’s other restrictions.</li>
<li>No cases of fully vaccinated people contracting the virus.</li>
<li>There is a normal amount of people who die per year. This is sad but will always be true, and considering the amount of charitable donations to medical research there is, I know people care (you may not) and want to prevent what can be prevented. When you have a dramatic uptick in deaths that are at a pace that show we would far surpass the normal (and it did), why wouldn’t you try to suppress it? And saying no one cares about people dying shows that you really have no understanding of people from my perspective either. Caring about preventable deaths the exact reason me and all the “sheep” are taking every precaution possible. You’re just the one that doesn’t care.</li>

<li>People who don't wear masks don't get tested, only people who wear masks get tested. This means that cases only come from masked people. This shows that masks don't work. And if someone who doesn't wear a mask does get sick, he/she just goes through the sickness at home.</li>
<li>If the vaxxine works, then explain why countries with the highest % of their population vaxxinated are experiencing biggest surges ever. For example, Seychelles's cases skyrocketed after they started administering the vax. India's cases skyrocketed after they started to vax.</li>
<li>It's not that I don't care about people dying. People dying is an unfortunate part of life. But sacrificing the past 14 months of your life for what was essentially a flu season is laughable. Why didn't you stay at home all the previous flu seasons?</li>

        <p>&rt;inconsequential things like a mask</p>
<p>Children of the future who cannot recognize subtle facial queues disagree.</p>
<p>&rt;when the stakes are the lives of you and others</p>
<p>I had it already, its a fucking head cold for &lt;40YOs. Likewise, a vaccine exists, if you are at risk, go get it and lets get back to normal life. If the at risk get vaccinated, no one will die. Those not at risk don't need it, you can still spread the virus if you get it, and if the symptoms are mild for you, what's even the point? </p>
<p>I just want to clarify for you. This has never been about safety, this has been about moving a shit ton of wealth away from small business and redirecting it toward large corporations. It has been about slowly removing freedoms and liberties while perporting that the changes are for "your safety." </p>
<p>Open up the countries, and if you are afraid, THEN STAY HOME.</p>

        <p>But you’re not just making the choice for yourself, you are endangering others. Your head cold (or NO symptoms at all!) could cause the death of your coworker, or elderly grocery cashier. How can you not respect other lives that way? Its simple courtesy at the least!
And about the kids, for someone so skeptical, you sure are ready to sign up with the long-term social effects are, give me a break. Who said that? An expert? You don’t believe those on principle.
I do hate the boom the big businesses got, it sucks. I’ve done what I can to shop local, but it’s not enough. I don’t think there’s someone pulling strings for it, but won’t argue that it’s a shame.</p>

        <p>Like I said, if they are at risk, they should be vaccinated (and thus protected.) If they are protected, what I do shouldn't matter, because the at risk are vaccinated and I don't get symptoms. As I also said, vaccine doesn't stop spread, so that argument is senseless.</p>
<p>As it pertains to kids, it is pretty clear if they don't see facial queues, they won't learn them... get a grip. I have 2 kids and my oldest tries to take other peoples masks off because he doesn't like it. He is used to seeing faces.</p>

        <p>I understand the game is changing with the vaccine, so I kinda get this logic. But I am not going to risk other people on the assumption that they’ll be fine. So you agreed with masks before the vaccine? 
Well duh he’s used to facial expressions, we are all fucking used to it. It doesn’t mean he’s screwed for life. It’s like when a father goes off for the military for a long time, the kid may not be familiar with him when he returns, but the normalcy returns eventually. Humans are pretty smart actually.</p>

        <p>Not so much worried about my kids as I would be the parents who wear masks at home. If a kid in the 3m-2yr range is raised without seeing faces, they missed critical developmental milestones that may never develop. Of course humans are smart, but a kid beaten daily for instance will always have that trauma and anxiety. Can a kid learn this as they age? Perhaps, but I'm not taking that risk. </p>
<p>As for masks.. If you wanna wear one, wear it, my concern begins when government mandates it.</p>

        <p>The same way you err on the side of caution with other CDC guidelines, like not eating raw/undercooked foods: sushi, ceviche, runny eggs, rare steaks/burgers.    And you obviously check EVERY piece of meat you cook with a thermometer before serving, also per cdc guidelines.  It's almost like you believe you can make your own risk assessment judgements in defiance of "experts."</p>
<p>In this context, as with so many others, the CDC guidelines fly in the face of all previous common sense and studies.  I have years of mask training, testing, and wearing under my belt, and thanks to OSHA standards and objective testing equipment can both explain to you and show you how poorly even N95 masks block aerosols when worn in realistic settings.  If you want a mask that actually seals and thus protects, find something with a good couple inch thick wide rubber perimiter.  Anything else is theater.  This is how proper science is conducted, btw, through data and testing, not "common sense" or "err on the side of caution."</p>
<p>If we as a population really cared about health, we'd mandate exercise and healthy diets, because obesity kills FAR more every year than covid ever could, costs society more in a host of ways, and makes people more susceptible to both severe covid and transmitting it!  Addressomg obesity would save millions upon millions in the US alone.  Why isn't this a big deal?</p>

        <p>Which means we much decide for ourselves which government guidelines are useful, and which are idiotic overreach, and the answer is that most are in the latter category!  If you listen to the government to decide how to live a happy and healthy life, you should expect neither, the track record is too poor, and the government's motivations too questionable.</p>

        <p>Yes, I make little low-risk judgements for myself when I cook food. They affect me and my household only, and I have enough experience cooking that I know what to expect and what my comfort level. If I was cooking a batch for thousand of people, I would probably double check the thermometer. And if I go to a restaurant, I expect them not to be taking risks with my food. The public is different than private health risks.</p>
<p>I would be interested in seeing the aerosol tests you’re referring to, that’s the first objective argument I’ve seen that could actually make some sense. My understanding is it also prevents circulation of air, keeping it near you rather than going throughout the building, for less spread.</p>
<p>If I was mandated a specific diet because other people were obese, I’d be right here with you on the skeptical side. Obesity is mostly personal decisions, and there are initiatives to help with some of the more systemic issues. But it’s also a multi-faceted issue that is rooted in our culture and lifestyles. COVID is a single virus that had potential to be reduced with specific actions. “If the country does [a, b, c], less people will die.” There’s not a little check list of things I could do for other people’s obesity.</p>

        <p>We should really, based on CDC recommendations, shut down all sushi restaurants and make it illegal to serve raw/undercooked meats, eggs, etc.  This affects millions!  And it's the CDC recommendation, right?</p>
<p>No, you really do retain the presumption of making your own risk judgements, whether disregarding the hilariously flawed government food pyramid (pushed by industry, of course) or restrictions on sushi.</p>
<p>Masks really are a much broader subject than the media wants to admit.  If you look at masks that are actually about life and job safety, those for which OSHA sets manufacturing and testing standards, you see a rabbit hole of digital particle counters, neck and face movements that disrupt poor seals, rules like no facial hair below the lip line, etc.  You also get a host of industry standards with government vetting and oversight.  With all that, and a properly trained individual with a properly sized, fitted, maintained rubber mask, you can still get leaks if you don't tighten them correctly, they get jostled, or you distort your face too much. There's a reason firemen (should) check their mask seal on every shift and as part of every 2 minute drill.  Compared to all that, even N95s are a joke.  They are ONLY designed to protect the wearer, and you can watch every move you make let by particulates larger than vial aerosols if your test equipment shows counts.  (For reference, 10 yrs as a fireman I've done these too many times...)</p>
<p>If you look up cloth masks you'll find a host of "not a medical device" "not designed to prevent the spread of disease" disclaimers, because there is no testing or regulatory body or standards.  Cloth masks are theater, they're not generally knitted tightly enough to prevent aerosols from slipping through (MIT video, i think, showing vapours oozing through.  watching people in the winter with their breath visible through and around is similarly enlightening.) and any larger exhalation, sneeze, or cough will overwhelm the elastics and particles will exit everywhere.  They're just not capable, and the CDC's own flu preparedness documents from pre-2020 pretty much assumed cloth masks work poorly by untrained individuals would never be useful.  Mapping mask mandates (and compliance numbers) to cases/icu show zero correlation, reinforcing these studies.</p>
<p>So far there's no check list of behaviors shown to limit deaths to (or from...) covid, anywhere in the world, except MAYBE opening up fully to get the core spreading community, the 15-35s, all exposed and over it as quickly as possible, to make further spread more difficult.  Models from as far back as april 2020 predicted this, and it matches what you see whenever performing age-stratified epidemiological models.</p>

        <p>Risk vs reward. For your example, risk of getting hit in a car crash is relatively low, but the consequence of not using my car: losing my job, not being able to do anything beyond walking distance (assuming public transit isn’t very good, which it is in some places). It would be quite life-altering. Mask for example: risk of contracting a potentially deadly virus, reward... nothing?
There have been a good amount of restrictions that I would agree are life-altering like restaurants and such, but the risk of these things are MASS spreading which I consider not worth the risk in most cases.</p>

        <p>I also work for a big company and have weekly calls with my company and others where I hear how behind they are due to COVID sickness and death. Weekly reports of cases, and deaths. Who’s is right? Well, probably both of us, I know I’m not lying and I don’t think you are, I just think we’ve had different experiences. Your experiences do not counter mine. Maybe they make you feel good, but it’s not enough to tell me mine aren’t true.</p>

        <p>Questions for you people:  I have a family member is is deathly allergic to peanuts.   To the point where touching a surface where a peanut has been, and then accidentally touching their eye would kill them.  Other people are deathly allergic to tree nuts, soy, strawberries, shellfish, etc. </p>
<p>Are you willing to give up all foods that are known allergens, and ban these foods from your kitchen, from all grocery stores, to save these people's lives?  On the chance that you might unknowingly transfer the deadly allergen?  To err on the side of caution?  Or is that too much work for you?  Keep in mind, lives are at risk. </p>
<p>Also, just because you don't have a problem with masks, doesn't mean other people don't.  Other people can have severe anxiety from having their faces covered.  Other people have respiratory issues that are exaccerbated from wearing a mask.  Don't you care about them?  </p>
<p>Its depressing to think that all you care about is yourself.</p>

        <p>That’s not a bad example, but there are a lot of restrictions that keep people with nut allergies safe (“processed in a plant with peanuts” etc). These are also a small percentage of people, and they will have to be responsible for themselves in these cases. However, if I was told something specific I could do to help with decreasing the odds of accidental peanut touching in stores, I’m sure I would. That’s a large scale risk vs reward: large scale sacrifice for minuscule risk reduction. Masks for example, small personal sacrifice for large risk reduction.</p>
<p>Anxiety and oxygenation issues are different okay reasons (although I’m sure they’re rarer than skeptics claim, but I can’t back that up), but everyone should do their best and if you don’t have those issues (legitimately) you should wear a mask.
I have never been worried about myself. I’m young and healthy, I know I’m low risk. I care about high risk people and want to do everything I can to keep them safe.</p>

        <p>Exactly what amount of deaths is acceptable to you?  What is your cutoff before you  change your behavior?  Is it only high-risk people you care about?  CDC data shows that the average age of death of COVID is over 80, and 95% of those people had co-morbidities.  So, high-risk people don't have to be responsible for themselves, its just the children with food allergies that do?</p>
<p>And how does a warning label work exactly?  How does that label prevent someone from touching a peanut, and then touching another surface?  How does it prevent a child who can't read from then touching that surface, and then their eye?</p>
<p>I'll tell you something specific you can do. Stop buying all foods that are known allergens, and then shame all of your friends and family and businesses you frequent to do the same.  You know, the way you are attempting to shame the people on this sub.  As you said previously, lives are at risk!!</p>
<p>Why do you hate otherwise perfectly healthy children with food allergies?  Why won't you do everything possible to keep them safe?</p>
<p>And your language regarding the masks is interesting.   You are young and healthy, and can't fathom that other people may not be as privileged as you, in regards to your physical and mental health.  How exactly do you determine what the "rare instance" is where it is acceptable for someone to not wear a mask?  How exactly do you determine what someone else's "small, personal sacrifice" is?  Why are you so selfish that you can't think about other people?</p>

        <p>Peanut example sucks. There’s not hundreds of thousands of deaths. 150-200 per year. My cutoff is somewhere between, but the examples are so astronomically different we don’t need to figure out where the line is.
And even if the average age is 80, there’s still tens of thousands younger people that have died.
Woof, you are really concerned about people with anxiety, but couldn’t care less about how many thousands of old people die.
And my healthy comment was about what my motivation for all of this is, it’s not about me at all. Which I only mentioned because you called me selfish and I don’t get anything out of this. I haven’t been trying to shame anyone, only debate.
And ignore people with severe anxiety disorders and oxygenation issues for a second: everyone else should wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I think the peanut allergy was a good example comparing what personal responsibility you have to someone at risk. But any analogy between two things breaks down eventually. In this case, the scale was not comparable (not just nuts, allergy deaths are like less than 500 per year).
I can’t tell anyone what to do, and I sure as hell knew I wasn’t going to change anyone’s mind here, I was hoping my mind would be changed a little (no way I would 180, but at least understand better).
I haven’t told anyone what to do publicly regarding COVID. I came to an anonymous forum of skeptics asking for some perspective. I’m not trying to control or shame anyone, this would be the last place I would come to try to change anyone’s mind, I know anyone here is pretty rock solid in beliefs. I’m debating for my own perspective. 
I know my motives dude. Glad you wear a mask. Thanks for shaming me, I appreciate your shame more than I would appreciate your praise</p>

        <p>Every COVID-skeptical politician has their motives as well. They can’t really both be wrong. You can’t just knee-jerk react to any authority figure as being wrong, otherwise you’re just a turning into a sheep by trying not to be a sheep.</p>

        <p>Low percentage of death, multiplied by VERY high number of cases equals high number of deaths (hundreds of thousands). You can say a low percentage if that makes you feel fine, but it’s ignoring the high number of actual deaths, and that’s the number we need to be fighting to decrease. Those are all people. How can you be okay with not doing everything you can to lower that number?</p>

        <p>History proves time and time and time again that no organization, no science, no government is truly trustworthy. It wasn’t that long ago that the science of Eugenics believed that certain people groups needed to be sterilized to promote healthy genes, and in America there were large sterilization campaigns against “inferior” Caucasians (aka white trash as some say now), the homeless and the mentally disabled. This inspired Hitler later, including literature by the so called Eugenicist scientists to do the same to the Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, blacks and dissenters. Like now, they cited science. Their agenda and narrative was backed by the science of their time. </p>
<p>If anything, my hesitation comes from history. The side of caution is trusting history’s lessons—not “popular science”, realizing that science has, is, and will continue to be abused for the motives of powerful people at the cost of others.</p>
<p>And here’s a tidbit of more history: Eugenics got such a bad rap after the Holocaust they renamed themselves as the field of Genetics. :)</p>

        <p>Things like this don’t compare apples to apples. You can’t just say nothing is trustworthy and give an example of someone being untrustworthy and rest your case. Give me evidence on this event, not just that you distrust anyone and anything.</p>

        <p>It wasn't just "someone" who was untrustworthy, it was an <strong>ENTIRE</strong> branch of science called Eugenics. </p>
<p>This is not my opinion. It's history. History shows that science has been wrong in the past, abused by governments and other organizations, the very purpose of science is to question in the hopes of coming closer to evidence. If we can't question the "science" then this is no different than saying we can't question religion. This doesn't mean I can't ever trust science. It means, you, and anyone for that matter, should never blindly just take by faith everything people say. </p>
<p>It's the same stupid shit the Germans did--took everything Hitler said by faith. It's the same stupid shit many Conservatives did--took everything Trump said by faith. It's the same stupid shit many Democrats did--took everything the media says by faith. It doesn't matter who it is, what party, or group. It's much easier to just believe what people say and be intellectually lazy than to take full responsibility. </p>
<p>I have work to do, I can't sit here and educate you. I gave you my answer and it's a legitimate answer. Look it up yourself. I did my due diligence and I'm busy. </p>
<p>My stance is that I remain skeptical, especially with no real long-term trials and testing. If down the line, years from now, all the data becomes conclusive that the experimental vaccines are safe, I may take it.</p>

        <p>I never said all science is bad. I said it's not truly trustworthy. Being a healthy skeptic is a good thing. It doesn't mean throw everything out. Governments have some good benefits. Governments aren't truly trustworthy though, like one would trust a good friend. Doesn't mean let's all go bonkers and be anarchists. </p>
<p>My point is popular science is not the side of caution we should take. History is the side of caution we should take. And like I said, it doesn't mean I can't ever trust science. Data is ultimately interpreted by flawed humans that either function from bias, or ignorance. All the more reason why questioning doctors, scientists, and so-called experts is a healthy habit.</p>

        <p>Alright, that’s a fair approach. Please tell me where you get your unbiased data and how you draw your conclusions, I’m genuinely interested in how you do this if you’re really that objective about it. I feel like I hear a lot of people say this, but they happen to come up with the same conclusion QAnon and mommy anti vaxx mom Facebook groups did and they aren’t the most logical population.</p>
