    <strong>New normal got you feeling depressed?</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of these posts about people here being depressed and feeling hopeless. Get out in nature. Seriously. If you have any nice state parks like we do here in Texas, spend your weekends there in nature and refresh yourself.</p>
<p>I just got back from spending the day at Garner state park with my wife. Hiked a few hills, took in the beauty of God's creation, sat by the river. Tons of people with RVs and tents set up. Grilling, kayaking, hiking, little kids running around. Not. A. Single. Mask the entire time.</p>
<p>Contrast that with as soon as we got back into San Antonio we see people walking all by themselves down the street wearing a mask. The people who enjoy being out in nature are normal people. The basement dwelling, Fauci worshiping Redditors are not leaving their homes doing any sort of physical activity. So if you wanna feel normal for a while, get away from the city and spend time around normal people!</p></p>

        <p>I have to agree. Any other state park recommendations in Texas? I want to do a road trip back to normal soon and was thinking about Utah or Arizona but I’ve never really been to Texas. I was under the impression the landscape was just kind of flat, hot and boring lol (no offense, like I said haven’t really been there and I like going to new places.)</p>
