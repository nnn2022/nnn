    <strong>Hear me out.</strong>
    <p><p>My thought is, </p>
<p>It’s Bio warfare that spread like wildfire because China was actually committing a mass genocide and it got out all over social media </p>
<p>The disease was then spread across the world as a cover up </p>
<p>Public places/ governments must protect their people because their loved ones are affected...so they rushed to “fix” it all </p>
<p>The governments have rules and guidelines to uphold and it gets super tricky when public school is in session because children are required to be accounted for and if they don’t show up it’s a liability which creates more issues</p>
<p>So they say let’s mandate masks, those who want to abide will attend school and those who don’t will homeschool-problem solved </p>
<p>We are not forced to go anywhere, literally no where else than school without exemption...every single resource we need is available at fingertips including dr visits...medication can be prescribed and delivered, you can give a hair sample/ blood sample/ urine sample/ saliva sample and fecal sample from home and it can be sent off...if you do have to go to the hospital, there’s a separate section for covid and you still get treatment </p>
<p>It’s all a big facade, and they are covering something up </p>
<p>The “vaccine” isn’t working because there are more variations being developed as we speak as a form of retaliation from those who are pissed off at the whistleblowers and someone*** hasn’t got what they are really after...it’s a major threat on the world and the governments are aware </p>
<p>With that said, I’m not saying covid isn’t real, IT is real, and someone has the cure, just as they had the means for creation, but until their agenda is complete, this shiz gon go on and on like donkey Kong </p>
<p>I’m not anti-vax...I’m hesitant as is 50% of the population. If they don’t keep this scare tactic going, they know that the credibility of all the doctors and scientists involved in this will be on the line. So, here we are.</p></p>

        <p>As more countries have to admit from lawsuits that they can't prove the existence of "Covid 19", I'm really wondering if it exists at all. </p>
<p>The tests can't tell 'Covid' from the flu! Less that 5% of the deaths are 'from Covid', not just 'with', &amp; the new symptoms are the same as a cold... I'm doubting the whole thing now.</p>
