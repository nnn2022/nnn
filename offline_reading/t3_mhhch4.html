    <strong>Another case of Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) as a result of the AstraZeneca jab.</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday:  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/30/mans-skin-peeled-off-in-reaction-to-johnson-johnson-covid-vax/">Man's skin 'peeled off' in reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID shot (nypost.com)</a> </p>
<p>Today:  <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/2612641/mum-agony-burning-rash-severe-reaction-covid-vaccine/">Mum left in agony with a burning rash due to 'severe reaction to Covid vaccine two weeks after jab' (the-sun.com)</a>   </p>
<p>&rt;Leigh King had her first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on March 12 but is still dealing with the pain of a rash. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The 41-year-old said her body broke out in a burning rash shortly after the jab, and it's now spread across her face, chest and back of the arms.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The rash is so painful it has left Leigh struggling to look after her 13-year-old son Aidan, for whom she is an unpaid carer.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Leigh, from Wishaw in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, said: “My skin was so sore and constantly hot. I have never felt pain like this it has been a horrible experience.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I am a very healthy person and am not on any medication or anything like that. I am not even in a vulnerable category.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I only got the vaccine as I am an unpaid carer for my son who has autism and mobility issues.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I haven’t even been able to care for him since I got the vaccine as I am in such pain.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“It was a horrible feeling,” she said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Never in my life was I prepared for what I was about to experience.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“To say it’s been the worst time of my life is an absolute understatement.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; ...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She claimed: “I went to Wishaw A&amp;E but was turned away.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I went back twice more and the last time I was in such pain I could barely walk out the hospital.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Currently waiting to see a skin specialist, Leigh said the reaction to the vaccine has seriously impaired her ability to look after Aidan.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She said: “Aidan has also found this whole thing difficult.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“He is scared to come near me because of how my skin looks and he struggles to understand what is going on.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“At home is his happy place and I am his best pal, I got this vaccine to care for Aidan but I haven’t even been able to do that.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“This has just been such a tough situation, and has been so physically and mentally draining for the whole family.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“He is seeing a specialist in Glasgow soon and I won’t be able to be there for him. I can’t be there when he needs me most.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She said: “I feel so let down on every level. I’m now waiting to see a skin specialist as it’s been such an extreme reaction and also need an eye test as my eyes are so dry.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I wish there was more support for people if this happens to them.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;An NHS spokesperson said: “We are unable to discuss individual patient care and would ask the patient to contact us directly to discuss their concerns.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A general statement from the NHS says: “The vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Any coronavirus vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Other vaccines are being developed. They will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“So far, millions of people have been given a Covid-19 vaccine and reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare. No long-term complications have been reported.”</p></p>

        <p>No-one asked you if it were newsworthy or not. The fact SJS was not a known side-effect of the drug is the whole point of the post. The rarity of the disease was never in question.</p>

        <p>Except SJS is, as I already mentioned, a potential side effect of every infection and medication in existence. Advil can cause it. Covid can cause it. Therefore, not noteworthy at all to have a case with the Covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>Dumbass, I take Lamictal. That is why I know so much about SJS. The risk of SJS with Lamictal, a known risk factor, is about 0.01% when tirated correctly. It is infinitely smaller for drugs that aren’t known risk factors. Including the AZ vaccine. If the AZ vaccine truly caused SJS, there would be hundreds—if not thousands—of cases by now.</p>
<p>Point is, SJS is an immune system reaction that can be caused by ANY medication, infection, and even some cancers. Covid itself is more likely to cause SJS because it can cause skin issues. Ibuprofen has caused SJS in at least one person (source below). But there is no warning on an Ibuprofen bottle about SJS because it’s just so rare. Same with the vaccine. It’s bound to happen to at least one person, but it’s not really a risk of the vaccine. It’s similar to an allergic reaction; some people can’t tolerate totally random medication. But unless a verifiable percentage of people are having the same reaction, it’s not actually a risk factor of the drug itself. Just a totally random, shit luck situation.</p>
<p>The first sentence of this case study is: “Despite the fact that any drug can be an impending cause of hypersensitivity reactions...”. That sentence makes your entire point moot. </p>

        <p>I used to take it, that's why I know about SJS. The reason that you know about SJS is because your neurologist TOLD you that it was going to be a risk, which is why they told you to keep checking your skin thoroughly when you first took it, and when you increased your dosage.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen was formulated in the early 1960s and has had one known SJS case in its \~60 year history. I don't take ibuprofen because it's been linked to SJS before. Lamictal is from 1991 and has caused far more SJS cases than ibuprofen which is evidence that it (L) is far more dangerous and warrants the safety warning. </p>
<p>If AZ et al wanted to really prioritise health and reduce scepticism, they would have long-since updated their safety warnings to reflect the chance that it might happen. Until AZ comes clean, people will always associate SJS with their jab.</p>

        <p>It’s literally one person. The other patient had the J&amp;J vaccine, not AZ. Unless you can prove that thousands more people have contracted SJS from the AZ jab, it’s not a risk factor. You said it yourself; Lamictal only has the safety warning because a statistically significant number of people contracted SJS while taking it. Just like my Ibuprofen example, one person is not statistically significant.</p>

        <p>You can even do the math yourself. You have 2 people across two different vaccines that contracted SJS. 298 MILLION people have been fully vaccinated. Unless you can provide thousands more examples of SJS after a Covid vaccine, you are significantly more likely to get eaten by a shark or die in a plane crash.</p>
