    <strong>The game of hipocrisy</strong>
    <p><p>When it comes to public support for lockdowns, we can´t forget that, for most people, it is very easy to simply say you are scared and the we should lockdown for I don´t know how long (because it shows how virtuous you are) when you can flaunt the rules and live an 80% normal life.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are normally enforced on businesses, not people (there are some dictators out there, but it is the exception, not the rule). If you know how to work the system, lie and behave discreetly, you can do most things you want and gain points as a virtuous worried about the health of grandma. There is no way to police everyone.</p>
<p>Hairdressers work with the door half open or at home, gas stations give booze, the police looks the other way if you gather only a few friends and don´t make too much noise, intellectual professions (lawyer, accountant etc) can be reached by phone and they open the door for you, you can always write a letter inventing a motive for an essential  movement.</p>
<p>Who knows how to work the system finds a way around most restrictions AND you gain points by saying #stay at home.</p>
<p>So, it is one of the easiest way to sound virtuous by behaving in the most hypocritical way,</p>
<p>If you had to really stay at home hard and your door was welded, I doubted we would have so much fearmongering.</p></p>
