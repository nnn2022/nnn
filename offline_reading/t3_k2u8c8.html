        <p>Personally I want someone to start an expedited case to the Supreme Court in the United States and cases in other nations over this lockdown nonsense.</p>
<p>You cannot lockdown people for literal damned months without compensating them somehow so that they can afford food, clothing, shelter, etc.</p>
<p>Even goddamned child murdering/molesting criminals have those things provided to them... why not the regular person in society during a lockdown?</p>

        <p>I'm reading it's mostly only like this in large metropolitan cities along the coasts. I could be wrong, but if you Google "50 most charming small towns in America" and look at a picture of a Main Street in a city with a population of 20,000 you can bet your bottom dollar this is not happening anywhere near this scale. Those people all know each other. They talk at the pub every weekend (which is what they are trying to prevent us from doing). They rely on that small business that's been in town for 100 years and 4 generations and many won't allow a Walmart within 25 miles of their town. And make no mistake a lot of this is economical. It's a plot to destroy small business and destroy jobs, making us more reliant of government checks (which if we're receiving, we're more likely to obey) and more reliant on giants like Amazon because it helps move us to a more digital world.</p>

        <p>I know firsthand about dental problems. You can mitigate some issues by cutting out ALL sugar &amp; alcohol (sorry) and using a soft toothbrush after eating anything. Also rinsing your mouth with a 1/2 cup of lukewarm water solution of baking soda &amp; salt (1/2 teaspoon of each) at night helps a lot (my dentist agrees). The "modern diet" is SH*T and VERY bad for teeth. Sorry if I sound like your mum! It is interesting to note that "school" produces the dumbarses of which you speak. Vulture Capitalist Peter Thiel has said that a Degree is a "dunce cap in disguise". He makes money by betting on people who have not been inculcated into the thinkology of the dumbarse (that schools produce on an industrial scale). So I wouldn't worry too much about school being the "road to heaven". The fact of your post shows that you are not one of the sleepy sheeple and that you can actually think for yourself. The wide and well traveled road is easy, provided you are happy to sacrifice your dignity and free thought. It is very hard, but once you find the way that is right for you, all things will click into place. We come into "this place" to learn, not to have a fictitiously "easy life". If you learn well, you won't be punished by having to come back ;-)</p>

        <p>Hang in there. Are you under 35 and in relatively good health with a clean record? I know this sounds pushy but I promise I'm not a recruiter. A lot of people forget the military is an option if you need food, shelter and free healthcare. Feel free to dm me if you have questions. You may be able to list your mother as a dependent and get her healthcare too.</p>

        <p>I am sorry. I know this probably won’t help but just in case in does I wanted to mention it. Some dentists were talking about all the dental problems they see now after all this happened. A lot of it is probably people waiting because it is harder to go to the dentist. But the article mentioned masks contributing due to dry mouth. It said of course to keep wearing them:/ but to try to breathe through your nose and not your mouth which is what wearing masks makes us more likely to do. Idk if your problem is related to dry mouth but I thought I would share. I wish I could do more.</p>
