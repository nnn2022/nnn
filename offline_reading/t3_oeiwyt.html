    <strong>I feel personally responsible for the pandemic. I prayed for a BOOMER REMOVER in 2019 and all of a sudden the DEADLIEST virus in human history hit!! I AM DEEPLY SORRY.</strong>
    <p><p>Read the title, chuds: I AM SORRY. Alright!?! Can we move on!? Jeez... any fucking way, if I can tell my story now without being JUDGED thank you very fucking much, around 2019 I started praying on a daily basis that some sort of "Boomer remover" would come along to eradicate all the fuckin' boomers that have brought about Brexit, Trump and the current fucking state of affairs we find ourselves in, but I never intended for this to happen! IT WAS A PRANK, BRO! A FUCKING JOKE! GOD, GOD!</p>
<p>It wasn't bat-soup or a lab leak that plunged this most heinous of viruses onto mankind but ME. ME!!! I hated the older generation for their fucking stupidity and all of a fucking sudden Covid ravaged the World! I DIDN'T FUCKING REALIZE MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE BOOMERS WHEN I MADE MY WISH! Who's going to pay for my weed if they die!? I TAKE IT BACK, ALRIGHT!? I can't find a place of my own because my degree in Gender Studies is fucking useless and I'm still paying off the student loans! Talk about a Monkey Paw!!</p>
<p>Even though I hoped this would happen and I literally hate with a burning fiery passion anyone older than the age of 40 I am fucking furious at you utter chudwads for not wearing fucking masks and having the absolute AUDACITY to complain about the current situation! WE ARE IN A PAN-DEM-IC! The fucking cheek! Do us all a fucking favour, yeah? AND LISTEN TO JAMES CORDEN: GET THE HECKIN' JAB! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7TarriXFME">He fucking knows what's up!!</a></p></p>

        <p>I wished for people to be healthier, and everybody started getting these PCR tests and getting a PCR test makes a person healthier, and everybody started wearing masks, which science knows that wearing a mask is a fundamental requirement of the human body to be healthy since 500 million years of evolution made us to be like that, and then people started getting synthetic mRNA injected into them and science has shown that 500 million years of evolution has lead our species to require injections of synthetic mRNA to be able to be healthy, so my wish was granted TOO!</p>
