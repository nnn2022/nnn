    <strong>Had a disagreement with my friends about masks.</strong>
    <p><p>We hung out a month ago. They’re all for wearing masks.  I’m not- I wear one for 8-12 hrs in a warm environment for work. This made me appreciate being without a mask, especially outside and the fresh air. Building immunity without masks is still better (going off-guard). Anyways, they explained their side and I explained mine. In the end, to make them comfortable, I put on a mask, but still kept pulling it down cuz it was warm and it’s not natural to be in masks all the time. Really wish it would turn out okay.</p></p>

        <p>Bad times really show which of your friends are real and which aren't. I will never put substantial trust in anyone who has gone along with the covid hysteria, or BLM, or any of the other blatant stupidity and insanity. They simply can't be depended on.</p>

        <p>Same, I can’t take people who are brainwashed into parroting whatever one-sided story the media is constantly throwing at us.  It’s entertaining to refute their claims with solid evidence and they just stop responding because they can’t find anything to substantiate their arguments.  </p>
<p>I wish I could meet the cool people on this forum in real life honestly since it feels a bit alienating when everyone else believes all the bs.  I did meet some people yesterday though who actually weren’t afraid to shake hands and one even pulled down his mask to take a sip of his drink.  It made me feel better knowing that there were sane people out there.</p>

        <p>You can’t fucking bow to what goes against your conscience dude. Putting that shit on said </p>
<p>“I don’t really believe in what I was just saying”. </p>
<p>You lack integrity in their eyes. Either stand by your convictions or shut the fuck up snd wear your muzzle. </p>
<p>Hate to be a dick, but this caving in is punk bitch behavior. No more.</p>

        <p>This is how you control the masses - through their friends. And this is also why people need to learn network science so they can understand how their beliefs are formed in the first place - through what your friends think.</p>
<p>What you’re encountering is called ‘double counting’. How many of your friends saw their current opinion on social media? Then when they share the opinion, and it’s all the same/matches, we humans become overconfident. We are FAR less rational than we’d like to believe.</p>
<p>I don’t blame you for backing down, but I don’t think you had the scientific ammunition. The true evidence for masks are VERY low. When your friends formed their opinion - it was baseless. The ONLY RCT study (gold standard of studies) for masks during Covid-19 came out last month (after being suppressed by 3 medical journals). People that wore masks got covid 1.8% of the time. People that didn’t wear masks got covid 2.1% of the time. They are negligible. It was weird, suddenly in June the worldwide science on masks turned. I believe this was a PSYOP. Social distancing is the main thing for preventing virus spread - it’s like 80% of the equation.</p>
<p>The best point you can make is that covid is not deadly enough to warrant these restrictions. Stay home if you’re sick. Asymptomatic spread is very rare and very exaggerated. Your friends are - in a sense - brainwashed by social media and molded by their friends opinions. I say this as an expert in information warfare and human social networks.</p>
<p>Please, pm me if you need anything else. You can be free.</p>

        <p>I stopped hanging out with a friend because he was so insistent on us wearing masks.  It honestly was just us going, “what?” To each other consistently since we could hardly hear what the other was saying.  Either I’ll wait for him to lose his paranoia or vaccines start rolling out (which I refuse to take and he believes won’t help the situation at all).</p>

        <p>I'm hanging in there with friends who love masks but don't overtly or covertly shame me for what I think and I make every effort not to do that to them. I've let go of others. There came a point where neither party felt safe in the relationship, all drama aside.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I lost both of the people I was closest to, besides my parents. It's heartbreaking. I kept my self and sanity, though. Trying to make everyone happy about what you do in the world will drive you crazy these days and there does come a point when trying does result in self-betrayal. Basically, you traumatize yourself by trying to conform.</p>
