    <strong>Unpopular opinion about the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>First of all thank God for this sub it helped me a lot, I don't believe in this covid bs (if it exists is mild like the common cold or flu) and all the psychos from world governments are using this to impose control on the population and they should be hanged for damaging economy and messing with people's mental sanity through lame propaganda and lockdown. Here is the controversial part: I took the AZ vaccine because I was hoping to be <strong>sterilized</strong>, I have 2 kids and it's enough. I was planning to get a vasectomy last year but here it's expensive like almost 1000 euros. That's it, I hope you will not hate me for saying that.</p></p>
