    <strong>Does anyone actually consider Australia has 'gone back to normal'?</strong>
    <p><p>So let me get this right. </p>
<p>- States and cities lockdown if 1 or 2 cases pop back up. You're on house arrest if a stranger somewhere has the sniffles.</p>
<p>- People have been fined and arrested for "misinformation" online. Aka something you said the government doesn't like so the cops come knocking at your door. </p>
<p>- You need to download a government app and log in when you go to certain public places</p>
<p>- You can't leave your country for possibly for 2 years due to travel bans</p>
<p>In what way is any of this normal or standard in 2019? I'd rather accept covid just spread than any of this become normalized. </p>
<p>When did communist China become a model country for western nations? How are Australians letting this happen to them and their beautiful country?</p>
<p>Any Aussies wanna weigh in?</p></p>
