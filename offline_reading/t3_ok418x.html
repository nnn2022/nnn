    <strong>Yet another fascist cover-up</strong>
    <p><p>Big capital, represented by its mouthpiece, the director of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, has long declared that "Cyber-Covid" (the communications and IT equivalent of the current "pandemic") is imminent. The other day they held a so-called "Cyber-Polygon", a kind of field exercise in case of a worldwide cyber-attack, assigning its main topic to an attack on production chains.</p>
<p>"The 2021 technical exercise practises and tests the skills needed to protect our industry, with a targeted attack on the supply chain as its focus" (source - <a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon">https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon</a>).</p>
<p>During an economic crisis, which is always caused by relative overproduction of goods, the most important task of capital is to DESTROY the surpluses which clutter up warehouses and generate no income, only costs (see K. Ostrovitianov, "Political Economy", chapter "Economic Crises").</p>
<p>Also, the standard "cure" that capitalists use in an attempt to overcome a sales crisis is reducing production. They close factories and plants, dismiss workers (or, like now, place them under unpaid house arrest, calling it "quarantine"). Because of this, trade links and supply chains become disrupted.</p>
<p>In order to cover up the destruction of millions of tonnes of goods (including FOOD), the disruption of production chains, the further intensification of economic exploitation, the shortage of essential goods, the reduction of social costs etc. capitalists invent another "pandemic" - now in the field of communications. It solves all the same problems as "swine flu", "bird flu", "foot and mouth disease", "covid", etc.</p>
<p>Capital has long been using so-called "cyber-attacks" as a cover for its shady acitivities (again, just like in case of viruses). In 2019-2021, as the global overproduction crisis intensified, especially in energy and heavy industry, capitalist "cyber-attacks" became more frequent. One of the most striking was the "hacker attack" on the largest US pipeline, after which the demand for petroleum products soared, prices rose, fuel transportation standards were relaxed, exploitation of fuel transporters increased, numerous small producers went bankrupt (freeing a niche in the market), etc. (source - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-57017207">https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-57017207</a>). So, "seek who benefits".</p>
<p>For the last few days the Indian bourgeois media has been churning out reports of an impending "major solar flare" that could lead to "disruptions in GPS, mobile communications, internet and satellites". (source - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzdNrZCIyMU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzdNrZCIyMU</a>). Last week an unexpected cyber-attack took place in a German province which "paralysed" everything and so the local authorities were unable to pay benefits and sponsor children and youth programmes for a week (what a shame for capital, isn't it, it was so eager to channel public funds into social welfare) (source - <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/rural-german-district-declares-">https://www.dw.com/en/rural-german-district-declares-</a>...).</p>
<p>Until the working class - the creator of all material goods consumed by society - and other wage-earners wake up and realize that against them stands a CLASS ENEMY  who owns all the media, who can "buy or engage any number of lawyers, writers, even deputies, professors, popes and so on" (Lenin, "Who benefits?") - until then this enemy will CONTINUE FOOLING THEM. Using people's trust in science and their lack of understanding of the fact that under capitalism, science serves the capitalist ruling class and therefore is called *bourgeois*, the Enemy uses it as a cover for its dictatorship and directs first microbiology, and now physics and astrophysics to protect its interests. Soon there will be thousands of "scientific" studies in which bourgeois professors will be nodding along - "Yes, yes, the cause of communication and supply chain disruption is the SUN and no one else." Yes, definitely not the capitalist mode of production and its cyclic crises.</p>
<p>As the global crisis of relative overproduction intensifies and the discontent of the working masses increases, capital is forced to take ever more drastic and radical measures to save its rotten economic structure, its profits. The "cyber-covid" scam will also help to solve another major agenda - the DESTRUCTION of the LINE OF COMMUNICATION between the working masses. War is war.</p></p>
