    <strong>Red Line Mask Movement</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, I have been thinking about this for a while and want to get some feedback.  </p>
<p>To get to the point: There are some of us that do not agree with the mask mandates/lockdowns but are forced to wear masks anyway (whether that be from social or direct pressure).  </p>
<p>I think it might make sense for those of us in this position to start adding an Easily Recognizable Symbol to our masks. I'd like to suggest a Thin Red Line across the mask.  </p>
<p>This way, we can still signal to people around us that we do NOT agree with these policies and are only complying because of force. If enough people start doing this or something similar, it might help other people to see that there are many people around them who feel the same way, and help with some of the dread that a lot of us feel given our position.   </p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p></p>

        <p>All people are different and all situations are different. I agree that people need to stop entertaining this, but different people will be able to do that at different times. Some people are in workplaces where they'd be fired if they even attempted this, and due to having no money from the lockdowns, they don't have much of a choice.</p>
<p>I agree with you bro, I really do, but you have to understand that not everyone is in the same position as you, and will be forced to wear masks for quite a lot longer. They literally have no other option. I'm trying to talk about ways to help those people, who exist and again, have no other option through no fault of their own, show their dissent against the authoritarianism. I can't see how that's a bad thing given their unchangeable circumstances. It's not as simple as "everyone stop wearing them", because if it were, we wouldn't be in this mess.</p>

<p>i think it is as simple as that. many millions of  people were dictated out of work and into poverty, whether they would wear a face diaper or not. </p>
<p>this irrational fear is a strange game. the only winning move is to not play</p>

        <p>Yeah and if we all just gave on dollar, starvation would be over.</p>
<p>If we all just stopped smoking cigarettes, there'd be no more tobacco deaths.</p>
<p>This is a very doomer-mindset frame of thinking, what you are advocating for is just as impossible, stupid, and utopic as the "if we all just wore masks.." argument. It's literally just the reverse of that.  </p>
<p>Not a personal attack against you bro, strictly the idea / frame of thinking.</p>

<p>did we not live our entire lives through many 'outbreaks' and 'pandemics' of various flus, etc. without anyone wearing masks by DICTATE?</p>
<p>why now? what is so special or deadly about this common cold virus? </p>
<p>the way it is marketed, or propagandized, that is what is different.</p>
<p>locking down entire populations of healthy people by dictate was unprecedented and yet look at how easily it is being done.</p>
<p>if this corona was even remotely close to being as contagious and deadly as claimed, would we need to be ordered by DICTATE to wear masks? would we need to be told to stay home? would you risk going to any job, essential or not, even with a non medical grade mask?</p>
<p>moving buses are dangerous and deadly, do we need to be ordered not to jump in front of them?</p>
<p>self preservation is a natural instinct, is it not?</p>

        <p>Don't take it out on me bro, I already agree with you, you are completely missing the point. I haven't said anything against what you are saying. I am just acknowledging the reality of human nature, every human on earth dropping their masks at the same time is not going to happen.</p>
<p>Do you not see how your argument "well if we all just dropped our masks" is very similar to "well if we all just wore masks"? Neither is an argument you can practically make in society, we are not a hive mind species. I'm really not the person you need to be arguing with, you're wasting your breath on me as someone who already doesn't support lockdowns or mask mandates. </p>
<p>I am simply acknowledging the reality around me, I know of people in the situation like what I described, they have 0 recourse and will be fired if they attempt to de-mask at their job and it's not like there is another job readily available. Your argument is just public-blaming in another form. I'm just trying to find solutions for those people who have no other choice, because I care about them and sympathize with the position they are in. Yelling them down, telling them to just quit their job is not a very empathetic thing to do. You can just say "all people who don't want to risk their livlihoods to de-mask are stupid" but it doesn't help them whatsoever. Go attack some actual anti-lockdown people and stop wasting your breath on people that already basically agree with you.</p>

        <p>I agree that it is wrong that people were forced out of work. You keep making arguments like I don't believe that. You are obviously in a lot of pain bro, but you really need to take your anger out on people who are actually worth it.</p>
<p>The whole point of this was to be a "transitional" step towards demasking for people who can't do it right this second on your arbitrary timeline.</p>
<p>And it's NOT like everyone was all wearing masks all day out of nowhere, there was a gradual buildup to it pretty much everywhere, even in places where they were mandated, so your argument falls flat. I'm advocating for that same thing in the opposite direction. All you're doing is attacking someone who's on the same side of you for not being radical enough. If you think it can happen in one day you are kidding yourself or know nothing about human nature.</p>
<p>Well guess what? Most people aren't radical, most don't try to rock the boat, and while I get the point you're trying to make about that being part of the problem, you're not going to change anyone's mind by arguing they do something against their own self-interest in their personal lives. Not every single person is willing and able to stand up and fight in the same way you are.</p>
<p>All you've done is attack this idea to the point of me just wanting to remove the post entirely, even though I'm against the mandates and lockdowns. I was just trying to find a solution that could help some people who aren't ready or able to just drop the masks this very minute. Those people exist, and ignoring them and the influence they have doesn't help our movement, it stifles it.</p>
<p>Again, save your energy for people who actually disagree with you. I want it to be over as much as you do, but not everyone can turn their whole life into a political statement against the status quo, most people are just trying to survive.  </p>
<p>Beyond that, I already have enough Doomers arguing against me, I come here to talk to people who understand the lockdowns are bad and not constantly have to fight battles over this and that. Just like, chill bro. This is our space, no need to be going after each other here, the doomers are the real problem. Don't let your anger for them bleed into your interactions with your fellow Truthers, we should be supporting each other any way we can which (again) was the original intention of this post.</p>

        <p>&rt; You are obviously in a lot of pain bro, but you really need to take your anger out on people who are actually worth it.</p>
<p>the only 'pain' i am in is the pain of watching people participate in the destruction of their own lives for 'the greater good', whatever they think that is, under unlawful dictates.</p>
<p>i am not taking my anger out on anyone. kindly stop asserting that i am attacking you or anyone else. i am articulating observed behaviors of what i have been witnessing.</p>
<p>&rt; ...arguing they do something against their own self-interest in their personal lives. </p>
<p>the compliance IS against their own long term self interests, just not in their narrow short term self interests. people act according to motivations and incentives. in a nutshell, they act to either avoid pain or achieve pleasure.</p>
<p>I have a friend who works directly for the mic and is aware (through friendship with me) the the State is his mortal enemy. he xp'd firsthand how this same state has destroyed his family and personal life for its own profit, all in the name of 'the best interests of his children'. why does he continue to work for the mic? because 'if it wasn't him on the job, it would be someone else'. this very same rationalization is at play with the masks and all the rest of it. as you point out, 'most people are just trying to survive.'</p>

        <p>Symbols are very important. The only downside I could see is the police thin blue line. If you invoke that symbology mixed with how foam in the mouth pro markers are, your idea might die before it gets off the ground. I suppose I would just think on it a little more. My mask has a hand sewed over my mouth. Seems to be well received and thought provoking. Maybe something along those lines?</p>
