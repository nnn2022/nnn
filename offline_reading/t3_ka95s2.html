    <strong>I am so afraid of masks being normalized</strong>
    <p><p>Not necessarily like mandate, but I've heard people at work saying they will still wear them even after they tell us we don't need to anymore.</p>
<p>And I've been reading about people saying they will wear them forever, because apparently since they've worn them they say they don't get sick anymore.</p>
<p>It is really scary to me how people have become so in love with something they never gave <em>any</em> thought to before now. And they love how Asians are so smart and wear them all the time in public.</p>
<p>I am so frigging sick of seeing and wearing the stupid things. I NEVER want to see a freaking mask outside of a medical setting or while painting or sawing or something EVER again.</p>
<p>We will never be able to show our face in public again without people complaining. Why should I bother trying to grow a nice beard, the mask constantly rubs it and messes it up and dries it out, and I can't show it anyway. What's the point in lip gloss and makeup if only your closest friends and family ever see your face. Heck, what's the point in getting dental work or braces? Might as well save your money, masks are way cheaper! Don't bother shaving anymore as nobody will ever know.</p>
<p>And of course this is like some time of history where we read where ignorance gave way to enlightenment and 2020 was the day the world learned we never show our face in public again out of politeness and preventing the spread of disease.</p>
<p>I mean they literally are never going away now! Every flu season years from now every other person will be wearing a mask whether they are sick or not. I can see it now. And it will be in the media and the health and science articles about how great they are, even though for hundreds of years we never heard anything about them.</p>
<p>There are masks with built in headphones, Underarmour and Nike make masks, I think even Samsung is selling some kind of air filter mask. Why pay all that money and put development into them if they're just some temporary necessity?? Clearly they are the wave of the future.</p>
<p>I wish it was like 1919 or 1920 and we could just take the damned things off and forget it ever happened, but ohhhh nooo we are too smart for that in 2021 or 2022 or 2023 or whenever this might end.</p>
<p>I'm sorry the face wasn't meant to be concealed by a mask. This is going too far. People that have insecurities and want to wear the mask to hide themselves because of that need psychological help, it's not about health it's because they are having self esteem issues and trying to hide behind a mask isn't going to solve it.</p>
<p>Also STOP comparing this to seatbelts. I am in my car an hour most days at most. I'm out in public far longer than that. Wearing a seatbelt isn't something I do all day.</p></p>

        <p>Masks are used to not sneeze into the patient who is gutted like a fish or saliva. The other reason is to not get any blood that may spray on your face wouldnt get into your mouth etc. Its not meant to filter out any airborn pathogens. Search dr. Lee Merrit on bitchure. Or go to www.thelastamericanvagabond.com for real information about current plandemic and other stuff. There are many other places but thats the beginning.</p>

        <p>So a diseased patient or deceased, diseased patient who somehow splatters a liquid (drops and droplets) that contain a virus cannot pass through. How is that different from saliva ejected from your mouth when talking. </p>
<p>If only one virus made you sick masks would be pretty ineffective (my opinion.), however we know there has to be a great enough concentration for you to get sick right? So how does protecting one’s mouth from emitting and receiving droplets not work in defense from the virus?</p>

        <p>They love to say it “doesn’t hurt to try” but it obviously does.  Masks are culturally toxic and have done real damage to us as an already divided society.  The fanatic fixation on this placebo has blinded us from literally everything else.</p>

        <p>Some people will never stop wearing them because they like it for whatever reason but they won’t be mandated forever and most people will stop wearing them as soon as they get the chance.</p>
<p>People in general don’t like masks but go along to get along, only lame ass Reddit weirdos and people who are scared for whatever reason (sometimes valid, such as being old sick etc) actually want to wear them. That is not the majority of people and as soon as the vaccines are out or cases are down, which ever comes first, those masks are either going in the trash or the back of the closet to hopefully never be seen again for the vast majority.</p>

        <p>He’s not right. The masks, lockdowns, virus fear mongering, social shaming, etc is not going to end. Everyone needs to realize that now. The ONLY way it could end is if a majority of people decide they will not put up with it anymore. We know by now that our population is far too interested in being virtue signaling obedient morons to ever resist it. It’s never going to end.</p>

        <p>There will be no going back. The companies will keep their own mandates to shop in their stores because the media will shame them for lifting restrictions. Large dem cities will continue their policy of masking. I don't even think large gatherings will come back.</p>
<p>Serious question... we have the vaccine now. When will everything go back? How many people need the jab? Think about it... if the University of Florida announced today they will allow full stadiums for basketball and football games, what would happen? What if they announced it in a month? Six months? A year? No matter when they do it, a subsection of the loud minority will scream that people will be killed as a result. Unfortunately, they are the ones who dominate what happens in society anymore.</p>

        <p>I commented on another post that masks will become a far Left "uniform" accessory long after COVID is a threat.  At least I'll be able to know which people to avoid.</p>
<p>Once the case numbers go way down, governments will have no viable reason to mandate masks nor the desire to pay for expensive PPE.  I agree that certain Far Left-leaning companies will keep up mask mandates just to virtue signal (Starbucks, etc), but I'll never frequent one of those places again.  I believe even moderate and center-Left Dems will throw the masks in the trash as soon as they're not mandated.  </p>
<p>Yes, there will definitely still be people screaming when stadiums start allowing events again.  But you know what? There will be no reason not to allow those.  Businesses need to make money, and they will open as soon as they're permitted.   The people whining can just vow to never attend a concert, festival, or sporting event again.  And honestly, I like that idea.  When I go out, I'll be guaranteed not to be bothered by Leftists.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I did an IG survey on masks, and like 60% said they’re done with masks the second it’s allowed. Good that was the majority.  Even some of 40% said probably only at certain times (like if they’re sick, public transport), so I’d like to think the majority are going to ditch masks and it’s a vocal minority. </p>
<p>I have noticed that most who love the masks seem to have some fairly intense body image issues already so I think for them they can hide themselves better. It’s sad bc it’ll make their issues worse, but those clinging to masks generally aren’t for health reasons.</p>

        <p>I think so too. I don't mind a mask because well I'm an extreme introvert and like being not so easily recognizable or notice. With glasses and a hat no one ever bothers me and I never feel awkwardly obliged to make small talk. it's great.</p>

        <p>I’m sure in real life, if I had the misfortune of meeting you, you’d cower in a corner and not say a word. This is why this dystopia is so fun for low-level, insecure losers. </p>
<p>People with such clear mental issues and unhealthy hatred of people should rightly be derided, and should never ever be in a position to make decisions, as your crazy response shows (lol, Guiliani, what? Stay on topic, moron. Who the f said you’re dirty? You just threw that insult at yourself). I think there’s something incredibly disturbing about someone so afraid to speak in public, to be seen, that they’d happily cover up half their face... but I guess some people are naturally-born slaves. </p>

        <p>Lol maybe I don't want to interact with douchebags like you. It makes me fuckin cringe how corny some people are. Everybody is an armchair psychologist and everyone knows more than anyone else. You don't know what this life is for. I have my own reasons and things I need to get done. I can tell you're just a little corny ass bitch on reddit.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a psychologist to understand you. Anyone this immediately angry has issues. </p>

        <p>I agree! People on both sides of the whole covid thing can be too invested in attacking others rather than trying to explain our point of view. Masks were a fashion accessory in some places before this so I can understand if it's to some people's taste! I'm glad you see it's not to everyone's liking too!</p>

        <p>I upvoted you because I’m all about freedom. I’m sure a lot of people feel the same as you and I can even <em>sort of</em> understand the appeal of being anonymous or people who see it as a fashion accessory, even though I’m not about it myself. I will not care at all if masks never completely go away as long as it’s optional and no one is being shamed for it either way. I just have no interest in telling other people what they should or shouldn’t wear, and neither should the government.</p>

<p>This is utter bullshit and I hate when these doomers say this. Masks literally make you sick! It's poisonous to breath in your germs and will make you sick. I got a horrible sore throat from wearing a mask and after, refuse to put another muzzle on my face. On top of thst, they lower your oxygen intake and are extremely dangerous. God didn't make us to wear masks, that's why he gave us an immune system that's worked for millions of years. Suddenly a piece of cloth is supposed to be better built?

        <p>Exactly. If anything you <em>want</em> to be exposed to as many things as possible when you're young so that you're immune when you're old and vulnerable. A study of people exposed to the sars-cov-1 showed they were all immune to sars-cov-2... 17 years later. I imagine that anyone in their 60s at the time would be thankful for that, being in their 80s now.</p>

        <p>Honestly waiting room masks in the ER or PCP are about the only place I'd really be in favor of staying forever. There's been times when I've waited for a physical injury or someone else and there are some patient 0 looking people who probably should be wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I see why you're worried this is where it's going - it's tempting to extrapolate from the present moment.</p>
<p>But if you can open your mind, let me share with you a little hint and reason for optimism: the further we go into the future, the less anything makes sense (relative to the past), the less you can reliably predict what will happen next.</p>
<p>The masks, the quarantines, the vaccine, the election - none of this is linear, none of it is going to go off without a hitch.</p>
<p>If you can, try to withdraw into yourself when you feel concerned, when it seems like everything is set in stone (and in a bad way, at that). It's not.</p>
<p>I never thought I'd see so much resistance to The Program here on reddit, but the very existence of, the liveliness of this sub has opened my eyes. And we're not alone, though the existing platforms try to separate us. There are a lot of people that aren't going along with this now. And that's just the masks/vaccine issue - to say nothing of other things 'they' have in store.</p>
<p>Remember, our 'enemies' (wrong word, but shorthand for: the fraidy-cats who want to clamp down on all of life to feel safe) are even more terrified than we are. We're annoyed, we're pissed, whatever, but these people are truly living in a nightmare world right now. Let's show them by example that the world doesn't have to be some terrible thing. Some will hate and fear us for a long time, but eventually they will get bored and tired and say, "Fuck it, why can't I be out in the sun with them? Having a good time?"</p>
<p>Tomorrow is not decided. Even 5 minutes from right now is wide open, if you allow for it. Surprise yourself, surprise everybody. There's a lot of foolishness going on all around us, but hasn't that always been the case in the world? LIFE always wins in the end. Everything going on right now is like a gymnasium of creativity - use it, grow from it, find ways to lead the fearful ones out of their little caves.</p>

        <p>I could not agree more with this. The idea that people will need to walk around wearing a face diaper forever makes me simultaneously nauseous and terrified. And the worst part is that people are already saying they’re going to voluntarily keep wearing masks just because it makes them feel better to not show half their face to others. Is that not maybe a sign of some mental instabilities and/or problems? I don’t know about you guys, but I feel extremely rude and uncomfortable wearing one and I don’t get how people are not just comfortable with it, but adoring of it. Sorry for the long comment, I just have lots of feelings about this 😂😩</p>

        <p>The idea of accurate facial recognition of a face while someone is wearing a mask is absolutely wild! At that point it's essentially just eye recognition and it's crazy that there is that much distinction between each and every person's eyes on the planet.</p>

        <p>You can just not wear a mask you know. Just, like that. Just don't wear it. Take it off, throw it away. Ignore people who come at you, or fight back if they accost you, but just don't wear it. Shop at different stores if you can. I haven't worn a mask in like, 5 months, aside from hanging it around my neck at work because they bitch if you don't have one on your person.</p>

        <p>I live in the Boston area and commute downtown every day on the train. Masks are mandated everywhere outside of your own house/car in Massachusetts. I have never worn a mask outside and I walk by a dozen cops every day. No one has ever said anything about it. Not a single fine has been issued anywhere in the state. Cops don't give a fuck. </p>
<p>I don't know where you are but in America the mask laws are not enforceable outside of actual businesses.</p>

        <p>It's technically illegal where I am as well by governor decree. The cops in town said its blatantly unconstitutional so they aren't going to fine people for not wearing one, yet 98% of people wear them everywhere, including outside :/ only place I shop now is farmer's market because I'm sick of getting harassed whenever I go to the grocery for milk or cheese.</p>

        <p>I only wear masks or face shields bc it’s the law. If it wasn’t I would immediately stop wearing them. I don’t care about social norms much as I was one of the few people not wearing them right before my cities mandate. But I get what you’re saying. Seeing faces should be a normal, healthy part of life. I just don’t have any hope that these masks are going away anytime soon. I would like to move to somewhere less urban though where me and my family can be outdoors more and away from the city where I think people are more fanatical about mask wearing.</p>

        <p>I can see how those came into play in history now. The dehumanizing feeling when living your life behind the veil can morph you into a submissive character. Submit to fellow man, submit to God Himself. Feels like your only hope is to give yourself over to something higher and just give up your own will. Yet for most people today the submissive signalling to higher power is just empty social media virtue. What a sad fruitless loop. No God, no job, no social life just your status with The State.</p>

        <p>One of the many things that blows my mind about the masks is all the beautiful young women going along with it. The women who spend hours and hours working on their makeup, etc., just so they can . . . cover it up with a face mask??? I just don't get it. And I just don't get how young people are supposed to meet, flirt, and hook up with each other if they're all a bunch of faceless NPC's. I mean, is everyone just gonna use Tinder now? Really? Like, the survival of the human species kinda depends on people seeing each other's faces so they can date, mate, and procreate. This mask hysteria is gonna create a generation full of incels if people don't knock it off...</p>

My philosophy was taught by the wizard of oz. pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Relating to food service. Just enjoy the magic and wonder.

        <p>I don't really care that much about the masks. Yes, they're annoying... but they're not the end of the world.</p>
<p>I DO care a lot about the lack of freedom of monent, though : curfews, random closures of all kinds of businesses, "bubbles", etc. And then there's the collapse of the economy.</p>
<p>What I'm mostly afraid of, is that there will be little left of a normal economy OR normal social life a few months from now... and that life as we knew it will NEVER return.</p>
<p>Yes, masks are annoying. But let's focus on the far more pressing issues that are our freedom of movement and our collapsing economy!</p>

        <p>Oh masks are definitely going to be staying for good, some people are loving the current situation. It makes them feel important, validates their preexisting habits of staying at home doing nothing and gives them an excuse/praise for continuing to stay at home and do nothing.</p>

        <p>The Democrats use of the “Trump hijacked the CDC/FDA” rhetoric as a political argument during the election, even if they had decent intentions, has led to

        <p>Ugh I'm so tired of the virtue signalling, it's made the 'woke' crowd even worse. I'm also annoyed since I put up with braces for two years and I just got them out yesterday, but was there a point? I rarely wear a mask but if it keeps up and becomes normal I swear I'm running away to a cave.</p>

        <p>While true it’s WHEN, they are sick. Not just because there is an assumption they are sick. I lived in Japan for a bit and it’s still a small percentage that do. Again when they are ACTUALLY sick, not perpetually assumed to be without any justification.</p>

        <p>It’s basic etiquette to take off your hat and sunglasses when you go inside, and take off or at least push down your sunglasses when talking to someone outside. There’s a reason for that. Faces are important.</p>

        <p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But it's also good manners to let other people wear what they want. If you don't like people telling you to wear a mask, it seems to me that you would not want to tell other people that they shouldn't wear one.</p>
<p>It's not like wearing a hat inside, which everybody seems to have given up on criticizing anyway.</p>

        <p>Idk what you are implying, as if your colleagues and friends are the correct sources of information?? Unless your a scientist in epidemiology, virology, or immunology. </p>
<p>Also prior to 2020, we have been using masks in aseptic areas such as operating rooms or cleanrooms and the DATA (probably an unfamiliar term for you fucks) consistently shows a reduction in bioburden. But I reckon you have already figured that out, anecdotally, with your big clever brain. </p>
<p>The correct types of masks do work when used correctly. Proper donning/doffing procedures, over the nose, and minimal manipulations.</p>

        <p>Your analogies have no comparison to their point as they’re entirely different situations. </p>
<p>Its funny how the total summation of his point was:</p>
<p>&rt;wear a thin paper mask</p>
<p>And you reply with</p>
<p>&rt;neither want the world to shut down for them</p>
<p>If you think wearing masks is comparable to shutting everything down / locking down, I can only laugh. </p>
<p>Interesting though that you were nearly killed in an auto accident. I’m guessing you’re not advocating for the law to stop restricting the freedom of people to make the choice to go out and drive while drunk, or speed? I mean its their choice to do something that can demonstrably lead to another persons death, so why should we stop them from it? </p>
<p>I mean you make it seem like such a big deal that your liberty of choosing not to wear a mask, something that mitigates the deaths of other human beings, is at stake. </p>
<p>Covid 19 has only caused a 9/11 worth of deaths each day for the past 8 days now after we’re reporting the most deaths per day (with literally dec 9th today being our record high after 290k total) since the start of the pandemic. Lets not even mention the long term effects and health complications that people are susceptible to if they catch the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t want people off the road</p>
<p>Yeah but I am pretty damn sure you want them to be safe while on it. The combined deaths from speeding and drunk driving pale in comparison to covid deaths but I don’t see you complaining about your freedoms being restricted there? </p>
<p>And I’ll make that same case, I don’t want people off the streets, but I for damn sure want them to be safe as possible while they’re on it. </p>
<p>&rt;Screw off</p>
<p>Why do you have to come off as such an ass to someone with a well intentioned comment thats at least trying to engage with people that they know don’t share the same view? Is it your goal to just be angry online when people don’t agree with you?</p>

<p>Also, ironically, while I was hit by a sober driver, a friend I have who has driven after drinking and has never hit anything. So, I'm safer with a "drunk" driver than a professionally trained one. I don't drink, but that sure as hell is baffling.</p>

        <p>I think you have sadly missed just about every point I made but since you took the time to actually give me a response instead of telling me to fuck off I'll try and better help you understand my point. Sorry for making this long, but you really did drop the ball here.</p>
<p>\&rt;The bus driver who hit me was sober, so alcohol played no role in it. Want to try again?</p>
<p>Sure, can you go ahead and point to me where I implied that you were hit by a driver who was drunk or speeding? You may realize that its not relevant if you did or didn't.</p>
<p>My point of bringing those two points up is that they're *preventable* (keep that word in mind) and leading causes of automobile accidents / deaths from automobiles (I forgot to include texting while driving). Whether or not you got hit by a drunk driver was not my point, it was to bring up an analogous point and something relatable to automobile accidents (which is something directly relevant to you) and preventable deaths. If you want me to further elaborate on how mandating drunk driving, speeding, TWD, and wearing masks are analogous I'll be more than willing to expand even further but I think you can grasp the point here.</p>
<p>\&rt; I wear a mask for around 12 hours a day. You fail. </p>
<p>Fantastic, seriously. Quite odd though that you consider mandating wearing a thin paper mask comparable to making the "world stop" or having the "planet shut down" because the line you directly quoted from the user was "Why cant you suck it up and wear a thin paper mask" then proceeded to tell the user to screw off. Quite awkward, but I guess if you don't want to try and tell me the words you write don't actually have meaning can you help me understand how I was supposed to draw any other conclusion? The guy didn't even mention shutting down businesses or locking down, just simply wearing a mask. Quick tidbit but adding "you fail" only makes you look like a prick.</p>
<p>\&rt;I'm out of a car and off the road, so I have no freedoms on the road to begin with. You are really, really not helping yourself here.</p>
<p>How am I "really, really" not helping myself here lol? You again entirely missed the point; the qualifier to my statement was you desiring people to be safe on the road (ie. not drunk driving), not you needing to own a car and drive it. To add to that, you do still have freedoms on the road unless you somehow got your license revoked or you are physically incapable of driving; you don't lose those because you lost your car in an accident. I don't care whether you can or can't currently drive, I care about if you're a sane human being who thinks that we should mandate things that cause *preventable deaths on the road* (and if you can guess by extension, a mass pandemic).</p>
<p>\&rt;Also, auto accidents kill over a million people in the US alone every year. But sure, COVID-19 is the deadliest thing ever. Sure. </p>
<p>Not only are you an asshole for no reason, you just proceed to make shit up about a bunch of things you don't know. Auto accidents kill just over a million people *Worldwide* per year. Want to know the rate in the US? An average of about \~35,000 per year, so you're off by a factor of x1,000. So if you want COVID deaths in terms of US automobile deaths, that's about 8.2 years worth of automobile deaths in just a single year of COVID in the US (you know, the virus that has killed just below 300,000 people __IN  THE US ALONE__). That's more than the amount of US soldiers that died in the World War I, and tomorrow we will surpass the death toll of US soldiers in World War II. You are laughably ignorant of reality here to say the very least. I really don't understand how you can be so inconsiderate of the deaths of 290,000, again only in the US, people to be saying "but sure, COVID-19 is the deadliest thing ever". COVID-19 has killed 1.57 million people as of today World Wide. Do you want me to iterate that figure to you in terms of world wars, or automobile accidents perhaps? I mean, that figure does surpass the 1.3 million that have died of automobile accidents that you mentioned. </p>
<p>\&rt;Also, ironically, while I was hit by a sober driver, a friend I have who has driven after drinking and has never hit anything. So, I'm safer with a "drunk" driver than a professionally trained one. I don't drink, but that sure as hell is baffling. </p>
<p>I'll admit I don't know if I'm entirely correct here but I believe that the majority of drunk drivers don't get in accidents correct (I'm basing this off of the approximate 1.5 million DUI's issued per year in the US compared to the 10,000+ alcohol related motor vehicle deaths per year in the US)? So its not entirely unsurprising that your friend who decides to recklessly endanger the lives of their fellow citizens has had the extreme fortune of not fucking up the lives of both themselves and someone else. To put it plainly your friend is a piece of human garbage for doing what they did, and I hope that you would never honestly mean "So, I'm safer with a 'drunk' driver than a professionally trained one". Ironically, I had a friend (albeit we hadn't talked in quite a while as I had moved away) die to a drunk driver (her passenger thankfully survived) but she wasn't so fortunate. Though I'm glad to hear you aren't a proponent of your friends actions, I'm a little shocked you would have a friend like that. I won't even go further than that, because honestly this comes off as the most shocking thing you decided to add to your whole comment. </p>
<p>\&rt; Pot, meet kettle. </p>
<p>If me calling you out for being an angry asshole online makes me angry or an asshole, I guess I'll be glad to join the club. That being said, don't confuse me really driving my points in as being rude to you. Sincerely I do hope to converse with you in good faith, and from what I can tell you seem to have been reciprocating thus far. I don't have any anger towards the things you've said and I'm certainly not going to tell you to screw off for no reason. I guess I should also add (though you may not care) that I hope you've made a good recovery from your accident and that the financial damage isn't terrible (as I am quite aware that it can be a pain in the ass in the US). I'm interested to know if you better understand what I meant because I only gave my initial reply to honestly understand what you meant by the things you said.</p>
<p>If you wont give a response though have a great day, but please take my unsolicited advice and be a lot more considerate to the deaths from COVID-19 (or just deaths in general I guess?). I knew someone who died from it in August and its not a joking matter. Its made lives suck for quite literally millions of families who have lost loved ones around the world, not to mention the hundreds of millions more who have been affected by it.</p>

        <p>&rt;I knew someone who died from it in August and its not a joking matter.</p>
<p>And I know someone who killed himself, and I plan to do the same prior to my next birthday. No cause of death is a joking matter, and yet only one is being given any notice.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm a little shocked you would have a friend like that.</p>
<p>He's actually pretty awesome. He has a very high tolerance, so I assume that's why he's good behind the wheel after he drinks. Now, I still don't like it, but I've known him for years and that's why he has my trust.</p>
<p>&rt;Fantastic, seriously.</p>
<p>No, it's actually horrible, but my job depends on it. Being out of work certainly won't make this year better.</p>
<p>The auto accident statistic was what I looked up last night when arguing with my boyfriend (our relationship has gotten extremely strained, to say the least; we were going to be engaged; <em>were</em>).</p>
<p>I'm sincerely unsure what point you are attempting to make besides COVID-19 is somehow worse than literally anything else in the world that has ever existed or will ever (despite that tons of "essential workers" haven't dropped dead, and some are working more, not less; uh...?). Anything supposedly that deadly and terrifying should've spared almost no one.</p>
<p>&rt;be a lot more considerate to the deaths from COVID-19 (or just deaths in general I guess?)</p>
<p>Tell you what? When the deaths from the increased crime rate, poverty, domestic violence, suicide, overdose, other illnesses, and whatever else isn't coming to my head right now that has been worsened is given the same consideration, I'll think about it.</p>
<p>It took a shooting at another location of my job for them to reinstall the metal and xray detectors (they were uninstalled to "encourage social distancing"). We had to stay at work when we had <em>real</em> safety hazards (lack of running water, bathrooms shut down, conveyors busted) throughout one morning, but if we seem to have so much as the sniffles (did COVID-19 erase allergies?), they want us to go home. The power of media and panicking.</p>
<p>I told the other user to screw off because I am vehemently against the concept of using your problems to try to control other people. And yes, I've been sick too (hilariously, I've tested negative twice for that virus; go figure). Cold tends to knock me unconscious every year for a few days.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has the attention of everything, so yeah, I'll admit I've come to disregard it. Though, that's more because of the virtual signaling and the constant fearmongering that's getting harder to avoid. I mean, if they just said "please wear a mask" and "wash your hands a little more", and left it at that, and there weren't evidence of the rules being broken by the same people who make them, many people would have much less issue.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the bus rides were free for a while. Err, sort of. They reopened the front of buses when it was figured out passengers were getting on without purchasing a ticket. Damn it!</p>
