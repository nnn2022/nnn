    <strong>I do not know what the ‘truth’ is.</strong>
    <p><p>I do not know what the ‘truth’ is. I surmise that whatever it is that I believe - it is a matter of choice. I must in no way regard any information I get as factual or ‘true’. Since knowledge of such a final reality as that, is not possible, even in principle. That is not how life is. I must choose then. I must regard things in the light of my experience and deploy whatever technique, trick, wisdom or knack that I have derived in the passing of time. Choices are always emotional. Choice without emotion, is not possible. I must then consider well the causes of feeling while I preside in the matter. Hence Covid - 19 is a phenomenon of marketing, reporting, propaganda and psychological abuse proffered with an intended effect to be that of terror. There is no real world infectious disease phenomena or emergency happening in this, in any way substantially different to which occurs regularly, frequently or even continuously in our world. Our world has now taken significant progress to a totalitarian outcome where freedom will have no meaning. We shall be allowed to live. Living will be the limit of our freedom. Nothing will be personally determined. But we shall be allowed to live. I care nothing now for facts or figures or arguments. I know what I know. I know that I am right.</p>
<p>It is people - us - who have done this. The occluded bogeyman, the demonic energy. It is us. We have made this. But now that we have - we cannot turn and face it.</p></p>
