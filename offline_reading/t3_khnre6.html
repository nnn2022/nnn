        <p>I actually find that it's the people who took it serious at the start are the people who now see the scam. I also find its the people who said "it's just a flu" at the beginning are now the main cultists. Almost like they've been conditioned into a state of constant fear.</p>

        <p>Definitely true for me. I was concerned for the first month or two, because I didn’t know what we were dealing with just yet, and I have a chronic illness. So I stayed home as much as I could for a few weeks, until I got more information.  That being said, I knew masks were bullshit from day 1.</p>

        <p>I was just thinking this. When it first broke out, we knew so little that I was genuinely concerned and I read everything I could about it. I was wearing masks before it was required cause the fearmongering was strong and I was pretty bluepilled at the time. I saw a friend around early spring, and they wouldn't even wear a mask inside a grocery store. Now I'm completely disillusioned, and the same friend is wearing a mask outside wherever he goes. It's just a herd mentality. When no one cared, he didn't care, when everybody cares, he cares. I blocked and deleted his number recently cause I don't associate with sheep.</p>

        <p>I realized it was a scam when I saw the data manipulation, biased reporting, and complete absence of calm, evidence-based discourse in the first two weeks. The exponential growth model they tried to sell had no basis in reality, as anyone with even a rudimentary background in stats could tell you. Policies weren't adjusted as more data was coming in. They just kept hamfisting lockdowns and masking. The media, pharma, big tech, and politicians knew exactly what they were doing from the get go.</p>

        <p>Ive found this before there was even a lockdown. I took this seriously before the panic shopping set in at the beginning. The more i looked into it the more i realized how crap this entire thing was. I was actually the first at my work to have even heard of this and told people about this new virus. You are wrong. I took this seriously then realized how much crap it is not the other way around.</p>
