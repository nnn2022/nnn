    <strong>I'm suffering from chronic depression, and have lost the will to live.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm an 18 year old guy living in California, and I've been suffering from chronic depression now for around seven months. No matter what I do to try and make myself feel better, it doesn't work. At the end of the day I  still struggle to see reasons to continue on.</p>
<p>I have not seen a another person my age ever since this all started in March 2020. Yes, I have literally done nothing but sit in my room suffering while I watch everyone support the tyrant Governor here.</p>
<p>I have not been inside a classroom since March 2020. My entire senior year has been completely stolen from me. It was entirely spent in my room on my laptop with not a single exciting activity. No prom, no homecoming, no grad night, no trip to New York that I was looking forward to for years, nothing. </p>
<p>But the good news is that our Governor is finally going to reopen the state!</p>
<p>On my last day of high school.</p>
<p>It almost feels intentional. The lockdown started right when I was making friends at the end of the junior year, and it's ending on my last day of high school, just in time to successfully make sure I lose out on life memories. It wouldn't have been any different if the Governor just walked up to my house and flipped me off.</p>
<p>And what is my reward for sacrificing life experiences and not interacting with a single human being besides my parents for a yesr straight?</p>
<p>Vaccine passports being mandated here, and Governors openly bragging about the Great Reset now.</p>
<p>I'm seriously struggling to keep it together at the moment. What's the point of continuing on, to suffer even more?</p></p>

        <p>Better times are coming my friend. You're 18 and finished with school. You have a freedom to move forward, to move away, to find a place that isn't so full of crazy people. I promise there are still sane places to be.</p>
<p>I don't know if you plan to go to college or find work, but you have the freedom to leave your state and find somewhere else to be, to exist.  </p>
<p>Do you like driving? Become a trucker and see other places in the wide breath of the United States! Do you like education? Find a trade school somewhere else and learn a trade, one way you can take pride in real work of your hands. Do you like academia? Apply for colleges. Community colleges in rural States are full of with people who believe like you do and they're not that expensive.  </p>
<p>In a way, the whole goal of what's been going on seems to have been to break down people like you. Take pleasure in defiance!  And find a way to live, and prosper!  It takes fortitude and faith and is beyond difficult without friends and family to support you, but there is so much more ahead.  </p>
<p>I don't know if you pray or not, but I do, and I hope it's not too forward to say but I'll be praying for you!</p>

        <p>I spent a lot of time just traveling to other states that were more open last year and was able to meet people from all over that weren’t completely brainwashed. I would suggest taking a break from even going to college and visiting states like TX and Florida and trying to enjoy life, it doesn’t look like things in california are getting better. Maybe go up to northern CA and spend some time in the mountains, that’s one place I was able to find peace during this time. You are an adult now so you can create a better life for yourself and there’s still a lot of life experiences to look forward too. Hopefully you figure something out bro but really it’s about taking your power back and that might mean moving somewhere else no matter how scary it is, the whole point of this shit is to make you feel powerless to these dictators but we the people can take back that power. Let your heart guide you on what to do and then follow that not what anyone else says right now.</p>

        <p>I will second this—go to the mountains. You’re not going to find your will to live in your house. A few years ago I travelled around California and took a side trip to Yosemite. I previously thought that the mountains in Poland were the most beautiful place in the world. Have you been to Yosemite? Do you have the means to go stay in a cabin somewhere there for a week? If you don’t, can you convince your parents you need a trip to shake off this awful feeling? Even if you all go together, I promise you it’s worth visiting. Some of the hikes in Yosemite are beautiful. Even if you don’t believe in God or a higher power (I don’t) they make you feel something bigger than yourself. There’s a waterfall in Yosemite that’s only a short hike up, maybe 15 minutes. If you go at the right time of day (we went in March around 4pm) as you stand there surrounded by waterfall spray the light hits the water just right, and you end up surrounded by rainbow. It’s like you’re inside the rainbow and you can reach out and touch it. You can feel it. It’s the most beautiful and magical place on earth and no photograph will ever do it justice. You have to be there and feel it. I’m embarrassed to say that it brought me to tears and I’m just standing there on top of this mountain crying, but I’ve never felt more alive, and I’ve never felt more like life meant <em>something</em>. </p>
<p>Go there.</p>

        <p>I actually have not been to Yosemite since I was very young, so I don't really remember it too much. Maybe I should ask about taking a trip there again. It may help me mentally.</p>

        <p>It will get better.  A couple of crappy years in your late teens and early twenties is nothing in the scope of a lifetime.  I know that doesn't help today but hopefully it gives you some extra will to live.</p>
<p>In the mean time go outside as much as possible.  Supplement vitamin D. See someone about anti depressants. Exercise.  Start a new hobby, preferably an outdoor based hobby.  Fishing,  mountain biking,  hiking.  Those can be done alone but also usually you see people while doing them.</p>
<p>Lots of studies show that spending time in outdoor green spaces can reduce depression.</p>

        <p>There are different times ahead. If you feel that you're missing out on the "best years of your life", remember: only people who peaked at your age would say that. I know, that is hard to comprehend, you know, I used to be younger as well and I am not sure I would believe my own words. </p>
<p>You have a unique opportunity in front of you: unlike the generation before you, someone pulled away the curtain over reality and burnt the bridge that society usually considers to be "the next logical step in life". Going to college while accepting a load of debt, traveling to typical holiday destinations and calling yourself "cultured", getting a low paid job in an Excel factory or some gig in the new economy. How brave, how predictable. Just look at the crying Millennials on college campuses. What role models. (/s just to be sure)</p>
<p>Take it all in, the hysteria, the politics, the bullshit and know, know deep inside you, that reality is something different. You will drastically change over the next ten years, trust me, and this situation gives you a strange form of freedom, once the crisis looses its momentum. So fuck prom, homecoming and all the other old values, Kodak moments and fake reality and throw it out. If your prom has any deeper meaning for you in ten years, there is a good chance that you wasted your twenties. Start learning useful stuff outside of school, that soul-crushing insane asylum, test out what might be interesting, what might come easy to you, what might create meaning for you.</p>
<p>Flip off the governor, know that you cannot rely on the beautiful but deadly words of government and corporations, reject their warped reality and take everything with a grain of salt and look for holes where they are too stupid to close them.</p>

        <p>That's the problem with being one of the few sane in today's world. You have to live with these constant feelings of hopelessness, anger, and ever-growing cynicism and they just eat away at you. I've even felt my physical health getting worse, and while I'm not quick to associate physical health problems with mental issues, I feel like that's what it has to be since everything is getting worse at the same time. My eyes, my teeth, my back, my lungs, my stomach, my sleep, even though I try as best as I can to be healthy.</p>
<p>It's even worse when you're so young because you're less likely to have like-minded friends in this matter. And I am so sorry about your senior year. Mine was last year, and while I wasn't looking forward to prom or graduation or anything, I just wanted to be there so fucking bad. To enjoy it. I looked forward to just enjoying the end of it my whole life. The worst part is that none of this is necessary. It's just the people in power taking our lives from us. There's no real reason we can't just live like 100 percent normal. Lots of people don't understand why it's a big deal, but it is if you're like me and school was your life. It's something everyone is supposed to have, and you'll never get it, because they took it from us.</p>
<p>I get it when you say you have no will to live. I don't either. (I'm not going to kill myself though, so no one freak out.) But the thing is, we're the minority. If we weren't, this wouldn't be happening. That's why we need everyone in this fight that we can get. I know how you feel to have no hope, with everything you were looking forward to and everything you love gone, and to have no one understand you and everyone call you selfish for just wanting to live freely. The realization that I'm one of the few young people fighting against this is what keeps me going even though it wears me out just existing in a place like this.</p>
<p>And if you have no will to live, you probably don't care what anyone does to you, so use that to fight against this. I don't care either what the Nazis try to do to me.</p>
<p>I'm praying for you and if you're not religious then I'm thinking of you.</p>

<p>I have been through hell, but somehow I have this impossible Joy because I have JESUS with me.</p>
<p>He died for You. Pray and ask HIM to Save You.</p>
