    <strong>It was expected to be much sorter and much more severe, no?</strong>
    <p><p>Nowadays, when we look on the extreme socioeconomic damage of lockdowns - from bankrupticies, debts that usually only exist in war and delays in school development for kids and everything else - and the fact that the fatalities are similar to the 1968 or the 1958 flu, that did not have such disproportionate response, I wonder if most pro lockdown poeople ask themseves if it was worth it.</p>
<p>No matter how scared people are, the results are in. Society had an extraordinary disruption for an epidemic whose severity is far from being an outlier in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>I only wonder if, when everything begun in March 2020, pro lockdown people really thought that it would be far worse than it actually was and that it would be over in 2 months. Things like school closures have a nonlinear pattern: things when they drag on, for too long, the damage goes up very quickly.</p>
<p>Now that things dragged on too far, they canÂ´t swallow the idea that they were wrong and, so, they double down.</p></p>

        <p>We're past doubling down at this point. They've doubled down on the original doubling down probably 3 or 4 times by now. So we're at more like a 16 or a 32 down.</p>

        <p>I tell you a sad story. I have a family business, we are the 4th Generation running it. 2019 was our best year ever since my brother and I took over the company some 15 years ago.</p>
<p>We are severly affected by the lockdowns and even in between, the ban on all events and closure of all leisure activities hits us hard. From moment zero, there has been little to even no empathy for our company going broke. At first people told me, its only two weeks I should just chill, then it was this, then it was that.</p>
<p>Basically 90% of my surrounding (family &amp; friends) are more less content with my company simply going broke. As in, well unlucky, but hey you are healthy, isnt that what counts...</p>

        <p>If at least that were true. In germany the idea of state-help for small business is... sub-optimal to put it mildly.</p>
<p>But you are right about the pride part. Ive come to notice that the less people have been working on creating their own life, the more they are accepting the new normal.</p>
