    <strong>Those who got or will get one of the jabs: why?</strong>
    <p><p>I tried posting this in r/LockdownSkepticism, because I figured it might be one of the only places with an audience that wouldn't outright reject it as anti-vax or just validate my feelings without any real discussion. But they wouldn't accept it :( I got told:</p>
<p>&rt;Our focus on this sub is examining the empirical basis for lockdowns, and the submission in its current form doesn't align with this aim. 
&rt;Feel free to resubmit with a tighter focus or repurpose the topic as a comment in another thread</p>
<p>Doesn't feel very fair given how strongly the vaccines are being tied into lockdowns/opening up, but anyways. You guys tell me what you think, here's the post:</p>
<p>As I understand it, there are a few major contenders so far, all of which are very new and came to market in extraordinarily short amount of time - some would call them experimental, some would disagree in characterizing them that way due to related preceeding research, but either way, they are being deployed under emergency use authorization which is an important distinction vs full FDA approval that takes a lot more time with good reason. People have legitimate concerns about the use of MRNA technology, rightly so in my opinion. Even if the short term results were perfect, which they aren't - there's just no way to know how it will actually turn out over the years to come. To be clear - I think people should still be able to get it if they so desire, but it absolutely must be within a context of complete and informed consent, free from any and all coercion. I desperately want to believe that most people agree with at least that.</p>
<p>Just in case some may not be aware, I'll throw this out there too, I think it's relevant: treatments. I feel there has been a somewhat myopic focus on vaccines. Yes, they should be researched of course, but there are proven treatments, which we hardly hear any mention of in mainstream media. They have numerous studies behind them that many doctors and scientists have spoken out about, but often been censored for. You can look them up yourselves, or just get a quick and easy list of some of them <a href="https://c19ivermectin.com">here</a>. These are real and completely legitimate and valid science, so I hope it doesn't get censored here too. i don't have any particular inclination towards any specific one - i just feel that it's important they get seen and considered, rather than people just assuming vaccines are the one and only option.</p>
<p>Sorry for being so long winded. The crux of it for me is that so far, I have yet to hear any compelling reason whatsoever to get injected with any of these things, especially knowing that it won't prevent infection or transmission. I feel like that should be treated more similarly to how influenza vaccines have traditionally been done, which is that anyone who wants one can get one. I never have, and it's never been a problem or point of contention for anyone. I never seem to get sick, nor do those around me. Some people I live with do get the flu jabs, they are fine as well, we just respect each other's personal decisions. And that's what it should be. A personal decision. I see no rational justifiable reason that it should be any different for this one. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>This is the only reason that makes any sense so far. People are caving to peer pressure when it comes to injecting things into their bodies.</p>

        <p>I had the second Pfizer shot today. I didn’t want the vaccine but the opportunity arose to get it and I took it. I have had kids and am in late 40’s. </p>
<p>My daughter isn’t getting vaccinated as she is only 15 and there is no need for her to have it. If she wants it she can get it when she is 18. </p>
<p>The only reason I got it was because of opportunity to get it. It will be tied to my job by the end of the year so I went and got it. It hasn’t changed my life. It hasn’t made anything better or worse.</p>
<p>I am for free will for everyone. If people want the shot, then get it. If people don’t then don’t. I am fine with either. I just don’t want a vaccine passport or people being denied things because they don’t have the Covid vaccination.</p>

        <p>I think majority of people are just naive enough that they believe everything the govt tells them and also what the news tells them.  They lack "critical thinking" and apparently have short memories about all the times in the past the govt has lied.  </p>
<p>Even in regards to covid when they LIED to our face and said an N95 mask would not protect and so therefore leave that one for the medical professionals.  And also how they lied and said a cotton mask is good enough or a bandana is good enough even when we have scientific evidence that they are offer very poor protection.  </p>
<p>Here is another thing people dont know:  There are 3 more vaccines that are in current trials as we speak and offer a potentially better performance than the 3 vaccines that are currently out.  So I am better off to just hold out for a couple months and get the better vaccine.  Or maybe no vaccine.  Thats why waiting is the best option because it leaves you the most options.  </p>
<p>But once you accept the current shot you may not even be allowed to take the new stuff because it may be contra-indicated to stack with the other vaccines.   So in reality the logical and sanest choice is to wait and not take the vaccine.  Just to keep using N95 respirator and adhering to the same guidelines we are already accustomed to.</p>

        <p>May I say thanks for a well-worded and earnest question!
Allow me to attempt to give an example situation that might directly answer.  </p>
<p>My parents went ahead and got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and while I wouldn't have done it I understand their reasons for it. They are in an age bracket where the odds seem to be better for them to get the vaccine then covid.   Neither of them is at high risk seizure or blood clots, but their age makes them higher risk for covid.  And while the vaccine in theory doesn't prevent transmission the idea is that it makes a later covid infection much less intense which could be life saving for them.  </p>
<p>Also because they are older, concerns about long-term repercussions weigh less heavily than it would for someone Young.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I can appreciate that. It sounds like they probably routinely get the flu jabs as well then. It's not something I ever plan on doing, but I suppose I can understand that perspective. My problem with these ones in particular is that there's just too much trust required of those with a track record of too much deceit. I pray for those that take it that it really is as portrayed.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's my perspective as well. My grandparents were a military family, Air Force, and they always trusted exactly what anyone in any position of authority said, from doctors to teachers to politicians.  My parents are less like that and even can get quite skeptical at times, so I was surprised they were willing to get the jab.  I agree that trust in the track record of companies like moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson is problematic at best.  And while I don't think that factored too heavily with my parents, I know it does with a lot of elderly people.  </p>
<p>My parents are in their 60s so if there is an increase in chance of blood clots over there the next say five years they're still well within the danger zone.  And who knows what else is up with what is effectively a first-run product.   For their sake I also really really hope there's not bad side effects like that.</p>

        <p>It's a risk, but if they feel they weighed the risks with full information, then more power to them and I have to respect that even if i disagree. I just draw the line at this bizarro-world collectivist bullshit of forcing everyone to do the same. Let people have all the vaccines they want, make sure all the information is there, and that should be the end of it. But instead, we have to turn the world upside down and go on a witch hunt against those who don't want any part of it.</p>

        <p>I work in a hospital with neck, mouth, and throat cancer patients who are at a high risk of dying from covid due to their conditions. I was never worried about covid for myself, but I cannot get sick so if I got covid I know I'd be asymptomatic and potentially spread it to these very fragile patients I take care of. Being that I cannot get sick, I'm not worried about covid vaccine side effects so I just got the shot.</p>
