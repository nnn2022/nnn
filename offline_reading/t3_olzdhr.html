    <strong>I was surprised by the x amount of people who went into the hospital, feeling like utter trash and convinced they experienced a heart attack.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>Went to the hospital. Been having issues for awhile, that almost killed me. Hospital was negligent every time I went. Over 6+ hour wait, cruel nurses. Don‚Äôt believe that Canadian healthcare is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waited another 6+ hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the hospital was overcrowded today (during covid peaks, it wasn‚Äôt) I was next to a lot of patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women from my guess anywhere from 20, to 60 came in, claiming they had a heart attack. Not one, but multiple. They were shaking, quiet, and felt sluggish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time the doctor came back with results. They said there was nothing wrong with them, and their cardiologist tests or whatever came back perfectly normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The answer? The covid vaccine, and their response, ‚Äúsometimes the vaccine has longer symptoms for people.‚Äù</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Idk, I‚Äôm not an anti-vaxxer, but I have my hesitancy on this vaccine because of my current health problems. Never in my life have I heard a vaccine causing heart attack symptoms where women come in, concerned and believing they had a heart attack. A sore arm, or maybe feeling shitty for a day. Sure but not like this.</p>
<p>But, hey heart attack symptoms are perfectly normal y‚Äôall.</p></p>

<p>Well, a vast majority of us aren't either, but when it comes to an untested and unsafe experimental gene therapy, yeah we're against that, specially when it's being imposed to healthy individuals just so they can access basic necessities.  </p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you get better soonüí™üí™</p>

        <p>Not only have I heard of but I actually had a heart-attack-like symptom myself.</p>
<p>That was on December 5th in 1998. 2 days after getting my 2nd of three doses of FSME-vaccine.</p>
<p>It was a stinging pain that lasted for several hours and slowly became less stinging. After that, whenever I did something physically demanding, the pain would come back and I had to rest for a while. Didn't help my school was on top of a steep hill.</p>
<p>It took about 3 months to go back to normal.</p>
<p>For some reason I didn't tell my parents back then. I also did not immediately make the connection to the vaccine. Only my cousin and two of his friends knew at the time. I tried to act as if it isn't that bad...</p>
<p>I didn't take my third dose of it and also started to eat healthier because that was the other possible explanation I had for it, despite not being overweight or anything like that.</p>

<li>I'm very much pro-vaccination.</li>
<li>I'm very much anti-spike protein, as it seems to be lab-made and the causing all kinds of problems (from viral infection, as from vaccine replication).</li>
<li>Not very keen on the mRNA technology either, as it overrides the innate immune system, as if it were something flawed and faulty, to be replaced with injections.</li>
<li>The fact that politicians want to enforce injections onto people without informed consent, is a dead giveaway that noone would get these injections, if people actually realized what they are about.</li>
<li>Renowned scientists/doctors stating 85% of covid deaths could 've been prevented with early treatment, and are censored about it, with those treatment medicines politically prohibited, showing it's not about healthcare, nor science, but politics.</li>
</ol>
<p>To conclude/synthesize: politics want to inject people with a harmful designer protein. If you don't take it yourself, it 'll be forced upon you. You wonder why people are hesitant?</p>

        <p>Stop using the phrase "hesitant/hesitancy." Hesitancy implies that you're going to just need a little push to convince you. Be an adult and claim your decision - you are NOT hesitant, you are making a fully self-actualized and autonomous decision to not receive a medical procedure without any direct or specific benefit to you.</p>
