    <strong>I have been RADICALIZED into refusing an experimental clot-shot, thinking for myself and wanting basic freedom!! I NEED TO BE RE-PROGRAMMED!!</strong>
    <p><p>Daddy government needs to wash my brain some more because I'm thinking too much for my own good. I need my autonomy and agency stripped away as I am causing harm to not only myself but others around me, purely through my own selfish existence as an UNVACCINATED (Pappa please forgive me!) individual! I need to be pumped full of that sweet, sweet Science juice immediately so I can protect others who have been vaccinated themselves and those who can't get the vax (even though they'll be excluded from the rest of society because of their unvaccinated status and FUCK I'M DOING IT AGAIN! STOP. FUCKING. THINKING!).</p>
<p>I need to be re-educated and re-programmed. Stick me in a room for two weeks and pipe in "Happy" by Pharrell Williams on an endless loop, that oughta do the trick. When I'm released I'm sure I'll be an obediant little lapdog; a Tiger King watching, Science worshipping, Billie Eilish stanning model of modern society. I will NOT delete the NHS app. I will BUY all the toilet paper. I will question NOTHING, no matter how illogical, insane or intrusive. If you tell me to wear fourteen masks at any given time I will comply. I will take every booster shot pushed on me until my arm is a blackened, track-marked twig, ready to snap off at any moment, and when it does I shall offer my remaining arm for more. I might end up looking like a foosball player when both arms are amputated but I'll have done my part in fighting Covid.</p>
<p>Those who call for my death for my unvaccinated status only do so out of a deep, empathetic need to save lives. Soon enough I shall be part of that same crowd, rage-filled and bulging vein throbbing from my forehead as I scream through several layers of masks for more restrictions and less freedom. I will demand the government (who I profess to hate and criticize endlessly yet conversely follow zealously and severely admonish those who don't) take away my bodily autonomy, right to free speech and what little freedoms I have left so we can protect the elderly, many of whom fought in their youth to prevent such authoritarianism and fascism from taking hold in the West. </p>
<p>I shall shit on their past in the present to ensure their future.</p></p>
