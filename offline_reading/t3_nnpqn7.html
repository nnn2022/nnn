    <strong>gathering witness reports: how governemental employees abused emergency laws between march 2020 and may 2021</strong>
    <p><p>for the purpose of both trauma healing as well as also to prevent eventual further attempts of autoritarian totalitarian tuned individual human beings to abuse emergency laws trying to install a global dictatorship based on ... your body my choice ( sarcasm ...)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i believe it could be helpfull if those of us who understand what happened to us, how we were being misshandled, being abused by governemental overreach during the past year and more ... if we would gather our witness reports somewhere</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>anonymous or with name ... either way most valuable could also be for some to read about the  effects fellow human beings noticed, how the  governemental intimidation messed up ones personal social interactions with family, friends, collegues etc.</p></p>
