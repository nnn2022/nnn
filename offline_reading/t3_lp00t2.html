    <strong>Anyone think masks cut off oxygen supply? How long would you say it takes you to feel the effects of oxygen loss when wearing a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>Just curious. Don't look at my history and call me a troll I'm genuinely asking because I wanna do an experiment while wearing a mask and doing different activities but I need a time frame first</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn't say they cut OFF oxygen per se but it's definately reduced. Had an experience at work on Friday I felt compelled to share, made a post about it yesterday.</p>

<p>Try walking a few hundred meters carrying a pretty heavy box and see how you feel.</p>
<p>Repeat the test with a mask strapped to your face and tell me there's no difference in how you feel.</p>

        <p>Depends on the mask and the activity. A friend's kickboxing class now has breaks every 10 minutes because they need to rest more often. If the mask is at all capable of filtering anything it necessarily takes more effort to suck in air, which is more tiring and limits oxygen for exercise.</p>
<p>For really fat people, just walking might be enough for this to have an impact. The US is full of those.</p>

        <p>Making exercise classes easier because it’s hard to breathe in the mask makes me so angry. They never should have mandated masks for exercise. Also you can’t admit that it’s hard to breathe in them but why else would they be doing that? Making everyone less healthy and fit doesn’t make sense during a “ health crisis” or ever and is obviously about something else. They want us confused and unhealthy and sick.</p>

        <p>To a small degree probably. It's always important to breath fresh air when your outside. These psychopaths however, want people to stay inside all day, get zero sunlight (Vitamind D) and eat shit fast food. The exact opposite of boosting your immune system and staying healthy.</p>

        <p>Yes, as someone who is hypersensitive to headaches, I start getting a headache a couple hours after wearing a mask nonstop (I haven’t actually timed it but I will start doing that). The headache goes away shortly after I take it off which makes me think that less oxygen and more carbon dioxide is the culprit.</p>
<p>My best guesstimate is that it takes about 2-3 hours to develop the headaches and 15-20 minutes for them to subside after de-masking</p>

        <p>I don't know, to be honest. I don't know if it's oxygen but I do feel a struggle to focus, dizziness and eventually sometimes even sickness in my stomach and shortness of breath. I don't care what causes it, it happens and it's really not a nice experience.</p>

        <p>Anecdotal but my dentist said he isn't comfortable working without using an oxygen line into his mask because he needs to think clearly.</p>
<p>In my experience, it's pretty evidence from winter outdoor activities that make you breathe hard.</p>
<p>It's common sense that when you cover something it reduces air flow.</p>

        <p>Tried it for the last couple of hours in a shift at a previous job last year. Never again. Within minutes I had to start taking deeper, longer breaths to feel “sated”, and as time went on each breath felt less and less satisfying regardless of depth or duration so the job became increasingly difficult due to tiredness. But it wasn’t only physical, it was mental tiredness. I also remember heating up to the point of sweating even at rest. I was not unhealthy, I’m young and I exercise a lot.</p>

        <p>As someone who suffers from a propensity for severe headaches and migraines (which I’ve suffered from since age 14) I still complied (unwillingly) with the masks until my headaches and migraines started to occur more frequently, until then I only generally experienced about 3-4 a week. However a few days in to wearing them I would be doing my job and then all of a sudden I could feel them coming on, day after day, the only days where I didn’t get them was when I wasn’t in work and unsurprisingly not wearing a mask. So I sought medical advice from my GP who said not to wear them... so anybody coming at me with the ‘it’s just a mask’ and the sanctimonious claim of ‘you don’t care about other people’ feel free to step in to my shoes and feel what it’s like to suffer from headaches and migraines that make you want to tear your eyes out and kill yourself week after week! Don’t try and guilt me in to ruining my quality of life just so you all can virtue signal about how ‘unselfish’ and ‘compassionate’ you are when you’d happily destroy someone else’s life just for your own gratification! That is why I won’t wear a mask and fuck you all who condemn me for it!</p>

        <p>Technically, I don’t think they cut off oxygen per se, so much as cause CO2 to build up. Most of the common complaints (dizziness, breathlessness, tiredness) stem from this.</p>

        <p>Almost instantly. Compare with a single layer of cotton or a scarf.  The key here is that liberal ideology functions so that everyone must stay calm and not need too much breath. ie, just stay calm if you can’t breath, what do you mean you can’t stay calm. Its a brand of nice fascism, and now they are mandating that kids don’t talk to much at lunch time.</p>

        <p>No, it does not. Even actual respirators do not in an amount that matters to a healthy person. I've worn actual military gas masks for over 24 hours (full MOPP4) with no effect from 'loss of oxygen. </p>
<p>Look folks, the rags are useless &amp; this BS doublethink of it both not stopping a virus because it is too small (true) AND also can block gasses (false) is just stupid. </p>
<p>Unless you are in such poor health walking leaves you winded, a rag is not gonna do it either.</p>

        <p>Masks cut off enough oxygen that a surgeon can only do one surgery and then thats it! If they didn't die during or after the surgery due to lack of oxygen they are forced to retire.</p>

        <p>Yes, so you agree. surgeons most likely take breaks between every operation. That hyperbole back fired immensely.</p>
