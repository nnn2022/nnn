    <strong>"Because Of The Pandemic" Is Not An Acceptable Defence</strong>
    <p><p>I am fucking sick to my back-teeth of Y'ALL constantly fucking defending the ongoing madness and tyranny perpetrated under the banner of COVID. The Paralympic-level mental gymnastics you fucking exercise to convince yourselves you're doing the right thing by obeying governments and institutions you endlessly criticize and pour scorn on, summarily executing any and all ideals you held dear prior to 2020, shows you are weak, spineless, and, above all, brainwashed. You've forgotten what it is to be human.</p>
<p>I want to see Y'ALL defend the jackbooted thugs who used excessive force to break up Sarah Everard's vigil whilst also defending the "mostly peaceful" BLM protests. Go on, fucking do it. I dare you. DO. IT.</p>
<p>I want to see Y'ALL watch that video on the front page of anti-lockdown protestors in the Netherlands being clubbed over the head and set on by the K9 unit and maintain a straight fucking face. Tell me they were doing that for "their own safety". Having said that, knowing how hateful and vile most of you are judging by your comments, I can't help but imagine you'll curve a little smirk over that video and maybe even pop off a cheeky wank while you're at it.</p>
<p>I would love to see Y'ALL fucking take into account that 67.9 million people worldwide have recovered from this virus rather than fixate on the comparatively low number of 2.65 million deaths (most of which are WITH Covid on the death certificate). In fact, I'd just love to see someone quote that fucking number instead of focusing on the American death toll for once.</p>
<p>Y'ALL are so eager to defend The Science and dismiss any studies or evidence that might go against Your Science. Y'ALL love to sweep suicides, vaccine deaths, and unemployment rates under the rug because that doesn't net you enough upvotes and Covid has given you an identity and license to act like a complete cunt to people online and offline. Y'ALL actually like the fucking new normal because you can indulge your social anxiety whilst appearing to actually give a fuck about other people.</p>
<p>Empathy has been weaponized against all of us. We have all been divided. You can't defend the actions and restrictions used by the government without acknowledging the detrimental and harmful effects of those actions and restrictions. Most of which have been hastily yet lazily cobbled together, I might add. Are lockdowns and face-masks really the best we could come up with to combat such a "deadly" pandemic? Why not JUST shelter the elderly and vulnerable whilst providing healthcare services with money and extra equipment, perhaps financed from the pockets of the politicians and officials who have profited off of and presided over this shambolic cluster-fuck?</p>
<p>Pfft, but that would be stupid, right? Too much work: let's just lockdown everyone, tear down small businesses, and reshape society into a deformed caricature of its former self. How the fuck do we recover from this shit? My prediction: we don't. I swear, this whole farce and war against the scourge that is Covid will culminate with a masked NHS nurse twerking on the back of a nuke plummeting towards the ground like at the end of Dr. Strangelove. Fucking clown-world.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a Yank, not a Brit, so our legal system is a bit different. </p>
<p>Over here, based on prior judicial rulings and the US Constitution, everyone must be afforded due process (innocent until proven guilty), and the government is only <strong>supposed</strong> to use the "least restrictive" manner of accomplishing a policy objective (I'm a US libertarian, so I think even the "least restrictive" test gives them <em>too much</em> power). </p>
<p>But let us take those at their face value. The orders to wear a face covering are based on <strong>assumption of guilt</strong>, that is, that anyone is a potential carrier, even though most transmission is symptomatic, not asymptomatic. To require quarantine or masking, you are <em>supposed</em> have to establish someone is actually sick, or very likely to be so, beyond a reasonable doubt. But that all got tossed out the window in the panic.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, locking down and shuttering businesses for months, then making them jump through insane hoops, is by no means the "least restrictive" thing that could be done to limit spread. </p>
<p>Talked to my wife yesterday. We're mostly work-from-home (though I do go to a nearly-empty office about four hours a week), so we have actually come through the pandemic relatively well, other than our mental health taking a hit (especially in winter - cold climate - in summer &amp; fall we had things like golf and hiking and the beach, at least). We concluded people may have trouble getting back to functioning like normal, because this overbearing government garbage went on for <em>way</em> the fuck too long.</p>

        <p>The people against this sub (lockdown shills and Covid-cultists in general actually) have a fucking annoying habit of addressing everyone as "y'all". I think it makes them feel smart or something. Thought I'd just indirectly point it out/make fun of it by emphasizing and repeating it haha.</p>

        <p>Im gonna be honest, im not the most informed and interested person, actually i classify myself as lazy useless bag of flesh.</p>
<p>Still, some things are more then clear for a dumbfuck like me. Like, here in Maranhão (a province of Brazil, bad engrish here), Flavio Dino has authorized curfew. Like, first ppl here were mad at the 1964 dictatorship that used cirfew and now, just bc its for "the greater good", they let their heads down? </p>

        <p>They had to do something to crush the rise of nationalism and all of Trump's economic success here in the US, while dragging the world down to the lowest common denominator (China) and coerce otherwise freedom and rights loving people into becoming the fascists the "anti" fascists were screeching about for the last 5 years.</p>
