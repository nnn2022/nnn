    <p><p>&rt;While this Order may be enforced and CDC reserves the right to enforce through criminal penalties, CDC does not intend to rely primarily on these criminal penalties but instead strongly encourages and anticipates widespread voluntary compliance as well as support from other federal agencies in implementing additional civil measures enforcing the provisions of this Order, to the extent permitted by law and consistency with President Biden’s Executive  Order of January 21, 2021.</p>
<p>&rt;The order exempts those under the age of two, as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Individuals are also not required to wear a mask while eating or drinking “for brief periods of time” or communicating “for brief periods of time” with someone who is hearing impaired.</p>
<p>&rt;The CDC also specifies that individuals do not have to wear a mask if unconscious “for reasons other than sleeping,” or if they are “incapacitated, unable to be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.”</p>
<p>&rt;The order also permits those who are “experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath or are feeling winded” to remove the mask “temporarily until able to resume normal breathing with the mask.”</p>
<p>&rt;“Persons who are vomiting should remove the mask until vomiting ceases,” the order states.</p>
<p>&rt;The order will remain in effect “unless modified or rescinded based on specific public health or other considerations, or until the Secretary of Health and Human Services rescinds the determination under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act that a public health emergency exists,” the order added.</p></p>
