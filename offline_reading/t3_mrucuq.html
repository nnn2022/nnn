    <strong>When you have to wear a mask...</strong>
    <p><p>Many of us are required to enter areas that enforce YBMC (your body, my choice) policies, primarily mask requirements.  If this applies to you, here are some masks you can wear to express yourself and to communicate to those with similar opinions that they are not alone.  Please note that I do not profit from the sale of these masks, and I am in no way affiliated with the sellers: I just wanted to share.</p>
<p>My personal favorite: <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/mask/Do-You-Feel-Safe-Now-by-Fyms/56821680.9G0D8?ref=product-image">(Redbubble) "Do you feel safe now?" mask</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Safety-Compliance-Reusable-Washable-Bandanas/dp/B08S734XLN/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=anti+mask&amp;qid=1618540998&amp;sr=8-2">(Amazon) "It's not about safety: It's about compliance" mask</a></p>
<p>(Redbubble) <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/?iaCode=all-masks&amp;query=antimask&amp;ref=search_box">A diverse selection of masks designed by smaller artists</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=antimask">Etsy's selection of anti-YBMC masks, also designed primarily by smaller artists</a></p>
<p>I also read <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/13-investigates-anti-mask-protestors-turn-to-mesh-yarn-crochet-masks-covid-coronavirus/531-5350260c-d6b1-4bd8-857e-860fe84e0f52">an article</a> that discusses another route you could try.  Most YBMC requirements (both those set by businesses and those decreed by local and state governments) are very vague, only requiring people to wear facial coverings that cover their noses and mouths.  They fail to specify important details, such as material and minimal effectiveness.  To mock these rules, some like-minded individuals have been wearing completely ineffective facial coverings and have received little to no pushback, as they are fully within policy.  For example, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anyoupin-Adjustable-Ultra-Violet-Protective-Paintball/dp/B07P6QGRW9/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;keywords=airsoft+mask&amp;qid=1618543947&amp;sr=8-9">this mask</a>, which is in full compliance with most mask mandates, yet it obviously provides no protection (it's so obvious that even pro-maskers can see it).  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search/?query=mesh%20mask">Here are some more options from Walmart.</a></p></p>
