    <strong>I can’t anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I’m sick and tired of seeing and hearing the same bs spouted by jab pushers and maskholes. This real life episode of The Twilight Zone has gotten old. It’s about other people! It affects others! Unprotected sex impacts others as well. Should we mandate condoms so nobody gets stds? Limit the amount of sex partners one can have? Enough of the bullshit already!</p></p>

        <p>Don't stress about it. A lot of the time, these people are just doing what they're told and are wanting to go back to normal. They genuinely believe that everyone getting the vaccine is the only path back to normalcy. Most of the time, they mean no ill will and more often than not, they're just anxious to get back to normal - I wouldn't hold it against them. Especially if they recommend you get the vaccine out of genuine concern for <em>your</em> health, rather than out of tribalism or irrational anxiety.</p>
<p>Of course, it goes without saying that there are a ton of genuine asshole pieces of shit who would use their vaccination status or mask wearing as a tool to gain some feeling of moral superiority over other people. You see it all of the time here in Reddit and other social media sites, and even in real life, at times. These people are in a cult, and it's very weird. I agree with you though - it really does feel like a Twilight Zone episode seeing what you would think to be normal people devolve into whatever it is they are now (NPCs, drones, etc.), but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Regardless, don't stress about it. There's not much you can do to change people who have already convinced themselves that their world view is correct. The most you should do is inform, move on, change the subject if it's brought up again, or just find other people to chat with.</p>

        <p>I call them the modern day Jim Jones cult. They would jump off a cliff if their gremlin god Fauci told them to.</p>
