    <strong>The lockdown supporters are becoming unhinged</strong>
    <p><p>Just an observation. For context, I'm in Ontario. </p>
<p>I like to scour "normie" social media here, particulary CP24's Twitter (which is a big local news station in Toronto) - I don't have social media accounts myself, but I do like to read what people are saying. </p>
<p>Something I noticed, the supporters of lockdowns are becoming more and more draconian and unreasonable. Now I know what you're thinking - yes, they've always been unreasonable to some degree. But it's getting worse. I've literally seen unironic tweets asking for police checkpoints, military checkpoints, and of course the amazing "LOCK US DOWN NOW!"</p>
<p>I'll tell you this, a lot of fence sitters I know in my life are starting to raise an eyebrow. Whereas 4 months ago maybe they would have been in support of more measures, seeing these maniacs continually escalate their demands is starting to push many away. </p>
<p>Now sure, there are still way too many people who support this nonsense, but I see a very different response to these people today vs a few months back. I'm not saying the tide is turning or anything like that, but there's a different feel in the air.</p></p>

        <p>No offense but I've been seeing posts like yours for months now. People saying "Hey, everyone I know is starting to notice something's up! The tide's turning, y'all!" It just doesn't seem like it, not on a meaningful scale.</p>

        <p>Oh no worries, no offense taken. I would be lying if I said I don't have my own doubts that anything will change. I alternate between glimpses of hope and complete lack thereof quite often.  This is why I said it's more of an observation than any kind of hail Mary. </p>
<p>And you're right, we need meaningful change on a large scale. Unfortunately that hasn't happened yet. I think we're all still too comfortable, many of us have too much to lose. I don't think until more people's backs are against the wall that we will see anything other than social media complaining.</p>

        <p>These kinds of things happen on an exponential curve. Nobody is talking about it until everyone is.</p>
<p>I myself am kind of curious what the real picture is, since the media wonâ€™t let us know we are kind of shooting blind.</p>

        <p>I think most are bots used by TPTB to dissuade anyone from questioning or disagreeing. Civil people will see that many people cheering on the govt taking away rights and not want to speak against it for fear of being ostracized.</p>

        <p>I was at the dentist last week and they had it going on all TV's. I asked if they weren't tired of the constant CP24 Covid scroller. They ended up changing the channel in every room. Can't believe people don't notice that constantly hearing and staring at it is terrible for one's mental well being.</p>

        <p>There's no sense of personal responsibility with these people. They show up on the news interviewed in the street saying the government should stop people being on the street. It's surreal.</p>

        <p>They don't matter. They only stomach lockdowns at all because essential workers (whose lives are non-existent to them) are buzzing round with Amazon deliveries and wrenches and Funko-Pops. If <em>everyone</em> had to <em>actually</em> stay home, and they couldn't just call for food or entertainment - or, God forbid, no new Netflix shows came out! - they'd not be able to cope. They certainly won't come out to defend the government when millions of unemployed, impoverished people start tearing it to pieces. They'll sneer online, the way those luvvie types always do, but be far too scared to go near a barricade or police line.</p>

        <p>I'd bet that none of these "normals" would actually want a full lockdown- you know- locked inside their homes with no grocery stores or stores of any kind... they wouldn't want that- but it's considered cool to wish for it.   Well, the honest agoraphobes would want it, but they're not mentally sound people.  Agoraphobia is recognized as a mental disorder.</p>

        <p>yeah ive noticed this on reddit and r/unitedkingdom too. its gone from 'try and stay home and social distance' to 'police should have unrestricted power to fine and imprison people for not wearing masks and going out after 8pm'. Either its Stockholm Syndrome, or they are getting worried that we mayybe right and overcompensating becuase they dont want to admit they;re wrong/</p>

        <p>I think there's a shitload of bots. Particularly on twitter and reddit. This in turn does cause some people to act like maniacs, but for the most part I don't think your average person is actually clamoring for more lockdowns or restrictions at this point in time.</p>
