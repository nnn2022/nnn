    <strong>Thoughts on a Facebook post</strong>
    <p><p>I recently saw this post going around Facebook, and figured I'd add my two cents. Apologies for the length. </p>
<p>"FINALLY SOMEONE HAS SAID IT!!!!! </p>
<p>I have done my best to respect the diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 over these past few months, however the ER nurse that posted this brilliantly sums up my train of thought :</p>
<p>Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense.📷</p>
<p>"Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?</p>
<p>What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?</p>
<p>Is it zero cases?</p>
<p>The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.</p>
<p>Is it a vaccine?</p>
<p>It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.</p>
<p>The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.</p>
<p>We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications.</p>
<p>Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.</p>
<p>We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren’t necessarily safe!</p>
<p>Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?</p>
<p>How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?</p>
<p>You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?</p>
<p>What if October's numbers are the same as August's?</p>
<p>You moved football to spring?</p>
<p>What if next March is worse than this one was?</p>
<p>When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?</p>
<p>I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are strawberries and so is shellfish.</p>
<p>We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.</p>
<p>We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage. Many speed and don't wear seat belts.</p>
<p>We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.</p>
<p>Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway?</p>
<p>Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old gas station sushi?</p>
<p>Or operating a chainsaw?</p>
<p>When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty?</p>
<p>Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, "I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the State Fair and go to Church and go hug my Mom in her retirement home?"</p>
<p>I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days.</p>
<p>I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.</p>
<p>We either get busy living or we get busy dying.</p>
<p>When God decides it's your time, you don't get any mulligans, so I guess I would rather spend my time enjoying it and living in the moment and not worrying about what ifs and maybes, and I bet I'm not the only one."</p>
<p>(I copied this from someone else. Feel free to do the same.)"</p>
<p>By failing to adhere to COVID restrictions we have perpetuated the course of this virus. The same people who are now arguing against vaccination are those who refused to adhere to medical advice early on, and still largely refuse to wear masks. Do the right thing now, and with enough people pulling together we have a very real chance at beating this disease. Sure, the flu vaccine has an efficacy of 40-60%. The current COVID vaccines have an efficacy in the 80-90% range. </p>
<p>Ultimately the sentiment behind this enrages me. There is a common misconception that land of the free means "I do what I want, and damn the consequences". That is, simply, unacceptable. Your right to personal convenience does not trump another's right to life. Get busy living or get busy dying? Fuck off. Take common sense precautions now, so we can all spend more time with those we love in the future.  </p></p>

        <p>Because calling you a "selfish grandma murder" isn't productive. I'd rather explain my thoughts, and open the floor to discuss. I am angry, but it's important to understand why. I hate wearing a mask. I hate not going out, I miss going to bars and dates and movies. But I do not forsee a world where we will ever be able to go back to normal without taking effective agressive action now.</p>

        <p>I'm going to tell you something that may have never occurred to you: </p>
<p>Let's say you all get your wish and the anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers get put into camps away from society so it's only the good, honest, rule-following folks such as yourselves allowed to participate in open society. </p>
<p>I guarantee you that even then, with all us horrible people out of your way - you still will never see freedom return. </p>
<p>Because it's actually people like you who are prolonging this, not us. </p>
<p>If you were wise and wanted your freedom back, you'd realize that people like us are your only ticket back.</p>

        <p>And I'm telling you, even with 100% compliance, covid, it's variants and "climate disasters" are here to stay. this isn't about a virus, it's about restructuring society. And the future society they're trying to build involves masking, social distancing, capacity limits, tracking and revolving lockdowns forever.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure I agree about COVID being around forever (we beat smallpox, we can beat this), but concur with climate disasters and such always being around. People will always have to deal with hardship, but I cannot imagine a world where anyone readily embraces uneccesary controls. I'm an American, and I like to believe that, assuming voters and the criminal justice system hold politicians accountable, we will never collapse to those authoritarian depths.</p>

<p>You can be a compliant sheep, nobody cares about what you want.  If you haven’t figured it out yet... they’re constantly moving the goal posts for our “liberties” back... until the next shot🙄. The only way is flat out defiance.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything in this post except the last two paragraphs. My wife had one of the early cases back in February of 20. They tested her for lupus due to her symptoms including a face so swollen she couldn’t open her eyes for days, two rounds of Tami flu with no effect. She was miserable. Her illness lasted nearly three months. She is 100% against this vaccine because of the unknown consequences. People have the right to decide for themselves. If a person is scared of infection they are welcome to continue to social distance and mask. Nobody is mandating you can’t.</p>

        <p>I am sincerely sorry about your wife, and hope she is doing well now. As for being against the vaccine due to unknown consequences, well, I can't agree, but I can understand. I do hope we can get to the point where transmission has slowed and your wife's natural antibodies are more than sufficient, and we can go about our business.</p>

        <p>Developing the solution to the actual problem that there is to be solved began 110 years ago.  By the end of 2019, we had it nailed down.  The overwhelming evidence produced between the end of 2019 and now confirms it.</p>
