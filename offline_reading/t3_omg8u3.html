    <strong>Current state of the vaccine in Japan</strong>
    <p><p>This popped up tangentially in another thread and just sharing for others who might be curious how things stand in Japan.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10601000/000802395.pdf">Ministry of Health site</a> there have been 556 officially reported deaths due to the vaccine. This is not an entirely reliable figure as the nature of the reporting system is opaque. One example of how there might be issues is that there are 554 death reported for Pfizer out of 39 million shots given (0.0014%) and only 2 for Moderna out of 1 million shots given (0.0002%). In other words Pfizer seems to be 7 times deadlier than Moderna, maybe that’s the case, or maybe the reporting is off.</p>
<p>Those numbers might seem low but bear in mind that Japan has roughly 15,000 Covid deaths in 16 months (937 deaths per month) , while the vaccine has caused 556 deaths in just 5 months (111 deaths per month). The monthly vaccine deaths rate is therefore 11.8% of the virus death rate.</p>
<p>These are just the short term effects so far. There may be a surge as many people only received vaccines in the last couple of months and there may be significant underreporting.</p>
<p>Most people in Japan seem to be assuming the vaccines are safe because they tend to trust the experts a great deal. However, among young people there is a lot of information circling on the internet that makes them hesitant. Generally, people are unlikely to be strongly suspicious because cases of deaths and severe reactions are very rare and downplayed by media and the government. Cases of actual deaths from the virus are also relatively rare (far lower than annual flu deaths and affecting the same group) but the media and government are playing these up constantly. If the vaccine death rates increase, or if people start documenting negative side-effects on social media, this may change.</p></p>
