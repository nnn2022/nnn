    <strong>How to see Totalitarianism Coming</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone else read any good books about totalitarianism creeping into society, or totalitarianism in general?  Here are some brief notes/useful highlights from my personal studies. </p>
<p><strong>A catalyst for the New Normal?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;It only takes a catalyst like war, economic depression, plague, or some other severe or prolonged crisis that brings the legitamacy of the liberal democratic system into question. (Dreher, Live not by lies) </p>
<p><strong>Social Distancing and Lockdowns.?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world, is the fact that <strong>loneliness</strong>, once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, <strong>has become an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses</strong> of our century. (Arendt, <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism)</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A polity filled with alienated individuals who share little sense of community and purpose are prime targets for totalitarianism ideologies and leaders who promise solidarity and meaning. (Dreher<em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Believing Useful Lies</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Once you relinquish your freedom for the sake of "understood necessity,</strong>' for Party discipline, for conformity with the regime, for the greatness and glory of the Fatherland, or for any substitutes that are so convincingly offered,<strong>*</strong> <strong>you cede your claim to the truth</strong> ... You can surrender your moral responsibility to be honest out of misplaced idealism. You can also surrender it by hating others more that you love truth.  (Dreher)</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>for the <em>health and safety</em> of others, to <em>flatten the curve,</em> or to <em>reopen society, etc.</em></p></p>

        <p>I agree, it is clearly happening all around us. I am also just interested in history and what it looked like when totalitarianism was implemented and sustained in other parts of the world. I know in a general sense what happened but the small details are always of interest too.</p>

        <p>"Ordinary Men is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of  RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever."</p>
