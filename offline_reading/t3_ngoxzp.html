    <strong>Just travelled from Michigan to TN, my thoughts</strong>
    <p><p>In Ann Arbor, MI (liberal college town) it is still pretty standard to wear a mask, i would say people don't even dare go in a store without one. As I drifted further south on my drive it was crazy to see how much it changed, by the time i was near the border of Ohio nobody really seemed to by caring about it in the gas stations and all that. </p>
<p>I was south of Dayton a little bit and I walked into a waffle house with my mask in my hand and there was a dude giving me a look like "you better not be putting on that mask bro", like he would have been pissed if I did. </p>
<p>Even Costco and Walmart in Kentucky/Tennessee that still have the mask requirement up, clearly no one including employees gave AF. I think pretty much everyone is done with the bullshit, 'recommending' only vaccinated people not wear a mask opened the flood gates in areas that are immune to horseshit. Maybe in Canada or California this croc of shit would fly, but just remember Reddit and the MSM does not speak to your average American. We're already seeing sold out stadiums in open states, those who want to get back to the real normal are, and those that want the new normal can stand in the shit and take a nice whiff for all I care</p></p>

        <p>yup. The building at work just got rid of their mask mandate placards. I stopped wearing one months ago but in the past week the moral panic has significantly subsided</p>

        <p>Michigan here, complete shit show. Even after mandates lift people are still wearing them and private businesses are demanding them as well. Whats worse are the people harassing others over going maskless, mob mentality is spiked in metro areas.</p>
