        <p>There is many more deaths than 12000. Sad to say, but we are talking 100,000+. I can only imagine the death rate worldwide from these injections, and we have not even hit the long term effects, or the 5th injection.</p>

<p>You have to be a bot.</p>
<p>You think over 12k VAERS reports are all false? People admitted to the hospital are lying...? Why?</p>
<p>Give me a motive.</p>
<p>Who is making money off unvaccinated people?</p>
<p>Jeez louise. You claim we're the conspiracy theorists...and yet you're the ones claiming hundreds of thousands of people are lying about adverse effects. Fuck, you probably think all of r/CovidVaccinated is lying as well.</p>

        <p>* If you're thinking about reading this thread don't bother. mozillameister has no idea how literally anything in the world works.</p>
<p>There are twice as many Covid-19 Vaccine VAERS reports for "BLOOD TEST", "BODY TEMPERATURE", "LABORATORY TEST", "HEART RATE", and "BLOOD GLUCOSE NORMAL".</p>
<p>What's with all these people getting the covid vaccine and having an adverse event of BLOOD TEST?</p>
<p>It's almost like VAERS is a dumping ground of the things that happened 30-120 days after vaccination and not a source for vaccine safety information which you literally have to acknowledge by pressing "I Accept" before being able to view VAERS data: "The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines."</p>
<p>But we're in a subreddit that values feelings over facts so im sure you'll have a really great response</p>

        <p>That has more to do with how bad the UI of the website is when submitting than anything else. It's really confusing and a horrible user experience. I walked my uncle in submitting his and even for me being fairly tech-savvy it was daunting.</p>
<p>Regardless, there's so few people who even know what VAERS is still or trust it. Submitting a report is definitely underreported. I know my uncle had no idea about it and submitted his in June for an adverse event that happened in January.</p>
<p>Even still....you think over 12k people who had family that was admitted to the hospital and actually died are lying? That's conspiracy theory level. Far worse to blame individual people than corporations imo.</p>

        <p>Most vaers reports are from providers not individuals.</p>
<p>I know it's hard to believe that people die literally every single day. Almost 10,000 people die every day. Half the population is vaccinated. 5,000 vaccinated people die every day from totally normal causes.</p>
<p>There are 160 million vaccinated people. 869.7 deaths per 100,000 population per year. Vaers reports are up to 120+ days after vaccination. 160,000,000 / 100,000 = 1600 * 869.7 * 120/365 = 457,000 deaths expected within 120 days of vaccination. You can modify it to be 1/365 and you'd find that you could expect 4,000 people to die the same day they get a covid vaccine just from normal deaths.</p>
<p>This is why vaers is useless, you have no denominator and math is hard.</p>

        <p>No.</p>
<p>It's literally a self-reporting system. It's fucking on their website!</p>
<p>"VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences."</p>
<p>It's literally a self-reporting system. The hospital was VEHEMENTLY against labeling it a vaccine-related event despite his own doctor who saved his life saying otherwise.</p>
<p>Your argument is ridiculous...by that logic you can apply that to every positive COVID case. Which would make this pandemic null. You can also apply that same logic to car accidents, plane crashes, cigarette smoke, asbestos and lead poisoning, etc. It's so non-specific and general it doesn't really argue anything other than 'ya people die'.</p>
<p>The difference is these are unnecessary deaths. Now you can argue vaccine deaths vs COVID deaths and you'd sadly have a much better argument as that's a more apples to apples comparison....but I gather that's not the direction you want to debate because you know it's not a winning argument.</p>
<p>It also is assuming several things that are extremely simplistic:</p>
<ol>
<li>The data is complete (its likely far greater...which you mentioned in even your own argument that it's up to 120 days lagged)</li>
<li>That vaccine-related issues are purely short-term and impossible long-term (we don't know one way or another).</li>
<li>It's been a full year (barely even 6 months since mass vaccination so your own math is overinflated).</li>
<li>Injuries are not important...only deaths are (good luck dating if you have Bells Palsy, or holding a job if paralyzed, or having a normal, long life with myocarditis and heart tissue damage). These are far greater numbers than deaths.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You also entirely ignored the fact that the argument stemmed from a guy claiming only 4/12000 are real. You went around the central argument to deliver a completely nonsensical point. That person is still a conspiracy theorist unless they can explain how over 99% of documented VAERS cases of death are fake, given that all VAERS submissions have to contain a hospitalization record and ID, and are scrubbed by the government if deemed inaccurate/false on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unless you're admitting that's likely true and just intentionally moving the goal post from 'safe' to 'mostly safe'. Which is an entirely different argument than 'oh you're full of shit there's no adverse reactions happening'.</p>

<p>Hey guy I know reading is not your strong suit and you are unable to accept basic facts about how the world works. So instead of bothering with your wall of garbage I'll just point out that you're a clown before I walk away.</p>
<p><a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following  Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccinations<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report to VAERS:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether it is or is not clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Vaccine administration errors</p>
<p>The vast majority of VAERS reports are from providers, not individuals. Full stop.</p>
<p>It is not a self-reporting system. It's an adverse event tracking system which allows self-reporting.</p>

        <p>...but providers are intentionally not reporting. So it becomes a self reporting system.</p>
<p>Just in my small circle I personally know several people who have adverse reactions to the vaccine:</p>
<p>- 2nd cousin, died of a heart attack 2 weeks post-vaccinations post-Moderna shot.</p>
<p>- 3rd cousin, who is suffering severe myocarditis with no history of heart issues pre vaccine.</p>
<p>- 3nd cousin, has kidney issues post vaccine.</p>
<p>- Best friends grandmother with severe neurological issues post vaccine (eg: constant seizures, cannot walk properly).</p>
<p>- Other best friends mother with permanent Bell's Palsy days post vaccine.</p>
<p>- Close friend with arm paralysis issues, brain fog weeks post vaccination.</p>
<p>- My uncle, who almost died 4 days post-Moderna shot due to multiple organ failure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Officially only my uncle's was documented because I did it for him. None of the others are, and the hospitals have ruled ALL of these as just coincidence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't have a ton of friends and my family is very small. The fact that I can know so many people personally who have adverse reactions seems statistically impossible if the vaccine was as safe as you're suggesting...</p>

        <p>VAERs is reports of anything that happened within 120 days of receiving a vaccination. If I overdose on cocaine 90 days after receiving the vaccine that's an Overdoes in VAERs.</p>
<p>VAERs is not a useful data source for establishing vaccine side effects. You have to literally agree that you understand that before it lets you search the database.</p>

        <p>If that's true, then what should we rely on for adverse effects reporting? Also wouldn't something related to cocaine overdose show up on the reports themselves? Like I said, it's a federal crime to lie on those reports. They also haven't specified what percentage they deem is "unrelated." No justification. No press conferences that address adverse effects themselves nor safety. Not to mention the censorship of those injured, and believe me I've witnessed plenty of that.</p>
<p>In any case, there's other numerous issues with the entire rollout of everything. Unable to archive CDC pages. Not allowed to look at the raw data itself. All the flip-flopping, if they're not sure on their data then why are they so keen on mandates?</p>

        <p>There is no If, it's literally true. </p>
<p>The mistake you're making is you're treating it as a database of things that happen because of the vaccine when its a database of things that happen 4 months after getting a vaccine.</p>
<p>How many heart attacks happen 4 months after buying a Ford pickup truck? Does it being a crime to say you had a heart attack four months after buying a pickup truck change that? Do Ford pickup trucks cause heart attacks?</p>

<p>Occam’s razor really is helpful too. I’ve used it since the pandemic started: the way the whole world would have to carry this all out together to make money and kill people and do population control or whatever by forcing vaccines (which lmao ok) is just so unfathomably difficult and absurd that clearly the simple answer is dumbasses like people on this sub are fear mongering <em>themselves.</em> </p>

        <p>You do realize that VAERS isn't reliable, right? It has a history of being misused by anti-vaxxers. And they can't just remove blatantly false reports without the poster's consent, either.</p>
<p>Besides, the Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccinations doesn't even include Covid yet, so any and all reactions following the Covid vaccines are being reported, which leads to a highly inflated number. Healthcare providers are required by law to submit reports to VAERS.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm sure they'd love to halt the global vaccination program. 
Again, not all reports are false. Not even close to a majority. But the fact remains, the numbers are greatly inflated.</p>

        <p>I have responded to a prior comment explaining that the Table of Reportable Adverse Events Following Vaccinations doesn't include Covid yet. Healthcare providers are required by law to report Adverse Events. But since the table doesn't include them yet, any and all reactions are being reported, which greatly inflates the numbers.</p>

<p>Don't twist my words. I didn't try to pivot to any other explanation.
The numbers being inflated due to minor reactions being reported and false reports being filed are two separate issues.</p>

        <p>No, I believe you are correct in your actions and the points you made were solid.</p>
<p>I firmly believe the best tool for us to use against this mass hysteria is raw facts, logic, and a bit of ridicule. The amount of ignorance we are facing is unfathomable. We are against the titans of the medical industry, the bought-out media and talking heads funded by billionaires around the world, and corrupted politicians passing archaic tyrannical mandates by the day, but we have many tools to draw from including history, morality, the greatest information database on the planet, and honestly, numbers. As much as they want to run their "polls" in our faces, the people standing up to this likely vastly outnumber the vocal minority pushing this degeneracy.</p>
<p>Keep strong and even if they are a shill, it's worth it to take time to respond because there are likely many many more readers/lurkers than we know, they may not have as deep of an understanding or awareness of the situation we're in, but we have to offer the opportunity for others to catch up.</p>

<p>your sources suck. I'm not sure you even read them. I'm pretty sure you just googled something like "don't believe vaers".</p>
<p>they are all about how reports can be misleading or data misconstrued. they specifically say "anti-vaxxers" are using data to mislead.</p>
<p>they are not in any way evidence that people knowingly file false reports as a conspiracy to defame a vaccine; or that false reports are filed in numbers great enough to show false trends in vaers data.</p>
<p>let me repeat: they do NOT say that "anti-vaxxers" are filing fake reports. they say that data is cherrypicked by anti-vaxxers and used to scare people.</p>
<p>big difference.</p>
<p>further, your factcheck alleges that 2500 reports of deaths were reviewed and ruled out, but there is no source for this. it is simply asserted.</p>
<p>i asked you to prove that "anti-vaxxers" are conspiring to knowingly submit false reports. you stated it like it was a well-known fact, after all, twice.</p>

<p>As opposed to you, who has been providing sources all throughout this discu- Oh, wait.</p>
<p>I have provided sources strongly suggesting that some false reports are being filed. Are you upset that no one is expending time and effort to count the amount of false reports because those cases are fairly rare? </p>
<p>I have also found contradictory information on whether or not VAERS can remove false reports without consent. Believe what you will. 
"The reports may contain information that is incomplete, <em>inaccurate</em>, coincidental, or <em>unverifiable</em>." That suggests that they are restricted in deleting false reports. 
In the past, cases like the Hulk report have shown that they can't remove false reports without consent. 
In a recent article, it was stated that they can indeed delete false reports if they choose to do so. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I have explained why the number of reports is inflated disregarding the probability of some of them being deliberately falsified.</p>

<p>I can't provide sources to prove a negative. </p>
<p>&rt;strongly suggesting that some false reports are being filed. </p>
<p>2 out of 400000. </p>
<p>Do you truly not understand how that isn't proof of what you're alleging? </p>
<p>There could be 2000 false reports, and you'd have to prove that they weren't filed as a prank, and that the people filing them all planned to discredit VAERS. Ideally you'd prove that the people filing these reports were working together in a conspiracy. But I'd take the first two conditions, provided you had more than a few examples.</p>
<p>Because you're saying that the reports are filed in such numbers as to overwhelm the system.</p>
<p>You're also going on a second prong and saying that, well, the data is only meant to show patterns. And it doesn't prove causality.</p>
<p>And you're right. But it's in such numbers that it's worth looking into.</p>
<p>But you don't believe it's worth looking into. You say "well no because the anti-vaxxers are filing fake reports, and because doctors are being over-scrupulous and reporting everything. ignore the reports because they're probably fake or wrong or unrelated and you can't prove they aren't."</p>
<p>so I'm asking you to prove the "fake reports" part, and you've provided one, and your source provided one more, and 2 reports out of 400000 is noise, not worth worrying about. </p>
<p>now you're saying "of course there are other fake reports in there", and maybe there are. there probably are. you're right.</p>
<p>But if they aren't in numbers big enough to skew the data, then they DO NOT MATTER.</p>
<p>And you also said anti-vaxxers are behind false reports, strongly implying that they're doing so as some sort of conspiracy to discredit the vaccine (because why else would they bother with that). </p>
<p>So you need to prove that anti-vaxxers are filing false reports, in numbers big enough to skew the data. And you haven't done that at all.</p>
<p>You just keep saying it must be so.</p>

<p>It is being looked into. Let's take the claim that the vaccines can lead to hearing loss as an example. I've seen that claim propagated by anti-vaxxers before because of some VAERS reports. The CDC looked into it and found that the number of cases involving hearing loss following a vaccine didn't exceed the number of cases of hearing loss in the general population. The vaccines have been found to carry extremely low risk for serious health complications and have been therefore deemed to be very safe. </p>
<p>False reports don't contribute to the amount of reports nearly enough to be considered a reason for the amount, absolutely.
What is undeniable however is the fact that the Table of Reportable Adverse Events doesn't include Covid yet. The healthcare providers aren't being "over-scrupulous", they are required by law to submit reports in case of adverse events. Since Adverse Events for Covid vaccinations aren't defined in the Table yet, a larger number of reports gets filed. I've repeated this too many times now. The Table of Reportable Adverse Events is on the official website, you can go and take a look for yourself. Or read some of the reports. A good portion of them really just boil down to basic reactions following a vaccination. I haven't read through all of them, of course. </p>
<p>&rt;But if they aren't in numbers big enough to skew the data, then they DO NOT MATTER.</p>
<p>They absolutely do matter. </p>
<p>&rt;So you need to prove that anti-vaxxers are filing false reports, in numbers big enough to skew the data. And you haven't done that at all.
You just keep saying it must be so.</p>
<p>I didn't suggest that. The greatly inflated number of reports and the false reports are two separate issues, I've made that very clear in my previous responses.</p>

What is undeniable however is the fact that the Table of Reportable Adverse Events doesn't include Covid yet. The healthcare providers aren't being "over-scrupulous", they are required by law to submit reports in case of adverse events. Since Adverse Events for Covid vaccinations aren't defined in the Table yet, a larger number of reports gets filed. I've repeated this too many times now. The Table of Reportable Adverse Events is on the official website, you can go and take a look for yourself. Or read some of the reports. A good portion of them really just boil down to basic reactions following a vaccination. I haven't read through all of them, of course. </p>
<p>&rt;But if they aren't in numbers big enough to skew the data, then they DO NOT MATTER.</p>
<p>They absolutely do matter. </p>
<p>&rt;So you need to prove that anti-vaxxers are filing false reports, in numbers big enough to skew the data. And you haven't done that at all.
You just keep saying it must be so.</p>
<p>I didn't suggest that. The greatly inflated number of reports and the false reports are two separate issues, I've made that very clear in my previous responses.</p>

        <p>I suppose I owe you an apology. I misread your initial comment and thought that by "misuse", you were alleging deliberate fraud on VAERS.</p>
<p>&rt;past cases misuse of and present issues with VAERS.</p>
<p>&rt;VAERS is fine, but assuming that the numbers on an easily and publicly accessible/modifiable website accurately reflect the reality is ridiculous. </p>
<p>however i see you meant "misuse" as-in "misinterpreting data".</p>
<p>you haven't proved that these reports are in big enough numbers to skew data. if 50 out of 2000 reports of tremors, for example, are fake then that's still 1950 reports that are not knowingly false.</p>
<p>the absolute numbers absolutely matter.</p>
<p>but you don't see it that way  so we're just going in circles now.</p>

        <p>Actually re this</p>
<p>&rt;The CDC looked into it and found that the number of cases involving hearing loss following a vaccine didn't exceed the number of cases of hearing loss in the general population.</p>
<p>that's a big deal to me as a patient.</p>
<p>i wouldn't care if my hearing loss was statistically expected. I'd want to know if it would have happened if I hadn't got the shot.</p>
<p>And if they aren't investigating <strong>that</strong>, if they're just using these statistical analyses to say "eh probably not", that's concerning.</p>
<p>i don't care if statistically 200 people my age lose their hearing every day. i care if the vaccine caused my hearing loss. i care if my hearing loss was avoidable.</p>
<p>same with far more serious issues like strokes and deaths. </p>
<p>i really hope they are doing more research.</p>

        <p>Sort of like how covid deaths are inflated due to how they record any death within 28 days of testing positive with covid? Regardless of that person being asymptomatic or not. Now imagine if we recorded deaths that had the flu or common cold the same way.</p>

        <p>I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about equating it to rape. Rape is non consensual sexual penetration. Vaccines don’t come close you crybaby fuck. Not even remotely close.</p>

        <p>So what part of mandates involve consent then?</p>
<p>If you have to force someone to take an experimental technology in order to participate in freedoms/activities once equally accessible, does that not constitute coercion? </p>
<p>Again, no one can provide prior data on humans nor long-term data. By definition they are bypassing fully informed consent as complete information is currently unknown.</p>

        <p>Can you read? This entire issue is over consent. What part of mandates involve consent?</p>
<p>Because it damn well does relate to rape. What differentiates sex from rape is consent. You said it yourself. Mandates are by definition involuntary. You have no choice in the matter. I feel sorry for whoever has to be in bed with you if you don't even recognize what consent itself entails.</p>

        <p>So sad to see that this is what political discourse has become. On one side you have people willing to sacrifice preventable disease intervention, fuck up child development for generations and generally make life terrible for absolutely everyone over a virus that is less deadly than the flu after vaccination and only warrants intervention for older generations even without the vaccine (I support vaccines and am vaccinated but don't support blanket mandatory vaccines).</p>
<p>On the other side you have brain dead conspiracy theorists. I'm not saying the vaccine doesn't have some concerning group think, but this is so dumb. 12k+ dead my ass. Get a grip.</p>
<p>I know I sound like an "enlightened centrist", but fuck man are there no nuanced opinions left at all?</p>

        <p>12k deaths doesn’t sound that unbelievable considering there have been around 150 million people vaccinated.  Myocarditis can lead to heart failure, and it has been a well documented side effect. Vaers is obviously not the best data pool, but it’s the only system we have to go by</p>

<p>So I show you direct quotes where people are in fact, discussing healthcare workers protesting, but that's not 'talk'? </p>

<p>Next time you lie make it a little harder to prove you're lying.</p>
<p>* there were no threats of violence in either, the only deleted comments are from anti-vaxers saying people who got the vaccine are morons. You're totally and completely full of it.</p>
