    <strong>I am worried about the future generation</strong>
    <p><p>The education system has produced a lot of kids that do not posses any form of critical thinking ability. What happens when the majority of the population would just obey blindly and follow the rules just for the sake of compliance? People easily fall for peer-pressure!</p>
<p>I am really worried about the future generation, worried about the future kids. If we allow this to happen, if people don't voice out and protest, then I fear that it would just gradually get worse over time. Huge respect to the French and Greeks for standing up on what is right! Resist brainwashing.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it's a sad state of affairs. They are coming for the kids. They want to digtally map infants brains for their first few years and create a standard archetype from the information and use it to condition future infants. There's some real dystopian shit knocking at our door under the guise of "well intentioned" technology and progress.</p>

        <p>True. I coach my nephews 10 year old baseball team and all they do is cry. First hitter of the year popped out and started crying. </p>
<p>One kid made us play with 8 midway through the game because he couldn’t do it, and he “sucks.” Kid was pretty good too. Lefty hitter. </p>
<p>This was supposed to be travel ball, or challenge ball, or whatever they call the above rec league ball. </p>
<p>Other coach is 26 and a 5th grade teacher and babies these kids soooo much. They get breathed on and he goes and checks them out. It’s ridiculous.</p>

        <p>This is my biggest fear. I think a lot of people on this sub are very blasé when it comes to some topics. And maybe many only have themselves to worry about so they can afford to be… I have two little boys. I was watching my older son yesterday and he is full of spark, he is so funny, excited about so many things, he has so many big dreams, he could be anything, do anything, I’m biased for sure but you know I see all these kids at his school and all of them are so… bright and vibrant and full of optimism and they all sparkle - in their own ways (I know this sounds corny pls bear with me) and I don’t want ANYTHING or ANYONE to break them and crush their little souls and turn them into uniform little clones who have no fight, no spark, no dreams - just compliance and no sense of individuality. </p>
<p>I do love humans. I look at the things we have accomplished throughout history. The art, the writing, the languages, music, building societies, science and medicine, our empathy and kindness and compassion and resilience. Even if we see so many right now who have fallen victim to the manipulation and fearmongering and have stopped fighting… and maybe never wanted to fight in the first place, I still feel for those people. And I don’t want this world to be what it looks like it will become - for our children. For all these kids who have so much to give and so much to teach us and who can accomplish so many things and keep humans HUMAN. </p>
<p>I am only 24. And I know many here say we haven’t had try freedom in a long time and I can see why and see some truth in that - but obviously my childhood was not like this - and I am so scared and so devastated that my children and children all around the world and those who have yet to be born are entering this… global society/dystopia that feels so foreign and unreal and difficult to comprehend. What will their futures be?! Stuck fighting this war… being forced to conform, losing their lives because idiots can’t see history repeating itself and the people in power are greedy control freak evil fucks who don’t care about the future generations especially those from the middle/working class let alone the ‘poor’ ones. </p>
<p>I’ve been feeling so anxious I am physically sick. I don’t want to make my oldest son scared but I feel like I have to make him aware… I don’t know how. I feel like I need to keep him close to me, I guess I am just waiting for the moment I will have to pull him out of school. Which I know I will probably have to do… I don’t know. </p>
<p>I don’t want anyone to break my son, or any of the children, it’s serious. We have to protect our children. At all costs. I didn’t want this for them. I would not have had them if I had known this was where we would be now in 2021. I feel guilty as a parent for bringing my kids into a world where they… well all the things I mentioned above. It’s the kids - we have to fight for the children. We have to. </p>
<p>And anyone of us who has kids needs to be keeping their ability to think for themselves, stand up for themselves, be aware, be awake and be resilient and not fall into any groupthink/complacency blah blah I’m not… wording things right! But you get my message.</p>
