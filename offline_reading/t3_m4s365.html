        <p>It was on the news for a VERY short time they piled bodies in cheap pine boxes then bulldozed dirt over them. This was on Hart Island. I'm sure there's more.</p>

        <p>Wrong...
America returns prisoners bodies to their family. Even in the event when there's no one to claim the body of a prisoner they don't bury them on MASS or are you assuming THOUSANDS of inmates very suddenly DIED in NY and no one decided to mention it. Or did they bury the massive amount of Covid deaths like how they tried to hide the numbers? Which is more likely?</p>

        <p>I commented this before, but thought I should leave it here too. </p>
<p>I think the most likely explanation is nursing homes were greedy and allowed a lot of their elderly residents to die from neglect, cheaper medication changes, and lack of care. I’m not convinced they all died of covid. Many nursing homes take their patients off their prescribed medications and give them cheaper ones to make a daily profit since Medicare/Medicaid/insurance pays them a flat fee per person per day. The lower they get their expenditures, the more money they make. Nursing homes do not care about their patients. Now they face no liability in the deaths due to the covid panacea which is a recipe for greed and disaster. Most nursing homes are run by large holding companies, conglomerates, and private equity firms; their business is profiteering off of death and dying. Compound that with families and friends unable to check in with their loved ones due to covid restrictions. I think the real scandal is that the PTB let these nursing home residents die, and counted their deaths as covid in April to lead to the mass hysteria and lockdowns nationwide over covid. Without those high death numbers, none of the panic and fear mongering was justified in the slightest. And if everyone knew the deaths and “mass graves” were nursing home patients who were just one missed or wrong medication dose, untreated infection, missed dialysis,  or one strong wind from blowing over anyway, there wouldn’t have been compliance with the agenda. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the mass graves were dead nursing home patients who didn’t have families to claim their bodies (not uncommon in New York City elderly and nursing home residents). Without the high death numbers in New York, none of the nationwide lockdowns were justified. </p>
<p>I was living in NYC when the pandemic hit, but left late April when things started to get violent but before the protests. I never heard excessive sirens, saw anyone cough or keel over, and I went outside and to the store everyday just for normalcy. The situation I saw was not akin to what my friends and relatives all over the country were calling and texting me and freaking out about. They all thought I was going to end up in a mass grave. Everyday the city sends bodies to potter’s field, and I think this Hart Island thing is an offshoot of that. There are unheard of numbers of elderly and disabled New Yorkers who pass on and have no families to claim them or care. It’s just the type of people who live in the city long term and the lifestyle.</p>

        <p>I think it's a culling due to how many nursing home patients are on Medicare etc using our tax miney...People have been BANNED from visiting family in nursing homes since the beginning of Covid yet the number of deaths IN nursing homes are insanely high. NY had over 15K Nursing Home Deaths they had to start burying people in mass graves and renting freezer trucks for body storage. Michigan is possibly even worse. Now for the part you DONT see.</p>
<p>Some Nursing homes even here in Texas have set up "Covid units" which are hallways that are taped off usually with big sheets of plastic. The nursing home residents IN the Covid units have to stay in the room without coming out. Employees wear masks and gowns etc. That may sound like a good thing but here's the flip.
Some Nursing Homes have a rule where if the Nursing Home patient LEAVES the nursing home for any reason they have to go to the Covid unit for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>For example... Let's say your Granny stays in a nursing home and has a fall and hit her head and they call an ambulance to take her to the ER to be checked out. The ER will give her a covid test. Turns out she's fine and shows negative for Covid. She then gets returned to the nursing home but is taken to the "Covid unit" automatically for 2 weeks. Well the thing is she's going to have a much higher possibility of catching Covid if she's ON the Covid unit and not sick. After 2 weeks the patient is then returned to the general population of the nursing home. So if the patient DID manage to get Covid while on the Covid unit they would then be freely spreading it like a hardcore flu through the rest of the nursing home. When I brought this up at a local nursing home that it seems it would promote spread I was told they had "lost" about a dozen residents but they were following the companies Covid orders. To me it seems more like a culling...</p>
<p>I've brought this up several times to people that it seems backwards but it's fallen of deaf ears. I recommended emptying out an ENTIRE nursing home and using it ONLY for Covid positive patients and when they're better they could be returned. Like what was supposed to happen with the USS Mercy in NY. </p>
<p>Who do you report these issues to? The currupted Health Department? The currupted CDC?</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea imagine that MOST nursing homes are following this outline in every county... In every state all over the US. Do you think it would cause an increase in deaths?</p>

        <p>I’m a nurse in Ohio and my mom was in a nursing home. She had cancer and was getting chemo and the nursing home literally told her that if she left to get her weekly cancer treatment she’d have to go
To the isolation unit where they kept covid patients and she would have to keep her door shut at all times. Because of that, she stopped her cancer treatments.</p>
<p>ETA:  I mentioned I’m a nurse because I have seen so many patients admitted at the hospital that have very OBVIOUSLY been neglected at the nursing home. With families being unable to visit, these nursing home residents are not being looked after.</p>

        <p>Yes. Apparently everyone missed this. After Cuomo shoved the sick into Nursing Homes there was funeral homes that had to rent freezer trucks to store the massive amount of dead bodies. I'm sure there's more mass graves they probably don't even put out the real numbers.</p>
<p>This one is on Hart Island.</p>

        <p>Yes, these are prisoners who have no family to claim their bodies.  This is how they've been dealt with literally forever and has nothing to do with covid.</p>

        <p>So y’all are blaming Cuomo for all covid deaths now? This is a very convenient boogie man I guess. </p>
<p>A lot of people died to covid, especially in nyc and Long Island, so much so that they needed mass graves, this wasn’t a secret, for a while 1000 people a day died in NY, not just died in nursing homes. Cuomo is not a good guy but you can’t blame him for everything, well you can but you’ll look like an idiot.</p>

        <p>Yea who could blame him for pushing Covid patients into nursing homes? even when the nursing homes said they weren't able to isolate the sick. Or the fact he refused to use the USS MERCY and field hospitals to isolate the sick because of politics. Or the fact that he KNEW it was causing massive deaths and he hid it. When Cuomo was questioned about it he literally said 
"what difference does it make?"
I mean while literally hiding all the deaths he's causing and STILL not changing the order the guy put out a book and was paraded as a hero by the currupt media. Ellen said she's now a "Cuomo-sexual" convenient for him since he also apparently loves sexual assault.</p>

        <p>But that’s ignoring the fact that you’re pinning “mass graves” on him. This is just not very objective, you just hate him. Politics caused a LOT of problems in the last year and I’m willing to bet you think it was mostly all democrats. I kinda think there’s no point in continuing this conversation, but I found alarming that anyone is even acting like the mass graves were a secret, I remember watching it on TV, I remember reading about it on Reddit, it was awful but it wasn’t all his fault. I’ll be plain, I want him out of office, I disagree with many many of his policies, but I don’t think he’s some sort of monster, he made mistakes. It didn’t help we had a toddler in the Whitehouse.</p>
