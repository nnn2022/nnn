        <p>King's immediate cause of death was sepsis, according to his death certificate obtained by PEOPLE.</p>
<p>The Larry King Live host also had two underlying conditions that led to sepsis, including acute hypoxic respiratory failure – meaning he did not have enough oxygen in his blood – and end stage renal disease also known as kidney failure.</p>

        <p>Its 6 in one hand a half dozen in the other. Covid doesn't kill, it's the respiratory failure and eventually multiple organ failure that does. Its splitting hairs. Like "the fall doesn't hit you, the ground does."</p>
<p>I'm sure COVID played a role, but the dude was over 80 and had a ton of preexisting conditions. Not gonna get broken up or demand we tank the entire economy because of it.</p>

        <p>Probably treated for. He had the virus; giving a vaccine for it would have been useless at that point, as his body was already trying to mount an immune response for it by that point. In many of these cases the inflammation from the immune response causes scarring in the lungs, which is what makes it hard to breathe and results in the hypoxia mentioned in the article.</p>

        <p>How do we know he had it?</p>
<p>I basically do not believe anything anymore. Not saying you are wrong at all, I accept what you are saying, it sounds strictly speaking more plausible than my theory they killed him with their deadly vaccine then claimed it was covid, which I am basing only on paranoia. -.-</p>
<p>Still I do not trust any news anymore, especially not when it involves celebrities and covid 19.. Looking at Tom Hanks and that orange-haired comedian lady when I say that. I do NOT believe them.</p>

        <p>Everyone eventually makes a choice about who and what they believe. I trust science, because I've read and learned and done enough of it to know that it works. I've also interacted with scientific community enough to know that it is viciously conservative, which is to say that if a scientist tries to make an argument that isn't bulletproof, the community will pick it apart and destroy it (and maybe the scientist, too). So I generally trust scientists. </p>
<p>It's my opinion that when you give up on trusting the experts, you may as well throw in with the flat earth society. I don't know a lot about neurosurgery, but if I get a brain tumor I'm going to trust a doctor to fix my brain. I don't know the first thing about timing belts, but I'll trust a mechanic when he tells me if mine isn't working. These people stake their reputations on their expertise, and the same is true with vaccine developers, epidemiologists, and public health officials.</p>

        <p>For any of this to be 'science' to me personally, I need to see data.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Primarily I want to see PCR test cycle counts for all the datasets used to lock us down. If they are averaging over say 28-32 at most cycles, it is proof this whole thing is a hoax. I have seen several memos from UK and USA INS and CDC demanding 40+ cycle PCR testing. This is known to produce only noise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>IMO the people locking us down are murderers and are responsible for all the needless suffering, suicides, and horror of A FULL ON LOCKDOWN OVER "trusting science even though everything seems fine outside O_O"</p>

        <p>That's a mountain of data to peruse, but I'm sure you can find it somewhere. Probably on pubmed. I hope you have the expertise to understand the language. I wonder if you also might be interested in looking over the data on internal collision force and injury incidence before buckling your seatbelt.</p>
<p>Your opinion is your own and you have every right to hold it. If you think the lockdowns and job losses and loneliness are insufferable, perhaps you should spread that message to the many people who refuse to wear masks or social distance. Those are the people who are keeping COVID-19 around. We would have forgotten about lockdowns by now if everyone had gotten on the same page.</p>
<p>Why am I here? I guess I'm here because I saw an opportunity to bring some sunlight into a place overrun by darkness.</p>
