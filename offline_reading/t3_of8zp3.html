    <strong>How quickly the narrative changes for the convenience of the elites...</strong>
    <p><p>Its absolutely frightening how the narrative changes so easily when the ones at the top are the ones to decide whether its convenient for them to do so... Really, whenever I think about it I get some sort of shivers and wonder if we're living in a movie.  </p>
<p>I used to be one of those people that followed the coronavirus situation in Wuhan before anyone of the western world cared about it. That wuhanflu quarantined sub... A little tiny community that was constantly repressed by reddit. That community began as a warning to the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic and trying to warn of a possible pandemic. I was all for vaccines, lockdowns, and such. Was even begging for lockdowns and was happy when it was finally declared a pandemic. Back then the coronavirus subreddit was MAJORLY against lockdowns, saying coronavirus wasnt a real issue, trying to quarantine and ban the wuhanflu subreddit because we were spreading misinformation and fearmongering... WHO saying that coronavirus is not a threat and not transmissible human-to human even went as far as to say there is nothing happening in Wuhan at all... HAHA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then when it became officially a pandemic later on suddenly the whole narrative changes out of nowhere because WHO decides thats the new narrative now. Whole of that subreddit just suddenly says the virus is so dangerous, we need to protect ourselves, constant lockdowns. Like a whole turn. People who used to bark they didnt believe in lockdowns suddenly loved them and began to fear for their lives... Suddenly WHO has "always" said that its human-to-human transmissible, that its dangerous. Suddenly whenever you bring up their bullshit you're being gaslit, told you said a lie, fact checked by some shady company that pulls its facts out of its ass when there is evidence. Suddenly the evidence of them twisting the narrative gets erased, censored, repressed, fact-checked by the same people who said corona is nothing to be afraid of and "just a flu bro". Suddenly the "just a flu bro" turns into "how dare you kill old people you evil scum!" Let's parrot what the big WHO said to us because whatever they say is the truth! Seriously?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And now they're trying to say that nonewnormal is spreading misinformation and all. They just shifted the blame completely. Like a vicious cycle. One day you're the one spreading misinformation, the next day you blame the other for spreading misinformation. What kind of fucking dystopian shit hole is this? People don't realize that there is no side winning here... Neither we're winning, neither are they. They're just dividing us and culling us so we are against each other. How difficult is it to see this truth? Why are so many apathetic and parroting whatever another says without critical thinking?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can't believe I used to be part of those who really did believe in this whole scam, parroted everything, and was even happy about this scam lockdown and vaccines. I started researching deeper, but now, everything's getting censored so those on the other side might have it more difficult to realize they're lied to on many levels. This really is a clowns world because they expect the "peasants" to be without a brain :D </p>
<p>This just really is upsetting. No one is a winner in this whole situation, we're all going to suffer the consequences while some on top are laughing at all of us being pitted against each other.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long rant and for the English, but this whole thing is just so aggravating....</p></p>

        <p>I remember arguing with someone that wearing a mask was pointless.  I said, "it can't hurt."  They said, "unless you're properly trained and have a fitted n95, it's pointless."</p>
<p>Two months later the same person scolded me for not wearing a mask and denied ever saying that masks were pointless.</p>

        <p>It's exactly that type of gaslighting and avoidance of taking responsibility that is frustrating. Remember when governments would sternly proclaim that masks are only for medical staff and shamed anyone else wearing one?</p>
