        <p>Love how they always bring up the immunocompromised.  They're the new grannies.  Since when is Covid the only disease they can catch, much less the most serious?  Question is, if these vaccines are safe and effective, then why can't they receive one?  The flu shot is stongly recommended for the immunocompromised every year.</p>

<p>And the laws wouldn't be necessary if it wasn't for shitbrains like yourself. We wouldn't have gotten rid of measles or smallpox or a lot of other diseases if people who get Ds in science were allowed to leave their kids unvaccinated and still send them to public schools.</p>

<p>Measles only kills about 2 or 3 people per 1,000. Covid is much worse than measles. <a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/blankchildrens/pedsgeekmd-article.aspx?id=babec96f-cf1e-4af1-b421-adfcb36ca561">Source</a></p>

<p>The measles vaccine is about exactly as effective as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were in the initial trials that lead to FDA emergency use approval. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html">Source</a></p>

<p>I'm not going to bother calling bullshit on your degree because it's immaterial to the subject. I'm generalizing and the generality holds true. I will say I'd be a bit surprised to hear a stem graduate with honors would say something like measles is worse than Covid without taking a quick second to Google it and make sure it's true.

        <p>I’ve just had time to review your sources.  Your own source proves you wrong on your second point.</p>
<p>“People who receive MMR vaccination according to the U.S. vaccination schedule are usually considered protected for life against measles and rubella”</p>
<p>Covid shot does not do this.</p>
<p>Don’t think I did not notice that you specifically countered measles in my argument and not small pox.  Although, I will concede you “got me” in that covid is worse than measles in some ways, however I did not specifically mention the fatality rate.  </p>
<p>1 out of every 5 people diagnosed with measles require hospitalization, for instance.  While covid is less than 1 in 10 for people with no underlying conditions.</p>
<p>This brings me to my next point that measles affects primarily healthy children.  Whereas disastrous effects of covid is typically associated with old, unhealthy people.</p>

        <p>Measles vaccines work for life, and the Covid ones don't. But my point was that they were both tested at about 95% effective in the initial trials. </p>
<p>And Measles hospitalizes more people per 100 infections, but Covid is far more deadly. I'd rather see a kid go to the hospital for a couple days and get sent home with a lollipop than see a 50 year old diabetic father of three die, but that's just me.</p>
<p>One common thing I've noticed with Covid deniers, is you guys seem to just not give a fuck about old people. </p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how many of you change your tune on that in your late 50s.</p>

        <p>I actually quite enjoy old people.  </p>
<p>But if we are playing that game I have to bring up that a lot of the same people that use “boomer” as a pejorative, couldn’t wait for boomers to die out so they could have their utopia, and even went as far as to calling the virus the “boomer remover” in the beginning are now saying, as you mentioned, that others don’t give a fuck about old people.</p>
<p>But I digress.  The main point of emphasis is that there is no comparison between measles or SMALL POX vaccines to the covid shot.  One protects you for life and the other barely protects you at all, and you can still pass it on to others, and then it only lasts 6 months or so.  To call this a vaccine is really stretching the definition of the word.</p>

        <p>We're literally going in circles now.</p>
<p>Measles kills about 2.5/1000
Vaccine is 95% effective. Doesn't prevent infection or spreading.</p>
<p>Covid kills more like 10/1,000. 
Vaccine is about 95% effective and doesn't prevent infection or spreading. </p>
<p>So they're the same thing, except Covid is a much deadlier disease, more contagious, and the vaccines need a yearly booster.</p>
<p>You get a measles vaccine when you're a baby, and you have to prove it before they'll let you into most schools or before you travel. But no one cries about their freedomZ over the measles vaccine - basically just because it's not politicized the same way covid has been.</p>
<p>Small pox has a 30 percent fatality rate, so I have a feeling you morons would be lined up for the vax if smallpox was new like Covid is. Thank god there was no Reddit when we developed the smallpox vaccine, or it would probably still be around.</p>

        <p>“And the vaccines require a yearly booster”. </p>
<p>So, not going to go into the weeds here, but basically it’s a flu shot?  Yet we never shamed people about not taking that. </p>
<p>And yes it has been politicized, but it takes two to tango.  When trump was in office we have multiple videos and screen shots of liberal ideologists/ leaders such as BIDEN and HARRIS saying they wouldn’t take it/being skeptical.  A logical position.  But as soon as they take office now they say everyone should definitely take it.</p>
<p>And somehow it’s the conservatives fault that it’s being politicized?  You’ve got to be kidding me dude.  Wake up.</p>

        <p>Let's just hope we can chalk it up to big mouths exaggerating on the internet. If I heard this talk in my neighbourhood I might get violent in response.</p>
<p>It's a natural reaction when someone says they'd like to see you beaten, arrested, imprisoned or worse because they deem you 'infected' and 'dangerous to others' without any proof or reasoning to believe it, other than fear and suspicion.</p>
<p>That makes them truly dangerous to a free and civil society.</p>

        <p>There's just too many accusations, false claims and such in their speech to even address, nor would they care about any rebuttal you would provide :/</p>
<p>I almost don't want to bother conversing with them anymore and simply start swinging my fists instead.<br>
Sure, it's the weak man's way out, or "I no longer have an argument" way out but pretty much it is becoming 'What we have here is a failure to communicate - some people you cannot reach'. All I want to do now is neutralize them one by one so they can't move this agenda forward that may put a lot of people's lives in danger.</p>
<p>As they get more volatile in their accusations and manner, we may have to defend ourselves from what they propose to do to otherwise free and perfectly healthy Citizens.</p>

        <p>Most other nations also require voter ID and ban third-trimester abortions. I wonder if they want to copycat that too, or is it just vaccine passports?</p>
