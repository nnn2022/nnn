    <strong>Notice How When You Walk Outside Without a Mask on People Refuse to Look at You</strong>
    <p><p>It’s like looking at the non-maskless makes you get the virus or something. Also sometimes they look at you and adjust their mask subconsciously reminding you to put yours on, when I know damn well I don’t have mine on. </p>
<p>Seeing someone’s face and nose shouldn’t make you uncomfortable. Seeing people doing normal things shouldn’t make you uncomfortable. </p>
<p>I’m super close to like randomly taking a 13 hour drive to Atlanta. (Maskless and normal functioning people.) I was going to save my money for a new car but how things are currently would a new car be worth it?</p></p>

        <p>Where I am I find the opposite actually. I’ve never had more people say “good morning” to me on my weekend walks as I do now. It’s almost like people are just desperate to see a human face. I’m in northern England though so we’re usually a pretty friendly bunch at the best of times but everyone seems just genuinely happy to be outside with other functioning humans. It’s usually the people masked up outside that get funny looks. Although if you’re in a shop, forget it. The British like rules, and by god people follow them to the letter. Maskless in a shop? Better start running!</p>

        <p>Funny thing is here in the city I live The Netherlands nobody wears mask outside we only put it on to go to the store and I did a test.</p>
<p>I went to store first couple of times with a mask on but I left my nose open to breathe and people that didn't cover their nose started to cover their nose but nobody is complaining about it and some people start smiling because they subconscious know I don't really like this.</p>
<p>After a while I went to the same stores without a mask and now it's okay if I go to stores without the mask after I went there awhile with a mask on not covering my nose, no complaints they just let me in</p>
<p>And if people saw me going to stores without a mask some people started following to do that too.</p>
<p>But they only do that when somebody else do that.</p>

        <p>Same story here and I'm in one of the worst states in the US, I've gotten this entire time in a couple stores I'm still allowed into 2 reportings of me that were just dropped cause I used this magical word everyone has forgotten to how to use in response to people dangerously overstepping their bounds with what they're allowed to dictate about our bodies and that was that. Sometimes I get a angry last word from them but they just leave me be. Lead by example and others will follow. Nothing good happens if everyone just complains. Many people don't really believe all this they just have no role models anymore besides mainstream media and since the rights violation situation has gotten this bad without a word from them against it I'm guessing it's on purpose.</p>

        <p>Crossing the street or walking in the street or ostentatiously walking six or ten feet onto a lawn to wait for someone else to pass are very common here.</p>
<p>I've observed a few funny things, like someone slipping on ice in the street when trying to avoid passing someone on the sidewalk (she didn't hurt herself or anything).</p>
<p>I was playing in the snow with my kids in the front a few weeks ago, evidently too close to the sidewalk for one woman who walked in the street and told me not to "breathe on her." I advised her to stay home, which she probably should for her own mental health.</p>

        <p>Everyone in this post talks about how they get greeted, everyone adores them, and claps for them when they are out unmasked. And sure, very great for you... But my experience is the opposite. Being out unmasked gets me treated like a leper. People do look away usually, however when they do look at me, it's to glare at me or to confront me. I was already treated like leper before this, and have had complete strangers, even as an adult, treat me like garbage. But things have worsened tenfold since March 2020, and if I didn't believe so strongly in opposing the new normal, I would just put the mask on all the time like everyone else does, and shut my yaphole. Actually, I'm already on the brink of doing just that, because I am sick and tired of being treated worse than ever, and of the futility of fighting this. Even my supposed "allies" in this sub love to snipe and put me down, which makes me question why I am fighting on the side of a bunch of assholes anyhow.</p>

        <p>A car would absolutely be worth it! Go drive around to rural areas, or areas that aren’tlocked down. </p>
<p>I used to work <em>all</em> the time out of town—but since my businesses are closed (due to covid) I feel like the one thing that’s good is that I finally have time to travel around my state, hike, and visit beautiful areas, National parks, etc. </p>
<p>Rural areas are my favorite right now. The smaller towns are so much more “normal” then the bigger cities around me.</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK. Where locally isn't important, only that so few people wear a face covering that I could walk for hrs and perhaps see less than a handful of doomers. We don't mask up over here. People are out and about doing their own thing like any other period. A few people do apply a face coverings before entering a store, as per store requirements, and then remove said covering upon exiting. Those who don't bother with the covering aren't challenged, not that I've ever witnessed, as retail have had enough of this already. But by and large most people seem to have realised this isn't about a virus.</p>
