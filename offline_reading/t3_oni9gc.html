    <strong>I just don't understand</strong>
    <p><p>Someone said the following in another sub, and I quote:</p>
<p>&rt; We need forced vaccinations at this point. These assholes are stopping us from returning to normal. </p>
<p>This comment received numerous upvotes.</p>
<p>Can someone help me understand the mentality behind this?</p>
<p>I oppose vaccine mandates (never mind physical coercion) because I support human rights. That means the rights of people who say such asinine things. I support their right to bodily autonomy as much as I support my own.</p>
<p>Do they think that allowing governments and employers to require a particular medical treatment is fine because it's a treatment they want? <em>Has it ever occurred to them to wonder if it might someday be a treatment they don't want?</em></p>
<p>Do they actually believe that the unvaccinated are a threat to the vaccinated? Virtually nobody qualifies for a medical exemption under the extraordinarily strict guidelines of the CDC which recommends this non-approved vaccine even for pregnant women against the advice of other health organizations and against common sense given the lack of safety studies in pregnancy. And they are pushing to approve the vaccine for younger and younger children who aren't even at risk from covid. This being the case, literally everybody who is afraid of covid can get their own vaccine. Nobody has to forego it for medical reasons. Nobody.</p>
<p>Which means that nobody is dependent on others taking it.</p>
<p><em>Which means, let us make our own decisions.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and it's not the unvaccinated stopping you from returning to normal. It's the authoritarian authorities.</p></p>

        <p>The short answer to your first question is "yes". They do fear the unvaccinated because they are told to. Now they are being told that we that hadn't gotten the Trump juice are why there is variants that their jabs don't protect them from because they are told to. </p>
<p>Far too few have the sense to understand that the Trump juice is snake oil &amp; was never even claimed to prevent infection or spread to begin with.</p>

        <p>I can help you. Everyone in this sub will disagree with all the claims in this answer but I'm just giving you the reasoning that leads to this comment. You can only get an honnest answers from someone who disagree with this sub's message.</p>
<p>I don't know about the U.S. but in my country several vaccin are already mandatory. It's not something new and I'm not scared that the government try to force medicine I disagree with into my body because I don't see the state as an evil entity. It does have this power anyway so using it for Covid doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>The unvaccinated are a big vector of transmission and mutation of the virus. Plus the vaccine is not 100% effective. It's not something new that you need a certain percentage of the population vaccinated for the vaccine to be fully effective, that's why there are mandatory vaccines in the first place.</p>
<p>I believe that lockdown are a reasonable measure against the virus but I don't like it obviously. I believe that the fastest way to return to normal is having enough people vaccinated.</p>
<p>If you believe that the vaccine is safe and effective then you can easily see the unvaccinated people as irresponsible and not reasonable. At one point you just say fuck it, let's force them to take it if they don't understand shit.</p>
<p>If you agree that the government is not evil, that the vaccine is safe and effective and that people not taking the vaccine are making everyone else more miserable you come to the conclusion that forcing everyone to take it would be good thing.</p>

<p>I disagree with this statement.</p>
<p>There are many places that do not have mandatory vaccination, not for schoolchildren, not for anyone else. And you know what? They're doing just fine. Enough people get the vaccines voluntarily that they don't have to worry about outbreaks or about mandates.</p>
<p>If the vaccine is truly worthwhile then people will want it without being forced. If it's not good enough to sell itself, it's not good enough.</p>

        <p>Right, but the problem is why do they not want the vaccine? If it's because it isn't good enough fine but in my opinion (and you probably disagree) it's because there is too much disinformation on it.</p>
<p>If you're confident that the vaccine is safe but you can't convince people of it because they believe any stupid thing they read on Facebook that lies to them about the subject what do you do? This is when making it mandatory becomes the only solution.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day you can't force a huge part of the population to do something they think is bad for them without creating a societal malaise. We can't continue to move forward if nobody can agree on basic facts or worse on what constitute a reliable source of information. I have no difficulty understanding antivax and where they come from because the problem is not that they are not logical, it's just that they work with different informations.</p>
<p>Try searching sometimes what studies were conducted on the vaccine and their results or why hydrochloroquine is not considered a cure for Covid starting with a neutral perspective. Or even better try to construct the case FOR the side you disagree with by finding the best information that support their point of view. I guarantee you will learn something new.</p>

<p>Nobody owes you or anybody else an explanation of why they don't want something put inside their body. The only necessary reason is "I don't want it."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If you're confident that the vaccine is safe but you can't convince people of it because they believe any stupid thing they read on Facebook that lies to them about the subject what do you do? This is when making it mandatory becomes the only solution.</p>
<p>And yet this isn't a problem with all the conventional and fully-approved vaccines in the other countries I mentioned, or in states of the U.S. that allow non-religious and non-medical exemptions. In all of those places most people still choose to get the standard vaccines such as measles and polio, even though they aren't being stripped of the right to informed consent as you are so eager to do and falsely deem necessary.</p>
<p>I would add that there would be a lot less of what you call "disinformation" which is really just protest and critique if vaccines were not pushed so heavily on people who don't want them. Here's a little hint about human nature: people don't like to have things forced on them, and you'll encounter a lot less opposition when you aren't pushy.</p>

<p>Why? There are already a ton of things we are forced to do in every country, what makes it so special? If we could prove that the vaccine is 100% effective and safe, is your principle worth the human lives it would cost? You are not allowed to put certain drugs in your body, wouldn't the same logic imply that the state should never tell someone that they can't put something in their body? Not saying your principle is absurd but I don't think that there is a correct response here.</p>
<p>&rt;And yet this isn't a problem with all the conventional and fully-approved vaccines in the other countries I mentioned</p>
<p>Antivax sentiment is on the rise in the lot of countries and that was the case way before the Covid pandemic. I think we see all this opposition to the vaccine simply because everything related to Covid gets hugely politicized since there is a huge spotlight on it.</p>
<p>&rt;I would add that there would be a lot less of what you call <br>
"disinformation" which is really just protest and critique if vaccines <br>

<p>Do you have any actual data on this? Of course nobody really likes having something forced on them but I would never take for granted that more people would get vaccinated if there was no restriction on people not taking the shot. In France a lot more people got vaccinated after they announced that unvaccinated people will be ban from entering certain public spaces. It's possible that you are right but you probably have a bias if you think that you don't need any real study to know that.</p>

<p>Because it's your goddamn BODY, Karen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If we could prove that the vaccine is 100% effective and safe, is your principle worth the human lives it would cost? </p>
<p>You can't, because it's neither 100% effective nor 100% safe. But even if it were, it still wouldn't be right to violate anyone's bodily autonomy. Besides, if it were 100% effective and safe then everyone who wants it can get it and be protected by it so your point is moot.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You are not allowed to put certain drugs in your body</p>
<p>I never said I agree with that, but it's not the same principle at all. There's a difference between positive and negative rights. Look it up.</p>
<p>I sure hope you don't go around raping people since you seem to think you have the right to decide what goes into their bodies.</p>

<p>&rt;Antivax sentiment is on the rise in the lot of countries and that was the case way before the Covid pandemic. </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing some good news!</p>

<p>&rt;I would never take for granted that more people would get vaccinated if there was no restriction on people not taking the shot</p>
<p>That's not what I said. Now you are just twisting my words. What I said was people wouldn't speak in opposition to it as much. Isn't that what you're so afraid of? You're scared some soccer mom on Facebook is going to say "vaccines bad" and then other people will fall in line to believe it and forego their own shots.</p>
