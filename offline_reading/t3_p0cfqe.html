    <strong>Either i get vaxed or become homeless</strong>
    <p><p>So my parents told me to stop being stubborn and get vax'd like everyone else in the family. They are not taking me on vacation in a month if i dont get my two shots of moderna. And they said that if i miss the vacation i may as well pack my bags. Im 19 so they legally can do that. But I dont have any choice now, they already took away my car and credit cards. </p>
<p>So they know the mounting pressure is on. I tried reaching out to a few friends but they are all convinced its easier to go with the flow. And their parents like mine already made them vax and wont allow me to stay if i am not also 'protected'. This sucks, i held out as long as i could.</p></p>

        <p>Your infection risk profile is low.</p>
<p>Your risk profile for suffering an adverse reaction to the jab is higher than your parents risk profile.</p>
<p>They are asking you to take a bigger risk than they took for themselves.</p>
<p>Jabbed people still transmit the virus.</p>
<p>Personally, I think its unreasonable they should apply coercion - therefore I'd move out.</p>

        <p>No - and it would be sad to break up family connections over someone's individual choices. Families need to support each other, regardless of choices.</p>
<p>At the end of the day - you'll make your decision. </p>
<p>I learned that standing up for myself was more important to me than doing something I don't believe in, for the purpose of making someone else happy. Unhappy people are not unhappy with you, they're unhappy with themselves.</p>

        <p>You wanted us to say “you did your best, you have our blessing to give in and get coerced into injections”?</p>
<p>Not me. I will die on this hill. Never give in. It’s so funny to me that a 19 year old isn’t even considered an adult. </p>
<p>You wouldn’t be the first person to get kicked out at 19. With parents like yours it would be a blessing. </p>
<p>You can adjust and adapt your life but you can never uninject yourself. Feels like you wanted to come here and have us tell you that it’s OK to give in and nobody else can possibly have it as hard as you? </p>
<p>Plenty of people are going through the same. Never give in. Stay sane.</p>

<p>Damn humans got so pathetic. And here you are saying it’s understandable. If you give in you are working directly against our interests. I have no sympathy for that. </p>
<p>Many people have divorced, lost their jobs and been arrested standing up for the right thing. OP’s situation is no different. All I’m seeing is the consequences of a country treading their young adults like children until a ridiculously old age. I worked and provided for myself from 18. This would have never even affected me.</p>

<p>Not everyone can magically get a job. They say there's "millions of jobs available" right now, but many of them are now implementing vaccine mandates, for instance. What's going to happen if OP gets a job, and then his job also requires the vaxx (and you're a fool if you insist this won't happen). It's becoming harder and harder to resist this without risk. Nothing like this has ever happened before in human history (medical and social tyranny on a global scale), so it's stupid to act like "damn humans got so pathetic" and going around calling people names for having difficulties right now.</p>

<p>Am I annoyed because someone is having difficulties? Or am I annoyed because they are ignoring the fact that everyone is going through something similar and instead of looking for support they are looking for people to make them feel better about giving in?</p>
<p>I will not do that. Many people have lost their job, been arrested, got divorced. I am here to support people who are on our side, not make pathetic people feel better about giving in. They are actively against us.</p>
<p>This is going to get way worse before it gets better. If we are not willing to suffer at all then we will lose.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you have already given in. Now I get why you are commenting like this. Projection.</p>
<p>It’s going to take years and I will have to suffer but by speaking your truth to everyone you meet and never giving in we will win eventually.</p>

        <p>Hard times create strong men. So Become strong. </p>
<p>Find someone who’ll hire you unvaxxed. Or try to hitch a ride or two to texas or florida (mask up if it’ll make it easier to get a ride) and try to look for work there. Never look back…. This world is getting fucking shit on by you know who. Start working. Save money, get a gun, ammo, bugout bag, knives, learn survival shit. Most importantly try to always have work and live below your means so you can have money. Try to counter inflation after you save 5k ish. Gold or silver bars, just a little, or something else. Try to find a group of people in the same situation as you. Sorry your family sucks. </p>

        <p>Have you tried reaching out to temp agencies? There are a lot of decent paying jobs available through those places. Many of those jobs also offer flexibility with existing schedules (college, family, etc).</p>
<p>Are there any rooms for rent in your area? It's not as fun as having your own place, but it's usually a lot cheaper than renting an apt solo. </p>
<p>In the end, the choice is yours. There are positives and negatives no matter which decision you make.</p>

        <p>Since no one’s actually willing to give you non-dickheaded advice here’s my two cents:</p>
<p>0) Accept that even in 3 years time you might not land that “lucrative” career. Nothing is a guarantee. Keep moving towards it with that in mind.</p>
<p>1) Buy yourself time. Keep making appts every two weeks then when they ask tell them there was a mistake, you missed it because of school, etc. It won’t work forever but it’ll give you time to get some $</p>
<p>2)When they get to their breaking point, find a low cost rental you can squat at from week to week/month to month. If you’re in FL you can find something for at least $60/night (airBnB is good for this) which is still a lot but at least you’re not homeless</p>
<p>Supplement extra income doing Uber Eats or some shit until your parents finally cave because they don’t want their son to actually be homeless. The will of parents can often be easily broken if you call their bluffs.</p>

        <p>Unless they’re like my parents and have a general “I don’t give a fuck about you or care after 18” mindset. I have parents that basically stopped caring about me after 18, despite me being disabled and unable to actually change my situation of unemployment in a small town that has few jobs that I can do. They made me finish a useless degree (history) even after I wanted to quit half way through. The last ten years have been rough. I didn’t mean to make this about me but I wanted to add my experience.</p>
<p>I think if a kid isn’t able to meet certain standards based on things they can’t control like disability, they shouldn’t be held to expectation of someone without those limits. Mom and Dad didn’t have normal childhoods. Dad’s father died when he was a kid and he had basically to grow up really fast around 11. My mother’s mother was apparently an alcoholic. They just didn’t develop emotional skills or things that would make them empathetic. That’s my take.</p>

        <p>I know i will miss my vacation at Disney but at least I have a good excuse to not get it.  I don't know how long that sort of excuse will fly but I think that after the family vacation they will be more leanient, I don't really think they would kick me out once things cool down. Maybe I can get one of my buddies to create a nice photoshop card of vaxination. </p>
<p>You know what, I feel much more calm now. so many other replies were about me moving out without even thinking about my situation, honestly, thank you.</p>

        <p>Makes sense especially since they’re going on vacation. They probably just wanna make sure you don’t miss out. But I’m sure after they’ll have a change of heart. </p>
<p>If your buddy does, don’t forget to wear your band-aid around the house and get a little sick for the first few days. Gotta look convincing!</p>

        <p>Definitely give consideration to the long term air Bnb rentals, they can be pretty cheap. A few years back I was renting out a room in my house for about $40/day. </p>
<p>Other options if you have a friend or some roommate situation you can slide in.</p>
<p>In addition to the delay tactics, try to make an appt with a doctor and see if you can get them to recommend you NOT getting it.  It’ll be hard for them to say their word is better than advice you received from YOUR doctor.</p>
<p>If / when they’re still being psycho assholes, try to let them know as calmly as possible that this is a bad precedent they’re setting and it’s not going to bode well for our future relationship. You are not respecting me or my decisions about my health and that’s unacceptable. </p>
<p>You WILL have complete and total independence eventually (sooner than you probably realize) and this is one of the first major choices you are making in your journey. This is one of your parents last chances to really ‘assert their authority’ on you, but you need to let them know you are looking to them for GUIDANCE, not to make decisions for you.</p>
<p>And btw, fuck Disney.</p>

<p>Heart, lung and spinal cells do NOT recover. Those who suffer badly from covid, which wouldn't be you, find it's a blood-clotting disease. It's the little spike protein debris that causes thousands of little tiny blood clots, fucking up your heart, lungs etc.</p>
<p>Guess what the vaccines do?</p>
<p>At your age your at far greater risk from the vaccine than the virus. Still, your parents have agreed to cover all your medical costs, wipe your ass if you're paralyzed etc? They'll take full responsibility for anything bad that happens, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, you're putting your future health in jeopardy by taking the vaxx. This crap doesn't even fully protect you from Delta; latest from Israel was something like 38% 'efficacy' after two jabs. You can still get infected and spread the virus. Government will soon be pushing for booster shots; an endless future of booster shots awaits if you go down this path. The "vaccine" is a complete joke. </p>
<p>At 19 yrs old you're still very young; don't risk your health with a faulty experimental treatment. Being homeless at 19 is a very temporary setback. However, injecting yourself with experimental drugs is permanent, one you can never undo. Think long term, not just the here-and-now. I hope you make a wise decision, but we all must decide on our own and live with the consequence.</p>

<p>The sadness of it all is that the parent, im sure, are convinced that they are in the right. They took the vaccine to save themselves and protect others. Now ythey probably want their son to be responsible... and it is probably hard for them to trace the line in the sand. </p>
<p>That is the problem here. we have to recognize that most of the ultravaxxer a in good faith, doing what any good citizen would do which is to follow the authority recomendations. It would be all well and good if the faith of the autoriy was as good as it's citizen...</p>

        <p>Bro I get it. I have a metabolic disorder that because of it I had to get vaccinated in case it really wrecks me. I also live with my parents and unemployed from the same metabolic disorder that affects muscle strength and balance. I live in a small town with few jobs that are suitable for me. My parents are obsessed with this virus like it’s NHL playoffs.</p>
<p>I see your trying to make hard choices. I can see it from both sides. On one hand you’re stuck there but yet you still could get out of it by simply leaving. I couldn’t leave my situation based on my circumstance but you could. If they really did take your credit card and car then that’s fucked.  I honestly would cut all contact with them for it. You really don’t need people who are like that in your life.</p>

        <p>Is it possible to delay college?<br>
I'm not american so I dont know if this works, delay college by a few years, move out and join the military for a few years so you get to save a bit (not sure if US military gives you food and shelter initially)<br>
And then resume college when you've saved up enough?</p>

        <p>Your parents are deranged: the car they gave you is FAR more likely to kill you than C19. It's sad to say, but it looks like you need to cancel the trip, find a new job and move out if you want to maintain bodily autonomy. I am really sorry that your parents are like this!</p>
